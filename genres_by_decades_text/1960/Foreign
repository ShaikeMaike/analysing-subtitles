I don't feel very good
Nothing's looking as it should
Dad, Mom, Grandma, Grandpa don't know who they brought into the world
I want to be someone
Do what no one else has done
So our sweet name will be remembered by posterity
I like my own sweet name
I like the touch of fame
Sweden can be really good
Fix things up as they all should
Germans, Russians, Americans
We'll set them a good example
Of social democracy
Of a mixed economy
So Sweden's sweet name will be remembered by posterity
Reform the world
Just from little Sweden
So we get well-known,you see
For our fine democracy
We'll have the touch of fame
Buy our film!! Buy it!!
The only film in two versions.
One yellow, one blue.
Buy the yellow, buy the blue.
Buy our film, 'cause there are two.
The same picture, yet different.

- The yellow film.
- Big and small!!
- The blue film.
This is the blue version.
The blue version...
Madeleine, four, take three.
- What school did you graduate from?
- The Sigtuna private school.
- In the crown prince's class?
- No.
- You seem big-headed. Are you?
- No.
- The French Lyceum.
- For how long?
All my life, since I was seven.
- The French Lyceum.
- And after that?
Language studies in Switzerland.
I often go abroad, to France.
- You like France, do you?
- I love France.
- What do you do?
- I study French at the university here.
Look at me.
Now look into the camera.
BEWARE OF MERITOCRACY
Do you happen to know who the crown prince's girlfriend is?
''Maj Hultén, Teacher, Age 34''
Many women find it difficult to reach a climax in ordinary coitus.
The position doesn't matter.
On top, on the side, sitting or whatever.
Just about any position is possible - well, perhaps not while running.
But there are many ways, just like for any other physical activity.
Many people think it's due to psychological reasons that younger women don't reach a climax.
Subconscious or even somewhat conscious conflicts cause them to forbid themselves to reach a climax.
- That it's not ''nice.''
- Exactly.
- That it's not ''nice.''
- That's what I think.
Most girls think like that.
Oh, please!!!
You know how you'll look naked if you just eat and eat.

Marie,you had a question?
If homosexual women have sex, is that also mutual onanism?
Yes, the word onanism, masturbation, means self-satisfaction.
It's a bit difficult to call something
''mutual self-satisfaction.''
But it does describe what it is.
They caress each other's sex organs so they both reach a climax.
Before, I hardly dared touch a girl in case she'd think I was a lesbian.
The word lesbian is clear, then?
It means homosexual woman.
- I've never felt that, but-
- Never?
Do you touch people a lot?
Have you been to a girls'boarding school where it's even more sensitive about homosexuality?
It's not the same at this school.
We go out, we meet boys.
It's not the same.
But take girls at boarding schools in Switzerland, with nuns chaperoning them.
- How much, then?
- Five thousand crowns.
Damn good it isn't ten!
We'll have to write an IOU.
- Cheapskate.
- And you'll have to pay it off.
- Cheapskate.
Hey, can we get going?
Damn, he can't hear.
We can't wait for Ahlstedt.
Where the hell is he?

I AM CURIOUS BLUE
Hell's bells!
It's embarrassing! You're making a film on the Swedish class-system, but you buy a black-market apartment!
- Look who's talking!
You just want it good for yourself!.
- Honey.
Isn't my place okay, then?
- Yes, but I want my own place.
Why?
- Hi. Am I late?
- Yes, we said ten to.
- Isn't it that now?
- It's a bit later.
Sit down, for Christ's sake.
Screen test : Börje Ahlstedt.
Director : Hortlund.
Action!
- You're the sales director
- Yes, I'm head of the company's sales and servicing in Stockholm.
And head of Bergengren Ltd.
Yes!!!
- You have a driver's license?
- Oh, yes!
- It's a basic requirement.
- Of course. I'm a good driver.
Are you interested in cars?
I like sports cars.
All kinds of cars.
How old are you?
- How old are you?
- I'm 28.
You get a love scene with Lena.
A love scene with consequences.
What kind of consequences?
I don't know.
I'll think of something.
- This Madeleine!!!
- An upper-class chick.
You're really hot for her.
Then you have something with Lena.
You think you'll be a successful salesman?
Yes, I believe in my personality.
Yes. 1200. Then I'll make
350 crowns for every car.
- Can I get paid tax-free?
- No, that's not possible.
The term tax-free doesn't exist these days, sorry to say.

SKUNK PUSSY!
''Skunk pussy is your name.
Worse than a whore!
You and Vilgot should be tortured in some sadistic way!
I hope you and your likes meet a painful death!
If I were alone, I'd sign this, but we all hope you go to hell!!''

''Congrats on finding such a young yet full-blown whore as Lena Nyman.
You must get good use out ofher, both privately and for renting out.
We're a bunch of fun-loving guys who want to hire the whore for some group therapy.
She's well trained for that.
Reply in the Nov. 24 of "Expressen", stating the price and where we can pick up the whore. ''
Good morning, Peter Wester.
Has Lena Nyman arrived?
THE NYMAN INSTITUTE
Hey, Lena?
Do you want Freud or Marx?
I want Franco.
Hi.
Take a look.
Imagine that's your mom and dad and you're very young.
A tiny kid, lying there listening to them talking about you.
You can't hear what they're saying, but it's obviously about you.
The radio is on, too.
A popular song.
One your mom liked a lot and went around humming before she disappeared.
- But why did she run off?
- I don't know.
She couldn't take it any longer.
- But to leave me like that!
It had to do with her nerves.
Maybe she had a nervous breakdown.
I think she was in a mental hospital for a while when you were little.
You know, she came from the country, from Västergötland.
From a little place called Lundsbrunn.
Her mother was religious, a nonconformist.
The Pentecostal Revival Church or something like that.
Oh, I must have hated her!
And longed for her.
May I ask you a few questions for a survey for the Nyman Institute?
You have to branch out on your own.
Newspapers work too fast and can't be trusted.
Science works far too slowly and gets no results.
So you have to branch out on your own.
Has the leveling of income gone as far as it can in Sweden?
As far as it can?
No, but I don't think it'll go much further in the near future.
Did you know that income leveling here has stood still for 20 years?
No? It's true nevertheless.
Guess how it'll be in 20 years.
The income gap will be even bigger.
But not many believed me.
Especially not among the students.
They thought it was natural as hell that those with a head for studies should earn a lot more than others.
No storms yet in our minds do dwell
BEWARE OF
They didn't fear
MERITOCRACY an educational welfare state that rewards the bookworms and forgets everyone else.
I warn you::
Emphasizing education will sharpen class boundaries!!
Some people were born with limited prospects.
They're lost and awkward.
They lack the brains to study.
Others have a very different start.
They have the chance to study.
They have parents who encourage and push them on.
Should they be rewarded for that?
Should they get better jobs?
Better wages?
A better position in society?
Is that right and fair?
Yes, I suppose so.
It's a question of performance.
Yeah, but you can't help being born with a less-than-brilliant mind.
He shouldn't have to suffer for it.
But the thing is, does he?
Either I hadn't made myself clear, or he didn't make any major demands on justice and equality.
He shouldn't have to suffer for it.
But the thing is, does he?
I got the strangest results from the workers.
They seemed brainwashed, like they'd not heard the term ''class society.''
Class society?
Class society?
How do you answer that?
No, I don't think so.
I think everything's okay.
You can't ask for more.
UNAWARE
No, I don't think so.
- I don't think so.
- You don't?
A guy from the Swedish Labor Federation said it was due to Per Albin, a prime minister during my childhood.
He duped the workers with dreams.
They're in a coma and won't wake up even if the right wing takes power.
THE SWEDISH CLASS SOCI ETY
What gives a really low wage in Sweden?
Being over 50, with only elementary school, and doing manual labor.
Preferably a woman, in a rural area. Then it's tough.
14,000 is enough for a woman, at least in rural areas.
- Women should earn less than men?
- Absolutely.
CONTEMPT OF WOMEN
SECRET: OPEN:
- Where in Northern Sweden?
- Hammerdal, in Jämtland.
- And what's your occupation?
- Short-order cook.
- What education do you have?
- Elementary school.
Let me try and guess your income.
It must be around 1 1 , 000.
That's right.
- I'm from Blekinge.
- Another short-order cook?
No, I'm a teacher.
- What level?
- Elementary.
I earn 25,000.
Textile worker.
Let me guess.
- Say 16, 17, 18,000?
- Yes, 16-17,000.
- High school teacher.
- A fine profession, isn't it?
- Well, yes, I enjoy it.
- And you make good money too?
Fifty thousand?
- About that, yes.
- An architect.
- From Stockholm?
You make a very good income.
A gross income of about -
About 100,000.
You look energetic. Perhaps you do a little extra work on the side?
I do. That's another 50,000.
Fifty thousand?
So you're up around 150,000?
Congratulations!
Would you please stand over there by yourself.
I think we really must do something here.
Don't the five of you and the whole public think we should give a great big cheer for that good old Swedish class society.
Swedes are moving away from the church, thank God.
So why get married and buried in church and have their kids confirmed?
I did a survey.
42% : need for something solemn.
21% : keeping up with the Joneses.
17% : spellbound.
8% : fear of God.
For Swedes, sufficient reason to take part in religious ceremonies!!
Goddamn it!!
CHURCH WEDDINGS ARE HYPOCRISY
CONFIRMATION IS HYPOCRISY
CHURCH + BOURGEOISIE =
UNHOLY ALLIANCE
THE ONLY WAY TO GO
INTO CHURCH IS FEET FIRST
- Should we separate church and state?
- Yes, that's a good idea.
- What political party are you?
- I'm a Social Democrat.
- And yet you don't think so?
- No, it's too risky.
The church might really wake up!
Let them stay asleep.
PARISH REGISTRAR'S OFFICE
- Should we separate church and state?
- Yes.
Why?
The state doesn't want to appear Christian, so church and state don't belong together.
For example, this office has nothing to do with the church.
What's the point in my sitting here copying birth certificates?
All this talk about reaching people - it's just nonsense.
A few years ago there was a big fuss about having female priests.
There still is.
But not among ordinary people.
It's among highly educated theologians.
This movement within the state church called ''Rally The Church'':
Have you noticed what they're yakking about?
Female priests.
Abortion. Sex education.
Aren't they fuck-fixated?
Is it good or bad that the church is losing its power in Sweden?
Good.
- Don't you believe in God?
- No.
- Have you left the state church?
- No.
- Why not?
- Plain laziness.
- Are you confirmed? Baptized?
- Both.
When I was confirmed,
I was religious.
- How did it go?
- Hi, Lena.
- I only got to borrow fifty.
- That's nothing! So what's next?
We'll talk about that later.
Lena, I've got myself a new home.
It's fantastic.
Come over and take a look.
I was embarrassed that I hadn't recognized Bim.
God, I mean... Bim!!
I often slept in his chair up at
'Stockholms Tidningen' while he wrote.
Sometimes we'd both sleep there before he went home to Bim.
He'd toiled for the socialist press all his life, after political training.
For every paper that the
Labor Federation had bought up and closed down.
Finally the bastards put
'Stockholms Tidningen' to death. Hell!!
- How much did you pay?
- Ten thousand.
- For all of this?
- It was all of my Labor Federation grant.
When I first met Hans, he was working on a future project.
He wanted to shake the movement up and make the May Day demonstration of 1974 something wholly new.
FRATERNIZATION!!!
SABOTAGE!!! NONCOOPERATION
The May Day demonstration was a manifestation for nonviolence.
An unusually large crowd took part or watched.
A sign of renewal within the labor movement, said the organizers.
Nonviolence! Nonviolence!
Foreign Minister Torsten Nilsson addressed a crowded stadium::
''We need thorough knowledge of the techniques of nonviolence, indoctrination of its 'catechism, ' and transformed military training.
We must not underestimate the problems, or make little of the risk of reprisals by an occupying force.
The fact that loss of life for us and the enemy would be much greater in conventional warfare motivates our wish to introduce new defense methods in an era when society's development makes military weapons seem antiquated.''
The earth is a pillow
Nice and soft and warm
There will Lena safely sleep
Animals and mankind dream
Silent in the arms of the night
It's the altitude.
I just can't.
Hans, what's the matter?
Why can't you?
Too much going on in my head.
I can't relax.
What are you thinking about then?
Is it Bim?
Yes.
- How strange you've become.
- You think so?
Why did you move out to the boat?
You talk so much about the group, and about group feelings.
How the hell can you isolate yourself out there with Bim?
Does it work out?
- Yes, it's so damned good with her.
- But are you happy with Bim?
- Sure. We yell and fight.
Then we make love.
- You yell and fight?
After that, it works fine.
But I'm no sadist.
Hell, that's not it!
Give me a break!
Yeah, but he's been impotent.
You can't play him as a wimp.
He'll end up a whining brat.
There has to be some power in the guy.
There can't be any power in this scene. He's a total failure.
He's worked on the girl all night!
- All night?
A whole bloody night and he fails.
There's no power there!
He had that power years ago, like we said!
Hey, he's Lena's intellectual father!
He's given her all the ideas on nonviolence and the class society.
He's the one who educated her and got her turned on about this stuff.
You screw up the whole situation!
Why ask me to make him impotent?
That wasn't my idea.
It was your idea.
I didn't go home with Vilgot.
I wandered around, not knowing where to go.
All of a sudden
I started thinking about Börje, and all the fun we'd had in drama school before Marie got pregnant and they got married.
Then I just hoped time would fly so I could phone him.
I was terrified
Marie would answer the phone.
Madeleine!
- Do you come here often?
- No!
- First time?
- Yes.
I go to Cecil's. No, not just go.
I have fun at Cecil's.
- Are you here often?
- I'm a regular.
- Ever been to Lorry?
- No.
-Jambalaya?
- No.
- Is Sweden a class society?
- I suppose so, to some extent.
Some people, like here, see this place as something special, when perhaps it isn't.
The name scares some off.
Just as well.
- I'm in advertising.
- Is Sweden a class society?
A class society?
No, I don't think so.
- Definitely not.
- So we have total equality?
- Yes, quite shocking.
- A shocking equality?
- So we shouldn't change anything?
- Definitely not.
Do you know who the crown prince's current girlfriend is?
- I'm not the least interested.
- No?
Is sex the greatest joy in life?
- No, that's very-
What's the word?
- Do you have problems with Swedish?
- Yes, I just arrived yesterday. Sorry.
- Were you abroad?
- I live abroad.
- Where?
- In Switzerland.
Those who don't work shouldn't live off those who do.
So that's a class society, then?
There's too much welfare support.
People laze around and get lots of benefits. Those who work pay for it!
Damn it, it's all happening!
They want me and Marie to play the leads!
What kind of play?
An American hit.
Success, money, laughter.
A chance like that, of course -
Exactly. But your film!!!
You mentioned a love scene with Lena.
With consequences.
Yes, a love scene with consequences.
Of course, a love scene without consequences would be pointless.
What is a lawyer's annual income?
From almost nothing to a couple of hundred thousand.
Then he pays 80% in taxes.
It's pretty fair that taxes are as high as they are.
But a restaurant worker, for instance, earns so many times less, though the work is hard.
Is that fair?
No, it's not fair.
When I worked in a mine or on a farm,
I paid lower income tax.
I worked more then but had less left, even after lower taxes, than now, when I work less.
Though people say I work hard.
I have more left over now, and much more satisfying work.
- Can't we do something about it?
- You can do a lot about things.
It's all dynamics. We always revert to differences and distinctions.
Madeleine! Hurry up.
We're leaving, Madeleine!
He's changed his mind again!
We're leaving town for two months.
- Hell, no. You and I have to get together.
- I know. But how?
How can I get away?
- Say you're staying with your mom.
I've used that excuse too often.
What the hell will you say, then?
- I have to go in now.
- But two months!
- What do I ask them now?
- Same thing.
- The IOU's fixed. I withdrew 5,000.
- Great.
But your mom will have to co-sign.
Then I have to go and see her.
I'll do it before we leave town.
I haven't seen her for a while.
Happy now you'll be getting your own place?
Sure.
Go back to sleep now.
Be good for daddy.
I really messed up on that screen test.
If he says he wants me in the film, I'll say,
''No, thanks. Not interested.''
He can be sure of that!
- But he's counting on you.
He is?
We talked about our scenes last night.
- Last night? In his bed?
- Yeah, I'm living there.
- You can move.
- If I can borrow the money.
- Money, money, money!
- An apartment costs money.
Damned prostitution everywhere!
- Nice if we had a place we could go.
- Everywhere! We can come here.
I don't like being here.
When will Marie be back?
- Not before 12:00.
- Sure?
- I promise.
I'm hungry.
- Where are you all going?
- Lundsbrunn.
- Where's that?
- In Västergötland, I think.
- What are you going to do there?
- Search for Mom, he said.
- Who?
- Mom.
Suppose I'd got on Mom's trail that afternoon.
If someone had said,
''She's up there at the new school.
She's a cook.
But the school's closed for the summer. ''
Wrong trail, of course.
No, she's not working there at all.
She moved to Borås a year ago.
Now we'll go up, up, up
Up on our dawning love's top, top, top
Come, come, come with me
She lives in Borås, is remarried, and has a son of eight or nine that I've never seen.
My halfbrother.
Grandma was a Revivalist, and Mom tried to leave the church as a girl.
Difficult to understand that she had a hard time leaving the church.
Through lies and deception, they take Him and crucify Him, thus proving the inherent evil of mankind.
But instead of letting mankind suffer its just punishment,
Jesus went in His love and said to his Father,
''Father in Heaven, you know me and you see the evil of mankind.
Let me go down to earth.
Let me speak to the people, and let me give my life for theirs,
Father, God in Heaven.''
And this was God's plan.
He told His Son to go.
Thus it happened thatJesus came unto us bringing His gift of love.
We cannot understand this, but such is the love of God.
Even if we cannot understand, through faith we can experience it and perceive that Jesus purifies and sanctifies our hearts.
Amen.
We shall close by standing up and praising the Lord.
Hallelujah!!! hallelujah!!!
Praise be toJesus!
God's blessing on you all.
I hope to see you here again soon.
Many other prophecies also speak of the Day ofJudgment.
How people are busy with worldly things and have turned away from God.
And, well!!! how depravity prevails.
Like in the days of Noah and Lot.
- And depravity prevails now, then?
- Oh, yes. Very much so.
Especially in Sweden.
- In what way?
You only have to listen to what they say in the news and so on.
What do you mean by depravity?
Immorality, thievishness.
REMEMBRANCE OF SUNDAY SCHOOL
What's immorality?
The Bible says that all intercourse outside marriage is immoral.
So you and your fiancée have never had sex?
No.
You're not going to do it until you're married?
No, we won't.
- Have you ever?
- No.
- Has your fiancée?
- I hardly think so.
Do you desire her in that way?
Of course. That's normal.
But since the word of God says that it belongs solely in wedlock, you comply.
You get the strength to do it.
The two of you don't indulge in petting?
- No.
- But you kiss and cuddle?
- Yes, we do.
- But that's all?
Will you have children straightaway?
It depends if we can.
Not everyone can.
If you're not going to have children, how are you going to prevent it?
- I don't think we'll try to prevent it.
- But if you did want to?
You just have to go without.
- Complete abstinence, then?
- Yes, exactly.
- No contraceptives?
- No.
No rhythm? No coitus interruptus?
Abstinence.
Take the population explosion, for example.
The world's getting overpopulated.
How can we stop that?
Stop it!!!
I don't think it's a question of stopping it.
As I said before, I don't think we have a long time left.
The Bible says that the whole world -
But shouldn't we do something about starvation due to overpopulation?
- Of course. We'll do what we can.
- Like what?
We can send them contraceptives, teach them birth control.
What the world needs most is the gospel.
The gospels don't feed starving people who have a baby every year.
Think about this:
A man who is saved goes to heaven when he dies.
One who is not saved goes to hell.
But all those millions in India and China aren't saved.
Are they going to hell?
The Bible speaks of heaven and hell and those with no faith in Jesus.
So first they starve to death on earth, and then they burn in hell!
They're children! ''Suffer the children, for such is the Kingdom of Heaven.''
Jesus said so.
- First torment on earth -
- ''Suffer the children'', it says.
But!!!
Yes, that's a difficult question.
I was damned upset afterwards and thought of all kinds of things.
Like the Catholics, they don't give a damn about social change.
And the religions in India, the caste system!!
Our own state church, that never made a move for anything important.
QUESTION TO HUMANITY:
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WITH ALL THE RELIGIONS?
I never went to Borås, though I was sure I'd find Mom there.
Mom, my halfbrother, and her new man.
I just couldn't do it.
I had some very strange days, floating around in thin air.
Anything could have happened.
It was frightening.
But nice, too.
They dropped me off five hours later... near Örebro.
Welcome to our maximum-security prison, built by order of the Swedish people.
''There is a refuge for all eternity in His arms. Amen.''
I'll have to talk with the social workers in Strömsund.
And in Gäddede, to find out if there's any room.
Yes, do they have room?
What will your friends here at the home say if you move?
- They never talk.
- Don't they?
It's as if they're deaf and dumb.
They're not exactly lively.
I'll have a look at that leg again.
That's the one that hurts, eh?
Like the joints are coming apart.
''Bertil Wikström,
General Practitioner, Age 45''
- The doctor's here.
- Oh, good.
- Sleep well last night?
- Better than in twenty million years!
- You're interested in prison welfare?
- Quite right.
- Do you know Torsten?
- Torsten who?
Torsten Eriksson, prison director.
The one who built Kumla,
''The Desert Fortress''?
May I come with you to Strömsund?
But you've got so much to load.
Torsten was a prison chief for whom we're very thankful
He built Kumla Desert Fort upon the plains of Närke
Strong he built the citadel
Everybody thinks he's swell
That's Torsten
Running, running away
Torsten was a radical even in the '30s
Hens are clucking, roosters crow
''Radicals are ninnies''
Wall was built 'bout seven miles high
Faggots seen by TV-eye
And Torsten
Running, running away
Very gentle are the screws never using axes
Out of work, they got the news
Now they're paying taxes
Radicals becoming men
Old gods can be used again
By Torsten
Running, running away
This institution here - we ought to blow the damn thing to pieces.
- Why?
- I don't believe in prisons.
Not huge ones like this.
- What sort of transport is that?
Prisoner transport on their way to me. My patients.
What do you think will happen with prison welfare, then?
In the Medical Journal recently a colleague of mine, Karl Grünewald, peeked at the Prison Board's building plans.
They were scary.
Evidently, from a therapy aspect, the institute that's to take over from Långholmen is worse than Kumla.
And the next prison up in Härnösand is worse still.
The planners apparently have no knowledge of behavioral science.
It's only financial considerations behind the whole system.
They build a factory around it and think it's the perfect solution.
Who's that?
A newcomer. She rents Svartön.
What a smashing hat.
She reminds me of the actress
Gunnel Broström.
Wait here a minute, please.
Peter, dinner's ready.
Bring Johan up with you.
Tell Daddy dinner's ready.
Okay, Lena, you can come in now.
Women, you know. Why aren't you allowed women when you're in jail?
Does that seem a crucial problem?
Well, it is in the beginning.
But it dulls off after a while.
- How's your leg, by the way?
- No trouble, really.
Except if I've been carrying heavy stuff. Then it aches.
- Why are you here today, then?
- I'm being released soon.
You get problems with your sleep and nerves.
- ''Release fever'' you call it, eh?
- Right.
You brood over such a lot of things.
I asked to stay a while, and I stayed with Bertil and Anna for two days.
I asked around about prison welfare.
Nice people. Or stupid, or smart.
I got the feeling that no one thought about what kind of justice we have here.
They're pampered too much.
So it's just getting worse.
They commit crimes just to get in here!
What was Ulriksfors in pre-prison days?
Originally, a wood pulp factory.
Then it became a textile factory.
Does the municipality benefit from the prison being here?
I think it does.
They employ a lot of people from this area.
It's unlikely any company would move here into those huge premises.
- What's a lawyer's annual income?
- I wouldn't know.
- Can you guess?
- No.
- What do you think?
- They must make quite a bit.
-And a textile worker?
- They don't make much.
-A waitress, then? Annually.
- I don't know.
It depends on what town she works in, the type of restaurant, and her age.
But it's a lousy job with lousy pay.
- Do you have lousy pay?
- Not anymore.
Why not anymore?
- Did you go to university?
- Did you?
No, the university's in my pocket.
- You earn a lot with that education?
- Yes. Didn't you know that?
Can you sleep when it never gets dark at night up here?
Yes. I sleep very well.
If you need anything, like drinking water,just come up.
- Do you know what a prisoner costs?
- 30,000 a year, on average.
- Do you keep figures in your head?
- Not at the moment.
I've locked them up for vacation.
- Do you have a guilty conscience?
- No, but Swedish society does.
- Really?
- Ask yourself!.
If I had a gun,
I'd knock that chimney down.
And the tower.
The whole bloody system.
Thanks. You forgot noncustodial.
Concentrate!
- I am!
- You're not!
It's pointless just saying a prisoner costs 30,000 a year.
Compare with noncustodial care,
20,000 people costing 60 a year.
- A retake?
- Yes!
He's crazy.
He demands total concentration on the picture.
Nothing else is allowed to exist!
I know he's a bastard.
Are you sleeping with him, though?
I said, are you sleeping with him?
Oh, that!!!
If I don't, I might just as well tell him about us.
You have to stop that!
Impossible till the film's finished.
Grand Hotel, Strömsund.
You can be without a little while!
Do you miss me, Lena?
A lot?
I miss you.
I miss you so.
Bye, then.
We'll have time to fly down to Stockholm and be back Sunday night.
I think the class society ought to irritate the Social Democrats.
It itches like hell.
Like scabies.
''The socialist itch.''
Sweden is a boastful country.
Our socialism is just showing off.
Prison welfare is just an example of how amateurish we are when it comes to looking after people.
I must attack the idea of general prevention, the groundless thesis that people won't commit crimes for fear of punishment.
What did Mom say?
Did she send her regards?
- No.
- It would be nice if she did.
- Hey!!!
- Yes?
- When are we finished up here?
- That depends on you.
Why is that?
Depends on how much you're prepared to put into this job.
You're losing your spirit.
That scene today with Gunnel Broström -
You were so absent.
- How about you, then?
- You just faked everything.
- You've changed a lot, too.
Have I?
But you admit you've changed?
There's something holding you back.
- Not that I know of.
Time to find out, then.
You're accommodating on the surface, but there's a barrier you never cross.
Is this the way it's going to be?
- No, this is no fun.
But we had it good before.
Didn't we?
Or was that just fake, too?
No.
No, it didn't feel like it.
Lena, what is it you want to do?
- What do you mean?
Finish the film? Stay with me?
Finish the film and then leave me?
Have you thought it through?
Okay, so now I'm not allowed to touch you!
I'm singing no longer ofkisses and sweet words
I'm singing no longer of marriage and rings
Darling and lover are only small play words
Having no worth they've lost their meaning
You were the first the last, and the only
So said my heart from the very first day
But I've given you back now the ring that you gave me
Bright rings of gold are nothing for me
I was so blue-eyed so young and so lowly
I was a baby that just couldn't see
You had those others
I wasn't your only
The love that I gave you you just threw away
But my heart is mourning
And longing and hoping
Longing and hoping
Against all,just for you
That you'll understand me
And then you'll come back, love
My heart is hopeless
It won't learn a thing
But I know I must make this heart of mine strong
A tough girl is what the men all long for
Is it good that the girls sit here and the boys stand over there?
- It looks a bit stiff, but it's okay.
- So it's okay?
Otherwise the guys can't see us girls if we all just mingle.
- What do the guys do all evening?
- I can't really answer that.
They're mostly driving around.
I mean on a dance night?
Most of those who can dance are up dancing, but tonight is slow.
- Do you buy booze before the dance?
- Of course you bring a bottle!
Definitely!
- Why?
The broads up here are so shy, so you have to loosen up a little.
I was in the liquor store and bought five whole bottles of brandy.
Excuse me. Gosh, you're tall.
How tall are you?
Six-four.
Full-grown.
- Do you go out to pick up a girl?
- Yes.
- Do you usually get one?
- No.
It's a drag.
What do you think of a girl who sleeps with you the first night?
- Good.
- You like it?
Sure, if she's good in bed.
Otherwise it's a drag.
- Bad.
- You think she's bad, then?
It depends who the guy is.
If you meet a guy who wants to, do you let him?
I don't think so. It depends.
- On what?
- On the boy and other things.
- I wouldn't.
- How many dates first, then?
More than one, anyway.
- Should girls save sex for after marriage?
- No.
- What do you think?
- Definitely not.
- Oh, so they should get practice?
- Right!
Should the girl or the boy take precautions?
- Who should take care of that?
- The girl.
Well, the guy.
Both.
Which do you prefer, a rubber or a diaphragm?
- What?
- Rubber, diaphragm or the pill?
The pill's best.
- Are you on the pill?
- No.
- Too shy to ask a doctor?
- No.
Should the boy marry a girl if he gets her pregnant?
Not necessarily, if they find out they don't like each other.
Well, that's a damn problem.
But it should be tried in court and that.
If the guy loves the girl, he should take care of her.
If he doesn't, he should forget her.
- Do you believe in marriage?
- No.
- Have you been married?
- No.
- But don't you want children?
- I already have one.
- How old is it now?
- Thirteen.
Thirteen!
I'm doing a scientific survey.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Sure.
- How old are you?
- Twenty-nine.
So you were how old when you had your baby?
Just turned 1 7.
- A boy or a girl?
- A girl.
''Lena Explains
Nonviolence to Sonja''
FRATERNIZATION!!!
SABOTAGE!!! NONCOOPERATION
It's just as shallow out here!
Christ, it's muddy.
What a lousy lake bed. Hell!
Are there crabs in here?
- No,just fish.
Come on!
Hurry up! I'll give you a swimming lesson.
Don't you dare? Come on!
I had dinner with Sonja and Elin every day for a week.
Cloudberries?
It was the first time that summer
I felt like staying in one place.
- God, that was cold!
- It's so peaceful here.
Not a soul for miles.
- I'm so muddy!
Rinse off before you get dressed.
- Do you know Sonja Lindgren?
- Yes.
Did many condemn her for getting pregnant when she was only 17?
Goodness, no.
I can't imagine that.
- I hardly think so.
- You don't?
Did you?
No, there's nothing!!! nothing wrong with that.
- You don't?
- Not me.
That belongs to another century, judging like that.
- Another century? The 19th?
- Yes.
I don't think people are so strict nowadays. Not people in general.
When I went into the hospital, they wanted me to take the elevator.
I refused.
''I'll take the stairs.
You take my bag in the elevator.''
Then, in the labor room,
I refused the bed and everything.
They all seemed to look at me as if to say, ''What's she doing here?''
I thought, ''You go on laughing.
I'll manage this myself.''
You know how it feels.
Not a soul gives you a kind look.
They all think you're filth, not being able to keep out of trouble.
Hell, only 1 2:00.
I'd sworn I'd get a few hours'sleep before Sonja and Elin came to get me.
We were going fishing for trout.
But it was just too light up there.
Damned mosquitoes!
Lena!
MESSAGE TO
THE PRISON BOARD:
YOU HAVE STOPPED

MARCH AGAINST IMPERIALISM
USA - Murderers!
Franco - Murderer!
Viva Ho Chi Minh!
Here comes the socialist movement's march against imperialism, symbolized here by a snake.
Africa :Uhuru means freedom.
Portugal out of Africa!!
Volvo in South Africa::
''Apartheid's value lasts. ''
Fire Wallenberg!
Fire the financiers!
Franco, executioner of the Spanish people.
Crush the right-wing junta in Athens.
Spread the revolution in the US.
Indonesia is the CIA's gas chamber.
One million people murdered.
It was awful meeting them all again.
All I wanted to do at that moment was go into hiding.
Workers of the world unite.
Fight for world peace.
Is there a party here?
No, Lena's going to live here.
-Just for a couple of days.
- It doesn't matter how long.
The thing is, where will you sleep?
That's all arranged. Over there.
Hans!
- What is it?
- She gets the right-hand cabin.
- Stop nagging. She'll be in here.
- No, I said!
Put her to bed yourself, damn it!
Let's see if we can find you a place to live.
- I can't live at home right now, so -
- That's fine.
I don't want to be any trouble.
Oh, no! Hans often has guests.
He's awfully kind.
Yes, he is, but!!!
- What is it?
- It itches.
A doctor in Strömsund said I had an allergy.
An allergy? Let's have a look.
Only here?
- No. My armpits and fingers, too.
What is it? Move.
I'm going to put -
Bloody pacifist!
Nonviolence, eh?
You're crazy.
- What the hell. You win anyway.
- Win?
You know very well.
I brought Lena here.
I know her and I want to help her.
You and your damned pseudo-psychology!
- Go and help her your way, then!
If you can.
I've managed Lena before.
Before, yeah!
- Come here.
- I want to sleep.
I don't want to hit you.
Tired of fighting
Half would be enough
We're turned on and off like lights
Men and beasts alike
The same damned family
Is the pillow big enough for us?
Let us rest now
Shut up in Babel's Tower
People are all blown about
I am one of them
The samejunk and weed
None of us are good enough
I'm one of them
The samejunk and weed
The wind sends me where it will
- Come here.
- Where's Bim?
Asleep.
Come in and sit down.
I want to talk a bit.
It's so damned difficult to talk about these things.
Lena!!!
You're so sweet.
It's such a mess!
I can't stand this damned fighting.
- Before you go any further-
- What are you doing here?
- I want to talk to Lena!
- I know, but I want to see something.
Leave Lena alone!
You've got nothing to do with her!
I'm going to look at your allergy.
Give me your hand.
A magnifying glass! You're crazy.
Just what I thought.
You've got scabies.
Scabies! The doctor said it was an allergy.
That's no allergy. It's scabies.
I wonder if you've infected anyone.
- Infected?
- It's catching, in a warm bed.
I almost think you've made up this scabies to stop us.
Shut up!
I took the part, then.
The part of a car salesman.
Even though I'd sworn I'd say no and Marie asked me not to.
Börje.
You sold Mr.Johansson a car, and he's very angry now.
Hi.
Can we talk somewhere?
I'm off now. I can give you a lift.
The car's in the garage.
- What did you say you have?
- Scabies.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Thanks for the scabies.
- Have you noticed anything?
- You bet! I itch all over!
So you've got it too.
But I might not have infected you.
- Who else, then?
- Maybe you gave it to me!
- Guys always get it from girls!
I know that much about scabies!
- So it's a girl's disease now, eh?
- You've slept with lots of guys.
- And you with lots of girls!
- Were you with anyone before me?
- Yes. And so were you.
- So what?
- You could have gotten it then.
You gave it to me.
And my kid. Bloody hell!
- You've never talked about your kid before!
- Damn, damn, damn!
Bloody hypocrite.
You disgust me!
You're so disgusting!
No matter. We have to do something about it.
You just call St. Göran's clinic for an appointment.
Number 27.
THE SOCIALIST ITCH

Sit on the paper.
One heel in each.
- A bit further forward.
- Give me her card.
- What are you here for?
- I itch. I think I have scabies.
How long has it been?
Two or three weeks.
Move down a bit.
I thought it was mosquito bites.
I itch and I can't sleep.
Your National Health Card, please.
- Have you been here before?

Your name is Börje?

Former.

No, why?
Depending on the examination, other family members might need an examination.

- The doctor decides that.
- No, I'm not married.
Move down a little more.
A bit more.

That'll be three crowns.
There, then.
Get up, please.
Wait outside for the results.
No alcohol, sexual intercourse or petting during the treatment.

Buy our film!! Buy it!!

- The blue version.
{3}{127}THIS CHURCH WAS AT ONE TIME THE OBJECT|OF MUCH ABUSE HAVING BEEN BUILT BY
{129}{252}A CO XCOMB CHEEKY ENOUGH TO ALTER|THE GROUND PLAN CONTRARY TO THE RULE.
{254}{377}WE WERE ACQU AINTED WITH THAT MASTER|BUILDER AND WE LIKED HIM WELL,
{379}{502}EVEN INF HE WAS SOME WHAT DISSOLUTE.
{2112}{2236}THE CAPRICIOUS SUMMER
{5021}{5136}This is an unfortunate summer indeed.
{5519}{5607}Shouldn’t t the month of June at least|permit us to attend
{5609}{5682}to our health and cleanness?
{5910}{5976}Hey, mister!|Get down from the broomatick
{5978}{6044}I see you are riding.
{6073}{6176}Where did you learn such manners?|- Pray do not cell me indecent.
{6198}{6322}I removed my trousers|because the skin too wants to brathe.
{6375}{6431}I was taught and I follow|the rules of hygiene.
{6433}{6531}For the benefit of my body.
{6540}{6621}Being enthusiastic for the present.
{6623}{6661}You are neglecting things eternal.
{6692}{6751}The book I laid down|is near enough to be remindful
{6758}{6877}of what duration means.|It is 2000 years old!
{6889}{6957}Pay attention to my words, major.
{6968}{7072}The major has not read your book|an will never read it.
{7074}{7122}Even if it were older still.
{7148}{7238}Should he believe the bray|of old asses sounded better?
{7261}{7370}He has come to fish|and you scare the fish away.
{7378}{7411}Oh no.
{7413}{7477}I have come to like these discussions.
{7503}{7564}Although I do not find them very noble,|I admit them.
{7583}{7641}As a faint reflex of passion.
{7663}{7727}What can be more magnificent|than an ever blue sky
{7733}{7792}and an ever burning red passion?
{7823}{7896}I am doubtful about the blue sky.
{7928}{7983}This June is not up to the mark.
{8028}{8137}Why are you holding back?|As if do not moan hours long?
{8148}{8233}Being poor I cannot afford|to expres my indignation.
{8265}{8347}Yet, I feel inclined to curse.
{8353}{8477}But for your propensity to wrangle|I could be of some help
{8505}{8614}but you always want to have|the last say.
{8623}{8702}Better to have the last say|than the last blow...
{8713}{8752}Oh, you are never idle!
{8793}{8889}We are discoursing on abstract things|with the canon.
{8905}{8964}I thing you are talking nonsense
{8978}{9022}and shouting as if money was at stake.
{9048}{9100}I have had to listen|to my husband s prating
{9108}{9171}ever since I married him at seventeen.
{9173}{9226}For you should know|I was too young when I got married.
{9275}{9334}I could have chosen better fellows
{9355}{9472}if Antonín had not thrashed my suitors|got hold of my keys
{9505}{9580}and plagued me|until marriage became unavoidable.
{9590}{9647}How can I, major, under such|circumstances
{9658}{9772}heed your kings|the canon s books and my own health?
{9818}{9929}It's true, Antonín was very much in love|and of excellent health.
{9968}{10060}I bet he gave the fellows|a good hidding.
{10243}{10310}My husband is an unparalelled ass|come sir, let me ferry you.
{10338}{10379}Those two won t hear a word...
{10388}{10448}I am ready to bet|they are talking about fire-arms.
{10569}{10649}You never met the organist, abbé|who used to pinch my hip...
{10651}{10708}singing merrily at the same time.
{10846}{10927}I am sure you are not lagging behind|him - in inventiveness,
{10948}{11070}being much travelled|and highly educated.
{11412}{11525}The swimming master, you and I|are old enough not to be tempted
{11558}{11682}to jump over a neighbour s fence.
{11941}{12002}The canon is a pervert|beware of him.
{12025}{12066}Oh, this has nothing to do with me.
{12125}{12162}You are uncanny, major.
{12165}{12277}Always astraddle, perspiring|casting lightening-glances
{12308}{12372}you remind me of a sergeant|I used to know rather intimately
{12377}{12446}when I was young.|Lend me a hand!
{12500}{12562}That sergeant was as quarrelsome as you.
{12593}{12693}I offered him everything suitable|to curb his vehemence.
{12716}{12812}Still, he twisted buttons|in his impatient fingers...
{12818}{12864}and drank bottle after bottle.
{12888}{12994}He was in the army-service corps|wearing red breaches, not like you
{12998}{13057}an old artilleryman.
{13060}{13151}Regiments wearing red breaches|were recruited form farm hands.
{13168}{13205}Oh, indeed?|I have never heard such opinion.
{13207}{13320}Those fellows,|were the darlings of our street.
{13328}{13416}Your husband to whom you are indepted|for having taken you out
{13458}{13577}of a hideous suburb|was neither a wagoner nor a gunner
{13588}{13621}but a sapper.
{13623}{13682}Don t I know it!
{13698}{13771}Hint at anything else|and the master will baste you.
{13780}{13862}Only fools neglect the present|living in the past.
{13913}{13962}Let us eat nad drink!
{13975}{14092}Give me fat cheese, venison|birds, lambs, all that is brought
{14103}{14162}forth alive or hetched from eggs.
{14183}{14277}Give me fish and the slugs
{14353}{14422}favoured in civilized countrics.
{14443}{14541}Give me food|the Earth has revolved again
{14544}{14601}and it is time to eat.
{14610}{14667}Have you become a windbag|or a glutton, major?
{14685}{14726}Showing off with you teeth|or your tongue?
{14773}{14830}Too much talk makes me uneasy.
{14848}{14960}Uneasy?|We have hardly begun!
{14996}{15063}You follow a bad regimen|with too much thinking.
{15093}{15178}Even while eating|which is another form of gluttony.
{15188}{15262}Do you want to start another quarrel?
{15265}{15318}Only because of your bad habits.
{15323}{15423}If I stuck up to my cars in water|you would pull me out.
{15453}{15566}Are you not drowning in errors|more fatal than water?
{15625}{15662}Where is the vinegar?
{15740}{15792}And salt...
{15886}{15984}Remember how we used to put|salt on our toast?
{16061}{16144}Alas!
{16168}{16227}I remember the Italian campaign.
{16230}{16305}Why was the first Piave battle lost?
{16330}{16434}The army was short of mugs.|So that we drank wine from hands.
{16443}{16554}The soldiers had to punch the casks|with their bayonets
{16630}{16754}and several regiments|were drowned in wine in cellars.
{16870}{16954}Much wine was wasted that way|wine which would otherwise have
{17013}{17129}stimulated thir waning courage.
{17175}{17287}Show your courage, major|by lifting a quintal.
{17308}{17390}I could recite some verses|which are immortal though dealing
{17393}{17467}neither with slaughter nor|weight-lifting.
{17470}{17539}Do not repeat bookish twaddle!
{17541}{17606}Silence!|I shall answer youwith this weapon.
{17628}{17689}The abbé will die from fear!
{17700}{17809}All right, I have means|to take you down a peg.
{17840}{17876}Valour burnt high
{17878}{17919}Though the arms grew weaker...
{17946}{18001}To blazes with your book of odes!
{18008}{18074}And by sword and spear|Men died on the ramparts...
{18085}{18140}The finger gnawing at|an unintelligible line...
{18146}{18200}Still, those who died were the victors.
{18202}{18250}Go hang, you interpreter|of shortwinded lines
{18254}{18302}limping according to rules!
{18313}{18355}Their life alone took the cunning foe
{18363}{18466}And they were crowned with eternal|glory.
{18678}{18742}Enter unhesitatingly!
{18768}{18872}The abbé and the major|found the water warmish.
{19217}{19325}Should you be short of anything|shout and I shall be in time...
{19394}{19492}My husband may be silly|but he knows his rights
{19494}{19532}and how to protect them.
{19534}{19630}If he did not, he would be more|than simply... Antonín.
{19640}{19697}Yes, Antonín - because I am Katherine.
{19728}{19804}You have acquired some logic|which is disarming.
{20463}{20576}I am going to leave|because some of these females
{20582}{20638}always try to drown|in sight of us.
{20661}{20776}Be smart in case of need|and cauticus if they are not of age.
{20864}{20968}Being a stalwart man of fifty|you are welcome here, major.
{20999}{21062}Do you want these women|to go away and leave
{21071}{21148}my swimming-bath unfrequented?
{21172}{21254}This would ruin me!
{21270}{21354}You seem to be too sure|of our tolerance.
{21399}{21485}All commanders are naturally tolerant!
{23273}{23342}I am Ernie, the conjurer|and, being sensitive to cold...
{23370}{23489}The clear sky spells a hot day.|Undress, gentlemen!
{23491}{23551}Is it you, sir|who are in everybody s mouth?
{23636}{23740}The fire-eater said to have lived|in Paris
{23742}{23781}who has arrived from Holland?
{23843}{23881}I was everywhere.
{23909}{23956}Like all magicians!
{23993}{24095}Chaps munching glass.
{24118}{24172}Producing wigs from their sleeves.
{24193}{24297}Self confident in spite of|a misshapen chest.
{24323}{24387}He seems dressed for some other|occasion.
{24398}{24466}Too extravagant...
{24475}{24559}He is showing all his limbs
{24576}{24627}in his pink tights.
{24663}{24715}Pink is the colour of piglings.
{24739}{24806}If pink is the colour of pigs|the scientists grey
{24809}{24862}is the colour of rats.
{24909}{24945}This is a capricious summer.
{24957}{25039}It was raining yesterday|and it may be raining today.
{25055}{25119}Is Dutch weather equally bad?
{25128}{25164}A little better.
{25171}{25258}But the sundays are meantly wet.
{25298}{25372}I am practised in clever feats|which, though physical
{25378}{25437}are mental as well.
{25491}{25597}I make things vanish from sight|imperceptibly, by a sleight of hand
{25646}{25740}the cutcome of much thinkings|and long deliberation.
{25753}{25813}Will you tell me the time, sir?
{25979}{26043}I feel something like a chill|between the two hemispheres of my brain.
{26046}{26112}I hear a ringing as of Easte-bells
{26134}{26258}and it is the ticking of a watch|within my skull.
{26263}{26330}This watch was inside your head?
{26332}{26421}Your artistic skill must be rewarded.
{26424}{26502}Oh, I never expected to find|so much discernment
{26505}{26547}in an out-of-the way country.
{26588}{26635}My public ussually shows|less appreciation, showering on me
{26637}{26725}uneatable objects.
{26733}{26776}People are so rude!
{26788}{26829}But give me my watches back!
{26840}{26903}I ask no more than to be rude, too.
{27015}{27088}Time flies and I cannot|hold it back.
{27090}{27180}Allow me to invite you|to my performance.
{27199}{27236}Mysteries! Amusement!
{27240}{27276}A heartrending spectacle!
{27288}{27330}Reduced entrance-fee|for children and soldiers!
{27521}{27571}Mr. Ernie is a smart fellow.
{27653}{27707}Did you see him blush|when the major made
{27723}{27777}that churlish gesture?
{27824}{27868}A smart fellow, indeed.
{27895}{27977}He ate and drank his fill|without paying the entrance-fee.
{28408}{28511}If that devil of yours were near|he would use his pitchfork on us
{28513}{28564}A because we fancy women|and are hurrying
{28568}{28630}to a magical pastime.
{28633}{28682}You are mistaken, Antonín.
{28684}{28762}I own no devil|and the devil has no pitchfork.
{29221}{29329}Pretty girls are deucedly scarce|but they do exist.
{29417}{29541}Each of them has her instrument|and all of them are present.
{29584}{29671}That rascally Ernie has roused|the town
{29673}{29710}with his tricks and his bragging.
{29726}{29770}What else has brought|so many people here?
{30498}{30558}I am not used to emotion...
{30609}{30647}Isn t she pretty, though?
{30688}{30724}Hasn t she got everything?
{30871}{30975}Antonín, let us ask her|to remove that... array!
{31702}{31771}These are fruitless trees.
{31815}{31871}But nature can be corrected.
{32068}{32117}Are you ready to pay, gentlemen?
{32921}{33030}Whispering is a bad habit|objected to by moralists.
{33059}{33122}Ever since it was sondemned|by the catechism, people abstain
{33138}{33252}from it|except in churches.
{33277}{33394}Enough!|The lady is in a hurry...
{34880}{34987}I wager, dear abbé, I can do it|as expertly without any preparation.
{35721}{35793}Do not overdo things, sir!
{36380}{36456}I bet he is not following his nose.
{36484}{36571}It always shows a deviation|to the right or left.
{36609}{36660}You are talking rubbish.
{36673}{36726}Did those somersaults seem imperfect?
{36794}{36883}If you seek perfection in somersaults...|I've got nothing to say
{39268}{39385}This is a dark night|and a lot of rascals
{39388}{39512}want to steal your bath towels|and other articles.
{39566}{39634}Go to sleep, dear Katherine|I shall be keeping watch.
{39691}{39798}The couch in the cloakroom|will serve for a vigilant rest.
{39834}{39879}I'll sleep with one eye open.
{46441}{46523}Open the door, you depraved lecher!
{46581}{46662}This accursed vocation|has earned me nothing
{46667}{46704}but insults and injury.
{46748}{46793}I could have chosen|forom a tidy bunch of young men
{46796}{46823}and look what I picked out:
{46825}{46880}A blockhead and a wencher|chasing after quills
{46895}{47005}with his home full of feathers!
{47246}{47309}You are drinking, gentlemen?
{47353}{47389}Is it you, major?
{47467}{47512}And you, reverend?
{47648}{47687}Hurry up, now!
{47715}{47796}Get this poor girl|some warm milk and dry umderwear!
{47830}{47880}Lam afraid she has got drowned.
{48153}{48265}I dived for the poor child
{48323}{48434}a girl hardly 20 years old|or she would have drowned.
{48493}{48581}I hear it was Anna, the girl|form the conjurer s caravan.
{48593}{48643}How come you've drag her|through willow trees here.
{48748}{48840}And that she had|to jump into the river
{48850}{48913}to save herself from a shameless rake.
{48969}{49025}It is nice to have a jilly girl friend.
{49034}{49079}I know it.
{49163}{49259}The pink little ears, the red lips...
{49309}{49407}I say, I know it|but the time's passing by.
{49433}{49477}All that is too easily forgotten.
{49480}{49595}Being stupid, women have never|aceomplished anything great
{49640}{49694}and are ignorant of spiritual delights.
{49697}{49818}Besides causing degeneration|by interbreeding with the offspring
{49846}{49936}of noblemen, and begetting|readers of deposit books.
{50419}{50499}Tonight I found a girl in his bed.
{50522}{50566}Wasn t she wet?
{50569}{50669}I heard the clink of glass|the purl of water, but alas!
{50683}{50741}Oh, gosh, father|now it's clear to me.
{50753}{50836}They deceived me by drenching|her underwear!
{50849}{50886}Look at Antonín!
{50905}{51009}Could such an oaf|win a pretty girl?
{51064}{51122}Are you sure it was Anna?
{51147}{51191}Canon Roch is right.
{51199}{51266}It was some hag carrying firewood.
{51293}{51387}Though lascivious once|your husband is old now.
{51399}{51436}I know best how old he is.
{51538}{51607}This wench did not come from the wook|she came from the caravan.
{51648}{51726}Yes, Canon, it was Anna!
{52478}{52517}No inactivity here!
{52719}{52798}No inactivity at all!
{53954}{54053}This bird reminds me|of your own chickens.
{54139}{54220}These are the lamentable confusions|of the ripe age.
{54279}{54401}Love arising from the transition|of periods.
{54453}{54577}I can see my obese|but respectable wife killing chicken
{54600}{54677}to carry them blushing|to Ernie s caravan.
{54772}{54839}I am ready to forgive her
{54928}{55052}but I want to be sure|her new passion is a lasting one.
{55198}{55322}Regone lovers, depart|and for heaven s sake
{55371}{55421}let it be for ever!
{55579}{55638}How nice is to count days up to three
{55640}{55705}How beautiful to wander|from town to town!
{55841}{55893}How beautiful to conjure up flames
{55911}{56001}to handle nice round objects!
{56035}{56149}How beautiful... the a lamps!
{56158}{56194}The magic hat!|And a steep rope.
{56316}{56375}Oh, it's so wonderful!
{56834}{56914}Why are we having such fine nights|and such inclement days?
{56988}{57045}Because you are a great sinner.
{57080}{57166}Counsider it a punishment.
{57169}{57258}Rubbish!|We used to be sinning more
{57260}{57331}and yet the sun was shining...|I don't think this is the point.
{57343}{57436}The mutual attraction of sexes|is older than rocks
{57459}{57523}and I can t see a deluge coming!
{57711}{57835}Do you never feel the urge|to concur with that creative power
{57883}{57962}in defiance of your Carthusian rules?
{58180}{58293}Dear Mr. Antonín, thank you|for coming to my aid.
{58336}{58415}You are so delicate.
{58430}{58514}Didn t you catch a cold?
{58527}{58587}I had a cup of tea|and Mrs. Durová, aou wife
{58589}{58639}took good care of me.
{58696}{58757}My wife indulges in idle talk.
{58759}{58883}Let her stay in a Ernie s Ark|and don t ever go back to him.
{58927}{59020}Ernie may be a mediocre conjurer|but he is a good foster-father.
{59631}{59682}Look at his magic!
{59698}{59777}Katherine playing the barrel-organ|Anna collecting the money
{59788}{59834}both of them living with him.
{59968}{60037}This sorcerer has the devil s help!
{60294}{60366}I've often been afraid you are not sane.
{60371}{60432}I see I was justified|in my fear for your sanity.
{60457}{60529}Treating it as a joke|after your wife has left you!
{61073}{61156}I wonder how Ernie is going to make beds
{61169}{61219}with two women
{61247}{61371}and a single bedroom.
{62678}{62802}I should have given you this book|the first time we met.
{62818}{62842}Yes?
{62844}{62948}Yes, dear Anna, it contains|chaste love stories
{63043}{63082}suitable for your ears.
{63089}{63188}Excuse me, I am frying fish|the supper might get burned.
{63191}{63312}Why, the fish are not fresh anyway|and today is not Friday.
{63400}{63521}All right, I shall let you hold|the saucepan over the fire.
{65547}{65643}Ernie is a moulting ape.
{65690}{65740}And he s knock-kneed too!
{65774}{65836}But he knows the ropes.
{65845}{65919}Isn t his lass all right!
{65921}{65958}For the bed!
{66339}{66418}OK, now!
{67757}{67872}In the name of the law!|What are you doing here?
{68748}{68788}I went to see him.
{68798}{68886}His ear torn and his face all swollen.
{68903}{68951}He was reading two books|and seemed in good mood.
{68999}{69110}He ought to show repentance|and castigate himself...
{69113}{69162}as they did in good monasteries
{69174}{69211}Isn t he a monk?
{69231}{69299}No.|Antonin, you should not give him
{69302}{69346}such bad advice.
{69365}{69404}He got his desert.
{69407}{69528}With his ear nearly torn away|needing a few stitches...
{69893}{69930}Get ready with your needle!
{70311}{70372}A physician might spread the rumour
{70374}{70459}that your ear was not damaged|in defence of the Church.
{70473}{70520}And cos' it is better to keep|our mouth shut about the whole thing
{70522}{70571}Let Mr. Dura doctor you.
{70634}{70758}He is very skilled with needle|as you know.
{70820}{70869}Anotnín Dura is a gifted man.
{70908}{70949}Will you have a glass of wine?
{70973}{71012}I shall need some spirit.
{71033}{71157}Or some hot water|for my long neglected tools.
{71217}{71306}You know I try to avoid trouble|and my nearly nevered ear
{71308}{71424}cannot make me change my attitude.
{71668}{71792}I returned to Ernie s caravan|and entered into conversation
{71824}{71905}with Anna who was frying fish.
{71963}{72002}Did you have supper with her?
{72007}{72131}I had a morsel of the fish|you caught in the river...
{72160}{72284}Keep your shameless story to yourself!|I don't want to hear it! I know it!
{72301}{72366}Be cheerful, abbé, cheerful!
{72396}{72474}Present you ear with heroic|determination and stop swearing
{72476}{72513}I might get confused!
{72607}{72702}Oh, you lecherous poets!
{72745}{72832}Oh, you confounded literature!
{72873}{72997}When will artistic writing|turn its back on brothels?
{73036}{73160}And embrace noble civic virtues?
{73200}{73324}When shall we be reading|about sale and purchase
{73417}{73541}about patrictiam|cattle breeding nad a amelioration?
{73693}{73774}Or a book of poems|about bodily strength
{73822}{73946}and agitation for a just class-rule?
{73949}{73986}When will it be?
{74001}{74038}In some distant time?
{74133}{74257}I heard you, abbé|droning verses of no educational value
{74321}{74413}frothing with the violent blood|and cruelty of specialists
{74487}{74542}who at the very cost of starvation|always try to introcuce
{74544}{74641}a new, uninteligible beauty.
{74942}{75026}The major and I say|it is a nonsensical and vulgar one.
{75048}{75176}And your manners have become|so dissolute that you get into brawls!
{75237}{75320}Yes, I got hart and you|sewd up the wound.
{75344}{75381}It is also true|that i Used to sit
{75383}{75422}on the river bank, reading books.
{75432}{75498}Books by Shakespeare|Rabelais and Cervantes.
{75538}{75625}I would lay down my head for them|as I nearly laid down
{75628}{75664}my ear for Anna.
{75714}{75802}The battlefield is the only place|to die nobly.
{75815}{75883}Poets make bad soldiers, anyhow.
{75902}{75939}Mr. Dura is right.
{76010}{76049}What I say is:
{76220}{76344}Distance can be mensured by wandering|just as affluence by hunger
{76439}{76486}and play precedes action...
{76516}{76582}Or, are you not convineed, major|that everything has its origin
{76584}{76708}in the playfulness and courage|of people who have time to spare
{76785}{76859}to babble like Gods|marshalling things
{76861}{76902}into an amasing sequence?
{76951}{77017}I observe, Antonín,|your character is changing
{77025}{77078}you have just spoken|in favour of potery!
{77174}{77271}No, no, forsooth!
{77326}{77383}I never thought of doing it.
{77493}{77617}Dear madam, near Mulhausen|we got into a snowstorm.
{77638}{77721}The funnel not drawing|it was cold in the caravan...
{77730}{77774}You know what foul weather means.
{77777}{77887}But was your caaravan clean?
{77906}{78026}Only a well kept home|is pleasant to live in.
{78041}{78143}I intend to make some coverlets|and cushion, Ernie
{78145}{78182}to embelish it.
{78184}{78220}Don t forgot the rug.
{78226}{78295}Anna burnt a hole in it|with a cigarette.
{78312}{78365}I reproved her yesterday.
{78373}{78421}She is damaging wilfully our property.
{78423}{78547}If she does not mend her was|I shall give her an hour s notice.
{78804}{78920}Ernie will not leave his caravan|in this weather...
{78964}{79088}I see you want to stay at home|and that you have hardened you heart.
{79152}{79233}Is it the very first time|you got the mitten?
{79284}{79320}Leave sour thougths alone.
{79328}{79415}Get reconciled with the Canon|who is only and instrument
{79417}{79454}of providence.
{79472}{79529}Have you forgotten how we used|to hunt on the river bank
{79542}{79666}for earth worms who love moisture?
{79750}{79811}The pleasant conversation
{79850}{79935}the delightful squabbles we had|which always ended well...
{79939}{80016}Antonín, all that is coming back!
{80823}{80895}I have said many times|Anna does not fit into such
{80897}{80934}surroundings.
{80936}{80975}Look how puzzled she looks!
{81006}{81056}Her plate nearly empty!
{81127}{81187}You should marry her, major|I think she is being ill-treated
{81189}{81225}by Mrs. Durová.
{81303}{81396}Miss Anna, leave the caraven.
{81429}{81478}Come to us!
{81502}{81579}Take my swimming bath|take the Canon s books.
{81604}{81648}What about the major?
{81706}{81772}I shall kill the conjurer|and got to jail.
{83366}{83403}Get down!
{83658}{83782}Come down, mister!|And do not tempt providence
{83865}{83939}You re going to hurt yourself!|And you'll get nothing for that
{84010}{84074}Stop that nonsense, come down!
{84338}{84407}What did I say?!
{84921}{84958}The conjurer is dead!
{84962}{85016}He s simulating!|- The bump he got!
{85022}{85059}Serves him right.|Why did he climb up there!
{85063}{85187}Let s collect a few crowns|and buy him a hen for his soup.
{85206}{85294}Don t forget, dear neighbour|we don t hold with collections.
{85330}{85366}Think what you could buy!
{85372}{85409}And have a good time...
{85497}{85534}He is a poor fellow.
{85546}{85661}He deserves spanking|so that the town is peaceful again!
{85679}{85715}You cry too much!
{85732}{85828}My companion hates murdeous tumbles|as much as blubbering.
{85876}{85954}Now put on Ernie s tights|for another performance.
{85956}{86002}A crowd is waiting!
{86079}{86125}Am I, a respectable citizen s wife|to také part publicly
{86127}{86251}in deception and subterfuge?
{86311}{86435}I am used to a decent house|and I shall have it again
{86454}{86545}because Antonín is calling me back.
{86547}{86615}I saw him several times|near the caravan, pole
{86617}{86741}perturbed and ready to tear|the caravan into splinters.
{86806}{86842}You are right.
{86851}{86937}You left your hearth for a while|and now you are the martyr...
{86963}{87036}Go home|before I reach for my stick!
{87252}{87377}I used to know some verses|fitting the most terrible situations.
{87420}{87544}Unfortunately I only remember|the first line:
{87619}{87668}"Také to your heels..."
{87748}{87785}Don t you know the rest?
{87807}{87884}No.|But the abbé might.
{88440}{88500}...she was dancing|in the circus Ferdinand
{88502}{88539}with a pear in her mouth.
{88564}{88642}People called it eccentric|and I do think
{88644}{88682}it was far from becoming.
{88726}{88796}Fresch lips need no ornament.
{89559}{89595}Oh, major
{90584}{90708}Displaying the mechanism of her joints|and the ontraction-of her muscular
{90769}{90839}system|Anna is the personification
{90866}{90929}of all that constitutes|the roots of theatrical art
{90972}{91093}a glorification of God|who created men in his own image.
{93555}{93591}Anna!
{95679}{95728}Where have you been?
{95735}{95810}I stopped at the swimming-bath|it is in shambles!
{95826}{95863}What have you been doing?
{95954}{96006}Oh, you have come for your things.
{96016}{96105}Také them and get out of here!
{96108}{96153}I decided to forgive you.
{96165}{96230}You got your desert|for you faithlesspess
{96242}{96302}living for three days|in an untidy, neglected home
{96304}{96360}without proper meals|and a good night s rest.
{96438}{96504}I can no longer be|angry whith you, Anonín.
{96545}{96596}So much the better.
{96623}{96694}But my defects|are past remedy.
{96766}{96853}Today I saw a woman|washing linen in the river.
{96878}{96985}She was not as pretty as Anna|and yet I felt
{96987}{97052}I had not changed.|Silence!
{97122}{97193}You may stay|but mind your tongue!
{97270}{97331}Oh, how beatiful...
{101400}{101455}Look where you hit|you might hurt my girl.
{101481}{101549}Your girl?|Your girl?
{101558}{101594}Have you lost you senses?
{101596}{101654}No, because Anna stays here|and you go away.
{101847}{101924}Let us be lenient|with the weekness of our friends.

{101972}{102009}Don t kill the major!
{103132}{103168}Are you all right?
{104474}{104598}This morning the magician|beat me up with his wand.
{104742}{104830}I have still more reason|for complaining.

My name is Sakura Nishi,
I left Japan for China in May, 1939
I was assigned to the
Tienstin Army Hospital
Nurse Taniguchi and you four, surgery.
Nurse Nishi and you three, general medicine.
Nishi.
Half of your patients are serious.
The rest are not.
They're mainly TB and mentally ill patients.
Some aren't sick at all.
Be careful.
Many can demonstrate a fever by agitating the thermometer.
Mental patients who've recovered pretend their sick.
They prefer being here to manning the front lines.
Seeing through their lies is your job.
You'll be with them every day.
Understand?
Outwardly it's just like a military hospital in Japan.
But in fact it's a field hospital.
You're new here?
Where was your last post?
After graduating I spent three years a Tokyo Army Hospital.
Born in Tokyo?
Me too.
From the Kiba area.
So, your family is in the lumber trade?
Grandfather was,
I don't remember.
Why not?
Father died before
I was born.
Mother also, when I was two.
An aunt raised me.
How old are you?
I'm 24.
I'm Pvt. Sakamoto, also from
Tokyo. Be good to me.
Tokyo, eh?
Damn it!
I wish I was back there.
Nishi, time to make your rounds.
Stop it!
I'll scream!
Go ahead.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No use fighting back.
Everyone's bored.
They'll enjoy the show.
I reported everything the next night.
I see.
Pvt. Sakamoto again?
You're his third victim.
He isn't fully recovered, but this can't go on!
Hello, Nurse.
I'm being sent back to the front line.
A death sentence.
Congratulate me.
Thanks for everything.
Good luck.
I really enjoyed it.
Next time it's my turn.
Stuck here all day.
A man needs a woman.
My next posting, two months later, was even worse.
Hell couldn't be much worse.
It was a front line hospital.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Bullet wound.
He's dead.
Surgery.
Bury this one.
Amputation.
Dead.
Put my foot back on!
Forget it, son.
Amputation.
All right, son.
We'll stop the pain.
No saving him.
Surgery.
Help me!
Please!
Control yourself!
Separate the dead.
Amputation.
At the thigh.
Anesthetic?
Just local.
He's a kicker, hold him down.
Idiot!
Get back here!
Mother!
All right, he's ready.
I'll sew him up.
Get me a bandage.
200 operations over three days and three nights.
Lt. Okabe, the surgeon, the medics and nurse, all went without sleep.
Arm next.
Hold him down.
More and more men were brought in.
Many died before surgery.
Some died during surgery.
Others died after the operation.
They all went to the morgue.
Get their tags or we won't know who is who.
There was a mountain of tags.
It was the end of the third day.
His pulse is strong.
He's lost too much blood.
He's a goner.
Nurse Nishi.
It's me, Sakamoto...
Save me, please!
I'm sorry about what happened.
I don't want to die!
I want to live!
I'm begging you!
Don't leave me!
Nurse Nishi!
Please don't let me die!
Don't kill me...
Doctor.
He needs a transfusion.
Anesthetic.
Only colonels and above get blood transfusions.
I know this man.
Please, Doctor.
How do you know him?
He was my patient in Tienstin for a while.
He's not kin, or even a friend?
No, sir.
We're swamped. These others have a better chance.
If you come to my quarters tonight, I'll do it for you.
Thank you, sir.
Just this once!
I didn't want him to die.
I didn't want him to think that was my revenge.
That I'd deliberately kill him.
The transfusion didn't work.
By the end of the shift he was dead.
What's up?
No pulse.
His pupils are dilated.
He's been gut shot, it kills them every time.
What a waste of precious blood.
We'll take him out.
Throw him in the pile.
One more dead!
Who is it?
Nurse Nishi.
Excuse me.
So, you really came?
Were you joking?
No, I meant it.
Pour me some wine.
The spoils of war.
The man we gave the transfusion to died.
That's no surprise.
It would've been a miracle.
I'm sorry I caused you trouble.
Don't play favorites with the patients.
Soldiers aren't human beings!
They're just weapons.
Why did you operate if you knew he'd die?
Before I was drafted,
I was a specialist surgeon.
But here I'm no doctor.
I have to decide who will live.
Whether I can save them or not.
Sometimes I long to be a doctor again.
I knew he'd die but
I did my best anyway.
The last vestiges of my professional pride made me go through the motions.
Have a drink.
You'll sleep better.
Yes, sir, I will.
How can I save truckloads of them?
Ruptured blood vessels, smashed bones...
Loss of blood or gangrene gets most of them.
We've no blood and very little medicine.
So I cut off their arms and their legs...
Even those who don't need it...
They say that I'm an expert at it.
I've cut off hundred of limbs.
I've crippled hundreds of men.
God knows how many.
But you had to save their lives.
You think they believe that?
They'd be better off dead.
What I'm doing is wicked.
I either let them die, or I cripple them. That's all.
Am I a doctor?
It's a wonder I don't go mad.
The war's to blame.
Not you. the war, eh?
As we attack, our lines get longer.
The enemy turns around and attacks our rear, where our defense are weak.
China's too big.
It's a stupid war.
But that's the Army's problem, not mine.
Get undressed.
I can't get drunk in front of a nurse.
That's an order!
Yes, sir.
There's no tomorrow on the battlefield.
We live from day to day.
What happens today, whatever we do, fades tomorrow.
You need not worry.
Now come here!
What's your first name, Nishi?
Sakura.
Sakura?
Cherry blossom?
Just think, if you live long enough, you will become a 60 or 70 year-old Sakura.
Cherry blossoms only last a few brief days.
I love my name.
I'd like to live up to my name.
Who named you?
My father.
He died before I was born.
In photographs, he looks like you.
Enough wine.
I need a shot now.
It's all in that drawer.
What kind of injection?
Never mind.
Just do as I say.
Yes, sir.
It's morphine, sir.
Hurry up. It's almost dawn.
There's no time.
I just want to sleep, to just forget everything.
Nishi, will you stay here until
I fall asleep?
Summer nights are cold here.
If you're cold, you can share my blanket.
I was exhausted.
I only wanted to sleep.
Next!
Awake?
It's noon.
You've slept for ten hours straight.
Get some more.
I must go.
They'll manage without you.
I said you're exhausted.
Doctor!
What?
Did anything happen?
You think that I took advantage of you?
You undressed me.
I didn't touch you...
Not that it matters.
What does that mean?
You wouldn't understand.
I'll go back.
We nurses went back to Tientsin in a truck with the sick and wounded.
By that time, I couldn't get
Dr. Okabe out of my mind.
Perhaps I had begun to love him.
"TIENTSIN MILITARY HOSPITAL"
How was the front line?
Do I smell?
What of?
Blood and gore. I almost scrubbed my skin off but...
Your imagination. That's how you become a real nurse.
Matron, what is Dr. Okabe really like?
He's a fine officer, an excellent surgeon.
You're in charge of surgery this time.
Nurse, can you help me urinate?
In a moment.
Why were both of your arms amputated?
The left one was blown off.
Gangrene set in on the right one, so the doctor...
Thank you.
Which doctor?
Dr. Okabe. He caught the tetanus in time. I survived.
How long have you been here?
Six months. My wounds have healed, but...
You can't return to fighting.
Going home? Have you a wife?
I shipped out two months after we married.
You want to go home, then?
Yes.
But, for some reason, I can't.
I only bother the others here.
Home will be better.
Pvt. Orihara's almost fully recovered.
He hardly feels any pain.
Why wasn't he sent home?
I wonder. But that is not our problem.
We're short of beds as it is.
It's best for him, and for us, that he goes home.
Nishi, that's quite enough!
It's not your place to make those kind of decisions.
Yes, ma'am.
I just feel sorry for him.
Nurses do not have feelings.
It's your duty to keep quiet and do your work.
I've given up.
I don't think I'll ever go home.
Never?
Thanks.
Not that I think that the war will last forever.
Why can't you go home?
A soldier who'd lost both legs was finally sent back.
They kept him hidden.
He can't even see his family.
They'll probably keep him institutionalized forever.
That's my fate, too.
But why?
If people saw me...
...they'd know how terrible war is, and hate it.
Some would think we're losing the war.
The Army brass wouldn't like that at all.
From time to time,
I wish I was dead.
You poor man.
It must be agony.
But I'm used to it now.
The one unbearable thing...
What is it?
It's...
No, never mind.
It's nothing.
Let's wipe you down.
Nurse Nishi, would you mind doing it at night?
Why? I can't show you any special favors.
I don't want the others to see me.
Tonight, after taps.
Please.
Let's do it now.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Nurse Nishi...
Can you come every night from now on?
If you want me to.
Please. I'd like you to.
You nurses...
...take care of our meals and everything.
With never a frown.
It's our duty.
But there's one thing that no one does for me.
Do you follow me?
Nurse Nishi,
I'm a man too.
I'm crippled but
I'm still healthy.
The others all can manage somehow... but I have no hands.
I'm helpless.
It's starting to drive me mad.
Do you understand?
Yes, I learned about that at nursing school.
Nurse Nishi, please save me.
Touch my body.
I beg you.
Have you asked the other nurses such a thing?
No, ma'am I've never asked anyone before.
Only you.
Nurse Nishi, I'm just filth.
I'm a hateful man.
I'm going to die without ever seeing my wife again.
Nurse Nishi, please help me!
Medicine, everything was scarce.
Poor Dr. Okabe could only amputate arms and legs.
However trivial, I decided I'd try to ease his burden...
...in my own way.
Nurse Nishi, am I asking too much?
Not at all.
Thank you.
You're the only one who cared to save me.
You poor, unfortunate man.
Nurse Nishi, please let me kiss you.
Just once is enough.
Sakura
I want to touch your body.
I don't mind, but...
Since I lost my hands...
...my toes have become very sensitive.
I can feel with them just like my hands.
So...
So?
Please.
Let me put my foot between your legs.
Please!
Alright.
I'm glad.
I'm very happy.
Go out for a walk?
Yes, he can manage.
I think it will be good for him.
But all alone?
I'll escort him.
I'm off today.
I see.
All right, then.
We can't do much else for him.
Have him wear a coat...
...so his arms won't be too obvious.
Treat him to something nice.
What is it?
Where are we going?
Let's find a hotel.
Just leave everything to me.
Let's take a bath together.
Together?
I'll wash you.
You can look at me all you want to.
Do anything you like.
Tell me anything you want me to do for you.
Why are you doing this for me?
No particular reason.
I have no arms...
...but I can do things to make up for it.
But this won't happen again.
It's the last time.
Yes.
Probably.
Remember it.
I'll never forget what happened today.
I'm truly very happy.
Nishi, Private Orihara committed suicide.
How?
He has no arms!
He jumped from the roof.
Fractured skull.
He died instantly.
I can't believe it.
This was found under his pillow.
Used his mouth to write it, I guess.
It's to you.
I haven't told anyone else.
Sakura, I'll never meet anyone like you again.
So, there's no point in living.
Thank you and good-bye, Orihara.
Will you inform his family?
He'll be listed as killed in action.
And receive a promotion to
Private First Class.
I believe I killed him.
I tried to help him, but
I tortured him instead.
It does not concern you!
In war it's each for himself or there's no surviving it!
Forget him as soon as you can.
There's too much to forget.
I can never forget.
Pvt. Sakamuto and then Pvt. Orihara.
I killed them both.
A month later...
...we five nurses were transferred back to the front lines.
I'm back again.
Been keeping well, sir?
Again?
It seems you and I are fated.
You've been promoted.
Congratulations.
The more people we kill...
...the more stars they give us.
It's a strange life.
Is there a major battle
Yes, Chang Kai-shek and his allies made an attack.
Our Army is stretched very thin.
They were cut to pieces.
The wounded are arriving in droves.
You have experience.
I'll have you removing bullets.
Can we manage?
We have to!
A handful of Japanese soldiers are pitted against all of China.
It's no easy war.
The wounded will increase...
...we're badly undermanned here.
You'll have to work twice as hard.
If not, good men will die.
Yes, sir!
We will, sir!
The wounded are arriving, sir!
Be right there.
Water!
Give me water!
Be careful!
No dead in here!
The bullet is still in there.
Remove it.
We began operating...
...and did so for two days and two nights.
I, alone, removed 160 bullets.
Can't save him.
He's cut to pieces.
He's lost too much blood.
Do you know why the enemy did this?
No, sir.
He swallowed this.
It's a secret code.
A communications man.
No time to burn it, so he swallowed it.
They cut him open to get it.
While he was still alive?
Yes.
A fine soldier.
You did your duty well.
A hero's death.
He's dead. Sew him up and ship him out.
Shrapnel in the lower back.
I'll have to operate.
Anesthetic.
I've changed my mind.
Close him up.
Next patient.
Why did he stop?
A waste of anesthetic.
Something different about him today.
The third night, after all of the soldiers had been treated.
Nishi?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Yes, sir.
Sit and have a drink.
May I ask a question, sir?
What is it?
Why didn't you operate after the anesthetic?
Officers need not explain to lower ranks.
I'll explain, though you probably won't understand.
Why's that, sir?
You're a woman, but you have no marital experience, right?
What's marriage got to do with it?
He was wounded in the sacrum.
Here.
All the sensitive nerves...
...that govern sex are located there.
If I operated on those damaged nerves...
...what would be the result?
He'd lose his masculinity.
Forever!
It made me think.
If it doesn't fester, he has a chance to live.
If a good doctor operates back home...
...he may leave the nerves intact.
So, I changed my mind.
I see.
I have no confidence in the work I'm doing here.
It's all wrong.
I kill those who'd recover, men better off dead, live as cripples.
But... to men, becoming impotent...
...is worse than being crippled.
I'm tired. Give me a morphine shot.
I want some sleep.
Stay until I fall asleep...
...like you did last time.
Hold me, if you want to.
Yes, if I'll do, sir.
I wouldn't ask anyone else.
Will you stay 'till morning?
Don't worry.
You'll be safe with me.
I won't even touch you.
Why not?
These days, I have no interest in women at all.
We're in different worlds.
I only want to sleep.
But why, sir?
You really want to know?
Yes, I do.
Alright, then.
I'll tell you.
Since I started using morphine...
...I'm not a man any more.
I haven't been for a long time.
You have a wife, don't you?
She died three years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Please stop using morphine.
Why?
I want to be in your arms.
What?
I think I love you.
I want you to touch me.
You love me?
What a strange girl.
You resemble my father.
A substitute, am I?
No! I really love you.
Sorry, I can't give up the morphine.
Why not?
I'm a doctor.
But I can't do anything here.
Without the drugs,
I can't go on living.
It's the same for soldiers.
They kill and pass it off as patriotism. That helps...
There are so many things that I'd like to forget.
Nishi, it's no use talking.
Just give me the shot.
Then get into bed.
Yes, sir.
I missed you.
I really did.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
You swine!
Letting maggots hatch!
What's the matter?
He removed a bandage and let flies settle on it.
Now it's festered!
Why did you do that?
He was afraid of being sent back.
He wants to be sent home!
What if you lose your leg?
It's better than dying!
My wife gave birth after I shipped out.
I've never seen my son!
Dr. Okabe wants to see you immediately.
I'm off to the front lines.
One doctor, two nurses...
...and three medics.
We leave tomorrow morning.
Were you ordered to?
Yes.
It's a tough battle.
Only one doctor there...
He can't cope alone.
It's an emergency.
So, it's goodbye for a while.
Please take me with you.
It's too dangerous.
You could be killed.
No! I don't want to leave you!
Why not?
I love you!
Love?
Do as you like.
But don't expect a life together.
This is war.
We could die any day.
I wonder.
The only way is to regard everyone as strangers.
So stay.
Matron said that too.
But I refuse.
It's an order!
I refuse!
You disobey orders?
I do.
A traitor to Japan.
I'm afraid of one thing more than anything.
That is working and dying apart from you.
Don't worry. I'll be back.
Wait for me.
No, please take me with you.
You're stubborn.
Who else, then?
Nurse Tsuruzaki.
She's new and inexperienced.
I'll take care of her.
Even further from Japan.
It doesn't bother me.
Ever nearer to death.
I don't care.
Are you ready to die?
The cherry blossom has such a short life.
The sooner the better.
Halt!
Is Dr. Okabe here?
Yes. What is it?
Your new orders, sir.
Go ahead.
You're to stay with us until further orders.
We're in your hands.
We'll escort you there, sir.
Good man.
We're here, sir.
Excuse the men, ma'am.
It's their first sight of
Japanese nurses.
They're ecstatic.
Time to head back.
I'm Lt. Ishida, in command of this outpost.
Please be seated.
Our headquarters are fifty kilometers from here.
The enemy has begun a massive attack.
They broke through our lines.
We've been cut off.
I see. So that's why our journey was cut short.
Yes, sir.
The enemy are better equipped and outnumber us.
We're unable to break through.
We're surrounded?
Yes, they've attacked twice.
A mobile squad helped fight them off.
Just one platoon here?
Yes, equipped with four light machine guns.
That's all we have.
Any civilian Chinese?
A handful of children and the elderly.
Doctor!
A 'comfort woman' has diarrhea.
I suspect cholera.
Please examine her.
Attention!
It's cholera all right.
She's badly dehydrated.
Quarantine her and give warm water for 48 hours.
She may pull through.
How many comfort women here?
Two more, sir.
They may have it, too.
Isolate them.
Disinfect this hut thoroughly.
It's off limits to the men!
Cholera?
That's one more enemy.
Is there nothing we can do?
No drug beats cholera.
Just isolation and disinfection.
Ideally, raze the village and withdraw.
That's impossible.
This is a strategic point.
We're ordered to...
...hold it at any cost.
In any case, the cholera must be contained.
Otherwise we all die.
Issue the men an acid gargle before meals.
The soldiers want the women who aren't sick.
Here they are.
Back to your cribs.
No! They're in quarantine.
How about you, then?
Much more fun!
Stop it! Nurses aren't comfort women!
You're hungry, aren't you?
Hungry for a man!
I'll pleasure you.
You animal.
This is the front. We either kill men, screw women...
...or eat rations. That's all!
We get what we can while we're still alive.
You idiots!
You want to die of cholera?
Get out!
You doctors get your pick of nurses. We don't!
Twelve men and two comfort women are infected now.
That's seven dead.
How does it look?
There will be more.
The problem is that we lost half of our fighting strength.
If they attack, we'll be wiped out.
Sir, all of the remaining
Chinese civilians have slipped away.
Afraid of the cholera?
No doubt some spies too.
Spies?
They must have introduced the cholera virus.
They fed something to her.
So the enemy knows out exact disposition?
Yes. Expect an attack any time.
Contact HQ.
Ask for reinforcements.
We can't, sir.
Our radio gear is down.
Send a courier.
To certain death?
We're surrounded.
No one could through alive.
We're expecting a truck tomorrow morning.
We'll just have to wait.
What's the matter, sir?
I've caught it.
Sergeant, a signal!
That's bad.
They'll attack tonight.
The doctor's asking for you.
Go at once.
Take a break, nurse.
You've worked all night.
We'll take over.
Nurse Tsuruzaki.
Nishi?
Yes, sir.
Enter.
Nurse Nishi reporting for duty, sir.
What's the latest count?
Four new cases, sir.
If I catch it,
I'll give it to you.
Same thing if you get it.
Why did you summon me, sir?
It's time for my shot.
I refuse.
But I need it.
Nishi, that's an order!
Morphine is only for the most critical of patients.
I'm starting to suffer from withdrawal symptoms.
Soon the fits will come.
I don't want the others to see me half-crazed.
Please.
Go get the morphine!
If you don't quit now, it will effect your brain.
Your heart will weaken, and you'll die.
I'm better off dead.
It's also the drugs that are keeping us apart.
Please give it up.
What would I gain?
You'd gain me.
You're a woman.
Yes, the woman who loves you.
How do I quit?
Please do as I say...
...as if I were a superior officer.
You're ordering me to quit?
I'll tie you up and do what I have to do.
Tie me up?
Yes.
We're caught between cholera and the enemy.
This could be our last night.
Be my superior officer tonight.
Do what you must.
But don't let anyone in.
The Captain is down with cholera.
I'll take over the command.
I expect an attack tonight.
Man your positions!
Just tonight...
They'll attack tonight.
The truck comes tomorrow.
We must not surrender the village!
Nurse Nishi...
Nishi.
You had it tough...
I'm over it now.
Untie me.
How long was I thrashing?
Five hours.
Two more have got it!
Please love me as a woman.
Please love me.
I can't.
I want to be a real woman.
Not just a doll.
Make love to me.
I can't.
I'm not a man any more.
No! That's all in your mind.
Without the morphine, you can.
Nishi, touch me.
That's what I am.
Do you understand now?
I can't love you.
No, you're all right.
Hold me close, as tight as you can.
It's no use.
Don't give up.
You can do it.
No. I'll never return to my old self.
You can.
I know you can.
It's Oh-One Hundred Hours.
Not long until dawn.
Hold out till then!
Their small arms don't frighten me.
But, if they bring in mortars, we're all dead.
I can hardly believe it,
Nishi.
Nurse Nishi has won.
I'm myself again.
It's like a miracle.
Please say that you love your
Sakura cherry blossom.
You want me to say that I love you?
I want you all to myself.
You already have.
Your heart, too.
Not in wartime, no.
There's only fleeting pleasure.
Not for me.
I don't want to be a passing fancy.
I want to be your true lover.
I have no heart to offer you now.
Then I'll look for it.
It's Oh-Two Hundred Hours, already.
Another three hours and we'll be safe.
They like to attack at dawn!
Be alert!
Sakura.
I love you. Now I can say it truthfully.
I'll never let you go.
Tonight we reached our greatest ecstasy.
Though by tomorrow, we may be dead.
You don't mind that?
This is all that's important to me now.
Get me the wine.
It's my last bottle.
Let's drink a toast.
I didn't know that military women were so sweet.
Military women?
I mean you nurses.
Put on my uniform.
Becoming?
Yes, wonderful.
A fine officer!
The boots.
Would they salute me if I went out?
First, they'd laugh.
The sword and gun.
I'm afraid not.
Dr. Okabe, pour wine for your superior.
Here, Major.
Sergeant!
What is it?
The enemy!
I prefer being a woman.
Then let me give you some pleasure.
I can hear your heart thumping.
It's the wine.
Nishi.
I wish we'd met in
Japan in peacetime.
They're attacking.
The enemy.
There's no escape.
Will you die with me?
Yes!
By your side.
I'm 40 years old.
A long life, yet short too.
I guess this is the end.
I can die happy.
Because I love you.
Your mark, Sakura?
I'll give you one.
Where?
The same place as yours.
Thanks to you,
I can die like a soldier.
Don't cry for me.
Enemy attack, sir!
Follow me!
Stay here!
Head down!
Hold your fire!
It's still too dark.
Don't waste ammo!
Wait 'till they're close.
What's the situation?
We're surrounded, sir.
They're using mortars to soften us up.
Before they attack.
It doesn't look good.
But it's an hour 'till dawn.
There's a slim chance!
Good!
We're soldiers, too!
Orderlies and nurses will fight!
Fire!
Give 'em all you've got!
Pull yourself together, nurse!
Protect your patients!
Here they come!
Dig in!
Sergeant’s dead, sir!
I'll take command.
Fight! Fire at least one shot before you die!
I'm scared!
You'll fight!
I'm too scared!
Come back!
Go get her!
She's gone crazy!
No, that'd be suicide.
I've killed yet again.
She's my third victim.
Nogami!
Somehow, I survived.
Not even a scratch.
Anybody still alive?
Halt!
Who goes there?
Army nurse!
We're reinforcements.
We routed them. You're safe now.
Stay back!
We have a cholera epidemic.
Cholera!
Send medical personnel immediately.
Any other survivors?
I don't know.
The cholera and the fighting took most of them.
I understand.
Wait here.
Nurse Tsuruzaki!
Forgive me.
This is how I will end up, too.
The bodies were stripped of their clothing.
Weapons, clothing, boots...
They took everything that they could possibly use.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Dr. Okabe!
The End.
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE!
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE,
WILL YOU?
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!
YOU LISTEN TO THIS.
Man: DEAR SIR,
THERE IS MONEY, A LARGE SUM,
DUE TO ME FROM THE SALE OF MY
PEDIGREE CATTLE IN THE ARGENTINE,
AND THERE IS ALSO MONEY TO COME
FROM THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY,
WHO HAVE CHARTERED
4 OF MY TANKERS-
IN ALL, ABOUT £40,000.
WHEN THIS COMES,
NATURALLY I WILL HAVE NO MORE
NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
AND WILL RETURN MY ORDER BOOK,
REFERENCE NUMBER 86-27946.
I WILL ALSO PAY
TO THE GOVERNMENT £10,000,
WHICH SHOULD MORE THAN COVER
ANYTHING I HAVE RECEIVED,
THE BALANCE TO GO
TO THE TREASURY
TO BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE
THE PRIME MINISTER WISHES.
MY SOLICITORS, MESSRS. KEAN,
DUNCAN, AND McKENZIE,
WILL BE DEALING
WITH THESE MATTERS.
MEANWHILE, AS YOU ARE AWARE,
THE POWERS THAT BE
HAVE AGAIN INCREASED
THE RATES,
AND THEY ARE DEMANDING FROM ME
IMMEDIATE PAYMENT
OF 10 SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE-
ALSO, SIXPENCE MORE EVERY WEEK.
I ENCLOSE THEIR ACCOUNT
FOR YOU TO SEE.
I CAN'T PAY IT.
Woman: YOURS RESPECTFULLY,

REFERENCE NUMBER 86-27946.
Man: P.S.
I NEED A PAIR OF SHOES.
THE ONES I HAVE
LET IN THE RAIN.
Man: GOOD MORNING, MRS. ROSS.
WELL, WHAT'S THE LATEST?
ARE THEY STILL AT IT?
YES. GOOD MORNING,
SERGEANT.
YES. THEY WERE LISTENING THIS MORNING.
WELL, I'VE BEEN
THINKING, YOU KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU GET RID OF
THAT WIRELESS SET OF YOURS?
THAT'S THE ANSWER.
YES. YES, BUT WHAT
ABOUT THE PIPES
AND ALL THE OTHER
THINGS?
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THEM.
WELL, IT ALL
TAKES TIME, YOU KNOW.
WE HAVE GOT
A MAN ON IT FULL-TIME.
IS HE OUT NOW?
OH, YES. HE'S ALWAYS
ON THE JOB, IS MAIGRET.
ONE OF THE BEST
WE'VE GOT.
YES, BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING NEW.
THEY'VE HAD
A KEY CUT,
AND THEY GET IN WHEN
I'M OUT VISITING FRIENDS
AND GO THROUGH
MY PRIVATE PAPERS.
IS THAT SO? WELL,
I MUST MAKE NOTE OF THAT.
YOU SEE, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE DOLANS.
THE DOLANS WENT
SOME WEEKS AGO,
AND INDIANS ARE NOW LIVING IN THE HOUSE.
ONE OF THEM
HAS A BEARD,
AND THERE'S
A WHITE WOMAN
WHO MAY BE HELD AGAINST
HER WILL. I DON'T KNOW.
YES. WELL,
WE'LL CHANGE OUR LINE
OF INVESTIGATION,
MRS. ROSS.
I'LL PUT
THE VICE SQUAD ONTO IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR LETTING US KNOW.
I'M VERY MUCH OBLIGED,
AND HAPPY NEW YEAR.

IN HIS LOVING ARMS
AND CLEANSE YOU
WITH HIS BLESSED SPIRIT!
GOD BLESS YOU, LAD. THAT'S RIGHT
- SEND OUT A MESSAGE.
HALLELUJAH!
HALLELUJAH!
HALLELUJAH! PRAISE THE LORD!
SIT DOWN,
YOU DOZY OLD COW.
HALLELUJAH!
Man: QUIET! QUIET!
NO ONE WILL GET
ANYTHING TO EAT IN HERE TODAY
UNLESS THIS NOISE
IS STOPPED IMMEDIATELY!
NOW SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN, ALL OF YOU.
AREN'T YOU ASHAMED
OF YOURSELVES?
AREN'T YOU?
Congregation: YES.
Man: NOW YOU WILL ALL
SING A HYMN.
THEN YOU WILL GET
YOUR SOUP. UNDERSTAND?
Congregation: YES, SIR.
RIGHT.

MRS. ROSS,
OVER HERE, PLEASE.
HELLO, MRS. ROSS.
I GOT YOUR LETTER.
YOU'VE GOT 10 AND 6, I THINK IT WAS,
TO PAY AT ONCE.
IS THAT RIGHT?
YES, AND I WANT
A PAIR OF SHOES.
YES, ALL RIGHT. WELL,
YOU GET THE 10 AND 6 NOW,
AND YOU MUST GO DOWN AND PAY
THE BILL AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
WILL YOU DO THAT?
YES. I'LL DO IT
TOMORROW MORNING
AFTER I'VE DONE
MY CHARITY WORK.
GOOD. YOU DO THAT.
WELL, NOW,
ABOUT THE SHOES.
I'LL SEND SOMEONE
TO SEE YOU
BEFORE THE END
OF THE WEEK.
TRY AND STAY AT HOME
IN THE MORNINGS, WILL YOU?
I SOMETIMES HAVE TO GO OUT QUITE EARLY
IN CONNECTION WITH PERSONAL MATTERS-
TO SEE MY LAWYER
AND SO ON.
OH, I KNOW, YES, BUT IF
YOU COULD JUST STAY AT HOME
IN THE MORNING
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS,
IT WOULD BE A GREAT HELP TO ME, YOU SEE.
VERY WELL,
MR. CONRAD.
ONE NEVER MINDS OBLIGING
A REAL GENTLEMAN.
MY HUSBAND, ALTHOUGH HIS QUALITIES
WEREN'T APPARENT
TO EVERYBODY,
HAD THE MAKINGS
OF A GENTLEMAN.
YOU SEE, I MARRIED
BENEATH ME.
DO YOU EVER HEAR
FROM YOUR SON?
HE SENT ME
A HUGE BUNCH
OF FLOWERS
YESTERDAY-ROSES.
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.
WELL, THAT WAS
NICE OF HIM.
HE NEVER FORGETS.
ARE YOU THERE?
Man: THIS IS PRECISELY
WHAT WE, AS A PARTY,
SHALL BE LOOKING TO
IN THE FUTURE
AND PAYING STRICT
REGARD TO, MOREOVER.
WE ARE NOT A PARTY
THAT PAYS LIP-SERVICE
TO THE OLD-AGE PENSIONER
AT ELECTION TIME
AND THEN
CONVENIENTLY FORGETS.
THE PROBLEM, THE MAJOR
PROBLEM OF OLD AGE,
IS UNDOUBTEDLY
LONELINESS.
A GREAT MANY OLD PEOPLE
LIVE ENTIRELY ALONE,
UNVISITED
AND UNWANTED,
LIVING DAY IN AND DAY
OUT IN SMALL ROOMS,
WITHOUT
COMPANY OR FRIENDS.
POOR OLD SOULS.
WE ARE GOING TO BE
THEIR FRIENDS,
AND I PUT IT TO YOU...
THAT AT THE NEXT
ELECTION,
WE SHALL ALL GO FORWARD
AND CAST OUR VOTES
IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT
I HAVE SAID HERE TODAY
AND WILL-
NOW, YOU LEAVE ME ALONE.
DO YOU HEAR UP THERE?
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!
YOU GET AWAY FROM THERE.
DO YOU HEAR?
YOU GET AWAY!
YOU GET AWAY FROM THERE.
LET ME IN.
IT'S ME.
I KNOW WHO IT IS.
I KNOW.
YOU GO AWAY FROM THERE, DO YOU HEAR?
BUT IT'S ME, MUM-
CHARLIE.
WHO?
CHARLIE.
CHARLIE WHO?
CHARLIE, MUM.
YOUR CHARLIE. YOUR SON.
BUT YOUR FATHER
ISN'T AT HOME.
HE HASN'T BEEN AT HOME
FOR 20 YEARS,
YOU STUPID OLD MARE.
I DIDN'T COME
TO SEE DAD, MUM.
I CAME TO SEE YOU,
DARLING.
WHAT FOR?
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.
WHAT?
A PRESENT.
HELLO, MUM.
WHERE IS IT?
WHAT, DARLING?
IS THAT IT?
THIS? OH,
THE PRESENT, YOU MEAN.
NO, NO,
THIS ISN'T IT.
WHERE IS IT, THEN?
IT'S A SURPRISE.
LET ME IN, AND I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
YOU CAN'T STAY
THE NIGHT.
I HAVEN'T GOT THE GUEST ROOM MADE UP.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT ON THE SCROUNGE.
I JUST WANT TO COME IN
AND SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE OR TWO.
THAT'S ALL.
I CAN PAY A VISIT
TO ME OWN MOTHER, CAN'T I?
YES.
WELL, HERE WE ARE,
THEN.
BEEN TO A WEDDING,
HAVE YOU?
YOU'VE GOT
CONFETTI IN YOUR HAIR.
CONFETTI?
YES.
AH, FORGET IT.
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING TO
STAND HERE ALL NIGHT, ARE WE?
LET'S GO INTO THE IDEAL HOME EXHIBITION.
YOU CAN PUT YOUR BROOM
DOWN. YOU DON'T NEED THAT.
IT'S NOT FULL MOON.
COR. BLIMEY.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
IN HERE, THEN?
Margaret:
DONE?
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU...
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU...
LOOK, HERE'S
A COUPLE OF QUID.
BUY YOURSELF-
GET YOURSELF-
WHEN'S
YOUR BIRTHDAY?
GO AND SPEND IT
ON SOMETHING-
SOAP OR SOMETHING.
THANK YOU, CHARLIE. YOU
ALWAYS WERE A GOOD BOY.
YES. WELL, DON'T
GET HYSTERICAL.
LOOK, I'M GOING
TO THE ROOM, MUM.
I'M NOT LEAVING. I JUST
WANT TO GET SOMETHING.
I'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.
MAKE US A CUP OF TEA OR SOMETHING.
OH.
HMM.
DID YOU GET IT?
WHAT?
WHAT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR?
NO. IT DOESN'T
MATTER NOW.
WHAT WAS IT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WELL, I'M GOING TO
GO NOW.
OH, I'VE JUST POURED YOU A CUP OF TEA.
OH, I'M SORRY. I JUST
LOOKED AT THE TIME,
AND IT'S LATE.
I'LL SEE YOU,
THEN.
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR
FATHER FOR QUITE A TIME.
WELL, THAT'S NO GREAT LOSS, IS IT?
I'LL BE OFF THEN,
ALL RIGHT?
CHARLIE.
WHAT?
WHERE'S YOUR PARCEL?
WHAT PARCEL?
YOU HAD IT
UNDER YOUR ARM.
OH, THE PARCEL.
I LEFT IT OUT HERE.
I'LL PICK IT UP
ON THE WAY OUT.
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF,
THEN.
SHALL I SEE YOU?
YES. I'LL BE BACK AGAIN SOON
- ABOUT A WEEK.
CHARLIE.
CHARLIE.
WON'T...
WON'T KEEP HOT
FOR A WEEK.
CAN YOU DENY THAT?
DIDN'T HE GIVE ME MONEY?
WHAT?
I DIDN'T ASK FOR IT.
HE GAVE IT.
STICKS AND STONES,
THAT'S ALL IT IS.
Man: YOU WANT TO MIND YOUR
MANNERS, YOU STUPID BITCH!
Woman: WHO NEEDS IT?
Man:
WELL, GET LOST!
AND YOU!
OH, I BEG
YOUR PARDON.
OH, EXCUSE ME.
MISS, MISS, MISS.
MRS. ROSS-
DOES SHE LIVE HERE?
SOME OLD BIRD
WHO LIVES DOWN THERE?
WHY DON'T YOU KNOCK
AND FIND OUT?
THANKS.
I COULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF THAT MYSELF.
WHY DIDN'T MR. CONRAD
COME HIMSELF?
AH, WELL, HE'S, UH,
BUSY, YOU SEE,
SO I DO
HIS OUTSIDE CALLS.
UM, YOU'VE-YOU'VE
GOT ANOTHER ROOM
APART FROM THIS,
HAVE YOU?
YES.
UH, MAY I SEE IT?
JUST ROUTINE.
WHILE I'M HERE,
YOU KNOW,
BUT IT DOESN'T
MATTER.
THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE ROOM.
NO-OH, THAT'S FINE,
THEN. UH...
JUST A QUICK LOOK
WHILE I'M HERE, EH?
THIS WAY, IS IT?
YOU READ A LOT,
DON'T YOU, MRS. ROSS?
YES. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A GREAT READER.
WE ALWAYS HAD A LIBRARY
AT THE OLD HOUSE.
I SEE. FOND OF
A GOOD READ MYSELF,
BOOKS AND THAT.
OF COURSE, YOU, UH...
UH, EVER THOUGHT OF GETTING
RID OF THOSE OLD NEWSPAPERS?
THEY CLUTTER UP THE
PLACE A BIT, DON'T THEY?
I LIKE TO KEEP THEM...
FOR REFERENCE.
YES, YES.
OF COURSE, THEY'RE A
BIT DANGEROUS, YOU KNOW,
IF THERE'S A FIRE
OR ANYTHING.
I'M VERY CAREFUL.
WELL, DIRTY, TOO.
THEY COLLECT THE DUST.
WELL, I KEEP THEM.
I MIGHT WANT TO
LOOK AT SOMETHING.
YES. WELL, RIGHT.
RIGHT. NOW ABOUT
THOSE SHOES YOU WANT-
IS THAT THE ONLY
PAIR YOU HAVE?
JUST THESE. I-
I CAUGHT IT
ON SOMETHING.
YES. YES, WELL, FINE.
YES. WE CAN MANAGE TO
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE.
OH, YES. WE'LL SEE YOU
WITHIN A DAY OR TWO
ABOUT THESE.
I'D LIKE A NICE STYLE, THOUGH
- NOTHING RACY.
# JELLY ON THE PLATE,
JELLY ON THE PLATE #
# WIGGLE WAGGLE,
WIGGLE WAGGLE #
# JELLY ON THE PLATE #
Woman: OH, NO! I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING TO DO
THE WASHING UP
WHILE I WAS OUT.
Man: YOU'VE BEEN GONE
ALL AFTERNOON.
Woman: HAVE I?
LOOK AT THIS PLACE!
I SAID
I WOULD CLEAN IT.
YOU SIT DOWN HERE ALL DAY.
WHAT DO I DO?
I HAVE TO GO OUT
AND EARN SOME MONEY
WHILE YOU BLOODY WELL
SIT THERE, SIT THERE,
JUST SITTING AROUND THE HOUSE ALL
DAY WATCHING THE BLOODY TELEVISION!
I WAS GOING TO
LOOK FOR A JOB.
YOUNG LADY.
YOUNG LADY!
YES? WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU ESCAPE?
DO WHAT?
ESCAPE. TAKE A CHANCE.
RUN AWAY NOW!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? RUN AWAY? WHO FROM?
FROM THAT VILE MAN WHO'S
HOLDING YOU AGAINST YOUR WILL.
AGAINST MY WHAT?
I KNOW. I KNOW HOW
HE TREATS YOU.
YOU GO TO THE POLICE,
AND YOU'LL GET PROTECTION.
WHAT HAVE I GOT TO
BE PROTECTED FROM?
FROM HIM!
FROM THAT INDIAN.
NOW LISTEN.
LISTEN. YOU MIND YOUR OWN
SODDING BUSINESS.
NOBODY ASKED YOUR ADVICE,
SO DON'T GIVE IT.
OH, AND THE OTHER NIGHT, YOU WAS BASHING
ON THE CEILING WITH SOMETHING, WEREN'T YOU?
WELL, YOU CAN LAY OFF
THAT FOR A START!
OTHERWISE, I'M TELLING YOU, I'LL COME
DOWN HERE, I'LL BASH YOUR DOOR IN,
AND ONCE I'M IN, I'M JUST AS
LIKELY TO BASH YOU IN, TOO.
KEEP YOUR BLEEDING NOSE OUT OF IT, ELSE
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'LL NEED PROTECTING!
Man: WHO YOU TALKING TO DOWN THERE?
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU! SO
YOU GET THE MESSAGE, DO YOU?
DON'T YOU START GIVING ME
THAT POLICE STUFF, EITHER.
OTHERWISE, I'LL BE THE ONE
WHO'LL GO TO THE POLICE.
THEY'LL CART YOU OFF TO
THE BLEEDING NUT-HOUSE.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
OUT OF SIGHT. I'LL PUT THEM OUT OF
SIGHT TILL I GET THEM SORTED OUT.
HE WON'T LOOK
IN THE CUPBOARDS.
OOH. WHAT'S THAT?
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE.
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?
FUNNY SORT OF PARCEL.
I DON'T REMEMBER...
OH, GOD.
OHH.
OH, MY GOD.
PUT IT IN THE DRAWER.
ARE YOU THERE?
Conrad:
DEAR MR. CONRAD,
I AM GLAD TO TELL YOU THAT
MY-MY MONEY HAS ARRIVED AT LAST,
AND I WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO
ACCEPT CHARITY OR INSULTS.
Margaret: NOT MEANING YOU,
OF COURSE-
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
A GENTLEMAN-
BUT ANOTHER SO-CALLED CIVIL
SERVANT WHO WAS FAR FROM CIVIL,
ALTHOUGH PAID OUT OF TAXES
THAT ARE RUINING THE FEW PEOPLE OF
GOOD BIRTH AND BREEDING THAT ARE LEFT.
Conrad: I WILL NOT NOW
HAVE TO GET RID OF-
TO USE HIS OWN
COARSE EXPRESSION-
OF THE PAPERS AND BOOKS
I HAVE COLLECTED FOR MANY YEARS.
BEING A READER, WHH ISARE THESE
DAYS, WHEN VERY FEW ARE EDUCATED,
ALTHOUGH SO MUCH IS SPENT ON
SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS, ET CETERA,
AND THERE IS SO MUCH IGNORANCE EVEN
AMONGST SO-CALLED CIVIL SERVANTS-
NOT REFERRING TO YOU.
Margaret: MR. CONRAD,
AS I SAID ALREADY,
I HAVE NO COMPLAINT ABOUT YOU, BUT
ONLY GRATITUDE AND KIND THOUGHTS.
Conrad: I MAY GO ABROAD
FOR THE WINTER
TO THE UNIQUE CHARMS
OF THE UNSPOILT BAHAMAS,
AND SO I WILL NOT NEED MY
NATIONAL ASSISTANCE BOOK ANYMORE,
AND I WILL RETURN IT LATER TODAY
WITH THANKS FOR PAST FAVORS.
Margaret: P.S.: I ENCLOSE A POUND
FOR YOU TO BUY A PRESENT FOR YOURSELF.
WOMAN TOOK AN EPILEPTIC FIT
JUST BEFORE YOU COME IN.
THEY TOOK HER
IN ANOTHER ROOM.
Woman:
MISS CURTIS, PLEASE.
SHE'S NOT LONG FOR
THIS WORLD. TELL THAT.
YOU CAN TELL JUST BY
LOOKING AT THEM.
Man: MR. GROGAN, PLEASE.
THEY'RE BETTER OFF OUT OF
IT, REALLY, AREN'T THEY?
Conrad: WHEN ARE YOU
STARTING WORK?
Man: TOMORROW, SIR. FIRST THING.
I'M STARTING WORK FIRST THING TOMORROW.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF
YOU COULD GIVE ME A GRANT
TO GET MY WORKING BOOTS AND OVERALLS.
I'VE SEEN YOU HERE
BEFORE, HAVEN'T I?
POSSIBLY.
I DOUBT IF YOU'LL
SEE ME HERE AGAIN.
MMM. LA-DE-BLOODY-DA.
SHE JUMPED THE QUEUE.
DID YOU SEE THAT?
WHO WROTE THIS?
WHO WROTE THAT? MR.
HEWITT, SIR. THE FOREMAN.
HIS HANDWRITING BEARS A
STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO YOUR OWN.
DOES IT, SIR?
YES, VERY STRONG. WE
CAN'T GIVE YOU A GRANT.
Man: YOU CALLING ME
A LIAR?
WON THE POOLS,
HAVE YOU?
NO.
WHATHEN? YOUR HUSBAND
COME OUT OF JAIL?
CERTAINLY NOT!
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,
THEN... LADY MUCK?
NOT THAT I'M BOTHERED ABOUT YOUR
BLOODY AFFAIRS, 'CAUSE I'M NOT.
THERE'S SUCH A THING AS
GOOD MANNERS, YOU KNOW.
MY MONEY HAS ARRIVED. THAT'S
WHY I SHAN'T BE HERE AGAIN.
WHAT MONEY?
THE MONEY FROM MY LATE FATHER'S ESTATE.
YOU KIDDING?!
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
I'M NOLIKE SOME,
YOU KNOW.
THEY CAN'T BEAR ANYBODY TO HAVE
A BIT OF LUCK. JEALOUSY, ISN'T IT?
I EXPECT SO.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
SHINES IN THEIR FACES.
STILL, IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD
IT, YOU NEVER MISS IT, DO YOU?
I HAD A COUSIN, YOU KNOW,
WON THE PREMIUM BONDS.
WELL, A BIT. ONLY £25
I NEVER ASKED FOR A PENNY.
I DIDN'T BEGRUDGE IT HER.
OF COURSE,
IT DIDN'T DO HER ANY GOOD.
IT CHANGED HER,
DID IT?
NO. SHE HAD IT STOLEN.
SHE PUT IN IN HER HANDBAG.
CAN YOU CREDIT IT?
SHE DREW IT OUT OF THE POST OFFICE
AND PUT IT STRAIGHT IN HER BAG.
NO, THAT'S A LIE.
SHE SPENT A BIT.
I'LL REMEMBER YOU,
YOU BASTARD.
YOU'LL GET THE END OF A BOTTLE
IN YOUR FACE ONE OF THESE NIGHTS.
JOLLY GOOD. NOW GET AWAY
BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE.
BUT SHE HAD £10.
£10 NICKED.
I'VE GOT MORE THAN THAT
IN MY PURSE AT THIS MOMENT.
YOU HAVEN'T.
LOOK.
Conrad: MRS. ROSS.
MRS. ROSS, PLEASE.
THAT'S ME.
I MUST GO.
WELL, UH... I'LL WAIT FOR YOU,
MISSIS. YOU WON'T BE LONG, WILL YOU?
NO, I SHAN'T
BE LONG.
WHY SHOULD YOU WAIT FOR
ME? WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.
I'LL BE FRANK
WITH YOU, MISSIS:
IT'S NOT OFTEN I GET THE
CHANCE TO MEET A REAL LADY.
THIS IS A REAL
TREAT FOR ME.
I SEE. I SEE.
Conrad: MRS. ROSS,
OVER HERE, PLEASE.
OH, GOD, IT'S
COMING ON COLD.
YOU FEEL IT,
DON'T YOU,
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T GOT
WOOL NEXT TO YOUR SKIN?
YES, THERE IS
A CHILL IN THE AIR.
STILL, THEY'LL
BE OPEN SOON.
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D DO ME THE HONOR
OF JOINING ME
IN A REFRESHMENT?
OH, I NEVER DRINK.
OH, I DON'T MEAN DRINK.
I MEAN, NOT DRINK.
I WOULDN'T SUGGEST THAT
TO A LADY LIKE YOURSELF.
NO, I MEAN A... A PORT,
PERHAPS. A GLASS OF PORT.
WE CAN SIT AT A TABLE NEAR THE
FIRE AND HAVE A WARM AND A CHAT.
YOU COULDN'T TAKE HARM
AT THAT, COULD Y?
YOU CAN EAT SAUSAGES
AND MUSTARD
AND SIP YOUR PORT FRIENDLY-LIKE
AND GET IN OUT OF THE COLD.
FOR THE OCCASION,
I MEAN.
WELL, IT IS SOMETHING
OF AN OCCASION.
OF COURSE IT IS,
A LADY LIKE YOU.
HERE, LET'S GET ON THIS
BUS. I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.
I DON'T USUALLY
TRAVEL BY BUS.
NO. WELL, IT'S ALL
VARIETY, AIN'T IT?
WHERE DOES THIS BUS GO TO?
I HAVE TO BE BACK, YOU SEE.
OH, JUST THE OTHER SIDE.
JUST THE OTHER SIDE.
Conductor:
FARES, PLEASE.
TWO 5s, PLEASE.
I HAVE TO BE BACK
TO SEE MY LAWYERS.
WELL, THEY'LL WAIT. AFTER
ALL, YOU'RE PAYING THEM.
IS IT MUCH FURTHER?
NO. NEXT STOP. YOU'LL
THANK ME WHEN YOU GET THERE.
WHERE ARE WE?
OH, IT'S ON THE ESTATE,
DEAR. ON THE NEW ESTATE.
I DON'T KNOW
THIS PART OF TOWN.
NO. WELL, YOU WOULDN'T, WOULD YOU?
I EXPECT YOU WENT
EVERYWHERE WITH A CHAUFFEUR.
IT'S JUST
UP HERE, LOVE.
I... I THINK
I OUGHT TO GO HOME.
OH, IT WOULD BE A PITY
NOW, WOULDN'T IT, DEAR?
WE'RE RIGHT
ON TOP OF IT.
THEY GET A GOOD CLASS
IN HERE, YOU KNOW.
WE'LL SIT IN THAT CORNER BY THE FIRE.
GO ON, LOVE.
YOU MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE.
A LARGE PORT AND A SMALL GIN, PLEASE.
OH, I'LL HAVE
SOME SAUSAGES.
THAT'S YOURS, LOVE.
YOU DON'T MIND ME
CALLING YOU LOVE, DO YOU?
I MEAN, I'M NOT BEING FAMILIAR;
IT'S JUST FORCE OF HABIT.
NOT AT ALL.
YOU SAID
I'D HAVE A SAUSAGE.
COURSE I DID.
WHAT A MEMORY.
CAN YOU BRING
THE SAUSAGES, LOVE?
COMING.
I'LL FORGET
ME OWN NAME NEXT.
LIKE I SAID, THIS IS ONE
OF THE BETTER-CLASS PLACES.
HERE WE ARE.
IT'LL HAVE TO BE FINGERS,
I'M AFRAID,
BUT I ALWAYS THINK IT
ADDS TO IT, DON'T YOU?
WELL, OF COURSE,
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW.
YOUR FATHER,
GOD REST HIM.
WHAT TOOK HIM?
TOOK HIM?
CHEERS. YES, I MEAN,
UH... HOW DID HE PASS OVER?
HE DIED IN THE SERVICE OF OTHERS.
WELL, IT'S BETTER IF
THEY GO QUICK, ISN'T IT?
5 MONTHS, EVERY NIGHT, I WENT TO
THE HOSPITAL FOR ME MOTHER. 5 MONTHS!
OF COUE, THEY WERE ONLY KEEPING
HER ALIVE WITH TUBES, YOU KNOW.
YOU LIKE THAT,
DO YOU?
IT'S NOT UNPLEASANT.
WE ALWAYS HAVE A BIT
OF PORT AT CHRISTMAS.
YOU KNOW, FOR AFTER
THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.
IT'S VERY WARMING.
WATCH ME. BIT OF SAUSAGE,
PLENTY OF MUSTARD...
THEN WASH IT DOWN.
SO HOW ARE YOU
GIRLS DOING?
FINE, THANKS.
Margaret, unsteadily: WHEN...
WHEN MY AFFAIRS
ARE SETTLED...
PERHAP
I SHALL BE ABLE
TO OFFER YOU A PLACE
IN MY HOUSEHOLD.
AHH. GOD BLESS YOU,
LOVE.
WE LIVED...
WHEN I WAS A CHILD...
IN THE PALACE.
WHAT PALACE WAS THAT,
LOVE? CRYSTAL?
IT WAS THE BISHOP'S
PALACE.
MY FATHER WAS...
A BISHOP.
OH, WAS HE? YES.

ALL OF THE YOUNG MEN
WORE WHITE GLOVES.
OH! WE WERE
SO HAPPY.
THE CARRIAGES...

OUTSIDE NOW.
UP YOU GET.
IT WAS LIKE
A CHRISTMAS CARD.
OF COURSE. YES.
YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT.
WHERE IS THIS?
AM I HOME NOW?
YES, THIS IS HOME,
LOVE.
Margaret: I SEE YOU'VE GOT
ONE OF THEIR KEYS.
ARE YOU THERE?
YES, IN THERE,

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
WERE THEY INVITED?
HEY, GET UP.

DON'T KNOW

WHERE DO YOU THINK HE IS? YOU DON'T
NEED 2 BLOODY GUESSES FOR THAT, DO YOU?
JUST GO GET HIM AND TELL
HIM TO GET BACK HERE.
WHAT FOR?
TELL HIM I WANT HIM! TELL

A NICE SIP OF THAT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.
AFTER DINNER...
YES. WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING IN A MINUTE.
AFTER THE DINNER,
THE LADIES USED TO
LEAVE THE DINING ROOM,
AND THE GENTLEMEN
WOULD SIT WITH THEIR BRANDY
AND... SMOKED CIGARS.
THEY USED TO... SIT WITH
THEIR GLASSES AND THEIR CIGARS,
TALKING AND LAUGHING.
TALKING AND LAUGHING.
WHO IS SHE, THEN?
SHE'S DRUNK. SHE'S JUST
A DRUNKEN OLD BIDDY.
I MET HER AT THE ASSISTANCE.
SHE'S A MRS. ROSS.
10 QUID.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YES.
WELL, WHAT'D YOU
BRING HER UP HERE FOR?
SHE'LL HAVE THE POLICE
ON US IF WE TOUCH THIS.
OH, CREDIT ME WITH SOMETHING, WILL YOU?
I GIVE HER AEW DRINKS AND
BROUGHT HER HERE WHEN IT WAS DARK.
SHE COULDN'T FIND ME
NOR THIS STREET AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE DID AN OLD
SCARECROW LIKE THAT
GET 10 QUID FROM,
ANYWAY?
AT DO YOU CARE?
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. TAKE
THE LION'S BLOODY SHARE!
I DESERVE HALF, DON'T I? AFTER
ALL, I PAID FOR THE DRINKS.
I DESERVE HALF, DON'T I? AFTER
ALL, I PAID FOR THE DRINKS.
HEY, WHAT ABOUT US, MUM?
YEAH. WE WAS TO GET OUR
SHARE FOR FETCHING YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'LL GET, DON'T YOU?
DID YOU TAKE ALL
SHE'D GOT IN THE BAG?
NO. I LEFT HER
HER SILVER.
AFTER ALL, I DIDN'T WANT TO
LEAVE HER WITH NOTHING, DID I?
BIGHEARTED BELLA.
HERE. SEE WHAT'S LEFT.
SPLIT IT BETWEEN YOU.
HAS SHE GOT
AN ADDRESS IN THERE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
HER ADDRESS FOR?
Boy: IS THIS IT, DAD?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
HER ADDRESS FOR?
WE GOT TO GET HER HOME,
HAVEN'T WE? AWAY FROM HERE.
SHE'S OUT
FOR THE NIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WE CAN'T WALK
HER HOME THROUGH THE STREETS, CAN WE?
OH, SHUT UP, WILL YOU?
HERE. BORROW YOUR UNCLE BILLIE'S
HANDCART. BRING IT ROUND THE BACK.
YOU WANT YOUR BLOODY
HEAD EXAMINED, YOU DO.
AND BRING SOME SACKS.
YOU'VE JUST TALKED YOURSELF
OUT OF ANY MORE, YOU DID.
ANYBODY CAN TAKE IT. KEEPING IT
- THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.
GO ON. MAKE SOME TEA.
ABOUT ALL YOU'RE GOOD FOR.
FETCH A BRICK, SON.
WE'LL DUMP HER
UP HERE.
SHE CAN WALK
THE REST OF THE WAY.
Woman: WHAT'S THE TIME?
Man: HALF 7.
YOU SURE?
YES.
YOU LOOK IT UP
IN THE PAPER?
OH, NO.
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT
AROUND IF HE'S LATE AGAIN.
HARRY.
HARRY, COME HERE,
QUICK.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DOWN THERE.
IS SHE DEAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO DO?
DON'T TOUCH HER.
DON'T TOUCH HER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.
ANY SIGN YET?
NO.
IT'LL BE
SOME TIME YET.
WELL, LET US KNOW.
CERTAINLY.
Man: EXCUSE ME, SIR.
WHAT'S SHE SIGNED HERSELF? "DAME
OF THE ORDER OF THE GARTER"?
YES. THAT'S NOTHING.
YOU SEE, SHE, UH...
OH, WELL, IT'S NOTHING.
IT CHANGES EVERY TIME.
I SEE.
I SUPPOSE... I SUPPOSE THE MONEY
MUST HAVE COME FROM HER SON.
HMM? OH, YES.
HAVE YOU FOUND HIM YET?
YES. HS INSIDE.
BUT YOU STILL NEED
TO TALK TO HER, DO YOU?
ELL, NOT REALLY, BUT IT
TIES UP THE LOOSE ENDS. W
I MEAN, THERE'S NO DOUBT WHO
DID IT. HE'SLREADY CONFESSED.
AN OLD FRIEND, HE IS.
THINKS THE WORLDOF HIS MUM.
ANY CHANGE YET,
DOCTOR?
WELL, RESPONNG, BUT NO
USE TO YOU, I'M AFRAID.
RIGHT. WELL, YOU'D BETTER
GIVE US A CALL, THEN, SISTER,
YOU KNOW, WHEN SHE'S READY. NO PANIC.
THANKS FOR
YOUR HELP, SIR.
I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO, EITHER.
NO, NOT AT
THE MENT, SIR.
ARE YOU A RELATION?
NO. NO. I'M NOT
ANYTHING REALLY.
I JUST KNOW HER
FROM WORK.
IS SHE
GOING TO LIVE?
OH, YES...
WELL, RECOVER,
ALL WE SAY?
WELL, RECOVER,
ALL WE SAY?
LET'S JUST TRY IT
ONCE MORE.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
ROSS.
ROSS. THAT'S RIGHT,
ISN'T IT?
MARGARET ROSS.
MARGARET.
MARGARET.
SO YOUR WHOLE NAME IS...?
MARGARET ROSS.
MARGARET ROSS. THAT'S
EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT.
SHALL WE TRY IT
JUST ONCE MORE?
NOW, TRY AND GIVE ME
THE WHOLE NAME, WILL YOU?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
MARGARET ROSS.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD INDEED.
SHE IS RESPONDING,
IS SHE?
RESPONDING ISN'T QUITE
THE TERM I'D USE.
DO YOU SMOKE?
YES. TNK YOU.
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T OFFER YOU E.
RESPONDING, NO.
IT'S MORE OF A STRIPPING-DOWN
PROCESS, ACTUALLY.
IT'S A QUESTION OF...
HOW SHALL I PUT IT?
WELL, IT'S A QUESTION OF
TAKING OFF LAYER AFTER LAYER
OF OLD WALLPAPERS
UNTIL YOU GET DOWN
TO THE BARE PLASTER.
THERE'S A SAYING,
YOU KNOW:
STRIP OFF
THE PHONY TINSEL...
YOU GET DOWN TO THE REAL TINSEL
UNDERNEATH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
OH, BUT SHE'S, UH,
SHE'S MUCH SMARTER
THAN THE AVERAGE.
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING
CASE, ACTUALLY.
WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU
STRIPPED OFF HER SO FAR?
WELL, AS YOU KNOW,
SHE HAS QUITE A LOT OF
TITLES AND POSSESSIONS.
ONE HAS TO APPROACH IT
VERY GENTLY.
BUT GRADUALLY,
ONE BY ONE,
SHE'S YIELDING UP THE
HES OF PRIZE CATTLE
AND THE FLEETS
OF MERCHANT SHIPS.
TANKERS, WASN'T IT?
HMM?
TANKERS. I MUST SAY,
I HALF BELIEVED IN THEM.
YES. TODAY... WHERE
DID WE GET TODAY?
OH, YES. YES TODAY, WE
GOT THE BISHOP'S PALACE.
SHE'D BEEN THERE,
OF COURSE-
THERE'S ALWAYS
A GERM OF REALITY-
AS A DOMESTIC.
AND SO IT GOES ON,
UNTIL SHE FINDS OUT
WHO SHE TRULY IS
AND WHAT
SHE REALLY OWNS.
YES. THAT MUST BE
A VERY REWARDING MOMENT,
WHEN YOU TELL THE MRS. ROSSES
THAT THEY'RE NOBODY, NOTHING.
WE'VE ALSO MADE
SOME PROGRESS.
WE'VE TRACED THEUSBAND.
A GENTLEMAN
FROM THE ASSISTANCE BOARD
WANTS TO SEE YOU, ARCHIE.
WHY UP HERE? WHY NOT
DOWN IN THE HALL?
OH, WELL, IT'S A
PRIVATE MATTER, MR. ROSS.
I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU ALONE.
OH. WELL,
GOOD MORNING, SIR.
I'M USUALLY OUT LOOKG FOR
WORK THIS TIME OF T DAY.
[COU COUGH
CAN'T TODAY BECAUSE OF
THE OLD CHEST, YOU KNOW.
THESE BOOTS,
THEY LET IN THE RAIN.
EXCUSE ME. I'LL TAKE MY
OLD RAGS OFF THIS CHAIR.
OH, THANK YOU.
WELL... CIGARETTE?
OH, THANK YOU, SIR.
OH, THANKS.
TA.
YOU'RE A MARRIED MAN,
AREN'T YOU, MR. ROSS?
WELL, IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING.
PUT IT THIS WAY-
I COULD WELL BE.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LADY
WIFE FOR MANY YEARS.
SHE MIGHT BE DEAD,
FOR ALL I KNOW.
SHE'S NOT DEAD,
MR. ROSS.
ISN'T SHE?
NO. SHE'S BEEN VERY ILL,
BUT SHE'S GETTING BETTER.
YOU'RE SURE IT'S
MY WIFE YOU'VE GOT?
OH, YES, WE'RE SURE.
MARGARET ROSS, NEE SEATON,
ONE SON NAMED CHARLES.
CHARLIE. YES,
THAT'S RIGHT ENOUGH.
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO HIM?
I'M SORRY TO S MY
INFORMATION IS HE'S IN PRISON.
IS HE, NOW?
WHAT FOR?
ROBBERY
WITH VIOLENCE.
SHE BECAME ILL ABOUT
THE TIME HE WAS ARRESTED.
HMM. NOT SURPRISED.
BUT SHE HAD
VERY GOOD ATTENTION.
SHE MADE
AN EXCELLENT RECOVERY.
I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.
SHE WASN'T A BAD SOUL
WHEN I KNEW HER.
BIT OLDER THAN ME,
OF COURSE.
YOU, UH... EVER THOUGHT
OF GOING BK TO HER?
NO. NO. THERE'S
NO SENSE IN THAT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BECOME VERY
INTERESTED IN YOUR WIFE, MR. ROSS.
WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE?
OH, DOCTORS, SOCIAL WORKERS,
PUBLIC HEALTH VISITORS, ME.
SHE'S STILL YOUR LEGAL
RESPONSIBILITY, YOU KNOW.
IF YOU EVER DO GET A JOB,
YOU'LL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER MAINTENANCE,
AND WE'LL BE
AFTER YOU FOR IT.
NOW WE'VE FOUND YOU.
WE CAN ALWAYS FIND YOU AGAIN.
WHY IS EVERYONE SO BLEEDIN'
INTERESTED ALL OF A SUDDEN
IN ME GOING BACK TO HER?
DID SHE ASK YOU
TO COME HERE?
NO. NO.
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-
SHE'S GOT TO ASK ME.
I'VE GOT ME PRIDE, YOU KNOW.
LOOK, YOU'RE IN THIS
DUMP. SHE'S IN HOSPITAL.
BUT SHE'S GOT A FLAT TO
GO TO WHEN SHE COMES OUT.
SHE'S ON HER OWN.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY
YOUNGER, EITHER OF YOU.
WE WERE ONLY
SUGGESTING THIS
FOR THE BENEFIT
OF BOTH OF YOU.
I DON'T KNOW...
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?
PNEUMONIA.
SUPPOSE I DID
GO BACK TO HER.
THERE ARE THINGS TO BE
WORKED OUT, YOU KNOW.
SUCH AS?
WELL, LIKE, UH,
HOW DO I GET THERE?
WE'LL GIVE YOU
A TRAVEL WARRANT.
WELL, IT ISN'T THAT
I MIND GOING BACK.
IT'S JUST THE APPEARANCE OF IT.
HOW DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, MY APPEARANCE.
I'M NOT EXACTLY
WEAVER-TO-WEARER, AM I?
I COULDN'T GO BACK
LIKE THIS.
I MEANTHAT WOULD PUT HER
RIGHT BACK IN HOSPITAL.
WE'LL FIX YOU UP WITH A
SUIT AND A PAIR OF BOOTS.
THAT'LL FETCH YOU UP A
BIT, WON'T IT, IN POUNDS?
LET ME PUT YOU
STRAIGHT,. ROSS.
YOU WON'T BE GIVEN
ANY MONEY.
I'LL SEE THE W.V.S.
AND THE SALVATION ARMY.
THEY'LL FIX YOU UP
BETWEEN THEM.
YOU MEAN CHARITY, SIR?
SOMEBODY'S CASTOFFS?
LISTEN, ROSS, I'VE SEEN YOU
CADGING COPPERS IN THE STREET.
YOU'RE A BUM, A DRUNK.
THE LAST TIME YOU TOOK
A JOB WAS 5 YEARS AGO,
AND YOU LEFT THAT
AFTER YOUR FIRST WAGE.
SO DON'T GIVE ME ANY GUFF
ABOUT BEING TOO PROUD
TO TAKE CLOTHES
FROM THE W.V.S.
I'LL SEE YOU GET KITTED UP,
BUT YOU'LL GET NO MONEY.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
HOW ABOUT SOME MONEY FOR
A RAZOBLADE AND A HAIRCUT?
I'LL NEED A MEAL
ON THE TRAIN.
GIVE ME A QUID
FOR THE LOT.
5 BOB. THAT'S FOR
THE SHAVE AND THE HAIRCUT.
YOU GET ANOTHER 5 BOB WHEN YOU GET
ON THE TRAIN, AND THAT'S YOUR LOT.
OK. I'LL MANAGE SOMEHOW.
RIGHT.
BIT OF A CHANGE,
ANYWAY.
WHAT'S SHE LOOK LIKE
NOWADAYS?
I DON'T KNOW. THEY DIDN'T
SEND ME A PHOTOGRAPH.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JUDG
A BEAUTY CONTEST, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE JUST GOING HOME.
I BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
YOUR WIFE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.
THAT'S RIGHT, MA'AM.
SHE'S BEEN VERY ILL,
YOU KNOW.
SO THEY TOLD ME.
PNEUMONIA, WASN'T IT, MA'AM?
YES. SHE WAS
IN A VERY POOR WAY.
SERIOUS THING,
I BELIEVE,
WHEN THEY CATCH IT
IN THE HEAD.
WELL, SHE'S RESPONDED WELL
TO TREATMENT, BUT, UH,
A GREAT DEAL IS
GOING TO DEPEND ON YOU.
NOW, CAN YOU
BE RELIED ON?
WELL, I KNOW MY RECORD'S A BIT SPOTTY.
THERE'S NO SENSE IN
NOT BEING OPEN ABOUT IT.
BUT I'LL DO WHAT
I CAN TO MAKE UP.
WELL, DO MY BEST. I
CAN'T SAY MORE THAN THAT.
HOW ARE YOU OFF
FOR FUNDS?
MA'AM?
DID YOU GET ANY NATIONAL
ASSISTANCE ON ARRIVAL?
OH, YES, THEY TREATED ME VERY WELL.
GAVE ME 10 BOB.
I HAD A SHAVE
AND A SPRUCE
AND GOT MYSELF
A NEW HAT.
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, I
WANT HER TO SEE ME AT MY BEST.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
OF COURSE.
WELL, I'M AFRAID WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF FUNDS
FOR THIS SORT OF DISBURSEMENT,
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A POUND.
THIS SHOULD TIDE YOU BOTH OVER
UNTIL YOU GET YOUR WIFE HOME,
AND THEN YOU CAN
SEE THEM AGAIN.
THANK YOU, MA'AM.
VERY GOOD OF YOU.

I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

HOSPITAL. DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.
IT'S ONLY NATURAL,
I SUPPOSE.
I WAS ILL.
WHAT DO YOU DO
ALL THE TIME?
I WAS ILL.
YES. I KNOW THAT.
I COLLECTED YOU
FROM THAT PLACE, DIDN'T I?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO?
DO YOU THINK ABOUT ME?
NEVER MIND.
DON'T UPSET YOURSELF.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW.
WELL, I THINK
I'LL TAKE A TURN OUT,
HAVE A LOOK ROUND,
FIND ME BEARINGS.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
WON'T YOU?
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT?
I SHAN'T BE LONG.
I'LL TAKE THE KEY.
DON'T MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE
WHEN I'M OUT.
ARCHIE...

WELL, IF YOU'LL JUST SIT DOWN
OVER THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS,
I'LL GO AND TELEPHONE

JUST TO MAKE CERTAIN
THE MONEY
HASN'T TURNED UP
SINCE YOU WERE THERE.

YOU'LL HAVE TO GET UP

Woman: NEXT, PLEASE.
NURSE EDITH CAVELL WAS THE BIGGEST
SPY THIS COUNTRY'S EVER HAD.
OH, YES? WHO'D SHE
PLAY FOR THEN-CHELSEA?
Conrad: MR. ROSS.
WELL, IT HASN'T
TURNED UP.
OH, DEAR.

I DOUBT IF IT WILL.
NOW, BECAUSE YOUR WIFE'S BEEN ILL
AND BECAUSE I KNOW HER VERY WELL,
I'M GOING TO PAY YOU
THE POUND.
BUT I SHALL SEND SOMEONE
TO SEE HER TOMORROW.
I DON'T LIKE
PEOPLE LOSING MONEY.
IT'S A CARELESS
THING TO DO.
I WANT TO IMPRESS
ON MRS. ROSS
THAT SHE MUSTN'T
DO IT AGAIN.
VERY GOOD OF YOU, SIR.
I'LL TELL HER, TOO.
COURSE, IT'LL MAKE IT
MUCH EASIER
IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH
TO GET A JOB.
WELL, I THINK
I CAN HELP THERE, TOO.
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT
SHOULD BE RIGHT UP YOUR STREET.
WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE, GO
AND SEE THE VACANCIES CLERK.

Hey guys.
Hey tell me please,
Is there any wedding here?
Are you those musicians who will play now in the area?
We are.
Yoshka has called us.
He said today - wedding; tomorrow - tavern.
Are you from around here pal?
I am Trisha.
Swineherd.
And why do you need her?
Yoshka does not work with female singers.
Only tambourine and males to sing.
Didn't I tell you Mica not to come.
Come on Mica.
Beat it.
What are you waiting for?
Isn't he telling you nicely?
Clear off.
Beat it.
Why are you looking at me?
Beat it.
Go away.
Go.
I'll take you to the wedding.
I am also going there.
Slow down, easy, easy.
Girl, you filth, you stink like a cream.
Girl, you filth, you stink like a cream.
Boy, you pig, you stink like a wine.

Girl you filth, you stink like a cream.
Boy, pig, you stink like a wine.
Your gosh crazy mind,
If you cannot talk, you can hear.
I told you hundred times,
Don't come in without a ticket.
Why are you assailed to railway?
Well, if she were sane she wouldn't come.
You muddy boor, I did not ask you anything.
You'd better take out the leek from your ass.
And you Goca, I'll break your legs if you board the train one more time,
This is not a mad house for you to walk around.
What else is it? she put her leg on a break, saying no, no...
... winking to a godfather to start moving...
Hey my daugther, is he the one?
Adder and flirt?
Yes mother, that is him, but he is not a flirt.
What did I do to her... by kissing her?
What did I do to her... by kissing her?
Nobody needs to know it, me and her mother only.
Nobody needs to know it, me and her mother only.
Hey, there is no mud in this street.
Hey, there is no mud in this street.
Hey, only now and when rain falls.
Hey, only now and when rain falls.
Wow guys, what I ran across.
Our Goca, like a fowl, in the grass,
...in a broad daylight.
And with who?
With some itinerant laborers,
... theirs moist sun.
I said to them,
I'll take you to police, you tailless cattle.
An her, if she is looking for a wedding,
I reckon, I'd take her to see a real one.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a flirt.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer.
Trustiness of wooer,
Trustiness of a dog
Trustiness of wooer,
Trustiness of a dog
If it is easy to flirt like me,
If it is easy to flirt like me,
To seduce one, one little girl.
To seduce one, one little girl.
He is doing this to me, his friend, and because of what?
Because of a fool.

In a village used to live an old gipsy.
She had a beautiful daughter.
She loved her daughter more than a whole world.
She loved her daughter more than a whole world.
In a village lived a hunter young.
He had a beautiful palace.
The gipsy is saying to her daughter:
Do not go to that palace.

Do not go to that palace.
You are like an picture.
One can sketch you.
Well, frankly,
It is the time for you to get married.
To settle down.
Will you, Trisha, tell me something,
But frankly, from your soul.
Have you ever been with female?
That way, you know.
I mean, as it should be.
You mother...
How big I am, but I haven't loved yet.
How big I am, but I haven't loved yet.
Fortunately, I'll start soon.
What are you using for that pitiful thing of yours, you miserable thing?
For what?
As we all know.
For pissing.
You are fools, that's you are.
Fools.
You are a free man Trisha, isn't it?
Mind your own business.
I am a free man.
Of course, I am a free man.
What do you care what are we talking about, then?
Do as you wish.
You are your own man.
Hey, here comes the chap.
Hey, here comes the chap,
Hey, he is walking with his pants raised high.
Hey, as it should be, hey, as it should be,
Hey, as it should be, to keep them off the mud.
Hey Panta, my good man.
Give a donation for a church my good man.
To raise it from the ruins.
Come on Panta.
You'll still have for a new pants.
Why is he linger round with that crazy child.
Come on.
Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.
I am not Yoshka.
And you cannot say absolutely nothing?
Eh, what am I going to do with you?
But I think that you can understand something.
Do you understand?
Tell me.
You know what?
Let me teach you how to play.
Hm?
Ha?
It is not so difficult, I swear to my mother.
Here, here, take it.
If I pay attention what village says,
I would never kiss a chap.
A man blew and twirled a girl.
There is one thing that is no good.
It is not good that he is doing it sneakily.
God forbid, like a man-whore.
You are very cheeky.
Why, for a God's sake Trisha?
Is it true, or not?
You are a man from the religious family.
Your father is a God fearful devotee.
And you, in the ditches, like a street dog.
Leave me alone people.
I can do what I want.
I am my own man.
And, what do you want?
Well, you cannot do everything you want.
Everything, just everything.
Do you see this money?
Do you see it?
I see, I see, I am not blind.
These are ours, from the card game.
Well, you see, when I wanted, I took it.
And when I want it, I'll throw it away.
Drunkard, you have a spotted face,
It seems to me that you'll become a musician.
We are Sremians.
We are Sremians.
We are Sremians.
Our blood is boiling.
Banging glasses, cuddling women.
That is our temper.
We are Sremians.

Trisha, my bro,
Trisha, house ours floorless.
Wait a moment.
Let's marry you.
What do you say, for your saint sake?
A?
A?
If I want to, I can.
Why not.
Trisha, my soul.
Trisha, my mirror.
He has spoken people.
He said, he would.
I will.
And you should know, I will.
Even I am swineherd, I am not a pig.
Like some.
How beautiful is richly adorned Srem, so wonderful life is there.
Girl, as vital as a cornel, so sweet is her kiss.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.
When Sremian goes to work, to hoe the vineyard he takes a bottle or two,
Sremian girl kiss me.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.

What good wind brings you here?
If you want your grandson, hurry up to take him,
Doomsday is coming.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Doomsday is here.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Eh time is passing, eh time is passing.
Eh time is passing like...
Eh, the whole life, eh the whole life
Eh the whole life stayed...
Snail put out your horns.
If you don't do it,
I'll kill you, with an axe to your head, on this green grass.
Snail put out your horns.
If you don't do it,
I'll kill you, with an axe to your head, on this green grass.
Why are always whist Goca?
Does the snail has legs mom?
Djura my child, bring me that sprit from behind the door to mix the food.
Comrade, do you know where is the school?
Go straight to the first corner.
Then turn left.
Then you go again straight to the first corner.
Then turn left.
And then?
Then you ask.
Everybody will tell you.
There is no education without culture.
I am a teacher, but I won't teach your children alphabet only.
They could stay lout as they were before.
You don't have to worry about firing.
Everything will be done properly.
I'll teach your women to paint.
Those from Uzdin has founded a painters club.
They are selling their paintings even to America.
It is better for them to sell the paintings than to whore around.
Uncle Peter,
I am painting in the fields on Sundays.
Do you know anybody who would carry my equipment?
Don't you worry, uncle Peter will take care of everything.
I have the right man for that job.
What are you doing comrade?
What is your real work?
We are, excuse us, looking after pigs.
We collect them in the morning, and return them in the evening.
You are something like a village swineherd.
That is what we are.
And our father was the same.
Listen. You are from here.
What kind of village is this one?
Village, like village miss.
Dusty.
Would you like me to teach you how to paint?
A?
We are all right and this way.
To look at you.
Dabble in good people, dabble in.
For the soul and for the church.
Dabble in.
God's temple to build, from the ruins.
To be like it was before.
Dabble in good people. Dabble in.
Give a donation for the church.
God's temple.
Trisha, trouble.
You don't respect Sunday again.
May God kill you not to kill you.
Quiet old man, we are painting, you see.
I see, I see.
You'll paint some misfortune for us.
Comrade, who is that old fool?
That is, excuse me, my dad.
Hah. That what the religious fanaticism can make of a man.
What is the box for?
Why are collecting donations?
They are doing it for our new church.
To build it.
Why new?
Is the old one not enough?
The old one was destroyed in the war.
It was its turn, I suppose.
Well, did you painted enough Trisha?
Why are you going from pale to blush?
Why are you going from pale to blush?
Why are you pale when looking at me?
Swear to my sun, I haven't seen a woman like that one.
Give me that chalk, what are you staring at?
Like painted.
Real city-girl.
I swear to God Trifun, if you continue like this, we'll have to marry you once more time.
Leave him alone. He is a family man.
Settled.
Have a child.
God forbid, and a wife.
My darling is swine herding, swine herding and for me longing.
Like you can't take a joke Trisha, for the God's sun sake.
Even if I have told you,
I did not take your eyes out,
... to your thick head.
Come on Goca.
Goca.
He is coming.
Run, you know that he does not like to see you here.
Come on, run.
Have you heard?
Run away from here.
I fuck your mother.
You are nothing to me.
Nothing.
Why my mind is in turmoil?
My sense tells me to be quiet.
Go away you both now.
Let my heart speak.
Go away you both now.
Let my heart speak.
I come to paint.
It is Sunday.
We are not going anywhere today.
We are going to paint you today.
The first look of your eye, with shine that matches the sun
Impounded my heart.
Made it a slave.
Impounded my heart.
Made it a slave.
That I love you, ah most darling,
To the whole world I'll tell.
But from you, ah most darling, my secret I will hide.
But from you, ah most darling...
I told you Trisha.
I'll paint you today.
Go away.
Eh you wretched.
To Kovin asylum you should go.
Why are you looking at me?
Go away.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer.
Trustiness of wooer,
Like trustiness of a dog.
Trustiness of wooer,
Like trustiness of a dog.
You comrade, look carefully.
Look around and don't forget something.
There are no breaks for me now.
I am preparing an exhibition.
Did you take all brushes?
I did, I did.
And don't rush like a steer.
You peasants are interesting, but not for a long.
One gives you a finger, and you want a whole hand.
Pay attention, don't forget a brush sweeping cloth.
It is here, here.
Tonight I also have meeting of party secretariat.
Preparation for the October celebration.
Eh my Trisha,
It is not my fault that you are swineherd, like that bigot father of yours.
For God's name.
.. his mother.
What has happened, for the moist sun sake.
E, I am a catfish, ... to my dull head.
Even with this big plain truth, I landed to this tree.
Bad lucker, sacramental bad lucker.
If you yawed a bit, you would end up on plain.
Not a single hair would fall from your head.
What are you gazing at.
You'd better help me to get out of here.
I can only go to the village to take a ladder.
Trisha, climb that three and help the comrade.
All right, all right, just stay there.
I'll do it myself.
... your mother
Go, what are you waiting for.
Go.
Wait.
Come on now.
Hop.
Eh, bad luck, it must always happen to me.
This is the third time.
The first time I ran to the power line tower.
The second time, church steeple.
And now, here, this tree.
At the end, I'll break my neck in some pigpen.
But this time
I didn't pick up so bad place after all.
Let me introduce myself comrade.
Mile Simic.
Milanche.
Agricultural aviation pilot.
I am driving this spraying cans.
Some call them coffins.
In every bad thing there is some good.
Imagine that I crashed on an old age home.
A?
Trisha, give something more to eat.
Comrade pilot must be hungry after all he went through.
I am keeping him as a service.
He is dumb, but he is loyal.
There are five of us,
And covering the whole Srem.
I am flying from day to day.
Oh, that must be wonderful.
Always above the earth. Oh.
Earth is, please excuse me, like a huge ass.
There is nothing on it.
Most often it stinks.
I see that you are an artist.
Lady.
Well, I am entertaining myself in this wasteland.
You should, you should...
Where were you until now?
What is it Trisha?
Bring something to drink.
The bottle is empty.
I must say everything twice.
And what are you going to do now?
Mechanics will repair that trash and I'll fly again.
But don't you worry.
The next time I am crashing on the same tree.
I know your kind.
And after?
What is left?
The maiden tears.
It is not like that.
On the other hand, when you think about it, what is this life comrade?
You got out from a hole, swirl round the hole all the time, eventually into the hole...
... your mother.
Why are you not paying attention comrade?
Oh, I am sorry.
Trisha, why are you not paying attention to what you are doing?
You could my friend take a little walk?
A?
It is clear air outside.
Wonderful.
You can trust, trust a bitch, but do not trust a flirt.
Trustiness of flirt,
Trustiness of a bitch.
I don't need you Trisha till Sunday.
On Sunday, as usual,
We are going out to paint.
Come one comrade. Beat it.
Like you don't know where the door is.
It is there, there.
Behind your back,
Just turn around, and simply go out.
It is not difficult.
Swear to my mother.
Hey the last nigh a lock asked me...
Would you make love my latch?
Hey go away tatter, you already asked me that.
Hey go away tatter, you already asked me that.
Hey I have a boy beautiful like an icon.
Hey I have a boy beautiful like an icon.
Hey not even every icon is not like that.
Hey not even every icon is not like that.
Hey I have eaten bonbons.
Hey I have eaten bonbons.
Hey from my boy's blue pants.
Hey from my boy's blue pants.
I found it under the table...
...raised it.
How do I look like?
And for an airplane, how long it would take it?
It depends is it single or double wings.
What?
Well, does it have one or two wings?
Well, two.
Eh, my God, three years.
What a dullard you are Trisha.
What do you mean?
If I am repairing tractors, I could airplanes as well.
Everybody specializes in something.
Some take care of pigs, some repair tractors, and some airplanes.
But I am not the one.
You have come to the wrong address.
And that you are in hurry, that I understand.
It is not easy to deal with mustaches like that one.
He'll dismount your headmistress.
What is it, what do you want?
What are you looking for in this time?
Nothing, nothing,
I just
I was passing by, and well, I thought if I am needed.
Why you would be needed you fool.
There is nothing to do.
Come on. Go home.
Beat it.
Come on, beat it.
Well, if you need, I thought.
To paint.
I ran riot, and I'll do it again.
I ran riot, and I'll do it again.
I caressed them, but not a dark ones.
Did you see what wonder mustache thing landed among us?
Well, we could rather say he flopped down.
Not landed.
But it does not matter.
As he landed to our teacher,
He is not getting up any more.
But she is a real dragoness.
When she put you between her rods, like you entered the heaven's village.
What do you say?
What do you say?
I can't hear.
Say it louder.
My heart is breaking into four.
My heart is breaking into four.
Because of you my beautiful doll.
Move a bit, you are like a statue.
Eh, God's miracle.
Father god-fearing, and son wooer.
You are Trisha, not a very wise man.
The girl had some fun with you, and enough.
She is looking for a single guy.
Not married.
What would she do with you?
Well, listen people,
Something serious may come out of this.
Trisha is smitten.
How do you feel my son of a poor?
How do you feel my son of a poor?
Seduced by a city girl?
Waiter, give us two brandies.
Sit.
It is getting cold outside.
Air is tonight, as you said, healthy freezing.
That is the reason why is our Trisha worming up the whole evening.
Why did you isolate yourself?
He is distressed today.
This is that kind of day for him you know.
Listen you, pig's handler.
What nonsenses are you spreading around the village?
You are Trisha, a fool indeed.
Rosemary has curled up, curled up with hollyhock.
Rosemary has curled up, curled up with hollyhock.
Flirt, flirt, small devil, policemen are looking for you.
Flirt, flirt, small devil, policemen are looking for you.
Come on comrade.
Come on.
Come on, ... your bleeding sun.
Why are you so kind to him?
Don't you see that he is shocker?
He has killed.
I killed.
Not him.
I did it the last night.
She assaulted Djurica.
Goca was dull creature.
She should be in Kovin asylum long time ago.
And what do you say Trisha?
Is it correct what is your father saying.
I don't know anything.
I drank a lot the last night.
Why, why are the police after me?
Why, why are the police after me?
I did not, did not foray,
I did not, did not cheat.
I did not, did not foray,
I did not, did not cheat.
Hey people. Stop.
What has come upon you?
Where are you taking this man?
People, wait.
Wait.
Wait people, what is with you for a God's sake?
Wait people. Wait I am telling you.
Go home priest.
This is not your job.
He is going to jail.
He killed.
Who has killed?
How is this possible?
He couldn't step on an ant.
I have killed father Sava.
I should be cursed, I killed.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
... on a hill, all wooer are hatching there.
I am playing well this game.
I always win.
I learnt it on a public works.
We were laying out a highway.
Oops.
Click.
Let it be, let it be
I am not playing well,
But somehow I always mop up in Rummy.
Is it?
But, I am playing honestly.
Touched, moved.
Eh, that was not a deal.
One can touch, without moving.
What and who I was touching in my life.
One thing is touching,
But another is to commit yourself.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer.
You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer.
Trustiness of wooer, trustiness of a dog.
Trustiness of wooer, trustiness of a dog
You bastard.
You raff.
You mob.
You know, honey, time has come for me to tell you.
I am not a Turk.
I cannot have two wives, even if I want to.
Tomorrow my wife Dimka is coming.
Our children are with her family in Belgrade.
We'll fly together.
That is why I am telling you to finish the game.
Catch the figure.
It will fly away tomorrow.
Girl's heart is wilting, boys are not keen in getting married.
Before the girls gets old, there will be tax on flirts.
If boys does not want to get married willingly, they should be married forcibly.
If boys does not want to get married willingly, they should be married forcibly.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Comrades. Thanks to our pilots our fields will be blooming.
And today, when we live in the time of progress.
When even the heart in our chest does not have to be our own.
Very clever chick.
Everywhere, even into the villages, new ideas should be pressed forward.
More modern.
Because, there is no economy without the culture.
Nor the culture without economy.
These are two faces of the same thing.
And when comrade Milan crashed,
I meant, landed,
That is why comrades,
Our pilot Mile, should fly on the sky for a long, long time.
And we are going to wish him farewell now.
That's right.
Long live.
Come on Mile.
Glory, glory, glory for the Serb.
Eagle is crying from the height, voice can be heard from the deep,
Don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you
Svetozar Miletic
Glory, glory, glory for the Serb.
We had been slaves enough,
But we are free now, don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you
Svetozar Miletic
... just call us and we we'll be there
Glory, glory, glory for the Serb.
Svetozar the son of Serb, we are all proud of you, don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you
Svetozar Miletic
... just call us and we'll be there.
We came to this plain to be seen by everybody and to remind them that we exists.
My opinion comrades is that we should not
Move from here until we get an airplane.
All villages around has one plane each, but we, as orphans...
What plane?
We won't move from here until things gets better.
That is it!
That's exactly it.
When students can do it, we can as well.
To bring in the law once for all.
Everybody to be equal.
Fuck it.
Excuse me comrade president.
You are welcome.
Worker should get what he is entitled to.
Look at us.
There is nothing a dog can bite to.
We had enough of bourgeois, even they were the red ones.
Let's comrades, send a telegram to those who are up.
To whom up?
To a pilot?
What a pilot?
You fool.
Wind, the wind is blowing, plums are falling.
Miserable poor always goes under.
Miserable poor always goes under.
My opinion comrade is this.
We who are down, we are sending telegram to those who are up.
A, what is it?
What?
According to early morning broadcasts of the Czechoslovakian free radio
Across the whole country was noticed a movement of a new occupation forces and removing the old ones.
A raising number of the occupation forces are entering the country,
And a number of foreign soldiers are
Moving from east to the west, towards Prague particularly.
Free radio is estimating that there are nearly half of a million of foreign soldiers in  Czechoslovakia.
Gunshots from automatic rifles could be heard last night in Prague.
It is reported that the occupation forces were shooting at every vehicle that was moving in through the city, even to the public safety vehicles, as well as to the vehicles that were picking up earlier wounded persons.
What are you people doing here, in this wasteland?
Looking for something?
Did you see the news comrade?
We are not really getting press around here.
I don't know.
Doomsday is near.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss.
What are they doing there?
What do they want?
I don't know.
Some Czechs.
Collecting donations.
What donation.
For what?
Is it for the airplane?
No, for the submarine.
Why do they need submarine?
For everybody to board, one by one.
And where to go?
Well, to go to mother's lovely c...
What are you staring at when you don't understand anything?
Come on, come on, get your things together and leave.
That was enough.
... and you brother, take care of yourself.
BEWARE OPPRESSORS OF WORKING CLASS!
Hey Yolande, Yolande,

Shave one, only one, of two of your mustaches.
Shave one, only one, of two of your mustaches.
Respected audience, thank you for coming to see our great attraction.
When I open the curtain, you'll see, sitting on the chairs,
Yolande and Peter who love each other very much.
Respected audience,
Yolande and Peter are sitting on this chairs.
I know that you don't know which one is male and which one is female.
There might be even some of you who suspects that Yolande is not a female.
Come on Yolande, show your brests to the respected audience.
That's it Yolande.
Bravo Yolande.
That's it Yolande.
Bravo Yolande.
It is over respected audience.
What are you waiting for?
Go away, the show is over.
You got more than enough for the five bucks.
Other should come as well.
Come on, go away.
What are you waiting for?
It is finished.
Come on.
What are you looking at?
Do you want me to paint you?
You look perfect for it.
Do you see this pal of mine?
They spend half of a year in a jail to paint him.
He is like an exhibition.
Everything is on him.
Well, Trisha.
Didn't I tell you not to come any more.
Well, there is something you should see.
I am telling you.
I'll show you.
Come in.
I'll leave immediately.
Swear to God.
And what is it you want to show me?
A?
You are really a cuckoo.
Well?
It was painted by a craftsman.
Cheap, 300 bucks.
He said that it will stay forever.
You are really crazy Trisha.
Aziz!
Look what Trisha did to himself.
How do you feel my son of a poor?
How do you feel my son of a poor?
Seduced by a city girl?
Seduced by a city girl?
When he felt, why he did not break his neck...
I'll drink while there is in a pot, when is gone I'll go to a tavern.
Look, this is the same thing that was at the last elections.
You should now Trisha that this is your last drink.
We are becoming poll station.
We are not a tavern any more.
Don't Yoshka.
It is not easy for a man.
One should understand him.
So young, and seduced twice.
I think people that we should leave Trisha alone.
He has lot on his mind.
You leave us.
I and Trisha, even we are arguing, we love each other.
I am not like some who talk sundry.
And there are people of all kinds.
Well, not long ago I heard some people saying that it is easy for Trisha to marry when his wives are dying like a flies.
It might be somebody, God forbid, who would say that Trisha's dad is sitting in jail for nothing.
It is a big thing.
Parental love.
Enough of it you there.
Didn't I tell you that tavern does not work today.
Elections are tomorrow.
Tavern should be repainted.
And you Trisha, for mother sake, you are drunk since morning.
The whole village does not like you anyway.
That old man I sitting in jail for nothing.
He is not drunk uncle Peter.
He just jollified.
I'll drink while there is in a pot, when is gone I'll go to a tavern
Father Sava.
Father Sava.
What is it old man?
Time to die?
Father Sava.
Oh my sweet God.
I lied.
Lied.
I did not kill.
Trisha.
My son.
Everything mine.
He killed.
Eh, ... mother's dulls.
Old men rush on to die with the priest.
Why must I play a fool here?
I don't care.
Give me that cap.
What did you say?
Well, go to...
Wind, the wind is blowing, plums are falling.
Miserable poor always goes under.
Miserable poor always goes under.
And what now Trisha?
No more hiss, hiss.
It is tough now. You run into the law.
To Aziz.
Wooer left without wooer.
Now, when he became a widower.
When he is so to speak free.
I told him nicely to leave the girl.
Not to make a fool of himself, he is already foolish.
And he grabs his knife.
Like if I am some dupe.
Come on Trisha. Take the knife now.
My heart is breaking into four.
All because of you my beautiful doll.
My heart is breaking into four.
All because of you my beautiful doll.
Do you remember when we were young?
When we were making love?
Tie him up.
You are going to ring the bells.
To ring the bells.
Better than your old man.
I was looking after pigs in the wasteland.
When sun was coming down.
I started to count them.
I count, one, two, three and four, five, six, seven, eight... eight nine, nine, nine, all, all are here, only Tris..
I mean Gedza is not.
My little Gedza, with the spotted back, with round chin, fat like a pear.
Aaaaa, Gedza,
Aaaaa, Gedza
It is Trisha, ... his sun.
Killing his wife was not enough.
Drunk cattle.
He brought pigs to shit around the church.
He killed Goca, fuck his mother.
He put his father in jail.
Not a God's church is holly for him.
No, no...
You want pigs to shit in our church, a?
Killed his wife, and father in jail.
How beautiful is richly adorned Srem, so wonderful life is there.
Girl, as vital as a cornel, so sweet is her kiss.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.
When Sremian goes to work, to hoe the vineyard, he takes a bottle or two,
Sremian girl kiss me.
Srem, Srem, Srem, so wonderful life is there.
ALL TO ELECTIONS

Comrade Andos, it is ten o'clock, and almost whole village has voted.
Zivanovic Ivan.
How many is left?
I'll tell you now.
Seven.
What is that blockhead Trisha doing?
He must be still sleeping.
My brothers.
Today on a new temple sanctification, which we build with lot of trouble,
Remember that the one up is only one who sees everything.
He made us from the same soil.
If the sin is in you, it is not from the God.
Because the God is sinless.
And his creation as well.
If the sin is in you... daemons invaded you...
...the devil has come for his due.
I have a devilish fawn.
Devilish fawn.
In a church she leers at me.
In a church she leers at me.
Brothers.

I'm sure you must be interested in sex, and it's a good thing.
It would be sad if you weren't.
I too am very interested in sex - as a subject of study, of course.
AUTHOR OF MEDICAL SEXOLOGY
AND SEXUAL KNOWLEDGE
Sex is perhaps more whispered about than spoken of openly.
But we don't know enough about these whisperings.
If we could only find out more, we'd know just how great people's interest in sex is.
In ancient times, sexuality was understood in a different way.
This was especially evident in the custom of worshiping the sex organs.
For example,
a male sex organ
40 feet high,
gilded and ornamented, was paraded around, accompanied by music and beautiful girls.
And no one protested, not even the girls who followed this gigantic
40-foot-tall phallus.
Or take the case of the Euphrates Valley, where they'd raise up huge phalli, or male members, measuring 180 feet high.
A special priest called a "phallobath" - he even has a name - would climb up twice a year
and remain at the top
of such a phallus for seven days.
Similarly, in India... coupled organs, male and female, formed an integral part of the altar.

Prcanj, do you hear me?
Hello, Zajecar?
Is that Mijovic?
You have a call from Murska Sobota.
We're trying, darling, we're trying.
Kragujevac can wait.
I have three calls from Croatia.
–ura –akovic, Slavonski Brod.
What private address?
It's a factory.
Obrenovac, hold on.
Sremska Mitrovica,
Poûarevac is calling.
Poûarevac. Answer, will you?
Waiting for an invitation?
Miss, you're like Napoleon.
He could read, think, and piss, all at the same time.
Svetozarevo, how's that famous beer of yours?
Your transport, miss.
A motorized lover!
Get lost, you fucking jerk.
I could give you such a ride!
And Sufrain, the driver at the Ethiopian embassy.
Child of darkest Africa.
African-style, sister.
A prince, so help me.
What a pleasure, having a professional work on your feet.
All I got from traipsing around with that bum with no car is corns.
I had Njegovan, a literature student from Lika.
He wrote me poems.
How did that go?
"Ruöka, my dewy flower,
I've dedicated a poem to you... about wild flesh."
Buddy, could you whiten these for me quickly?
Three hundred.
And a new dinar for quick service.
Money's worthless these days.
It was during the European
Athletics Championships.
He was a bashful blond.
You'd think he didn't know a thing.
But once he started, he couldn't stop.
He really gave you a good time.
In the morning, when we came out, dawn was breaking.
Everything was a sort of white mist before my eyes.
I felt like the Virgin Mary.
You know my Mihajlo, who played folk tunes on the accordion?
He was a good person, but he was too into his music - the "Nightingale of äumadija."
Dragan Stojnic, you little sweetheart!
I adore him.

Yugoslavia, born of struggle
Your people sing of your glory

My pleasure.
Buöatlija, Ahmed.
Izabela Garodi.
Excuse me?
Ga-ro-di.
This is my friend Ruûa.
Buöatlija.
Call me Ruöka.
Why don't we drop in at the Seaman's
Tavern? They've redecorated.
- Sure.
- Only if they've got draft beer.

Bodies of crime victims are hidden
in a wide variety of places.
Criminals often take their victims
to secluded spots
under various pretexts,
convinced that without witnesses
a crime will not be discovered.
For example, the body
may be buried, carved up,
burnt, thrown in a river
or hidden in a well.
A body usually
decomposes in water,
but cold well water
can retard the decaying process,
facilitating cleaning of the head
for identification purposes.
This cleaning is performed
in the following manner. ;
Layers of mud and algae
are removed,
the hair is combed,
lacerations are sutured,
the face is made up,
the eyelids are opened,
and glycerin is injected into the eyes
to restore their natural sparkle.
The criminal always seeks to make a "leap into the void," driven by his instinct for self-preservation.
In a word, he wishes to enjoy undetected the fruits of his crime.
SENIOR FELLOW
INSTITUTE OF CRIMINOLOGY
Advances in science and technology enable certain criminals to enrich their imagination and intelligence, thus subverting civilization's achievements to the service of evil.
Paradoxical as it sounds, crime is being perfected and is more and more a function of intelligence and less a matter of force and fist.
It was once enough for a criminal to catch a train or boat at the very last moment to escape justice, but with modern advances, he can't feel safe anywhere.
Wherever he goes, whatever he does, he'll leave enough traces for the Argus-like eyes of criminologists to find him.
The way he ties a rope to hang or strangle a victim, or, in burglary cases, the prints of shoes, socks or naked feet on a wood floor - all these are calling cards left behind for investigating officers that prevent criminals from realizing their unattainable dream -
the perfect crime.
Disposing of his victim's body is one
of a murderer's greatest challenges.
A murderer will often stare
long and hard at the motionless body, straining his brain for a way to get rid of the corpse.
The human body is made up of
an enormous number of substances.
Blood poses an insurmountable
problem for criminals.
Teeth and bones are very durable.
That fact helped our colleague Vodinelic solve the infamous case of the Podravina skull.
And our experts Dr. Milcinski
and Dr. Sava Gorkic
superimposed
an unidentified skull upon photographs of unidentified bodies to successfully answer the first of the seven golden questions in criminology: "Who?"
You have to taste this.
Barack palinka - apricot brandy.
A Hungarian specialty.
Are you -
I can tell by your accent.
Hungarian?
Yes, but of the domestic variety.
My brother in Budapest sent it along with Mr. Frankovic, manager of the Sleeping Car Company, the SCC.
Cheers.
That's a real disinfectant.
I like a good clean job.
Smells like apricots, doesn't it?
You're not married, are you?
No.
You know, I lived here with my mother until six months ago.
Then she had some kind of rupture, and she was gone.
I couldn't do much here, if you get my drift.
I couldn't bring company here.
I've been renting ever since I can remember.
The army was a mother and stepmother to me.
I was an orphan.
My father went abroad in search of work and vanished.
I went straight from the medical corps into sanitation.
It's been ten years already.
Let's have some coffee.
Neither burner is working, but we'll manage somehow.
Other than that,
I'm very upstanding.
I don't drink.
I'm a Party member.
Clean and meticulous.
I go on a binge once a year at most, when things get to be too much.
One teaspoon or two?
One.
And I thought you were an officer, something along those lines.
Izabela, you're a real tease.
Cheers.
Please come in the other room.
There's a good program on TV.
Would you hold this?
Thanks.
Thanks.
It's more intimate this way.
Don't you agree?
CLOSE THE CHURCHES!
Izabela, you're quite a little homemaker.
Just so you know:
I've gone two months without a man, and that's too long for a Hungarian girl.
There's this guy in our collective named Piöta Baci.
He tells these jokes about Hungarian girls - filthy jokes - and I imagined all sorts of things.
What do you mean by that?
The stories men tell.
You know - jokes and such.
So you didn't like me?
Don't be silly, woman.
What did I say?
"Pretty as a fairy princess with hair like silk."
Who's that?
Nobody.
Just the milkman.
Tell me, are you single all the time?
Not all the time.
I'm just too honest.
I don't know how to lie to women.
But believe me... you're the first modern girl... that I've hitched up with like this.
That was nice, what you said about my hair.
And my skin is like velvet too.
Female, 20-25 years old,
5'3" tall.
Bones and muscles of average development, of average nourishment.
Skin color: Grayish white.
Facial skin blistered and lacerated in spots.
Outer ear channels, nostrils, and mouth contain sand and green, moss-like, mucous threads.
Right shoulder area shows lacerations and a hematoma the size of a child's palm.
Skin under right elbow shows punctures in the form of bite marks.
Eyelids swollen, with pronounced changes due to decay.
Conjunctiva clouded and grayish, with grains of sand and above-mentioned fibrous threads.
Iris is light blue.
Uterine cavity contains fetus with lining, approximately three months old.
Brain tissue exhibits well-developed structure.
Right temporal area shows hematoma the size of a palm.
Conclusion:
Violent death by drowning, which, based on the above findings, was preceded by physical assault.
The threat posed to man by rats
has still not been fully grasped here.
Rats devour enormous quantities
of food and other goods.
They eat winter coats,
entire libraries of books,
corpses in autopsy rooms,
even film stock.
In 1725, an earthquake
and unprecedented famine
set great masses of rats
on the march out of Asia.
Huge armies of the berserk little
creatures reached the Caspian Sea,
swam across the Volga, and inundated
the European part of Russia.
By 1750 their advance guard
had reached Silesia.
After that, traveling along
roadways and later railways,
the gray rat conquered
one region after another.
At first, Europe welcomed
these uninvited newcomers,
figuring that the gray rat
would help exterminate
the black rat,
which had ravaged Europe
since the Crusades.
The gray rat and black rat
fought to the death.
Being stronger, tougher,
and more bloodthirsty,
the gray rat prevailed.
The rat is in many ways
more resilient than man.
There are currently
three million of them in Belgrade,
60 million throughout Yugoslavia.
It's still unclear who will rule
the Earth in 100 years. ; people or rats.
One pair of rats produces
1,000 descendants in one year.
Our rat extermination units -
advance guard
of the human race -
wage a fierce battle to safeguard
man's living space against rats.
THERE'S A PANTRY
FULL OF CHEESE
AND THE RAT EATS THE CHEESE
NICE AS YOU PLEASE

HIS MIND'S AT EASE
WHILE HE HAS HIS CHEESE
BUT INTO THE RAT
COMES A DISEASE
THAT SNEAKS OUT
FROM THE CHEESE
AND STARTS SCREWING

IT SCREWS WITH HIS EASE
SCREWING AND SCREWING
IT BRINGS HIM TO HIS KNEES
IT'S A BELLYACHE HE CAN'T ABIDE

LIFE'S AT AN END
IT'S TIME HE DIED
I THINK I KNOW
HOW IT MUST BURN
WHEN THAT SCREW
BEGINS TO TURN
Bachelors are always at the bottom of the heap.
I live here modestly.
I'm no big shot or one of those pushy types, but when it comes to fighting rats,
Ahmed's your man.
You live like in that novel
Wuthering Heights.
Eve.
And you're
Suleiman the Magnificent.
Put on some clothes.
What's that?
You're so cramped here.
I found what I was looking for:
A hen's egg.
What do you think of when you see a hen's egg?
Hens don't lay eggs just so people can make omelets.
This egg represents the most highly developed reproductive cell of the female sex.
Within this cell the germ of life is already present, the "spark," as the common folk say.
This germ illustrates how organs develop, including in the human being.
This is the most powerful element in all our science:
To know the mechanism by which all our organs, nervous system, blood and heart develop.
When you understand this,
I'm sure you won't think of omelets anymore
when you see a hen's egg.
My Mohammed!
Mujo!
Throw me some clothespins from the closet.
Right away.
Song of songs,
rise up to the sun
That shines on the march
of the Red column
What's that, for God's sake?
Comrades from the German Democratic
Republic gave us some records.
I immediately bought a record player.
O land, be ready!
Onward, O time!
O land of lands,
forward in assault!
Crush into dust rotten vermin!
Bravely into struggle!
Onward, O time!
Be joyful, O land
to the future sworn
The Commune stands
at the gate
To your oath be true!
Onward, O time!
We're all sticky.
Meho, you sure know what's good for a body.
Am I a good Turk or not?
What was that?
I didn't get a word.
Do you like it?
Know what it says?
It goes like this:
"Half of 100 forints is 50.
To hell with it.
Man's not made of wood.
He can fail once in a while."
Then it goes on:
"I kiss my girl on the mouth."
"However, slaughterhouses and granaries, along with roads, offer the most attractive targets of invasion for rats."
The things you're involved with!
Meho decided to surprise you.
This is Master Rade.
Hello.
Please come in.
Hey... what's that?
A record player.
The walls are good and sturdy.
They'll hold.
Or maybe we should put it here?
We'll put the drain down here.
Easy there!
What are you doing, lifting that alone?
Here we go.
That's it.
Go over there.
Shock-workers.
Careful you don't scrape it, or the paint will chip.
Set it down.
- To our health.
- Cheers.
You're not drinking?
- One more?
- A little later.
An expert job.
Come wash my back.
Hey, I didn't say there!
Interestingly enough,
there's not one great artist,
great poet or great writer
who did not deal
with the most ticklish
sexual matters.
The great painters -
Rembrandt, let us say... as well as others - depicted the sexual act.
Few people are aware of that.
One of our own artists painted an extraordinary painting that I greatly admire, which in essence is perhaps extremely pornographic, if one looks at it that way, depicting the sexual act in all its forms.
It's a picture by our great painter
–orde Andrejevic Kun, a painting first exhibited
30 years ago.
It depicts, without the slightest prudery, parents engaged in the sexual act in a room where children are playing and a meal's being cooked as an integral part of a certain way of life.
His point is to show us not so much the sexual act as the fact that all activities take place in that same setting.
That's one example of something that certainly might appear pornographic but is not.
One... two... three... he captures your heart.
One... two... three... a uniform.
You'll go on a journey.
Secretly, at night.
Fooling around.
A bed.
I'm not putting you on.
I don't believe it.
Think what you like, but I really love him.
I'm serious.
So maybe he is a bit of a homebody.
We hardly ever go out.
Well, dark eyes are dark eyes, a heart means love - even if it's a little love - but there's no mistake, my friend.
It's your fate.
Gimme another bite.
Take the whole thing.
Are you free tonight, miss?
- Unfortunately no.
- Too bad.
What are you doing tonight?
Giving my kids a bath.
Pity.
- For me?
- Sure is, handsome.
Thanks.
Miss, I am Mica, postman of death and joy, bearer of urgent telegrams.
It's a special service calling for speed and finesse.
When I show up, people immediately start crying or celebrating, showering me with tips or pressing me to stay for dinner.
I live like our delegations abroad.
Hello, Petrovac na Mlavi?
Give me military post 69.
When I want a girl, she can't say no.
- Who is it?
- The wool thrasher.
"Guess who I am.
Quilt-making's my game.
I live in a cottage down the lane.
I have two sons,
Andrija and Slobodan by name."
Got anything to thrash?
- I do.
Let's go downstairs.
- Lead the way, sunshine.
"I thrash wool, and my darling's no fool."
Master Aca, member of the Socialist League, thrashes wool for party members and nonmembers alike.
"My cock does a lot.
It glues you on the spot.
It makes you wet and hot, and in a jiffy you're caught!"
I see you thrash wool.
Could you thrash this quilt?
Sure.
Want me to thrash you too?
Oh, I was thrashed long ago, my friend.
This tooth really hurts.
Look, this one.
My God!
You should get that filled.
Don't let it rot on you.
I know a great dentist.
He made me some fantastic teeth.
Look.
You think you're really something.
Miss Izabela, you don't know me at all.
I admit that certain sexual adventures do happen to me, but not through any depravity of mine.
Say I bring a joyful telegram from a husband overseas.
The wife weeps with joy.
The telegram gets soaked.
She offers me liqueur-filled bonbons.
She hugs and kisses me.
- You don't say.
It's not my doing.
It's the postal service's fault.
My boyfriend's off on a work assignment.
I might not see him for a whole month.
Screw this life!
People aren't made of wood, especially not me.
So what if it's a night call?
Give me Poûega 64.
That's right - 64.
I didn't know you were on the night shift tonight.
I'm filling in for my friend.
Yes, her pilot came in, the one who flies charter planes abroad.
You really do know everything.
And your boyfriend?
Named to the commission investigating the food poisoning down in Niö.
I saw you two together once.
You were having a beer over near the hospital.
We'd gone for my anemia checkup.
It's not me waking you up, comrade.
It's a call from Zagreb.
This is a workplace.
Please stop horsing around.
When I say there's no hope, it's not just for show.
I'll turn the lights out myself if I feel like it.
Believe me,
I hold you in the highest esteem.
You're one of the most beautiful women in the whole building.
I'd never stoop so low as to harm you.
But you're so sexy, so it's not my fault if I wish to provide what your heart craves.
A certain pleasure in life... and suchlike.
Banja Luka?
Hold on a moment.
It's not right. Don't.
No, I'm not talking to you.
Please hold.
God, you're persistent!
When do you get off work?
I only mean you well.
- I work until 6:00.
I wasn't talking to you.
Hold on.
Go away.
If I start, I know
I won't be able to stop.
Stay on the line.
I'm getting your number.
This isn't right. Go away!
Please hold.
The line's busy.
Is that you, Frosina?
Give me 2274.
Yes, Belgrade, here's Skopje for you.
Please don't.
Crikvenica doesn't answer.
Yes.
Banja Luka,
I'm putting you through via Sibenik.
The lines are down.
The lines are down.

He used to live here.
Came back dead drunk.
Didn't sober up for ten days.
We found him right there Sunday, wallowing in shit like a pig.
Haven't seen him since.
But before that he was a saint of a man, meek as a lamb.
Suddenly something snapped, and he went crazy.
My Commune,

Laziness and sloth,
these old habits!
Heart, renew yourself!
Onward, O time!
Wheels, gather momentum!
Cogwheel of time
Dayshift and nightshift
turn without ceasing
Make haste today!
Onward, O time!

Thank you.

Why did you do that?
Do what?
You know. The 500 note! l think it's worth it.
Being funny?
Not at all, no.
What d'you want?
Nothing.
But l think it's very good...
You're very talented. l've been drawing does for ages.
You don't often come here.
No, l live in the South of France.
So long!
Going my way?
You're rich? l have money.
Don't ask me if l like painting.
You don't. l'd have thought the contrary. lf you like my pictures, you don't. l'd be pleased if l were you.
What's your name?
- What's yours?
Frédérique. l go this way.
- Me too.
What d'you think of them?
Not bad.
What's your name?
WHY
That's no name.
None of your business.
How much?
And that?
Why the difference?
One's original, one's a copy. l can see it's a copy.
No, the other is. l go this way.
Me too. l live there.
Goodbye... and thank you.
What for?
A good time.
Thank you too.
Like a coffee or tea... or something?
Got a bathroom? lf l can have a bath l want a coffee.
Of course.
How much sugar?
One and a half.
You've a good figure.
Not bad.
Pass the coffee.
Rinse your head, anyhow. l want it now.
Awful!
You put in two sugars... l asked for one
Sorry! Shall l get you another cup?
No, l don't want any.
How capricious you are!
Perhaps...
You're so demanding... particularly in... ln what?
My situation?
Yes, l have to be.
Now get out!
Why? l'm getting out. l don't understand. l'm naked.
Come now...
Between women...
That's just the point... and l hate that word.
Come over here.
Come.
Wait a second. lt's much better like that.
MERRY CHRlSTMAS
''Revolution...
''is not a banquet.
''lt is not made like a work...
''of literature or an embroidery.
''lt can't be done so elegantly...
''so calmly or delicately...
''with such sweetness...
''courtesy and generosity.
''Revolution is an uprising...
''the violence by which a class...
''overthrows another.''
You're right.
Someone's hooting.
Ah, it's Frédérique!
What, already?
And who's she?
- No idea.
Where'd she find her?
Another mouth to feed.
Let's get ready.
- Hope she's not a pain.
Where are they from?
Kenya and Mozambique. l love hunting.
My darlings...
Come to my arms!
Leave me some.
Now that's enough.
Don't you love us any more?
Out of sight, out of mind.
Unfair...
Who's the pin-up?
A friend... Why.
Why who?
Ask her.
Why who?
Why.
Heavens! lndeed, Robéque. l'll show you your room. l rather like her.
What about you?
Pity about her name.
Yes, it's too short.
Ankles good. lndeed.
Hair... you know that hair is very important.
Her center of gravity is... in perfect balance. lntelligence and beauty!
The leg could be fine...
What you can... see of it.
And the waist too.
Fine figure of a girl.
Yes but...
But what? l'm not entirely for the buttocks.
What's up with you?
Listening?
Shame on you.
How ill-mannered!
- That'll do.
Take no notice of them.
Get out now.
Aren't you ashamed?
Hurry up now!
Get out of here!
Who are those two?
They're charming.
You'll see when you're used to 'em.
Anyhow...
At Saint Tropez in December... it's not like in summer.
There's not much choice.
Not sleeping?
Doesn't seem to worry you much!
Should we stop?
No, don't do that.
She's a charming kid.
Think so? lt was a question. ls she charming?
No wrong notes, now.
Hell! What an awful place!
Not sleeping?
No, l'm too tired.
With that music...
Not too bad.
Come on, let's go out for a bit. l've something to show you.
Violette... a friend of mine
Miss Why.
Them and their music!
My head's turning.
What's cooking?
Roast veal and sprouts...
Robéque asked for it.
The nutmeg?
Where's the nutmeg got to?
Messing around in the kitchen.
They send me mad.
Where is that nutmeg? l hope you like roast veal with sprouts.
We'll leave you to it.
Keep calm!
Not bad... all this, eh?
All yours? lf you need work, there's plenty.
Did you start it?
No. lt was my grandfather.
And then there's land... and well during the war...
And you manage?
Yes, l manage all right. lsn't it rather a man's job? l'm getting tired...
Me too. Let's go back.
No...
Let's go there.
You like making love?
Well, depends who with.
Anyhow... why do you ask me? l don't know. l feel dizzy.
Listen, l can't swim.
Go on... don't be afraid.
No, l mean, do you like it?
What?
Well... making love... l don't know.
You don't know?
That's not a very good sign, is it? l'm a virgin.
Take me for a fool?
You don't believe me.
And yet l've no reason to lie. l'm not proud of it, anyhow. l know what you're thinking.
With the life l lead... the fellows l've had to sleep with because l haven't got a bed... to say nothing of those who try it on l think it's noble of you...
You don't believe me, do you?
You're mad... l do believe you. l really do.
What about you and men?
Here, in winter, it's different.
A game of bowls... and a game of cards
Other kinds of games as well...
And then there are the intellectual pleasures
A fine life, you see! l think you need it.
You know he took us hunting in Mozambique out of season?
Felix?
Yes, Felix.
Can you believe it?
One for you and one for me.
My kingdom for a horse!
The lottery results!
Pass me the tickets there.
For me?
Oh no, for me.
No, not even a consolation prize.
Three cards. l said three.
All l have... 13,500.
Pass.
Er... 20,000.
No, you can't.
Raise it to 13,500.
Bluffing!
No talk!
Anyhow, it's not your turn.
Plenty of time.
You can't raise any more! l know, l've a quarter of an hour to pay.
Go and get me a beer.
You see l can't move.
A beer, nice and cool.
Well, what's up?
Well? l've plenty of time.
See you.
Pass.
3 aces.
4 nines.
You hesitated?
Must be mad!
-lt was dealt...
That's why l took a card.
The classic trick!
And with a hand like that, you didn't raise? l don't have to. ln your place...
No inquests.
Get on with it.
Game's over.
Let's settle up.
Let's go on. l stick to the rules.
Just the last. l win 83,000. l lose 65,000. Not nice.
There must be a loser. l win a thousand.
Good of you. l lose 35,000.
Plus 12,000.
What's the boy's name?
Paul. l'll pay you when l pay the rest l owe you.
Nothing doing.
Pay up now.
What with?
Got a check book?
Who hasn't?
Then pay up.
Now let's eat and drink.
Not hungry?
What about you?
Then let's eat.
Come and sit down.
Tettinger 1955.
Champagne... the artillery of pleasure.
Here.
No thanks.
Yes, drink.
Nice to know you.
You'll come again? l hope so.
Goodbye, little ones.
Where are you off to? l'm going out. Can't l? l've a headache.
Nothing to stop you.
Do me a favor.
Follow them.
Who?
- You know quite well.
Hey! What's up? lt amuses me.
And it won't be for nothing.
Shall l tear it up?
Yes, tear it up, do. l'll tear it up, l promise.
You brought me luck. l was losing.
Why did you keep looking at me?
Are you annoyed?
No, but why keep looking at me?
Was it so noticeable? l asked you why.
Why?
You're a girl.
You're pretty.
And l like pretty girls.
You'll take me for an ogre.
May l?
Why?
Because you're an ogre.
Go along.
Take the wheel.
Not frightened of being with an ogre?
Not a bit.
Suppose l tried to... kiss you...
What'd you do?
Put you in your place.
And if l used force? l'd fight.
Let's go on.
You shouldn't have...
Why not?
After what l said.
Why? lt puts me at a disadvantage.
Don't be so proud!
Coming, idiot? l've torn my pants.
What do you do? l draw does.
Does?
Yes, does. lt's too long to explain. l'd rather be kissed.
Very well!
Wait, l'll tell you why.
Two guys, Robéque and Riais are following us.
Disappointment for them. l'm broke. l'm not joking.
They were playing poker at Frédérique's.
She asked them to.
She told you so? l just guessed it.
But why should she?
No particular reason.
She's bored. lt amuses her to know what l do.
She'll be happy.
Happy l kissed you?
Of course.
You've a great sense of friendship.
Oh, the dirty bitch!
Shall l make a fire?
A pity.
There'd have been a justification for the fire and the music... and the whisky l'll offer you.
What justification?
Making love to you...
Make yourself comfortable.
Do you know why we were followed? l don't give a damn. l must tell you something.
Tell me.
No, l don't want to.
Tell me. Why not?
No, it'd be silly.
And it doesn't matter.
Tell me anyhow.
Please don't insist.
Tell me.
Can l see you?
She's back?
She's at his place. l must say she only put up a slight resistance.
First he took her round the citadel.
We couldn't hear... but l suppose it was the usual.
She played it cool at first.
But finally she must have been overcome by his patter.
The two of them looked very... touching.
A romantic ballad... an idyll.
A petting party...
Think it funny?
Damned funny!
What do girls think of?
You can go now.
A slight formality.
My check.
You lout!
The laborer's worthy of his hire.
Night, sweetheart.
Go and buy some new pants.
Glad you noticed.
Hallo, darling.
Know where l've been?
With a man.
You don't ask if l love him.
Do you? l don't know. l think not.
And you don't ask... what l did. l can guess that easy enough.
Want some tea?
- Yes please.
Drink from my cup... if you don't mind too much.
Not too much.
Bread?
So... what's the young man's name?
Paul Thomas.
Not the architect?
You know perfectly well.
He seems all right. l hardly know him. l hope you'll be happy.
That's all l want.
How nice of you to call. l'm not disturbing you, am l?
Not at all. l came to see what you do.
You weren't too bored last night?
No, it was a very pleasant evening.
Three hours of poker... a bit boring, eh?
The faces of your friends were funny.
Let's go over there.
You like that?
An ingenious idea!
Yes, very much.
Should be finished in two months.
An amusing idea.
Houses all the same... but all different.
Anyhow, it's cheap.
You seem happy. l am. l'm happy that you're happy.
Let's drink to that.
Terrific!
You really know what's what in comfort.
To your very good health.
You like that girl?
What girl?
Don't be a hypocrite.
Why.
Who?
You know quite well who l mean.
The girl who's living with me.
Couldn't keep your eyes off her.
Her name's Why? l didn't know.
You didn't ask her? l must have forgotten to.
You don't love her? l don't know.
Why should l?
But you slept... spent the night with her.
Oh yes?
You're trembling.
- Not at all.
Yes you are. l'm not.
Another drink?
What's the time?
Ten past three. l had a date with your protégé at three. l'd quite forgotten.
Your turn, sweetie!
Not many people here. lt's Saturday. l think... l've drunk too much.
Can't you stand it?
Yes...
But l'm a little tired.
What's up?
Why not go to your date?
Think l ought to?
She'll be hurt.
Not so much as if l dropped her in three or four weeks.
Want to give me to her? l must go home. l feel as if... my cheeks are burning...
This bed's not been used!
No, don't touch me...
Yes, touch me.
Kiss me.
You know Paul Thomas?
- Yes.
Seen him today?
- Not today. lf you see him, ask him to call me.
Okay!
Come in, sweet child, and have tea with us.
We're playing animal noises.
You know it? l make a noise... you have to guess what.
Like this...
A dog.
A sheep...
Understand?
Your turn.
Listen!
Now what's this? l'll begin again.
A wolf.
Yes. Your turn. l know. Well, Why?
A hyena!
Your turn, Why.
Just do any animal... a snake, a pig
Dear little Why...
What's that?
Do you know, Albert?
No, do it again. lt wouldn't be a crocodile?
Of course.
You're right! A crocodile!
Visitors!
Ah, there you are! l'm sorry l didn't turn up for our date.
Not annoyed?
No, why should l be?
Let's stop play-acting.
Listen! l'm going to Paris with Paul.
How about that!
Shut up, you two!
You must hate me for it.
You don't know me. l'm sorry, Why... it's all my fault.
Please understand... l'm trying something out...
You have to read between the lines
What lines? l want you to understand... and then forgive me...
Can l stay?
Of course. l realize that... l'm very selfish.
Forget it. l'll wait for you here.
We'll look after her.
Behave yourselves, you two.
Sex!
We'd rather stuff ourselves.
Come and eat!
Where is the kid? lt'll be uneatable. l used sea water.
An asado is moistened with sea water!
Know what an asado is? ln the South American pampas... the 100-m.p.h. wind... throws burning coals on meat like this.
We've a grill.
Silence!
Go back to your kitchen!
Tell me if it's good or not. lt's very good.
''lf you see an animal, come for shelter.
''lt's probably a man.''
A Finnish proverb...
''Girls are nice, why are there nasty women?''
Meaning?
''A baker shouldn't be a butter-head.''
Understand his proverbs?
''The devil had no goat... yet he sold all sorts of cheese.
Red, white and blue...'' ldiotic!
At home with a fire and a full stomach is better than begging out of doors, eh?
Yes.
She's spoken!
My little ones!
We thought you were dead.
How sad!
My nightingale.
How are you, darling?
She's been nasty to us.
Jealous!
But we said...
That you made money and weren't afraid of men.
Don't listen.
They're hateful.
You're not dressed.
Headache still?
Just a bit tired.
So l lay down.
Here's your dessert. lt'll turn your head.
They've drowned it in kirsch.
Oh, those two!
Let's talk.
Go on.
Don't interrupt me because... it's a complicated story.
Paul and l... l'm listening.
Don't keep interrupting.
The little affair... the two of you had... wasn't really... very serious, was it?
What happened to me... was terrific! l don't easily fall for a man... but with Paul...
When l suggested... going with him to Paris... he said yes immediately.
Of course.
What man wouldn't?
Not angry?
Not at all. l was afraid you'd be.
Nonsense!
Don't be silly. l'm very pleased. lt was lovely in Paris.
We went for long walks... and to the Louvre...
He took me to his sites.
He loves his job.
He gave me books on architecture.
He's charming with me.
He's funny, you know. l like being with him.
At first l thought...
But an odd thing happened.
You're in love. l must be mad!
And him?
Yes, he is too... or so he says.
But it must be true.
When l suggested he live here, he said yes.
He'll live here?
Think it's silly?
Not at all. lt's wonderful for you. lt's the best thing in life.
There's nothing silly about it. l am so happy...
Sure you're not angry?
On the contrary. l'll go back downstairs.
How they annoy me!
They annoy me!
Who do?
Those two... the lovers...
Look at them.
No time.
Holding hands... and whispering
At their age! l can't stand him.
He's after her money.
Look who's talking...
Tell me what you think. lt's shit.
Anyhow...
Everything is shit. l'm cold all of a sudden.
Aren't you?
Want to go in? l'll get your shawl.
Where is it? ln the cupboard.
My dear little Why.
Would you get me a glass of water?
You're lovely.
Very much on form now.
What's up?
My face needed doing up.
You look odd.
Well, so do you.
Frédérique lends me everything... whenever l want.
Using other people's things... is like changing your skin. l don't see that.
Because you're a man.
Because you're a man...
She lends me her things.
Does that surprise you?
Nothing surprises me in this house.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
How long have you known Why? l thought l'd told you.
A month and a half.
And the two fairies?
That's lost in the mists of time.
Why do you ask? l think they hate me.
There's something morbid about this house. l think you're exaggerating a little. l can't say l adore them.
Shall l send them back to Paris?
Let's not go as far as that.
Can we talk a moment?
What do you want?
- We'll be quieter in there.
Are you... happy here now?
Why?
Frédérique's quite... mad over that dirty beast.
So what?
You don't think you can do anything but l'm a revolutionary. l take action. l'm fine as things are.
Don't try to teach your grandmother to suck eggs.
Are you happy?
Leave me alone!
Stupid bitch! l want to talk to you.
That should have been done long ago
But why did he ask you that?
They're jealous of our happiness.
Are you happy with us?
They think Paul has changed their lives.
Bastards!
Cheer up! Till tonight.
What's up?
Someone's put something in it.
- lndeed.
Get out! l've had enough of you.
Get out!
We did nothing.
Leave immediately. l want you out of this house.
Explain, darling.
We didn't do it.
Get out, l say!
Must l use other methods?
Let's not argue. Come along.
Can't even defend ourselves.
What is all this from a cosmic standpoint?
Why not ask the cook?
Get out!
We haven't a penny... lt's not enough even for second class.
And a taxi to the station.
And dinner on the train...
600 miles without food.
Well, we don't hold it against you.
So long, darling.
Till next time.
- Come on.
Breakfast is ready.
What did you say?
Breakfast is ready.
Up already?
- For 2 hours. l've been for a walk.
And l've made breakfast. l've picked flowers for you. l'm beginning to live again since they left. l feel rather guilty.
Enough of them was as good as a feast.
Collecting types like that...
Darling, would you... go and get some butter?
Till this evening, darling.
Drinking on your own?
- l like cognac.
No criticism.
Give us a drink.
Let's get drunk.
Shall we, Why?
Yes, why not? l always have good ideas.
Put on a record.
Why, give us some music.
A man wanted to discover wisdom.
He read all the books, but he didn't find it.
So they told him to go to lndia.
So he saved up and went to lndia but when he got there, nobody knew
But they said that up in the mountains there lived an old sage who knew what wisdom was.
So he went to the mountains and walked
He climbed...
He climbed for months... and at last he found the sage.
He said to him...
Good morning, sir.
They say you know all the truth about
Existence.
No, human wisdom...
No, the sense...
What was l saying?
Darling, change the record...
Well, then... the sage said he didn't...
Listen!
The sage didn't know.
He said:
Come back in 40 years and l'll tell you.
But there's an older man than me.
He'll tell you.
So the man walked on for months to see the older man.
And said:
Sir, what is wisdom?
And the old man... the old sage
1 10 years old...
He said
Human wisdom is a river...
And he said... he... he said
And the man said: l've walked for months and all you say is wisdom is a river.
And the sage said...
Wait a bit...
Don't be a pessimist. l'm not a pessimist. l don't give a damn!
Let's go to bed.
You're both lovely... my darling does.
Coming?
Why did we get drunk?
Just to drink. l love you both so.
Dear Why
We didn't want to wake you
Paul has to go to Paris on urgent business. l'm going with him, of course.
We'll be away a day or two.
The house is yours.
Try not to get bored.
There's money in the drawer.
Kisses from us both... l'm going with him, of course.
Try not to get bored.
Try not to get bored.
Kisses from us both.
There's money in the drawer.
Kisses from us both.
The house is yours.
We didn't want to wake you
Paul has to go l'm going with him, of course. l'm going with him, of course.
We'll be away a day or two.
There's money in the drawer.
Kisses from us both. l want a taxi...
Villa La Rebijoye.
You're leaving?
Yes.
Goodbye, Violette. Thanks.
When will you be back?
Never.
Why did you come? l was bored alone.
Alone in that empty house. l need people. l'm cold.
Awful things would have happened there if l'd stayed.
What things? l don't know.
Never heard shouts?
What kind of shouts? ln your head.
People quarrelling. lt may be in my head.
Who knows...
Sometimes they sing... and insult one another endlessly.
They don't talk to you...
But when they do, it's worse.
They shout louder.
What do they say?
They've nothing against me.
They just shout, that's all.
They're tired of shouting at each other.
They want someone else.
As luck would have it, they choose you. l won't go back there. l'll stay with you.
With you and Paul.
Keep me with you.
Oh, it's you.
Of course l was waiting for you lmmediately?
Very good.
Of course l don't mind.
Me too. l'm dining with him...
Hurry! He's waiting. l've finished. l can't go on as l was before. l can't live without them.
Who's them?
You and Paul.
Get out! l loved you both so much.
You're frightful...
You're disgusting!
Why?
Your love disgusts me.
Can't you see you're not wanted?
Goodbye to you.
What shall l do? l'd like to throw someone out. l'm fed up too.
Not easy to leave now...
Now that l'm used to it.
Why are you angry, Frédérique?
Because l love you?
Because l love you or because l love Paul?
You're all l've known.
Why hold my happiness against me?
My meeting you and loving Paul. l'll go. Don't worry. l'll go immediately.
You'll never see me again since that's what you want.
Don't be afraid...
And now, Frédérique, l can tell you
Have you noticed we look like one another?
The same skin.
The same hair.
The same mouth.
The same expression, sometimes.
The same tastes.
How should l not love you... and love Paul?
As you yourself...
Paul, my love.
No, l've changed my mind.
You come here.
We'll dine in our room.
No, l'm not mad. l want to be alone with you.
No, l'm not mad. l want to be with you... all alone.

THREE RESURRECTED DRUNKARDS
I just up and died
I just up and died
I just up and died
And went off to heaven
Right up a long stairway
A stairway of pretty clouds
I climbed all the way up
Stumbling back and forth
Tottering and swaying
I kept on a-climbing
Until I finally made it
To heaven's gate
Heaven's a cool place
Come up and see
The booze is good
And the girls are pretty
The way I died
Was while driving drunk
I just up and died
I just up and died
I just up and died
And went off to heaven
But here in heaven
There's a mean ole god
He takes your booze away
And hollers all the time
"Listen here: Heaven ain't
such an easygoing place!
Be more serious!"
Heaven's a cool place
Come up and see
The booze is good
And the girls are pretty
I just keep on drinking
All day, every day
Now I've forgotten
All about that mean ole god
I told you
we shouldn't go swimming.
- Why'd they leave money?
- Who knows a thief's mind?
This was no thief. Somebody just
needed to borrow some clothes
and left 500 yen apiece
in appreciation.
Beanpole, didn't you have the cigarettes?
- They were in my pocket.
- My student ID was in mine.
Shit!
Out here they won't know yet that the price has gone up.
We only have 1,000 yen.
Let's try.
A pack of Shinsei, please.
Forty yen, right?
Shinsei are 40 yen?
That's right, granny.
All over Japan.
All over Japan?
Just a minute.
Hello, police?
Three odd fellows here are saying that Shinsei cost 40 yen.
You said to watch for people who don't know the new price.
It must be them!
You boys must be them.
You rascal!
Who's them?
- Them... rascal!
- Rascal!
He says they're 40 yen all over Japan.
All right, I'll give you 50.
They're still here.
Why get so worked up over 10 yen that they'd send out patrol cars?
The police have plenty of money.
I guess they get the extra 10 yen.
- No, it's 'cause we're them.
- Oh yeah, right.
Beanpole, at least the police won't notice you.
What are you doing here?
We were just... you know...
Beanpole, you talk to him.
Where's the nearest bus stop?
The bus station?
You're looking for transportation.
You must be them.
That's right.
You don't wear Japanese sandals much, do you?
Not once since he was born.
They're uncomfortable.
Never worn them?
I see.
Come with me.
We just forgot the price went up.
Ever forget things, pops?
We said we'd pay the 10 yen later.
We just forgot.
Get up!
Don't be so rough!
We haven't done anything wrong.
- We going to the police box?
- Police headquarters!
The lmjin River's clear waters
Flowing on and on
Shore birds flocking together
Flying free across the sky
Here in the southern lands
I call home
Oh, those distant memories
Of the lmjin's clear waters
Flowing on and on
Our clothes!
Thief!
- It's these clothes.
- I could just go on to Tokyo.
- And leave us here?
- You can't come dressed like that.
Can't buy two outfits with only 1,000 yen.
Why don't we go to the police and explain?
Tell them somebody took our clothes while we were swimming?
They won't believe us.
I'm dizzy.
I'm dizzy
I'm hungry.
Heat's worse when you're hungry.
How long do we have to stay here?
The town's full of police spies.
We're better off naked.
Better to take someone else's clothes.
You mean steal?
- She said to steal some clothes.
- Yeah, she did.
You need kid's clothes!
CRACK DOWN
ON STOWAWAYS WEEK
You done with that?
Oh, yeah.
Thank you for your hard work, Officer.
Don't be silly.
Have they... -
No, not yet.
Those guys are quick.
Came all the way from Korea, so they're desperate not to get caught.
Korea?
Stowaways.
There are lots of them lately.
We have to work all night... - a real drag.
So you still haven't caught them?
No.
Do you know what they look like?
No, just their heights.
I'll catch cold like this.
Thank goodness.
What are you doing?
A memento of when we were mistaken for Korean stowaways.
Get rid of those.
Nobody will believe what we went through.
I guess it's quite a life experience.
The final adventure of our student days.
Idiots! What if we're caught in the dragnet?
That girl thought we really were Korean.
She had a nice look in her eye.
One that says,
"Steal if you have to," right?
- Did you come to return our clothes?
- Did you just throw ours away?
Yes.
Go get them.
Yes, sir.
Here they are.
Did you take anything out of our pockets, like money or a student ID?
Yes.
I'll be keeping them.
Put those on.
You've gotta be kidding!
We've had enough!
Put them on!
What if we refuse?
It's real!
Okay, we'll put them on!
- Then you'll let us go?
- Put them on!
We are.
Now what?
Are you going to shoot us?
Hurry up!
You are now Corporal Cheonil Yi of the Korean Army.
You came as a stowaway to evade serving in Vietnam.
And you're Korean high school student Hwa Kim.
You came along with Cheonil Yi in hopes of entering a Japanese university.
That's actually you two.
But your hopes were in vain, because an unknown assailant shot you right here.
The Japanese newspapers will have a big question mark in their headlines and leave it at that.
- What about me?
- I don't want to kill unnecessarily.
I see.
But you're Japanese, so I can't believe you'd stay silent.
Their bodies will be discovered tomorrow morning.
Your bleached bones will be found much later... up in the hills.
Button your collar!
A Korean soldier has to look sharp!
It's buttoned wrong!
But...
Run!
- We had one foot in hell.
- Looks like they didn't follow us.
We made it.
Final adventure of our student days?
This is the dramatic grand finale.
But nobody's going to believe it.
A Korean corporal.
Korean Corporal Cheonil Yi, and Hwa Kim, Korean student!
- And who am I?
- You're just a beanpole.
OMURA PRISON... - NAGASAKI
Cheonil Yi, Hwa Kim, and Beanpole:
You are hereby sentenced to deportation.
SEA OF JAPAN
Good-bye, Japan.
Good-bye, Japan.
PUSAN HARBOR
PRISON
You all volunteered
to go to Vietnam.
BARRACKS
THE EAST CHINA SEA
Good-bye, Korea.
U.S. ARMY HEADQUARTERS
SAIGON
THE FRONT LINES
I wish I'd met you earlier, but now I'm dead.
I wish I'd met you earlier, but now I'm dead.
You couldn't steal any clothes?
You're hopeless.
Quick, take those off.
It's a long story. Please listen.
You'll get caught, after crossing all that sea!
We didn't cross the sea.
We just took a dip in the water.
You mind dressing like a girl?
Who the hell is this girl?
She's a nice person.
You have relatives in Tokyo?
Nope, we just rent a room.
Idiot. Why not just tell her the whole truth?
I already know the truth.
Don't say a word.
We're not Kor... -
Don't talk.
Heart-to-heart communication is best... -
You won't get away!
Dressing up in different clothes
won't help you!
Even dressed as a girl?
It's your height.
Is something wrong?
What are you doing
with those guys?
Who does he mean?
This is a girl.
Damn it! Are you flirting with them under my nose?
You were wetting your bed just yesterday!
It's her he's after, not us.
Turn around!
You've been an incontinent brat since you were small!
I don't know how many times you peed on my back as I patiently carried you from village to town!
Bought you milk with my own food money! And this is your thanks!
A nice girl like her wouldn't wet her bed!
I'll go comfort her.
Hey, pisser!
Turn around, you bed-wetter!
Look at me!
The corporal isn't here.
You're giving my notebook back?
Turn around, pisser!
I CAN'T PRONOUNCE JAPANESE,
SO I'LL WRITE INSTEAD.
SORRY WE HAD
TO TAKE YOUR CLOTHES.
Then give them back!
AND I'M SORRY
WE HAVE TO KILL YOU ALL TOO.
You'd really do it?
YES.
Why even bother to tell us?
Shall we kill him first?
He's all alone.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
HOW SORRY WE ARE.
GOOD-BYE.
- How do we do it?
- Let's push him off.
A student ID.
That's mine.
And that's mine.
You! Get down here!
You bitch!
Causing all this trouble!
Pops, stop it!
What?
You kidnapped my daughter!
How about I call the cops?
Hey! Attempted kidnapping!
Female abduction!
Are they going to get on?
They will if we do.
Damn it.
- I'm going.
- What for?
To save her
from her inhuman foster father.
Fool! You're walking
right into a gun!
If I let her go now,
I may never meet
a girl like her again.
''And I'm sorry
we have to kill you all too."
Think we're safe just staying here?
Fool! If I die,
I want to die by her side.
She'll nurse me back to life.
You guys don't understand.
Wait! Think this through!
It's her!
It's him!
Hey, we don't have tickets.
Occupied.
Tell him.
Excuse us, but this is life or death.
We'll pay in Tokyo.
Please let us go, conductor.
The conductor's in the next car.
Come out here.
Are you going to shoot?
We're in a tunnel.
How many tunnels to Tokyo?
- It stinks!
- Just hold on!
Think he'll pass as a Korean corporal dressed as a girl?
Listen...
I don't want to die in a skirt.
- Did you toss the uniform?
Didn't you notice?
That girl's wearing your uniform.
She looks like a real soldier.
Go see for yourself in the next car.
We're safe!
Use your head while you're still alive.
You've really done it now, smarty-pants.
Now he'll make us change and shoot us for real!
Goddamn you!
Terribly sorry to disturb you, but might I have the clothes the young lady is wearing?
How dare you!
Have you no shame?
You just want to see her naked!
How about for 20,000 yen?
20,000 yen?
Make it 40,000.
Very well.
I want the student uniform in her bag too.
Fine. 80,000 for both.
You have the uniform?
You slut!
You did it with a student too?
That'll be 80,000 yen.
Get those clothes off now!
No, I won't.
You fool! It's 80,000 yen!
Now strip!
Are you a policeman?
Stay here!
Running after men like a cat in heat!
I brought the clothes.
Please change.
We refuse.
- Open up.
- No.
Then we'll put them on you
after we kill you.
Wait. If I'm gonna die,
I wanna die in her clothes.
I'm opening up.
Such a short-lived romance.
It still won't button right.
Don't worry.
We'll button it later.
Like this?
There are two of us.
We need two bodies.
How can you say that at a time like this?
It'd be nice if a couple bodies just fell from the sky.
Damn, if only this were Vietnam.
There are corpses all over the place there.
Use my body, please!
What?
That would be such a waste!
I want to die with him.
Fool! With this poisonous bug?
He may be your foster father, but you don't owe him anything.
He's not my father.
Then why die with a complete stranger?
He's my husband.
Please fire.
Wait a minute.
Would a Korean shoot a Korean?
We're Koreans!
Stop! We can't kill Koreans.
- Are you Japanese?
- No. I'm Korean.
- Why?
- Because I am.
Are you Japanese?
Why?
- No, I'm Korean.
- Why?
Because I am.
Are you Japanese?
Are you Japanese?
No.
I just up and died
I just up and died
I just up and died
And went off to heaven
Right up a long stairway
A stairway of pretty clouds
I climbed all the way up
Stumbling back and forth
Tottering and swaying
I kept on a-climbing
Until I finally made it
To heaven's gate
Heaven's a cool place
Come up and see
The booze is good
And the girls are pretty
The way I died
Was while driving drunk
I just up and died
I just up and died
I just up and died
And went off to heaven
But here in heaven
There's a mean ole god
He takes your booze away
And hollers all the time
"Listen here: Heaven ain't
such an easygoing place!
Be more serious!"
Heaven's a cool place
Come up and see
The booze is good
And the girls are pretty
I just keep on drinking
All day, every day
Now I've forgotten
All about that mean ole god
I told you
we shouldn't go swimming.
- Why'd they leave money?
- Who knows a thief's mind?
This was no thief. Somebody just
needed to borrow some clothes
and left 500 yen apiece
in appreciation.
Beanpole, didn't you have the cigarettes?
- They were in my pocket.
- My student ID was in mine.
Shit!
Out here they won't know yet that the price went up.
We only have 1,000 yen.
Let's try.
A pack of Shinsei, please.
Forty yen, right?
Shinsei are 40 yen?
That's right, granny.
All over Japan.
All over Japan?
Just a minute.
Hello, police?
Three odd fellows here are saying that Shinsei cost 40 yen.
You said to watch for people who don't know the new price.
It must be them!
You boys must be them.
You rascal!
Who's them?
- Them... rascal!
- Rascal!
He says they're 40 yen all over Japan.
All right, I'll give you 50.
They're still here.
A pack of Shinsei is 50 yen, right?
I'll just borrow a match.
What's going on?
Police?
There are three odd fellows here.
He just left.
Go after him.
Excuse me.
Where's the nearest bus stop?
It's hard to explain.
I'll take you there.
Thanks.
Could you please take a look at my foot?
I'm no doctor.
STOWAWAYS?
REPORT ALL SUSPICIOUS
PERSONS TO THE POLICE
Walk straight ahead.
We'll be fine from here on.
We'll just go where we like.
Disregarding others' kindness is un-Japanese!
Where's that nice dog of yours?
Right behind me.
- Let's go.
- Let's steal some clothes.
Wait till we meet her.
How can you be so calm when we're in danger?
We weren't in danger until after the bath.
We're safe in here.
Let's enjoy it a bit longer.
Hurry up, miss!
Hey, let's go.
- She isn't coming, you fool.
- What do you mean?
Hurry up!
Better to take someone else's clothes.
Right away!
We'll be waiting out front.
You don't have them, do you?
Of course not.
Didn't she say to go this way?
Don't worry.
Those guys aren't there.
Let's go.
Why don't we take this other road instead?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Not that way.
It's all right.
We had the clothes last time.
It's best not to follow me.
Let's go back.
It's okay.
Why are you going that way?
I'll go where I want!
But it's dangerous.
Well, maybe it's okay this time, since the clothes aren't a problem.
What?
You're just after the clothes?
Run!
- Did you just throw our clothes away?
- Yes.
Go get them.
Yes, sir.
Here they are.
Put them on.
You've gotta be kidding!
We've had enough!
Put them on!
You are now Corporal... -
Cheonil Yi... - that's me.
I came as a stowaway to evade serving in Vietnam.
Korean high school student
Hwa Kim... - that's me.
I came with Cheonil Yi in hopes of entering a Japanese university.
Are you spies?
How do you know all that?
But our hopes were in vain, because an unknown assailant shot us right here.
The Japanese newspapers will have a big question mark in their headlines.
Hurry up.
Son of a bitch!
I know. My bleached bones will be found later.
Button your collar!
A Korean soldier has to look sharp!
You gonna button it wrong again this time?
It's buttoned wrong.
But...
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Korean soldiers don't fight with students!
But I'm Cheonil Yi!
And I'm Hwa Kim!
And I'm a Korean beanpole.
So you understand?
Then die with those names.
We thank you deeply,
Japanese youth.
- What? We're Korean.
- One hundred percent!
You look a little odd.
Where are you from?
Who tries to kill Koreans?
Are you two Japanese?
Cut the crap!
We're stowaway Korean soldiers.
Prove it.
Buy some time.
You can't shoot until you prove it.
What are you talking about?
I'm a genuine Korean soldier.
A Korean recruit makes 60 won, private 2nd class 90 won, private 1st class 120 won, leading private 150 won, corporal 180 won.
Right. I'm a Korean corporal, and I make 180 won.
How much are Korean cigarettes?
Pagoda Filters cost 35 won.
You can't even buy six packs a month.
In Vietnam, you'd get 343,200 won for dying instantly, a protracted death would be 228,400 won... and a slow death would be 171,600 won.
The three of you together couldn't even buy a car.
What's so funny?
Those are funny pants... like that girl's.
You're a rascal, aren't you?
Still here, in those clothes?
They're picking a fight, saying we're not Korean.
Isn't that dumb?
You tell 'em, miss.
I'm not sure who you are, but these three poor souls just snuck into Japan from Korea.
Please let them go.
Miss, if these are Koreans, please leave it to us.
What would Japanese like you know about Koreans?
We Koreans... -
Wait!
Good-bye.
Please wait.
If you go now, we Koreans... -
Flirting again?
Who are you?
They're stowaways from Korea.
So you came a long way across the sea! Good job!
These strange Japanese men are harassing them.
What's that?
We're the ones who crossed the sea.
Good job to you too!
One, two, three, four, five.
- Who'd come over dressed like that?
- Japanese impersonating Koreans!
I'm Cheonil Yi!
So am I!
Hold on a sec.
I'll find out for sure.
I've got 15 years' experience.
Stowaways bring plenty of money.
What's this?
I've never seen such poor stowaways!
This is a disgrace!
I can't believe we're countrymen!
You have people in Tokyo who'll pay for you, right?
Yes, I have parents and a brother and sister there.
I have two brothers in Tokyo and one in Shizuoka.
Great!
I'll take you all the way to Tokyo tomorrow.
We'll even stop at the Ito hot springs.
Good night.
It's nice to be alive
and sleeping in a futon.
You think it's safe to sleep?
Sure they won't sneak in here and shoot us?
Or this one might do us in.
He might be angry about the girl.
That poisonous bug could come in through here and stab us!
Hey, wake up.
What is it?
Let's run for it.
There's only one futon.
Don't be such a prude!
So what if they're young?
Service as usual!
- But they're lying.
Then service for both groups!
- No.
Go!
He's on top of her.
Stop peeping.
Are they in this together?
That's why I said to run for it.
Button it right this time.
That's what he meant by "service."
Give it up.
He's asleep.
Maybe he's calling for his mother in Korean.
I can't look.
He says he looks after her, but he's just a poisonous bug!
You're gonna lose your gun.
He isn't human.
This is like Beauty and the Bug.
I can't take it.
That's not the face of a man who's about to die.
Yeah, you should be grimacing.
Yeah, grimace.
Not your whole face.
Just the half he's aiming at.
Grimace or cramp... - it shows which side is going to die first.
A little more.
Don't shoot!
Ah, sorry.
I couldn't sleep last night.
They aren't chasing us anymore.
If they do, we'll use these.
I'm glad we're going to Tokyo together.
That was some act you put on last night.
What act?
That we're Korean and they're Japanese.
That was no act.
It's all true.
That's right.
We're originally Korean.
Don't pretend for her.
Miss, we're really Japanese.
What are you talking about?
I'm Cheonil Yi.
And I'm Hwa Kim.
And me?
You saying you're Japanese?
Can you take these four to the train station? It's okay, guys!
The lmjin River's clear waters
Flowing on and on
Shore birds flocking together
Flying free across the sky
Here in the southern lands
I call home
Oh, those distant memories
Of the lmjin's clear waters
Flowing on and on
From the northern plains
To the southern skies
What's that?
A hand.
And a face!
Driver.
It's three against one!
Drop it.
Get a rock.
I wonder how
I should grimace right now.
Listen...
Drop the gun.
Stop the truck!
Shoot!
You did it!
I knew last night that you were the real Koreans.
But now you've killed two Japanese men, and that might mean a little problem.
But I'm here to help.
Leave everything to me.
Money makes the world go round.
It can fix anything.
You'd take us all the way to Tokyo?
Of course... and anything else you need.
I'll look after you like I do with her.
See how I followed when she ran away?
I'll look after you your whole lives.
Poisonous bug!
Where are you going?
Please wait.
He claimed to take care of you, but he made you his mistress.
He worked you like a servant and even made you service complete strangers.
He's a poisonous bug, a viper.
It's good you're free of him.
You're not Koreans.
I am. I'm Cheonil Yi.
We're Japanese.
You're no Koreans.
Koreans wouldn't kill other Koreans.
That man may have been a bug, but he was Korean.
Good-bye.
You mean... this is the end?
- We'll meet once again.
- Thank you.
Next time we'll meet as enemies, and you'll kill me or I'll kill you.
Then let's not meet.
No, we certainly will.
Damn it!
Why did I shoot?
- That was some experience!
- It sure was.
Now for the grand finale in Tokyo.
Such a short-lived romance.
Cut it out.
Your first love is the hardest, and you can never go back.
Then let's go back to the beach and redo it.
I've had enough of the beach.
Why so rattled?
We're Japanese.
We have nothing to fear in Japan.
But I'm Cheonil Yi.
And I'm Hwa Kim.
What's that for?
Still in a Korean daze?
Get over it before we reach Tokyo.
"What would Japanese like you know about Koreans?"
We'll be adding one first-class
and two second-class cars at this station.
If this were a movie... she'd come running into my arms now.
Yeah, if it was by some stupid Japanese director.
It's you, isn't it?
But you died.
You're still with him?
Quit it.
This is too creepy.
Have we become enemies now, like you said?
If these two are here, that means...
Relax. They're not here.
Start walking.
The bathroom again?
That's right. The bathroom.
How many tunnels to Tokyo?
It stinks!
Just hold on!
Think he'll pass as a Korean corporal dressed as a girl?
I can't be Cheonil Yi, can I?
I don't want to die in a skirt.
- Open up for your clothes.
- No.
- Open up.
- No!
Then we'll put them on you
after we kill you.
Wait a second.
If I have to die,
I want to wear her clothes.
I'm opening up.
A tunnel's coming.
Hurry up and change.
Is it okay for a Korean to shoot other Koreans?
You shot me first, didn't you?
I'm Cheonil Yi!
I'm Hwa Kim!
I'm the Korean beanpole!

Hey, stop.
What are you doing?
Hey!
H- hot!
Not ready yet?
Be patient.
But I've got a TV rehearsal.
What a hustler.
Give me a hand!
- Hurry up!
- I know.
- Your bandage...
- Oh yeah.
Over there.
Pose.
It's summer by the sea... come on now.
Hurry!
This isn't a thriller!
- What is it?
- What's wrong?
Watch out!
ATRAGON
It's dangerous. Keep back.
Your stolen car?
Yes, I'm certain.
How did it get stolen?
I was waiting for Mr. Shindo at Towa Construction Company.
Suddenly, I was choked and passed out.
A kidnapper wouldn't jump into a cold sea...
Who are you?
I'm a reporter.
Will you explain again?
Again?
Until I'm satisfied.
You were taking PR pictures.
What time was it?
About 20 minutes past 12.
A man came out of the sea?
- Yes.
- Here, right here.
He appeared suddenly.
Seemed made out of vapor, didn't he?
Or steam.
Be serious, will you?
We are... as truthful as a camera.
Why would he let off steam?
I don't know. But it's true.
Officer...
The hands that choked me from behind were hot, like fire!
Officer.
What is it?
Nothing down there.
I didn't find any bodies.
There!
- Get on the ball! I found a model!
- A model?
Miss!
Very nice.
A nice model.
What?
It's Action Magazine.
They want the cover picture.
It's ready. So-so.
So-so? I like that.
- Mad? Find her then.
- Why?
For my model.
But 10 million people in Tokyo, about half are women... I can't find her.
Find this number.
Easy.
I've never played sleuth before.
"SO 72-95".
Did you steal something?
What?
Police officers are here.
More questions?
An engineer was kidnapped at a dam site.
He's the second man since last night.
Vapor man again?
Gave off steam like a geyser.
Geyser man?
So you believe us now?
No! We have no evidence at all...
Only one thing to go on.
Those two who were kidnapped are civil engineers and experts on cave-ins.
Was it a coincidence?
By the way...
Earthquake!
The Vapor man!
A man to see you, sir.
U. Unno, True Story Magazine reporter?
His business?
He said he would like to ask you about the Imperial Navy enigma.
Enigma?
Tell him I have nothing to do with it.
You don't?
I see. You are a shipping company president now.
But you're the former Admiral Kusumi of the Japanese Navy.
Am I wrong?
I have no sensational war stories.
You've got one secret?
I feel chilled... excuse me.
About your secret.
A special submarine which never appeared to the public...
A weekly wrote it up...
A-400, the largest submarine.
Old news.
Yes, that's right.
A-400, 401, and 402 were disposed of after the surrender.
That's right.
But there was another submarine sailed on the night the war ended...
...A- 403.
403? Not even interesting as fiction.
The captain was Commander Jinguji...
He was your right-hand man, best sub man...
Where did he go?
You know what his special mission was.
Don't be silly!
He died before the surrender off the coast of Saipan.
A fine man.
He is alive.
What?
That's what reports say.
Hello, it's me.
You found her?
I'm better than a cop.
What now?
What? Get her consent?
Maker her pose nude?
Fool!
I didn't say nude!
It's utterly idiotic!
Groundless entertainment is stupid.
Did my father really die?
Makoto, what are you implying?
I'm sorry.
Your father was a fine Navy officer and unequaled in shipbuilding techniques.
The night before he left for an attack, he came to me and...
...asked me to look after you.
You were 3 at the time.
Did he really have to leave his only child and go?
That's war.
Country comes before personal feelings.
Country?
Yes, patriotism.
Patriotism?
Young people now may not understand it.
It's here.
Kokoku Shipping.
That car!
Come on.
- Should we go to her house?
- That's my boy.
Never let the prey get away? I know.
What's wrong?
Forget that phony reporter's words.
It's not that. Lately a strange man has been following me.
He's watching me when I go out or when I'm near my apartment.
I'm frightened.
Perhaps it's best to notify the police.
If anything happens to you,
I won't be able to face Jinguji.
Where are we? This is a wrong road.
Please be quiet, Admiral.
What? Who are you?
Something's wrong.
They're headed straight for the sea!
Admiral, please get out.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to obey my orders.
Over there!
Hold it!
What's this?
- Violence is not good!
- What are you going to do with them?
I will have them pledge loyalty to the Mu Empire.
The Mu Empire?
I'm Mu Agent No. 23.
You're mad!
It's a mythical Empire which sank into the Pacific Ocean...
...thousands of years ago!
You're well informed.
It's nonsense!
Well, you'll see.
Are you crazy?
Let go!
We have special energy. It's useless.
Be quiet!
Hot!
You two will work for us as slaves.
Slaves?
Uncle!
Our Agents.
- A submarine will come for us soon.
- A submarine?
Admiral, even if you kill me, other agents will come to get you.
Come with me and I won't shoot.
No, we'll meet again.
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPT.
So, you are the one who fired?
Yes.
He escaped into the sea?
The point is they're sent all over the world.
What agent?
A Mu agent.
The Mu Empire? Is it in Africa?
Think so?
No, it sank into the Pacific Ocean
12,000 years ago.
Sir, this.
This is for you, Mr. Kusumi.
For me?
Admiral Kusumi c/o Police Chief Ito.
From Mu Empire Agent No. 23.
It may be an explosive. I'll open it.
- A time bomb?
- Please.
It seems like a film.
The Pacific Ocean...
12,000 years ago, the glorious Mu
Empire existed in the Pacific Ocean.
The whole world was Mu Empire's colony.
You will be shown proof.
Cursed by fate, she sank to the bottom of the sea in one night.
But our ancestors survived.
The Mu people far surpass the people who live on earth.
With terrestrial heat we made a sun.
We live at the bottom of the sea by using buried resources.
Mr. Kusumi, the A-403!
Why is the A-403 there?
The Japanese Navy's pride... it is the best and largest submarine.
Commanded by Capt. Jinguji.
We regret he and his crew were not on it when we took it.
Admiral Kusumi...
Our reports say Capt. Jinguji is building a more powerful...
...and efficient submarine.
Atragon could be called an undersea battleship.
As you know, Admiral.
Now, in conclusion...
Stop the construction of Atragon immediately.
And return the world to the Mu Empire, so we can inhabit the earth again.
Listen to our people's joyous voices!
If you refuse...
...our curse and Manda's, our deity's messenger, will be on you.
Are we sane?
I think so.
So the world was the Mu Empire's colony?
It's a stupid joke.
Ajoke?
Wasn't that the real A-403?
It could be an imitation.
What do you think?
So it's a blackmail case, isn't it?
The police can't cope with it.
The perps are too big.
FILMS THREATEN NATIONS
EMERGENCYMEETING AT U.N.
The U.N. met about the Mu film.
Most of the delegates were skeptical.
It took only 10 minutes to decide to ignore them.
End of special news.
Captain, something ahead!
Captain, starboard...
Stop the engine!
Captain! Captain!
Full speed astern!
SOS, SOS...
MU DECLARATION SHOCKS WORLD
VENICE DESTROYED
HONG KONG IN RUINS
The U.N. sets up a United Defense HQ to cope with the emergency.
Trouble in "B" Block Area, long.
140°31 'E, lat. 9°20'N.
Immediately, orders are sent to the Red Satan...
...the world's newest atomic submarine which is operating in the area.
The Red Satan was crushed by water pressure.
It was the world's best submarine.
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
Of course, we could use the H-bomb.
But I doubt its power in high pressure water.
And its use is limited due to moral principles...
Atragon comes to mind.
We have no idea of its efficiency.
But the Mu Empire has noticed it.
It must have something that they are scared of.
Please contact Captain Jinguji at once.
Contact?
I don't know where he is.
But the film said you know where he is.
I don't know!
Then why did you remain silent when Captain Jinguji left?
Mr. Kusumi.
The U.N. requests that the Atragon be used.
Very well.
I was silent for the Captain's sake, but I will tell you.
The Captain revolted.
Revolted?
That's all.
Yes?
- Police Dept. is on the phone.
- Police Dept.?
Hello. Kusumi speaking.
What? You caught a Mu man?
Sir.
Thank you for coming.
Is he the man who shadowed you?
Yes, he is.
But he is not Agent No. 23 who tried to kidnap us.
No, he was a spare man.
Any evidence?
We've been questioning him, but his only answer is a number... 8561.
8561? The number's too big.
Fool!
I'm not a Mu, I'm a Japanese!
Why did you follow her?
You are trying to kidnap her, so you can find out where Captain Jinguji is.
No!
- Then why?
- Be quiet!
Wait!
It's probably the
Japanese Navy tag number...
Soldiers called them reservation numbers to Yasukuni Shrine.
I'm former Rear Admiral Kusumi.
Your name?
Warrant Officer Amano, sir!
You know me?
Yes, Captain Jinguji told me.
What?
He's alive?
Um...
Is he?
Yes, sir!
Where is he?
- I can't say, sir!
- What!
That's his orders, sir.
Admiral, this earthquake isn't a coincidence.
Remember me? I'm Mu Agent No. 23.
Where is the broadcasting room?
The world must obey the Mu Empire now...
...and become our colony.
Order Captain Jinguji to stop building Atragon.
If you refuse, we will annihilate you!
Officer Amano, where is the Captain?
That's a secret.
Please let me see my father.
It will be against his orders.
I'm a True Story reporter.
Even a dog, if it's alert, notices something.
Officer Amano.
As it is, the world will be destroyed.
Your superior, Captain Jinguji's daughter, too.
You want her to die?
Quiet!
Officer, I know you're loyal to the Captain.
I'll explain to him later, so tell me.
I see.
I can't tell you where he is, but I'll take you, sir.
Mr. Amano, it's all right now, isn't it?
What?
The Atragon base.
Which island is it?
- Navy secret.
- Navy?
Japan renounced war in her constitution.
You'll see.
Why did you bring him?
He would write it up if we didn't.
With us, the secret is safe.
Hierarch, Agent No. 23 has returned.
Will we know soon where
Captain Jinguji's base is?
Yes, a contact party of Kusumi has left.
Good.
It will please our Majesty.
Just wait and see.
We'll find out where it is.
Keep an eye on them.
Yes, sir.
What happened?
Cave-in! Power Room 57!
What?
The Japanese slaves just finished checking!
- Send them again!
- Yes, sir.
Hurry up!
Oh, Mu God!
We are trying to build a glorious Mu Empire on earth again!
Oh, Mu God!
Please transfer our hardships to the slaves on earth!
- Don't salute. This isn't the Navy.
- Yes, sir.
We left the plane 3 days ago.
How much longer will it take?
- We will arrive at midnight.
- Midnight?
- What's the name of the island?
- You'll see, sir.
A stubborn fellow.
What is it? Depressed?
It's nothing.
I'm worried.
What would my father think if he knew I came?
Oh, that...
Of course he would give you a big welcome.
You think so?
Are you bitter towards him?
No, I'm not.
But I don't understand him.
A father loves his child.
He was worried about you. That's why he sent the Warrant Officer secretly.
Then why didn't he say so?
It's an old-fashioned patriotism.
People thought it effeminate to think of home.
Please go in.
We can't afford to be caught.
Hey!
Please get ready to land! Hurry!
There?
Yes.
My hunch was wrong! I thought it would be an uninhabited island.
It's big!
All right, get off now.
Who is it?
It's... it's me!
What?
It's me.
Oh, Amano, all right.
Please.
Please get in.
It's stuck!
Here.
Everyone, please get out and push!
Are you ready?
Huh? Where is the True Story's reporter?
There he is.
How can you?
Look at that. It's amazing!
Iron pyrites, bauxite, manganese.
Untapped resources!
GOTEN KENBU CORPS
Amano is back!
This is Admiral Kusumi.
I am Lieutenant Fuji.
I'm Kusumi.
This is Miss Jinguji.
Please relax. The Captain?
I'll contact him, sir!
Amano, ask them to rest.
Mr. Kusumi, isn't it strange?
Whats strange?
There are no docks or factory.
Underground.
Hear it?
Faint machine noises.
Thank you for waiting.
Commander is here.
Jinguji!
It's been some time, sir!
I didn't know you were alive.
I thank you for treating my revolt quietly.
It's over and done with.
Captain...
This is Makoto.
Surprised? She's become beautiful.
Thank you!
Please relax.
It's an amazing place. Any natives?
Only those helping us.
It's ideal for our base.
The Atragon?
Atragon?
I see.
I'm wrong?
We are testing Goten-go tomorrow.
Goten-go?
That's Atragon.
Please rejoice.
We can serve the Navy again.
Do you have any idea why I came?
Amano told me.
That makes it simpler.
The world urgently needs Atragon.
The world is waiting.
I refuse.
What?
Goten-go is for Japan when she's active again.
She's for Japan...
Think it over.
The war ended 20 years ago.
Our Corps hasn't surrendered yet!
Wait!
Not even a kind word for your daughter! War crazy!
War crazy?
Excuse me!
Who is that man?
I guarantee that he won't make Makoto unhappy.
The Captain hasn't been around.
Is he angry?
No, he was always stubborn.
We're not welcome?
But we can't go back.
- I'll show you the dock, sir.
- Where is the Captain?
He has been up all night preparing for the test.
Who is it?
I'm sorry. I got lost when I was taking a walk.
Don't wander around!
I'm sorry.
All clear!
This is the entrance to the dock. Please.
Prepare for takeoff.
Bow, ready for takeoff.
Mid-section, ready for takeoff.
Engine room, ready for takeoff.
Stern, ready for takeoff.
Admiral, I've been waiting for you.
This is Goten-go or Atragon.
Lt. Fuji.
Yes, sir. Standing by.
We will start a test operation now.
In position!
In position!
- Open gate No. 1.
- Open gate No. 1.
Open gate No. 1.
Standing by!
Start!
Start!
Start flooding!
Water level 10 feet.
Fifteen.
Twenty.
Waterway filled.
- Open gate No. 2.
- Open gate No. 2.
- Slow speed ahead.
- Slow speed ahead.
Surfacing!
Hold your horses! A fish leaped.
I knew it wasn't enough noise for a ship.
Look!
Congratulations!
Wonderful performance.
We'll test the Cold Air Cannon tomorrow.
The Cold Air Cannon?
It is an instant freeze cannon.
It's absolute zero... 460°F below zero.
One thing puzzles me.
Yes?
Why does the Mu have the A-403?
And how do they know about Atragon?
It's simple.
When we were seeking for a place for our base...
...an unidentified submarine attacked us.
All of the plan would fail if we died.
So we used A-403 as a decoy to escape.
When they captured it, it was empty.
The blue print of Atragon was left behind.
Of course they didn't have the details but they marked us.
I see.
Please, Admiral.
Drop the Admiral... touching an old scar.
An old scar?
Our new Constitution has renounced war.
Who made us?
What?
You've changed.
My plans seemed like a revolt, yet you said you'd be responsible.
Your former guts?
The 20 years after the war gave us time to think.
Are you saying that Atragon is useless?
Who said so?
We need it... that's why we're here.
Atragon is not useless, the world needs it.
I refuse!
You still don't understand?
I refuse!
I built Atragon for our Navy!
All has changed!
I'll change it again with Atragon!
Fool! Stop talking nonsense!
Nonsense?
You call patriotism nonsense?
Take a global point of view!
I'll devote my life to my country!
Makoto.
Makoto...
Why are you crying?
Do you hate me?
I shouldn't have come.
I was happier dreaming about you.
Please, Father...
Please, do as Mr. Kusumi says.
Makoto...
For 20 years I left you in other hands and spent my time to rebuild Japan.
Don't you understand?
But you don't know how I feel.
Do you understand how a child feels, orphaned by war?
Yes, I do!
No, you don't.
If you did, you would work for world good.
Your way of thinking is like the people of Mu.
I hate you for it.
Makoto.
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!
It's you.
You called me war crazy.
Yes, I did.
And one more thing.
More?
- A war crazy has got a deadly weapon.
- What!
You are a ghost wearing rusty armor named patriotism.
A ghost?
I feel sorry for Makoto.
Excuse me.
Wait!
I've kept this close to me for 20 years.
Take care of her.
What are you doing?
I'll take you to the Mu Empire.
Let me go! Let me go!
Damn.
What are you up to, anyway?
Let go! I'm being kind!
Kind? Stop your joking!
You'll all blow up! I've set a bomb!
What are you saying?
Emergency! Emergency!
Hurry!
Commander, a bomb was set on the dock!
- What? Who did it?
- The reporter, sir.
Halt!
Your Majesty, they are the prisoners from our enemy, Atragon.
What shall we do?
Sacrifice them to Manda.
To Manda?
Manda will be delighted, I'm sure.
Manda!
Manda! Manda!
If Captain Jinguji doesn't listen to us, you will be sacrificed to Manda.
Manda?
Open that window.
Well?
An iron pillar is on top of the hatch.
- Remove it! Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
- Cut it!
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Kusumi, a Mu troop has appeared on Mt. Mihara!
From the crater, the radio said.
- What're police doing?
- Catch them!
Not as easy as thieves!
You take them!
We're the reconnaissance unit.
Have all climbers come down?
No, there are quite a few left.
Move forward!
What are those?
- They are flying saucers!
- No, they're not!
What are they?
Susumu, are you all right?
Thank you.
Mr. Shindo, is there any way to escape?
Even if there were, it's the bottom of the sea.
So there is no use in stealing these then.
Wait! What do you think they are?
Dynamite?
Special ones.
They have been using gigantic rocks since antiquity.
It's called megalithic culture.
They are the powerful dynamite used on those rocks.
I can't believe you stole them and you are still alive.
It's terrible!
I think they will start attacking soon.
Manda!
Manda! Manda!
We warn you in the name of Mu.
People of the colonies!
Destroy the Atragon!
Return our colonies immediately!
It's the only way to save yourselves from ruin!
Note February 10, 2400 hrs.
At first, the New York skyscrapers...
...and downtown Tokyo, you will see our power there.
You will see what we just said is no idle threat!
Not yet?
It's very hard, isn't it?
All right! Let's go down.
Check all parts!
Bow, all in order!
Mid-section too!
Engine room too!
Stern too!
Stand by!
All right.
But we're sealed in though.
You'll soon see.
- Stand by to start.
- Stand by to start.
- Start!
- Start!
Shall we go?
Go where?
I think I was wearing rusty armor.
I took it off and feel fine.
Jinguji!
Please contact HQ.
Atragon will now sail to destroy the Mu Empire!
- All's quiet, sir.
- Good.
- We still have five minutes left. Be alert.
- Yes, sir.
HQ! Come in!
Roger!
Three Allied Army planes!
This is the fate of those who defy the Mu Empire.
Atragon!
Defying our warnings, Jinguji?
Report it to our Empress!
They're escaping.
We'll follow to find their base!
- Touch down!
- Touch down!
- Open the vent.
- Open the vent.
- Depth 500.
- Depth 500.
Come out!
Become sacrifices to Manda!
Don't move! See this?
Understand? Move, and the Mu Empire will blow up!
Open it!
Wear these water-tight suits.
What is that noise?
I don't know!
You, too, Your Majesty.
What? I refuse to go!
Taking you up to land.
No!
I'm letting in sea water.
Wait!
That's the entrance to the Mu Empire.
- Stop!
- Stop!
A monster!
- Open the hatch!
- Open the hatch!
Your father.
Father!
Makoto.
Uncle.
Fine. Fine.
The Mu Empress.
Jinguji, it's useless to defy us.
Do you think you can win?
You defy us!
Mu Empire will win!
We will rule the world.
Killing me cannot kill our Empire's heart!
Empire's heart?
It's the power room using terrestrial heat for Mu energy.
Where is it?
It's located at six miles below the
Palace.
That's right.
Give up and surrender!
We will attack as long as you tell us to surrender!
But we'll listen to peace talks.
Impertinent!
Then we'll attack the heart of the Mu Empire.
- Stand by and dive!
- Stand by and dive!
Dive!
Emergency light! Hurry!
High tension current!
- Cold Air Cannon! Stand by!
- Cold Air Cannon! Stand by!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Advance unit assemble! Hurry!
Salute.
The advance unit will leave, sir!
Start!
What? Atragon is in the power room?
Yes!
Fool! It can't be!
They're inferior to us! They can't enter the power room from outside!
Absolutely not!
- Make sure to set the right time.
- Yes.
We did it!
Stand by to attack!
Stand by to attack!
Fire!
Fire!
Hey!
Let her go.
She knows she'll die yet she's returning. Just let her go.
Susumi!
THE END
He looks, he observes...
- He sees, doesn't he?
- Yes.
- He really sees?
- Of course.
In the beginning, they usually see clear colors.
- Clear colors?
- Exactly.
It's the light...
He opens his eyes so large …
His glance is limpid…
It's like he distinguishes everything.
- Look, I reflect myself.
- But no, it's me!
The first thing a boy should see in this world is the image of his father.
He looks at me.
He opens his eyes wide.
- He sees, doesn't he?
- Yes, he sees.

You were sleeping deeply.
Mr. Sakaguchi has arrived.
The butterfly, there, on the on the branch.
If you do not remove it, the tree will die.
Would you like that I play the gardener?
Seen that the plants don't speak...
I dreamed that you embraced someone under this tree.
- Takashi didn't cry?
- Non. He was asleep.
He did frighten me!
He is strange, this dad, hm?
He says strange things.
Come, come see dad.
What an opportunity! You have the impression in front of a scene of this kind… that all happiness is here.
You speak as if you must carry all the misfortunes of the world.
That's right. I don't have what you might call a family.
You deserve to be struck down on the spot!
You have an adorable woman, and a splendid hospital.
Well, that's exactly what's wrong.
His father bought me in exchange for his daughter and a hospital.
You ask her too much.
She does not understand what kind of family a man needs.
It is because you don't have any children.
A hearth without children is like a boat without veil.
And a boat that does not advance is not a boat!
You too, hurry up to create one!
- To "create" one?
- Pardi!
But it is ridiculous to say that to a gynaecologist!
There are magpies in the wood!
In this season, they begin to come down from the mountains!
What a pity! I just missed a marvellous photograph!
They are not just like other birds.
When the winter falls, they go down to the plain but the males and the females have their own territory.
What a tie, Mr. director!
When did you buy it?
That's how she calls her husband...
Why do males and females live separately?
I guess because during winter the food is sparser
And they fight for it
And the females occupy a bigger territory then the males.
According to me, that's not because the female is dominant, but because she has to be strong to assure the survival of the species.
How cute he is, Takashi.
Luckily, it's a boy!
Smile!
Fascinating how well you resemble him!
You are just a copy of your father!
Don't run away this time!
- Who is the real father of Takashi?
- What will you do when you know?
I would try to meet him.
- And then?
- Nothing.
Well, I will tell you.
It is Ibuki. It is your husband.
Takashi has no other father.
I don't know why, but coming to you reassures me.
Stop! On rest days, you must deal with Shina.
But she prefers that I leave her alone so that she can devote herself to her birds.
I wonder why you reassure me like that.
A year and seven months.
Takashi fully now.
It's really what you think?
You know better than me, since you are a specialist.
No. The obstetrics and pediatrics have nothing to do with it.
The consciousness of the newborn appears to form around three years.
Yet, I have a remembrance of the age of one.
What kind of memory?
The face of my mother crying.
Without doubt at the time of death my father.
You've heard about the scandal
Of the maternity of Kotobuki?
No.
That was in the post-war when there was nothing.
The maternity had many children for who the parents could not take care.
To feed them, they were sending milk and sugar.
But instead of giving it to the children, they sold it on the black market.
Of course, the children almost all died of hunger.
The director of the maternity was a woman.
She saw life as an object.
Consider life as an object...
This was the first and the last scandal of this kind.
Why did you tell me that suddenly?
Whenever I wonder why I became a doctor, this story comes to mind.
When the maternity was unmasked, some children were still alive.
Were you one of them?
I was seven years old.
Do not come back here.
Never.
Nonsense!
It is absolutely impossible!
I'm sorry, but I think it is useless to lie.
This is the result of analysis.
You might be a man,
But you can not become a father.
Are you going to tell your wife?
Do you really want one?
- Yes...
- Then there is a possibility...
Artificial insemination.
I am not forcing you.
But it is the only solution.
Cheers!
- What is it according to you?
- A whiskey with water?
No! It is a white liquid and viscous...
Look, you see?
Stop!
We are doctors in a clinic.
Neither pedigree nor money: No way of starting a business.
We will finally die in the clinic.
Do you know doctors of 50 years?
Tell me! What is in this glass?
Sperm!
I've sold it.
Cream!
I might eat cream.
- Enough!
- But! You're disgusting!
This is the band of doctors...
I do not believe in the results
Of the analysis.
Do not be silly! I checked myself to be sure.
- Do you remember Akane Egawa?
- Akane?
The girl with whom you were at the university?
- I heard she was in the art business...
- That's right.
- Do you still see her?
- Do not mistrust me.
That's ancient history.
She was pregnant.
- Akane!
- Let her rest.
She had a miscarriage.
You can bring her with you tonight.
Why didn’t you tell me?
That was our child, is not it?
Don’t you think he looks like you?
Good! Since you do not answer,
I will embrace the raven.
Stop! It's disgusting!
Not more then thinking of another’s wife.
Isn’t it, my crow?
Very good. I think about what your father
Said to me before our marriage.
Dad?
Since this is my father, it is also yours.
- No. Your father is your father.
- What did he say?
What difference could it make?
Stop, the raven is watching us.
Two birds have said:
"Living is a beautiful thing.
"Since life is wonderful
"Living is wonderful.
"Live!"
You are finally returned, despite my ban.
Yesterday, Ibuki called me, asking me to pass by.
Ibuki?
He knew however that he should host
A foreign delegation this morning.
Me too, in my job
I sometimes forget things.
- And Takashi?
- He does not.
A child...
A child saves a couple by mobilizing all the attention.
At least that is what they say.
Me in my work,
I always say to young mothers:
"Do not worry too much about your children, do not forget your husband. "
But myself not having any children
I can not know what it really is.
Why did you decide to have a child?
At least ten children per day are born in my clinic.
I am responsible for all of them.
The great days, we get almost thirty births.
But I've never been the father of these children.
I sometimes have a strange feeling.
Madam?
What is it?
Nothing. I had the impression someone looked at me.
This is my imagination.
My husband does not come back...
That day someone looked at me.
A stranger.
You are now asking me to carry the child of another?
- The child that you will wear will be mine.
- That’s wrong!
When the teacher Fujikida advised it to you in the beginning, you laughed about it.
- Possibly.
I have not forgotten.
You were drunk when you came back, and you treated Fujikida badly.
Perhaps...
I could never forget your voice, that day.
Well, forget it, even if you can not!
You will bear the child!
- Whose child?
- Our Children!
But if I wear it, it will be only mine.
This man looks again.
- Who's that guy?
- I do not know.
I do not want this child.
I will not go back on my decision.
Your decision? What decision?
I will not carry that child.
I would if it were your son.
But this disgusts me!
If only it were your son...
Stop with your nonsense...
I am like that.
I don’t need children.
Me, I need it!
For both of us.
A woman can not not wanting children.
You were making fun of artificial insemination.
Why have you changed your mind suddenly?
Why?
You think I did not think about it...
I was thinking all the time.
And then...
Yesterday, when I saw...
Vu?
Sometimes, I can not understand it myself.
Why do I want to have a child?
That's why I need it!
If you ask me to carry the child of an unknown or that of the man constantly hovering around the house.
Stop talking nonsense!
Perfectly! I would prefer that it be him rather than a stranger!
He, at least, I see!
I do not understand what you saying.
Or...
You do not want to wear the child of a man with whom you did not have physical relations?
It was the end of the summer.
I was in your summer house.
Just one week before our marriage.
You remember, don’t you?
You came with the Fujikidas, but you returned earlier to Tokyo.
I wanted to spend there the last week of my life as a young girl.
Yet, the third day I was bored already.
I wandered to kill time.
I had always dreamed to spend a few days alone, quiet, without parents, without anyone.
Thanks to you, just before our marriage, this dream had finally been fulfilled.
But my hopes were dryly disappointed.
"Was that the loneliness that I was dreaming of since I was little? "
I whispered to myself while walking.
At that moment,
I met him.
He acted as if he had not seen me.
He saw me without seeing me.
But suddenly I realized that this man ignored me voluntarily.
I felt an incomprehensible shame.
I realized that I cried out in spite of myself:
"I live in this house!"
A few hours had passed.
I was nervous. I lyed down.
At that time, someone knocked on the door.
I was embarrassed.
I did not think he would come.
He slowly approached me.
Unconsciously, I tried to scream.
Is it him?
The man who prowls around here every day, is it him?
I do not know.
I do not know his name.
- I even do not remember his face.
- Enough!
The child of that man can not be my child!
You really think
I'm going to believe this story?
It was you, isn’t it?
That summer... that I met in a coppice in the middle of a field.
Enter. Close the door.
It was you in that field.
You were covered with sweat, you drove a tractor. and you watched me.
No, you did not return once.
- No, it was not me.
- Yes, it was you!
Why didn’t you look at me,
Not even once?
- Why?
- It's not that.
I... I wanted to see if you were happy.
Happy?
No... You are not the same as before!
I did not think your wife would accept.
Anyway, the biggest remains to be done.
Assuming that the operation was successful, he will be born in 10 months.
- Take care of her.
- What is the percentage of success?
20 to 60%.
It means that we do not know.
It will succeed, I am sure.
I will return.
Weren’t you watching him?
Takashi is 1 year and 7 months.
He can not be gone too far!
I searched inside the house, outside, wherever he could go!
Ah yes...?
Seeing you as calm as this, it is obvious that you know where Takashi is.
You have hidden him to test me.
That's right.
- Tell me where he is now.
- He is really gone.
He’s a baby, he can barely walk!
Where do you want to go?
I do not know.
Who is your accomplice?
Sakaguchi?
It’s him, Sakaguchi.
Enough now.
You'd be happy to see me so worried.
Tell me where he is.
I am sure that you hate Takashi.
- But he is my child!
- Stop it, please!
I'm sorry, but it's really my son.
You may have the same blood, it is my first son!
Stop!
Go look for him, if you like...
Go find him.
Very good.
So he is with Sakaguchi.
Why do you want him to be with Sakaguchi?
You see other possibilities?
You're wrong.
Am I wrong?
So who?
If neither you nor Sakaguchi, who is it?
Shina?
Shina?
It's impossible.
She...
What’s it to make a child?
Were you scared?
- Where were you happy?
- Nothing special.
All mothers of the world feel the same.
- And if I would make one too, what then?
- Go ahead!
But a baby is a strange beast; it's a little scary.
- Don’t you think?
- Not at all.
- Is it cute?
- Yes.
That is surely what people think when it is their own child.
I make one?
But you know,
I am sterile.
I do not do anything not to have children, but nothing happens.
And you, how it was?
Honey? Lunch is ready.
Darling!
It varies from people to people.
Say, Ritsuko! If you make another you give it to me?
Come with mom...
What did you do with your husband when you were pregnant?
What kind of question is this?
We are eating!
- But it is important! I want to know.
- She is always like that.
- I was in our summer house.
- Really?
You did not want him to see you that way with your big belly.
Women are not spoiled, though.
And men, meanwhile, how are they? Hein, Mr. Director?
If I can not have one,
Ritsuko promised me she would give me the next.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
- I bother?
- Of course not.
I could read that from your face.
How do you feel?
- Everything okay?
- Sometimes it moves a lot.
Ah!
What is it?
You have the right to walk, but the cold is not good for you.
But I told you not to come...
In three months, I would have gone directly to the hospital.
So, I would have come to an end without it being visible.
Everything will be OK.
No! The baby...
The baby... I do not want to lose it...
We had so much trouble!
This is my child, right?
You hate me?
Do not say whatever.
Say nothing.
But I will have this child.
I asked you not to touch me during my pregnancy.
You're really horrible...
I should not have made this child.
You'd think I say that because it is not your son.
Why do you say nothing?
The car that drove by on the moment you've lost sight of, is surely Shina’s.
Innit?
No.
If you really think so, why did you introduce the Sakaguchi in our home?
- Why?
- They are friends.
Wrong. Whenever there is a problem, you invite them to the house on purpose.
- Every time... Why?
- Stop with your affabulations!
If they would not come here, we would be more quiet.
Still...
If you had really paid attention to him, none of this would have happened!
We have already suffered enough
To get him! Yes, suffered!
Nobody suffered.
I did not think it was so easy to make a child...
Easy?
It's a lease…
We were very young...
We had no money.
Not even a room big enough to live with two, but it seemed we could do everything.
It was just before the start of the Korean War.
You were speaking about yourself by saying "we".
Stop please, will you...
Stir the past can only
Jurt us today.
True, all this is old.
So, tell me what you became.
I told you there was nothing very interesting to say.
Men, men, men!
- We never saw each other since...
- No.
If he were born, he would be16 years old...
- He could not rise.
- But sometimes…
But sometimes I tell myself that with the life
I lead, I would have wanted him to be born.
But he was not born...
Would you have lead a normal life with the father of this child?
Exactly! Our child!
Today, you'd be a father as we see them everywhere and I...
Stop!
From who was this child?
You!
- I want to know the truth!
- But it was yours, truly!
Anyway, nothing can be done about it now...
That's ancient history.
It’s old... It’s far...
The doctor told me that
I am sterile from birth.
Yesterday, at the hospital.
Men, men, men!
Father of 3 children, you speak!
You lied, that's right.
Yes.
- That's why you come to find me.
- Answer me.
Whose child was it?
I go looking for him!
Where?
I do not know... There where he is!
As if you knew it!
Who took him and where?
It’s my son I am looking for.
Not something invisible.
He is my son, I will find him.
We have the same blood.
If he calls me, I...
In the north, south, east, west?
So? In the north, south, east, west?
1, 10, 100 km?
If you know, tell me!
Since Takashi is not my son, since it is your son, because you are her real mother because you sense where he is, tell me where he is! Immediately!
It is Shina.
Takashi...
You knew it... You knew it and didn't say anything!
It is true that Shina took Takashi?
Impossible!
I have no idea what she does.
- Neither where she could have gone.
- I don't know...
A place where you often go...
You are a couple, right?
A couple?
Yes, surely. Why?
It is supposed to represent something?
Of course!
A woman belongs to her husband.
- So she bares children, raises them...
- Stop!
For us, this makes no sense.
We live together.
Sexually we are also a couple.
But I never knew what she thought.
From our engagement on, there was an inconsistency.
Our feelings have crossed without ever meeting.
In fact, only our birds unite us.
Lost in the mountains, the small
Snipe expressed...
What a wise child...
She said:
"I'm so tired,
I can't take a step!
"I have to rest!"
She saw a light a little further.
It was the light of a house lost in the mountains.
"Knock, knock... Knock, knock. "
"I'm lost, can you
Give me shelter for the night? "
"Of course!" replied the old lady very nice.
This old lady lived alone in this house.
The little Snipe fell asleep.
She woke up suddenly during the night.
"Yum, yum!", she heard.
Below, the old lady seemed to be eating.
"What do you eat, madame?"
"Pickles.
"You want some? Here. " she says by handing one over.
The little snipe took it and looked...
It was the finger of her dad she had been looking for since the morning.
Startled, she tried to flee, but the door opened suddenly, and the old lady came in with a kitchen knife.
It was a witch.
You think little Snipe was eaten?
She managed to escape through the window!
It was a bird!
It was not a human being!
End of story.
"I have something on my face?"
For a long time, I dreamed to be able to say this reply.
"I have something on my face?"
Here you are! You're back with your father and your mother.
Here, I give it back to you...
- Takashi!
- Don’t ever disappear again from Mommy!
You're the baby of your mother.
- You realize what you did?
- What do you say, Mr. Director?
Why didn’t you say anything?
We only had fun the two of us.
What is wrong?
You didn't think that his parents would be crazy for concern?
His parents?
Yes.
- I'll tell you what to do.
- No thank you, Mr. Director.
You talk as the president of a court!
"Accused Shina Sakaguchi, why have you removed Takashi? "
"I found this child in the middle of the road, and helped him. "
"Then why did you not return him to his parents? Why?
"Because...
"I don't know very well.
I can’t say.
"I just wanted to do it. "
"His parents were concerned.
What do you respond to that?"
"Mr. President... "
The role of the President would suit Mr. Fujikida very well!
Mr. Fujikida has the look of someone who knows everything!
Moreover, he has nothing to do with the case.
"Very well, Mr. President, now it is my turn to ask you a question.
What are the parents?
Parents are the protectors and owners of their child?
I'm not qualified to answer this question.
As a physician,
I took part in the death of God.
Even if I would be accused,
I have not the right to judge anyone.
Can I dispose?
I’ll let you go.
There is no longer a president.
The accused Shina Sakaguchi says that...
Enough!
- The joke has lasted long enough.
- The public cries out for me to shut up.
But I am serious.
If my act is guilty who among you is not guilty?
- Pronounce the sentence!
- Enough!
Just ask forgiveness from Ritsuko.
You understand...
- But a child is not a bird.
- What are you talking about?
Okay, let her speak.
You think I have taken him because I'm jealous of Ritsuko?
It has nothing to do with that.
Oh no?
If Takashi had no right to leave, he must be put in a cage, like a bird.
But as a human being is not a bird, he will finally release himself.
Nobody can stop him.
Not true!
Nobody can go wherever he wants.
We are all tied one way or another.
Ritsuko and I will stay a couple even if we split.
Takashi and I are father and son.
There is a bond of invisible blood.
One can't escape through the cracks like that.
There is no link.
If there is no link, then...
This is because children can't choose their parents.
Everything is decided before their birth.
Parents also do not choose their children.
There is no link.
None.
Exactly! Ritsuko was right!
Everything is connected!
Enough! I don't want to hear you anymore!
What is this look?
If you hate me, say it!
- You are a coward! A coward!
- I beg you, shut up!
You didn't marry me for who I am, neither to conduct a clinic!
You did it because you did not want
To remain in your hospital, to be a small clinics doctor all your life!
You married me to get away from this hospital!
Fool! What does this have to do with all this?
You do not understand what a woman can feel!
Stop!
I've had enough!
Leave. And do not come back here please.
It is normal that Shina is angry.
Yet...
Although Sakaguchi is the father of Takashi...
No...
Sakaguchi has nothing to do with all this!
Ritsuko...
So you knew him?
But Takashi is my son!
You're the baby of your mother!
Your mom!
Look good at mom.
Look at the face and the eyes of mom.
Okay. Now listen:
You know, dad is not your father.
Your father does not exist.
You have no father anywhere.
Nobody knows that, not even you.
But the truth is that dad is not your real father.
This is the truth, as long as the truth exists.
This man says he is your dad,
Acts as if he were your dad.
But he is nothing but a hollow and empty shell.
The more he behaves like your father, the more he departs from what a father is.
You, you are my child to me.
And the more I say that you are mine, the more it becomes clear that you are not his child.
You're the baby of your mother.
You understand what mother says, not?
Mama knows it...
I should not have come.
When I got your phone call, I...
But you're here.
No. I came to take him back.
Give him to me.
Give me back to myself.
Takashi is not you.
He is not yours.
So what are we then, the three of us?
We are a real family.
- Even if you deny it.
- Takashi... is neither yours, nor Ibuki’s.
He is mine.
Even if he comes from you, he is not yours.
Do you know why I started to attend your home?
Although I felt a danger as a child by the river, irremediably attracted by the other side...
It was a warm spring day,
I went to Shina, we were just engaged.
While I waited,
I've heard them talk, she and her father.
Her father said:
"For an occasion, it's a little expensive.
"But since my daughter says so,
I will accept the price. "
He spoke about me.
At that moment,
I saw the dead children Kotobuki again.
I was going to be purchased as an object, as these children.
Until then, I sold my children without particular grief.
No, they were not children.
I sold a liquid, without remorse, because we had buried the children of Kotobuki as one buries objects.
I was engaged to Shina to escape that life.
But the result was the same.
I was an object, and for me as an object, children could not be only objects.
Just like I consider
Takashi like my son.
You understand what I ask to give me back?
You understand?
I can give you nothing, no water or anything.
You resemble him a lot.
I made them listen to the voice of the wind.
Wild birds need
The sounds of nature.
Where is Ritsuko?
It was not true.
I pulled your leg.
There is nobody.
You realize what you are doing?
So what? There are no alternatives.
You're not a man!
Stop...
It's just that I do not want...
You think that's how
You are taking revenge on them?
That's why she sleeps with another.
Takashi is the child of Sakaguchi.
You did not know?
You knew and did not say anything?
Because you're not a man?
You do not understand.
I am not a man.
But not because I can not make love to a woman.
You understand what that means, not?
At the beginning, the father of this child was supposed to have neither name nor face.
Except for mine.
Because this child is born from the hand of a doctor.
I thought you fooled me.
I thought I could forgive you even if it had been a serious story.
Forgive you...
But that, no!
I could never forgive you!
It's you, is not it?
The man who gave me Takashi.
It's you...
You're the man.
I do not know.
What am I at the end?
Who?
You are the father of this child.
I'm his mother.
Yet I was not your husband.
Now that's what I do.
Now, you're his father.
And you'll be my husband.
Now. Now.
It's impossible, you do not have...
What, "Impossible"?
I lucky as I was.
I did not need children.
I was satisfied with the quiet life.
I lived quietly until our wedding. Up to 28 years.
My father was a physician for 40 years in the same rural town.
It is in this kind of family that I grew up.
If at that time you would have understood me, if we had not had Takashi in this way, you and me, just the two of us, we would have been quiet. Quiet.
I'm going home.
What will you do?
Yes, if you want to come back please...
I will be happy...
You know what happened last night, right?
Why don’t you insult me?
Why don’t you hit me?
Because nothing has changed:
Takashi is still my son.
Hmm... Who’s that?
It's dad... Dad.
Yes, it's dad... It's your dad...
Mom, it's someone else.
That's mom.
Don’t fool me...
Who’s that?
- Dad.
- And that?
That's mom.
No! It's a dead leaf.
No, that's a tree.
No, that's a bird.
No, this is heaven!
No, that's the sun!

"Dear Lucia: Now I'm positive that I'm expecting Augusto's child.
That makes me his only real girlfriend."
What nonsense!
"You're just a pastime for him.
Leave him... - for your own good."
What an idiot!
It was Giulia.
I knew it.
Why'd you show it to your mother?
You could have asked me first.
Living with them is bad enough, let alone taking you there.
May I pull out now?
I can't afford a place in town.
It's too expensive.
What's so hard to understand?
Here.
And don't confuse reverse with fourth this time.
Just be quiet and keep an eye out.
I'm quite prepared... to make any sacrifice, but not for a lost cause.
Lucia, please.
Let's not start again.
When your sister writes me a letter like that... -
There's no point harping on it.
When someone threatens me like that, what am I to do?
Get to the point.
What do you want?
I'll see you later.
Cut it out!
She's a poor virgin
come to make her confession
Send her in!
I'll hear her sins
The brakes!
I told you there was gravel on the road.
I've told you a thousand times:
I feed the rabbits.
No need to be so rude.
They're not even yours.
They are too.
Keeping rabbits was my idea.
Go water the flowers.
I'm gonna tell Augusto when he gets back.
Go on and tell, tattle-tale.
- Why didn't you stop?
- Close the door.
- Are you angry?
- What were you doing out there?
Waiting for you.
I like riding with you. Is that a crime?
You shouldn't be out alone.
If something happened, who would help you?
Those two buzzed around me for half an hour.
You're pleased with yourself.
Guess what.
Ale left a poem on my dresser.
A love poem to me.
Did Giulia say anything about me?
You don't really believe her, do you?
What did you say?
Everyone says I'm a beauty
I am the queen of love
Everyone says I'm a star
Shining in splendor above
Be a good boy, Leone.
Try to remember.
What sound do horses make?
- I don't know.
Of course you do.
Come on.
What about donkeys?
Dinner's ready.
They bray.
And oxen?
Augusto's here, Mama.
May the Lord bless this food and keep us in his holy ways.
- One or two?
- Two.
Stop that!
Eat properly!
Nervous, eh?
Just a bit on edge.
Stop it.
Let go.
Stop it!
Ale, could you cut my meat?
Take it.
- Cards?
- I don't feel like it.
Come into the den.
Would you like to read the poem?
I wrote this for your own good.
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
I've told you a thousand times:
I just want to be left alone.
Is that asking too much?
Keep your emotional outbursts to yourselves and let me work.
Keep your nose out of my business.
Understand?
Yes, I understand.
Sure you do.
I don't want to hear another word about Ale's poetry.
Now get going.
I said get out.
- What did you tell him?
- Everything. You'll see.
That was stupid.
Why is it, at your age, that you have no ambition?
Nice clothes or a little pocket money... - those would be modest ambitions, but better than nothing.
Stop spying on each other, reading each other's diary.
Why don't you try and learn something?
You can't even type.
You haven't touched the bicycle I bought you.
Just go away.
It's pointless trying to talk to you.
All you've managed to do is take off Leone's bandage when the doctor said not to.
Why did you take it off?
You're like a bunch of animals!
Watch out,
'cause someday I'll get fed up.
And I've told you before:
Don't wear my shirts!
- So you showed him my poem.
- Yes. What about it?
Your phone was busy for half an hour.
Who was it?
Jealous?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm really down.
Try to understand.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Is that the TVin the background?
Do you love me?
Why don't we get together now?
I'll come over.
No, I'm not crazy.
I can be there in half an hour.
Wait for me. Bye.
Hey, it's 11:00.
My lesson.
My father sent along some apples for you.
It's 11:00.
My lesson.
- Put them down.
Turn off that record!
Get my slippers.
The window.
Did you get your report card?
And?
- I flunked.
Cretin! Imbecile!
Beast! Ass! Idiot!
This is what I get for trying to pound some knowledge into that thick head?
Go and dig the fields.
"O sun, you who rise joyful and free, tame your horses upon our hills."
Let's see this report card.
You gotta change these grades.
But it must be done very carefully.
No fancy stuff.
It takes a very light touch.
Give me a pen.
Meanwhile, here's an assignment for you.
A nice little composition entitled
"What I see on the terrace."
Go out on the terrace, have a look, come back, and tell me exactly what you saw.
All right? Now go.
Look. I changed your grade in math and art.
See anything interesting?
On the terrace your sister, Miss Giulia, was sunbathing.
Very good.
Let's explore this subject for a while.
Describe Miss Giulia.
On the terrace, Miss Giulia was sunbathing on the terrace.
Try to be more specific.
Can you remember, for instance, what position she was in?
I believe she was sitting down.
You remember how she was dressed?
No, I don't.
You're going to go back out there.
This time get as close as possible and observe carefully.
Then come back and tell me everything you saw.
Meanwhile,
I'll finish your report card.
All right.
Did you get up close?
Well?
Congratulations.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
The ink bottle.
Pour it.
Pour.
What are you doing?
You idiot.
What's wrong with you?
What do I do now?
"What do I do now?"
"You made your bed.
Now lie in it."
"As you sow, so shall you reap."
Did you study when I begged and entreated you, when I went hoarse trying to teach you?
Dig deep into your conscience and see who's to blame.
You got what you deserved.
Good-bye.
Every Sunday when I went
To church, my prayers to say
A youth of heavenly beauty
Sandrino.
Would you read me the newspaper?
Where is it?
Don't you see it?
Look around.
It has to be here.
Do you mind?
- No, Mama. Why should I mind?
What?
Are you talking to yourself?
I feel a draft.
Is the window open?
It's closed.
I found the newspaper.
What should I read?
Would you be so kind as to read me who died?
Who died.
Let's see.
Zerpani, Luisa.
Cavalli, Giambattista.
Paracioppi, Gustavo.
Saraceno, Elisabetta.
Anyone you know?
No, no one.
And births?
No births, no weddings, no graduations.
What else should I read?
Anything.
But what?
I can't read the whole paper.
I'll read some headlines and you stop me.
"Signalman crushed by moving train.
Was he drunk?
Impossible to determine for certain."
How sad.
Premeditated matricide.
Son kills mother for making him take a bath.
Good grief.
Retired married couple commit suicide by turning on the oven.
He was 68.
She was 53.
Same age as me.
What an awful day.
Isn't there any happier news?
The king of England died, leaving in the darkest despair and desperation... -
- But there's the queen.
- Precisely.
As always.
I'm so unhappy.
What's wrong?
Would you like some candy?
Open up!
Open up!
Learn some manners.
Just a minute.
Quick!
Put a handkerchief between his teeth or he'll bite his tongue.
Hurry up, you idiot!
- How?
You're suffocating him!
Let me do it!
I'll call the doctor.
The doctor was out.
Let's put him on the table.
Give me a hand.
Gently.
Laugh.
That'll make him furious.
Are you done?
Can't I talk to Augusto?
That's enough.
I said that's enough!
Come here!
Let me go!
Get out of here!
I've had it with you two!
Look what you did to my face!
She's hitting me!
Get out of here!
I can't take much more of this.
Stop butting in!
Sandro, what's wrong?
Did you hurt yourself?
Mr. Sandro, what happened to your face?
My face! My face!
My God!
Where's Ale?
Just look at him.
Staring in the mirror instead of cooling off his head.
Shame on you.
There.
Stay down there.
It'll do you good.
I can't breathe!
Just try to imagine if you were on your own... without the four of us.
For the first time in your life, you could think of yourself.
Tell me man to man:
Why should you let us poison your whole life?
And I'm including myself.
I really care for you, Augusto.
You're the only one I care for.
That's why I want you to be free.
And I think I just came up with a way.
Want some milk?
Look at this.
Can I get my driver's license?
Are you crazy?
They'd never allow it.
Have you lost your mind?
I haven't had an attack in a year.
I've been fine since I started taking my pills regularly.
I'm in full control.
Some control.
Just last month you... -
I was faking. I swear.
So I wouldn't have to go into town with Leone.
Great.
I should have known.
What's past is past.
I'll get right to the point.
Every year on All Souls' Day, we've all gone to the cemetery.
And you've driven us there.
This year I'll drive.
You really think
I'd be that irresponsible?
- Exactly.
- Exactly what? Explain yourself.
At the Barberino curve,
I'll drive us all off the cliff.
What's so funny?
Don't tell me you never thought about it.
Hi, Augusto.
How are you?
Everything all right?
What's your hurry?
- The usual place?
- Where else?
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?
Something came up at the last minute.
You forgot to signal.
I'm sorry.
Otherwise you did well.
Don't take it too hard.
A month will fly by.
- Let's go.
- All right.
I lied this morning.
The test was today, and I passed.
Congratulations.
If I'd told you in advance,
I'd have felt like you were there, and the responsibility would have weighed on me, with all the money you've spent.
May I ask a favor?
- Go ahead.
You're supposed to drive us to the cemetery today.
You do it for Mama's sake, but I know it's a bother.
I could drive them and give you the afternoon free.
You know how to back up?
Of course.
- Can you change a tire?
- I'll show you.
No, I believe you.
Very well.
But drive slowly.
- Please close the door.
- I'm coming right back.
Hello, boys.
Sandro, please close the door.
Mama, Sandro passed his driving test.
- Really? When?
- This morning.
He must be so happy.
I kept praying he'd just give up on the idea.
Hey there.
- Sorry.
- I have to get by.
Here are some towels.
Did you really pass your driving test?
I don't believe it.
- Sorry I'm late.
- I hear you did very well.
I'm happy.
Congratulations, Ale.
Let's eat.
Ale asked me if he could drive you all to the cemetery.
I trust him, and it's a chance for him to make himself useful.
And I could take care of some other things.
You're not going?
You always drive, and today suddenly Ale's driving.
I'm supposed to trust Ale.
Unless you drive, I'm not budging.
- He knows how to drive.
- I don't care. I'm staying home.
All right, Ale.
You'll take Leone and Mama.
If Giulia won't go, it's her loss.
I'll take them, but they all have to come.
Including Giulia.
- But how?
- You can persuade her.
She likes you and does whatever you ask.
She has to come along, like it or not.
I assure you:
You won't be sorry this time.
Why?
It's a surprise.
Dear Augusto,
you've always underestimated me.
But this time
I'll keep my promise.
Everyone ready?
Don't do anything stupid.
Comfortable?
Be careful, you hear?
Remember your signals and handbrake, and drive slowly.
I left a note on the table.
Read it when you have time.
What about?
Just things.
I'll get rid of everyone
for you today, including myself.
I failed the driving test.
I had to lie to get the car.
From one man to another:
good-bye.
I'd like to be cremated.
Come on!
Watch out!
Go!
- Ale, I'm afraid!
- Go!
I'm afraid!
Slow down, please!
Come on, you can do it!
I forgot.
That car made me lose my head.
This is a good spot, but I wasn't prepared.
Did you say something?
Mama wants to know why we stopped.
We stopped because we stopped, all right?
Hey there. How are you?
- Coming in?
- What for?
We forgot water
for the flowers.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
I'm falling!
Let's all say a requiem together.
- Why don't you want to?
- Because I don't.
- Yes!
- No!
- At least take off your sweater.
- And then?
You always end up taking it off.
Why make me ask for half an hour?
I end up begging, like you're doing me a favor.
Where are you going?
Stay here.
I don't know why you get so offended.
All right. I'm sorry.
It's been one of those days.
Read this and tell me if I'm not entitled.
And you just sit there?
Do something.
- You don't really think he'd do it!
Wait for me, Ale.
Where are you going?
Wait for me.
When you raced with that car,
I wasn't afraid at all.
You were a maniac.
I felt like I was driving too.
I really wanted you to pass him.
Why did you stop?
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
Is it an attack?
It's just one of those days.
I made my mind up about a lot of things, but then I changed my mind and went back on my decisions.
But now, come hell or high water,
I'm absolutely determined.
Please, Augusto.
You want me to sit down?
Is that better now?
Why so afraid? Whatever was gonna happen has already happened.
What's this nonsense?
I was just joking.
They could be back any minute.
We'll hear the car.
Are you crazy?
I don't like this.
What don't you like?
I don't know. The way you're talking.
My mind is racing.
Are you imagining the same thing I am?
Come on, tell the truth.
That must be them.
Get off the bed.
I'm glad they're back.
I was starting to think... -
If they hadn't returned, would you feel responsible?
Responsible for what?
Let's get things straight here.
Then why did you let yourself go?
Let myself go?
You obviously don't know me very well.
You were dreaming, just like I was.
The lights, Leone.
- Are you crazy?
- Look what he writes!
"I'd like to be cremated."
You little jerk!
Aren't you ashamed to show your face?
Stop laughing and get up!
Are you sick or what?
- Hey.
- What?
You knew this and still allowed me to go?
Stop laughing.
You'll make him mad.
- That's the surprise you promised me?
- What surprise?
Idiot!
What torture, living in this house.
All by yourself, just like that, you decided for all of us?
That was a narrow escape.
That's why you wanted me along too.
You didn't do it, but to think you could even conceive of it!
Giulia, listen.
Out of my way.
'Raus!
Come on.
- Someone's coming.
- Don Luigi?
Of course not.
Don't you hear it?
Yes, I know him.
- You do?
- It's Sandro, from the villa.
- They're all crazy out there.
- Quiet, idiot! He'll hear you.
You're the idiot.
What do we do now?
Come on, let's go.
"Condemned to spend your youthful years in this uncivilized hamlet."
How much do I need to raise them professionally?
I can help you raise them, but I've got no money.
How much would it take?
At least three or four million.
You have that much?
I'll stop by tomorrow evening and let you know.
All right.
All right, but why breeding?
You even forget to feed your four rabbits.
Why don't you learn to make business cards instead?
I saw it in today's paper.
Ten lire per card for drawing one flower.
Some people earn
10,000 lire a day.
Your enterprise would mean taking on debt, which I have no desire to do.
Mama alone costs three million a year.
Between you and me, if we didn't have her... -
But we do, and I just couldn't put her in a home.
We don't get public assistance, you know.
Are you ready?
Did you make a shopping list?
- It's in my bag.
Let's go, then.
- Augusto's here too.
- Don't look at him.
Stop looking.
- You know the others?
- Probably his friends.
Stop it.
Is Lucia there too?
- What if she is?
- Why are they laughing?
That's their business.
What will you have?
- Yes?
- A vermouth.
- Red or dry?
- What?
- Red or dry?
- Dry.
Ma'am?
Two dry vermouths.
Don't wait for me.
I'm getting a ride.
Did you get everything?
- Yes, we're all done.
- You need gas?
- No, we've got plenty.
All right. Tell Mama
I'll be home for supper.
And drive slowly, please.
I'm coming.
I suddenly feel hot.
I'll ride with Sandra.
You go ahead.
Let's go.
Lucia wouldn't tell us who you were talking to.
To the right!
Look at that fat one!
To the right!
Come on.
I'm going to the bathroom.
You can take your time.
Ready?
Did you make up your mind?
He looked.
I knew it.
I win.
That's enough sugar, Leone.
How did you think of that?
You're the one who said he was better.
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I know, and that's enough.
What are you going to do?
- I guess I'll take a bath.
Is that you, Ale?
Sorry, Mama.
It slipped my mind.
Have you been waiting long?
If you're busy, we can go another day.
Why would I be busy?
Want to come to the cemetery?
No. See you tonight.
Enjoy your bath.
I'm so sorry I kept you waiting.
- It doesn't matter.
You'll see.
We'll be back in no time.
Put me in the front seat.
And please don't upset me.
Let me enjoy the ride.
Have you got the money or not?
We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay?
All right, but stay in touch, okay?
All set?
Thanks, and have a good drive.
- Who was that?
- Tonino.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Ale, please open the window a little.
Of course. You get carsick.
I'm sorry.
Should we stop a while?
It's no problem.
Yes, maybe we should.
I can get some fresh air.
- Of course.
We have all the time in the world.
- Where are we?
- San Salvatore.
Don't get too close.
It's dangerous.
I'm sorry, but you'd better guide me.
Please, where can I sit down?
Come and sit on the wall.
Go ahead.
You can do it.
Ale, help me.
Where did you go?
- Keep going.
- Where are you?
Where's the wall? Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Ale, please help me.
Please, Ale, help me.
Help me sit down.
Blessed mother, pray for her...
Park over there.
"Knock and it shall be opened unto you."
- What are these?
- Mourning cards.
You have to choose one.
- You decide.
This house was never as lively as it is now... - for a funeral.
Many happy returns.
- Come on, Sandro.
Lucia really knows her way around a kitchen.
She makes great coffee.
How can you talk about coffee now?
I was just paying Lucia a compliment.
Why don't you go sit with Mama?
Giulia must be tired.
I'm on my way.
Tonight we could leave her alone.
She's not going anywhere.
We'll see. Now go.
- Coffee's ready.
- I'll take it.
Would you care for coffee?
Take one.
Go ahead.
Forgive me, but are you in or out?
Let's discuss it another time.
With chinchillas, if we wait, we'll lose the first litter.
Then let's forget it.
I don't know. I'm all confused.
I can't think straight.
Is it the money, or have you lost interest?
Tonino, even you must see this isn't the proper time.
My mother... -
- Forget I mentioned it.
Leone, go on.
I'll stay here.
Let me help you.
Everything will be all right.
Are you crazy?
Ah, Leone.
Come in.
Don't be afraid.
Do you need something?
Want some coffee?
Lucia, make him some coffee.
Say something, for God's sake.
Want me to dry?
What is it?
If you want to go, I'll stay.
How do you feel?
How do you think I feel?
Excuse me, Sisters, but this is our last chance to be alone with our poor mother.
Why did you send them away?
Because.
You always want to look important.
Are you sorry Mama's dead?
What a question.
Well, are you all right, or aren't you?
I'm restless, all mixed up, full of ideas.
Aren't you?
Certainly. It's a great opportunity, and everyone wants to take advantage.
Did you see how helpful
Augusto was being?
What's on your mind?
Do you even have to ask?
I'm a volcano of ideas.
Are you crazy?
I'll bet Augusto thinks he can get married now and move into town.
Too bad he'll have to stay here.
Please, Ale.
Come back down to earth.
He's the one who gives orders here.
True.
But I'm no longer under his spell.
Can't I say so?
You can say what you like, for all I care.
The way he was bossing
Lucia around today... as if we were all half-wits.
- What good is talking about it?
- Doesn't it hurt?
What good is talking about it?
Can't you see he's taking advantage of Mama's death?
- And why shouldn't he?
- Why shouldn't he?
Whoever has a plan will take advantage.
You have no plans, so you'll just look on.
He'll profit from this because he's the only one who wants something.
- Let's get something straight here.
- By all means.
Go ahead and snicker.
You think Mama died by accident?
I killed her.
With these hands, despite my fears.
I risk life imprisonment for the family's benefit, while he, like a thief, suddenly becomes "big brother."
He brings in Lucia and has her serve coffee, and he'll walk off with the fortune I made!
This little brain of mine... that you didn't trust an inch planned the whole thing.
My head!
Giulia, hold my head!
I'll come around.
Quiet or they'll hear us.
That's a good boy.
Go away.
Lean on me.
Come lie down on the bed.
Are you going to tell?
Are you going to tell?
Tell me how it happened.
Be a good boy
and keep your voice down,
or the devil
will come and get you.
If you wish to say a last farewell to your poor mother, do so before we close the lid on this gentlest and most grief-stricken of mothers.
No one's closer to us than our mother.
"No one can take the place of a mother," says an old proverb.
This woman, destined by divine providence to have her faith and Christian patience tried by lifelong misfortune... - at least now she can look down upon you from above.
I wouldn't have
the courage to kiss her.
Unfortunately, nature makes exceptions for nobody.
Yet "divine patience is omnipotent."
But that's another sermon.
A fur coat.
Look, Mama's fur coat.
There's nobody here anymore who's blind!
Where should we put it?
That's the first and last time you sleep outside.
And in a stable!
That's not even proper.
Why don't we move away?
What a brilliant idea.
There's something
I have to tell you.
Here we go.
Just a second.
I would save these magazines.
This collection might be valuable.
What do you want to do with Mama's room?
Let's hear it.
It's just that I'm getting married, and it seemed advisable... - or rather, necessary... - that I tell you.
Giulia, come sit here so he only has to look in one place.
If that's all, it's fine with me.
And I'm sure
Giulia would have no... -
Although I hardly know Lucia, we'll all get along well together.
Perhaps you didn't understand.
I meant we're planning to get an apartment in town.
I'll split my time between here and there.
Monday, Wednesday and Saturday in town, and the rest here.
Even a small apartment costs money.
This is a bit awkward, but Mama's death eliminates certain expenses.
Exactly... - the three million you promised me.
I assumed you'd forgotten about that.
How would you use it?
- I'll tell you.
When?
Tomorrow.
Remember Uncle Giuseppino?
Here we go!
Ale, be careful!
How am I doing so far?
Fine.
I'm just afraid that sooner or later you're going to tell him, simply out of vanity.
Certainly I'll tell him.
Problem is, I've lost the desire to raise chinchillas.
I'm bursting with energy.
I have to channel it into something.
We have lots of work ahead.
We'll empty the attic, clean the house. We'll be busy.
But for how long?
I loved the chinchillas.
I swear.
I'd dream about them at night.
You missed me.
Some of this stuff is still good.
They're burning everything.
If it weren't for me... -
Mama's glasses are all charred.
Look at this thing.
The pot we cooked eggs in.
This is burning hot.
Enough!
What's wrong with you?
You got the devil inside you?
- Am I a good lover?
- You'll learn.
We said 3,000.
I'm putting it here on the table, okay?
Have you known Augusto long?
Years.
- Is he good?
- Certainly better than you.
No doubt.
He's been doing it for years.
Does he visit you often?
- Three or four times a month.
In this bed?
What is this, an inquisition?
Come on.
This bed or another one... - whatever's available.
- How many years?
- I already told you. Weren't you listening?
Here we go again.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Where have you been for half an hour?
With a whore.
She's coming up ahead.
There.
- Which one?
There.
- The one in red?
- Yes. Did you get a good look?
You went with her?
To bed?
Go back around.
I want a better look.
The train!
- Here we are.
- Go slow.
Take a good look.
I'm not circling back again.
You recognize her?
Not bad, is she?
What do you think?
Will you go back again?
Why wasn't I invited?
Sandro didn't want it.
Ask him.
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Who told you?
He's lying.
How do I look?
So you're going?
I'll tell you about it afterwards.
I wasn't invited.
Neither was I.
Giulia, watch Leone.
Call me if anything happens.
What could happen?
Leone, do something.
Can't you see they're leaving?
Sandro, I beg you, don't do anything silly, and remember to wish Lucia a happy birthday.
Remember your manners.
Hi, how are you?
Good evening.
And above all, no drinking.
Is that clear?
- How do I look?
- Fine.
- Look my way occasionally.
- Of course.
Couldn't you go around the other way?
This is Alessandro.
Happy birthday.
Don't we look nice tonight.
So chic.
What a crowd.
I hardly know anyone.
I'll introduce you around.
Hey there.
Look, there's Sandro.
Got a cigarette?
Where did we leave off?
Ah, right... - at Hobbes's theory:
Homo homini lupus, which means that man acts like a wolf towards other men.
And what about women?
You disappoint me.
Can you really be that narrow-minded?
Women are incidental in philosophy.
Remember what Thomas Aquinas said in his Summa Theologica.
Are you new here?
Yes. I'm Augusto's brother.
Ah, Lucia's fiancé?
What do you do?
It's a bit unusual.
Come and sit here.
Are you always alone like this?
Shall we dance?
I don't really feel like it.
- Shall we dance?
- I don't know how.
- I'll teach you.
- Fine, if you'll teach me.
Come on, then.
- How do you do it?
- Like this.
- Where are you going?
- We have to talk.
- Is this wood?
- I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
Do you like my friends?
Yes. They're friendly people that you can talk to.
Would you like to live in town?
Sure. It's a lot of fun here.
But I'd need something to do.
I'm not against your marriage, even if Augusto thinks I am.
We all have our own lives.
It's just that, financially speaking... -
- Here you are.
- We were talking about you.
Somebody's looking for you.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
Great. Enjoy yourself.
I had no luck.
But she'd go with you. Honest.
She keeps asking for you.
I like how you said,
"I can't dance. All right, teach me."
There she is. See ya.
- No, don't go.
- Why?
- Stay here.
- See ya.
Shall we dance?
My brother's waiting for me.
I should go.
Give me your telephone number.
No, but you can always find me on the main boulevard.
See you around.
Wait... -
The car isn't ready.
- Want more coffee?
- No, it doesn't matter.
- Take mine.
- No, thanks.
- I'll leave some.
- Fine.
And now let's go paint.
What's wrong, Ale?
Are you angry about the car?
It's annoying.
I shaved for nothing.
- You can go into town tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
I'll have to shave again.
You know how hard it is.
Won't you come paint?
You go.
I'll come later.
I need to take a walk by myself.
I could tell.
May I come in?
Get out of there.
What are you doing?
Come out here.
What are you doing?
Let me give you a buggy ride.
Here he comes!
Where were you?
I was where I was.
What's wrong?
I feel depressed and useless.
You can't be depressed just 'cause you shaved.
Apparently I can.
How can I tire myself out?
The thought of painting is too depressing today.
Stop it, Leone!
You're messing up the floor!
Leone needs a bath.
I'll get it ready for him.
I'll go if you want.
Finish up here before I get back.
We should call it a day.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I'm glad.
Take off your shoes.
Now, Leone, while I prepare your bath, you go get a big towel, some underwear, some socks and an undershirt.
Leave your shoes in the kitchen and put on your slippers.
Get your bottle of yellow pills and a glass.
Go on now.
Now get undressed.
How many do you take?
- One.
Drink this.
Better not lock the door.
If anything happened, who would help you?
Go.
Five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten.
What's wrong?
What is it, Ale?
We forgot all about Leone.
You gonna spend your whole life in the tub?
What's wrong?
Did you fall asleep?
What's wrong?
What should we do now?
Just wait.
Her condition is stable for now.
Stable?
That's all you can say?
Just wait and hope things turn out well.
But you must have some prognosis.
Sandro, I'm not a magician.
But you must have an opinion... - either there's hope or there isn't.
You have to tell me something.
She could live or die or end up paralyzed.
Hear that?
Be quiet!
Get out of here!
I told you he'd get mad.
But what are her chances?
Can't you tell me that?
- It wouldn't change anything.
- It would for me!
What should we do?
You're breathing.
You're alive.
Just when things were starting to work out.
When we might have started inviting people.
Giulia may live or die or be paralyzed and a burden to us for 30 years.
Right back where we started.
You're right to want to leave, to sell this place.
Giulia's awake and asking for you.
Giulia, can you hear me?
Are you alive?
Can you feel your legs?
How about your arms?
Everything's working.
- Stop it.
What's wrong?
We can pick up where we left off, just like before.
You know Leone's dead, right?
Aren't you glad?
You're crying? Why?
- Because you don't love me.
- I don't?
But I do.
- Sorry. The door was open.
- Come in.
Have you seen how neat everything is?
Lucia's marvelous.
Yes, she's very efficient.
A real dynamo.
Thank you for being so understanding about me and Lucia.
Listen, Augusto.
It's time we spoke frankly.
- Can you believe it?
- What?
My wife and kids are supposed to live here?
I knew you'd say that.
He's thought of every angle.
You understand?
- What angles?
He'll leave you and Lucia alone because he can't get along without you.
I'll turn him in.
Let me finish.
Relax.
If anyone should be afraid here, it's me.
- What are you saying?
- It's true. I know him.
Besides, if you turned him in, they wouldn't believe you.
There's no evidence.
And you won't get a word out of me.
For him to dream, to get excited, he needs active people around him, people who don't need help.
Above all, they mustn't be incurables.
Let's stick together.
You and me.
- Of course.
Don't be afraid.
Just do what you've always done.
It'll be all right.
I'm leaving.
Okay. See you.
See you.
If you need anything, just tell me.
Giulia, are you asleep?
Sleep well.
Everything's working out for the best.
Sleep, sleep.
And tomorrow... -
Help me!
Help me!
Giulia, hold my head!

PITFALL
Here.
Oh, what are you making?
Hey, I brought food. You eating?
We're coming
It's hot.
It's hot!
It's getting tough, so close to the bedrock.
You think we'll hit pay dirt?
Yeah, I do.
The ground's gettin' nice and sticky.
Is that so?
Well, sticky or not,
I can feel something.
Gramps, if we hit coal, you'll be a big mining boss.
Stop kidding around.
- Look at this.
- What's that?
Smell it!
That's the smell of coal, nice and rich.
Time to eat.
Come over here.
Wash your hands.
There's nothing like white rice.
Sorry I can only pay you in food.
We're out of work anyway.
Besides, if you paid us, we'd owe you if we didn't hit coal.
Want some tea?
You definitely leaving in the morning?
Yeah.
Catching the first bus.
Where are you going?
The boardinghouse in town.
Something'll work out.
The old hick hasn't caught on to us yet.
But he will.
I'm getting out while the getting's good.
Yeah.
I hear there's bounty hunters around looking for deserters like us.
What'd you do that for?
What's it to you?
We could've made dog stew.
You should've told me sooner!
Hey, doggie, come back here.
Come back.
Shit.
He's gone.
Dogs and miners are both better off running away.
Even if I run from here now,
I'll probably just end up at another mine.
Who knows?
Could even be more hellish than the last.
Everyone knows they bait the line.
Give you 1, 000 yen, then eat you up.
A slow tailspin to the depths of hell, where you crash and burn.
What do you wanna be in your next life?
Forget it.
One life's enough for me.
Me, I wanna work somewhere where there's a union.
A union?
Yeah.
Just once...
I'd like to have my say and give my boss a good kick in the ass.
I'd like to be reborn as a demon.
A demon?
Yup.
I'd be reborn in hell anyway, and demons have it easier there.
Yeah.
A demon's a good choice.
Want a caramel, kid?
Take it.
Hey, look!
They're hiring.
Hello?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
The Marusan warehouse at 8:00.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Stand there like a telephone pole and a dog's gonna piss on you.
Couple of new guys.
Sorry, we don't need any more men.
You came from a mine?
You have any proof of address?
That's all right. I don't need it.
Let's see you jump.
Jump up and down!
Fine.
You're not crippled. We can use you.
Hey!
What's going on?
A deserter.
Next, 280 yen.
Next, 300 yen.
Next, 250 yen.
Hey, you.
Me?
- Come here.
- What is it?
Isn't this your picture?
Looks like it.
But what's it doing here?
Don't worry. It's about a job.
Just follow this map to your new boss.
I'll give him a call about you now.
Is this some kind of trick?
Don't worry. Just be glad it's work.
That's right. You're lucky.
I've got work!
I'm no cripple.
Isn't anyone here?
Hello!
Hello!
There's nobody here.
Hello.
Is that the mailman?
Finally!
Excuse me...
I just wanted to ask directions.
So you're not the mailman?
This is where I want to go.
Let's see now.
You should go that way.
I thought so too.
The map doesn't show a fork in the road.
That must be the hill over there.
What a ghost town.
The mine was closed. They said it could cave in.
The men all ran away in the night.
They owed me 7,000 yen.
That's a tough break.
You can say that again.
Aren't you gonna leave too?
I'm no stray dog. I can't leave with no place to go.
A friend of mine's gonna send for me as soon as he gets himself settled.
Well...
I should get going.
Sorry for the bother.
Stop that!
Thanks.
Why doesn't he write?
Was he lying?
You saw all that, didn't you, ma'am?
It's quite all right.
I'd like to ask for your cooperation.
If the police ask, tell them...
"The killer looked like a miner.
He wore split-toed work boots, so the footprints will be easy to spot.
He threw the knife in the marsh.
Then he came and threatened to kill me if I talked.
Then he left and hurried north.
He looked...
35 or 36.
He had a round face and a bald spot above his right ear. "
That's how it was, right?
Am I dead?
Where the hell did he go?
What did he have against me?
Pops, did you see a guy with white gloves?
Hey.
Little boy.
Lady, did you see a man with white gloves?
Please tell me!
Can't you hear me?
What's the matter?
You can't hear me, can you?
I guess not. I'm dead.
The living can't hear ghosts.
She probably can't see me either.
I guess she can't.
Being invisible might have been useful when I was alive, but this is unbearable.
Lady, I'm telling you, this is really terrible!
Hey! Your daddy's dead!
Go ahead, take it. I paid for it.
Wait for me right there!
Who are these people?
Yes, sir.
He had a round face, and a bald spot right here.
Bald spot?
Right ear?
How big was it?
Well... about this big.
He was dressed like a miner.
Must've been two miners in a brawl.
You bitch!
Why is she spreading these filthy lies?
A quarrel... two miners.
All right.
Give me the details later.
Hey, shut the kid up!
I'm busy right now.
- Did you touch the corpse?
- Of course not.
Hello.
We've got a murder.
Yes, sir.
Here's the information.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
This way.
That's the crime scene.
Please go ahead.
I was looking out my window, and I saw them heading in that direction.
They started scuffling, and one was killed.
You were looking from that house?
Get a shot of the whole scene with the body.
Describe the body's position in detail.
The killer ran this way?
Place a marker here.
Careful not to disturb the footprints.
Where shall I stand?
Over there's fine.
Morning. A murder, huh?
Looks that way.
Any leads?
That's what they're looking for.
I heard there's a witness.
- A woman from a candy store.
- I see.
No pictures.
Here... and here.
The fatal wound was to the heart.
Could you pull that up a bit more?
That's fine.
What about there?
- The carotid artery?
- Right here.
Get a shot of this.
- Got it.
- Man, he really got worked over.
Is that your corpse?
You can see me?
Of course. I'm a ghost too.
What happened to you?
A cave-in.
Can't you straighten your neck?
The dead stay forever as they were at death.
Did you eat just before dying?
No, I didn't.
That's really rotten luck.
You'll be starving forever.
Too late now though.
That woman! Why'd she lie like that?
Who cares? It's not worth getting upset about.
They can't nab the killer unless she tells the truth!
The dead only upset themselves by worrying about the living.
Let's go. Forget about them.
I've got to know why!
I wanna see that guy in white gloves get caught and confess.
Why did I have to die?
Why you gotta know that?
I can't rest in peace until I do.
The newly dead all talk like that.
They think it'll let them rest in peace.
But it never works that way.
The more you find out, the deeper the mystery, and the more you suffer.
Give it up. Let's go.
When you die, it's best just to accept the mystery.
But I can't rest in peace until I know!
The new ones all talk like that.
I'm warning you, the more you know, the worse it'll be.
He was the chief of Union
No. 2 at the Hirakawa Mine.
The chief?
This might be a big scoop.
Investigators may be back to search for the knife, so don't let anyone on the property.
This is horrible.
I should move away from here soon.
I'll come around tonight on patrol.
You're a witness, and the killer might come back for revenge.
Let me know if anything happens.
Thank you. I will.
Hello?
Is this Union No. 2 at the Hirakawa Mine?
This is The Nishikuni Times.
Is the chief in?
Yes, the union head.
Is this Mr. Otsuka?
It is? So you're alive?
No, pardon me.
What'd you expect?
It ain't that easy to get a scoop.
Damn, it's hot!
I found it!
What?
The ghost is alive.
Alive?
What do you mean?
He came to the phone in person.
I felt like a fool.
That's impossible! Look at this!
What?
They look almost alike.
No, they look exactly alike.
It's the same guy for sure.
This is no place for a woman on her own.
I've got money.
Now's the time to run.
Horrible...
It's just horrible.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Hey, what're you doing?
You're a material witness, you know.
I have to get out of here.
I guess you do.
This is no place for a woman alone.
No one else showed up?
Nobody at all.
It's really secluded out here.
It's awful. I can't stand it anymore.
Yeah, you must've been scared.
What's the matter? Come here.
I said come here!
We're all alone.
- What're you doing?
- Don't be shy.
I don't want this. Stop!
What are you doing?
No, don't.
You must be lonely, huh?
Nishikuni Times. We just called.
- What is it?
- We'd like to see the union head.
Hey, you seen the chief?
He's at the dressing plant. I'll get him.
So this is what a union office looks like.
What a huge mine!
You had something more to ask?
Can you spare a moment?
We'd like to hear what you have to say about this.
It looks like me.
Looks like you're asleep.
You're sure it's the chief?
Yeah, must be.
This man is dead.
I'm the one who's dead!
Stabbed in the chest?
Those are bloodstains.
He was stabbed in the side, neck and heart.
- So?
- Do you have any brothers?
No.
And of course this isn't you.
So it's just a chance likeness?
I'd say so.
But what a striking resemblance!
One more picture.
Does this scene look familiar?
Isn't that the abandoned pit at the Takaoka Mine?
That's right.
- You know it?
- Yeah.
We ought to. It's on the way to the New Pit.
I see.
So you've passed by there.
You mean that's where he was killed?
The white line marks the spot.
- When was it?
- Between 7:00 and 8:00 this morning.
It was a trap!
The chief was to pass by there around 8:00 this morning.
He was?
That was the schedule, but we changed it half an hour before leaving.
Then it's reasonable to suspect a trap.
You were the intended victim.
Your plans changed unexpectedly, and your look-alike, who happened to be there, was killed.
Yes, that must be it.
It was no accident!
The police didn't find the map I was carrying!
It must've been a gang.
You mean you have someone in mind?
Someone from Union No. 1, for example?
Yes, that's likely.
Shouldn't you call the police then?
Yes.
But how would we explain it to them?
Just a minute.
I still can't believe it.
They may hate me, but enough to try to kill me?
They'd only be hurting themselves.
You're right.
Maybe it was a warning to anyone defecting to your union.
Yeah! They're fighting to rein in the Old Pit faction.
Old Pit faction?
Our mine has an Old Pit and a New Pit.
We at the Old Pit broke off and organized Union No. 2.
But we've tried not to step on anyone's toes.
I was supposed to visit the New Pit, since eight of their men wanted to join our union.
I was going to stop them.
Stop them? Why?
The guys at the New Pit call us traitors and company stooges.
But it isn't that simple.
Before the split, the New Pit was the mainstay, since we were small.
We had few workers.
We were like a subunit.
We all belonged to the same union, so we pretended to get along.
But then the company moved in to divide and conquer.
It all began like this:
The company decided to lay off some of our men.
The union didn't put up a united front.
The New Pit guys didn't care what happened to us.
That's how the union started to crack in two.
I see.
The company exploited our weakness and took an even tougher stance.
How could we fight back with the New Pit selling us out?
I see your point.
A confrontation between us and the New Pit became inevitable.
I see. But in that case -
Just then the company baited us with the promise not to lay us off if we split off and formed a second union.
Is that ruthless or what?
We debated three full days and nights.
Break off and betray the union, or let them betray us?
We were in tears when we finally decided to split off.
It was hell having to do that to our fellow workers.
But are you saying things aren't tense enough to come to murder?
No, they are!
The New Pit's facing job cuts now.
One wrong move and the union will be split forever. Right?
Yes, it's possible.
By the way, do you know a man with a bald spot above his ear?
- Would that be Toyama?
- Toyama?
Second-in-command at Union No. 1.
I see.
Did Toyama do something?
- He's about to be arrested.
- Arrested?
There's a witness.
A woman, a nearby candy vendor, saw the whole thing.
She told the police the killer had a bald spot above his right ear.
That's bullshit!
I can't believe it.
Chief, you're too trusting.
So it seems Union No. 1 will be disbanded as planned.
Serves 'em right. Violence gets you nowhere in a nation of laws.
- Thanks for your trouble.
- Yes, thanks.
Wait!
You just said "as planned," didn't you?
"As planned"?
Did I say that?
What did you mean?
I don't remember saying that.
A slip of the tongue, I guess.
We have to call the police.
- We can't!
- Why not?
That reporter suspects me.
Of what?
It's a trap.
Soon the police will be suspecting me too.
Why do you say that?
Union No. 1 had nothing to gain from the murder, but we did.
Besides, it's too great a coincidence that a man looking like me was on that road just then.
Yeah.
That seemed odd to me too.
Any fool can see it was a setup.
What about the witness?
That's a good question.
She might've been pressured.
But would they go that far?
Who is it?
Sorry to bother you again.
What is it? Did you forget something?
- Who are you calling?
- Toyama.
Get me the New Pit union office.
Be careful!
It could be a trap.
Union office? Is Mr. Toyama there?
Yes, Toyama.
This is Otsuka of the Old Pit.
Mr. Toyama.
Mr. Otsuka at the Old Pit is calling.
Otsuka?
What the hell?
We have nothing to talk about.
Toyama speaking.
Is this Toyama?
What is it now?
Something urgent has come up.
A reporter just left here for your office.
A reporter?
Why's he coming here?
I don't believe it myself, but you're suspected of murder.
Murder?
Of course I don't believe it for a second.
It can't be.
What murder?
I have an alibi.
I've been with my men day and night since the strike.
Don't waste my time!
Listen, this is serious.
I can't give details over the phone.
There's some terrible plot brewing.
Can't we meet?
No need. My hands are clean.
But there's a witness.
The candy vendor in the ghost town told the police you did it.
What a load of crap!
This "load of crap" is gonna do you in!
Even a tiny leak can sink a ship. DOUBLE-CROSSER
Let's go see her together and get to the bottom of this before it's too late.
All right. Where?
Hold on.
T ell 'em I'm not here.
Don't answer any questions.
What is it?
We're from The Nishikuni
Times, here to see Mr. Toyama.
- What for?
- Isn't he here?
No. We're on strike.
You can't just barge in like this.
This is important.
You want Toyama?
Sorry, but he's out now.
He'll be back in a few hours. Wanna wait?
Fine.
I'm dead.
I'm a ghost.
I'll never know what it says, but it's too late anyway.
What a monster!
How cruel! I did what he told me.
Why'd he kill me?
Filthy rat!
And that cop!
Excuse me! May I have a word?
How am I supposed to answer you?
I'm dead.
Excuse me!
Anyone home?
I'm home all right, but I'm dead.
You better not come in.
Is she out?
You!
It's not my fault! I got killed too. Please forgive me.
Even if I'd refused his money, you'd still be dead, right?
Are you... still alive?
She's dead.
You're alive!
Damn it! I was too late.
I'll say!
You raise a ruckus pretending to be dead, but I'm the one who really got killed!
Why me?
Who could've killed her?
You two were in cahoots!
It's a trap!
Daddy.
Come here.
Hey, stop!
Is that him?
No, it's not.
What's he up to?
He wouldn't answer me anyway.
The union chief!
So it was you!
You let me die for you and then killed the woman!
Vicious scum!
Must a man become a demon just to survive?
Hey! I saw everything!
So it's you!
I saw her.
I had nothing to do with it!
I saw it with my own eyes!
Wait, hear me out.
Listen, will you?
- What for?
It's too late for excuses.
I didn't do it, I tell you!
I don't believe you!
...and then I called you...
Did he kill you?
So... you're dead after all?
I was killed in that guy's place.
We look alike.
Son of a bitch!
No, you've got it all wrong!
Some trap you lured me into!
He's not the one who killed me.
Then who did?
The same guy who killed you.
He came back?
The guy with the white gloves and leather briefcase.
Who the hell is he?
I have no idea.
Then why did you lie for him?
I'm sorry.
I wanted the money.
Well, then... why did he kill you?
I don't have the slightest idea.
He killed me without a word, took the money back, and left.
Who the hell had anything to gain by murdering the likes of me?
Double-crossers like you always have a good story!
Double-crossers?
You're the one who betrayed the Old Pit, a spineless dog who barked when the company told you to.
Fine! We'll let others decide who the real criminal here is!
You stupid shit!
One murder led to another, is that it? You're gonna hang!
We're both gonna hang, you stubborn fool!
Who'll believe nobodies like us?
Murder, huh?
You don't stop at anything, do you?
A great example for our members!
Son of a bitch! Where do you think you're going?
Stop, you bastard!
Stop, damn you!
Come back!
You don't understand a fucking thing!
They're really going at it.
That's some fight.
Fuck you!
UNITE
Who are you?
Why did you kill me?
Tell me!
Who the hell put you up to it?
Why did you kill me?
Who stood to gain from my death?
Exactly as planned.
What's that?
Look here! Tell me!
There has to be a reason to kill a man!
Why did you kill me?
Say something! Speak up!
You have to tell us!
You can't do this, you son of a bitch!
We don't understand!
Why don't you tell us?
Why did you kill me? Who was it for?
I'm so hungry!
Oh, shit!

SHIMAZU
Shimazu's in the back seat
on the right.
His bodyguard, Funaki,
is on the left.
Shimazu leaves home every morning at this time for his office in Ginza.
He keeps a regular schedule, only varying it under special circumstances.
The car windows are bulletproof.
This might seem like a good place to target him, but those windows are bulletproof too.
As you can see, his bodyguard's always with him.
It'll be a tough job, even for you.
After lunch tomorrow, he'll be at the bank and foreign ministry, preparing for his trip abroad.
He should finish at 2:30.
At 3:00, he'll meet with our boss one last time in the tearoom at Kikaku.
If I do say so, our boss is really too kind.
Why meet with Shimazu now?
In any case, the meeting will last an hour, so he'll return to his office shortly after 4:00.
If he leaves his office at his usual time, 5:00, he'll probably go straight home.
There he'll relax until his departure in two days.
That's about it.
What do you think?
- You've done your research.
- That's my job.
- Your information is reliable?
- Yes.
So... will you do it?
Tomorrow is Shimazu's last full day in Japan.
If you don't kill him tomorrow, we're in trouble.
You can do it, right?
You're our last hope.
If you botch it, we're done for.
Here's half the money and two passports:
One for you, and one for Mr. Shiozaki.
Please examine them.
It should all be in order.
Here are your boarding passes.
You'll get the other half at the usual place once the job is done.
But as we agreed, we'll need to confirm he's dead first.
I'll make sure you can't miss it.
We'd appreciate that.
As I mentioned before, this port has long been the Otawara gang's territory, but recently the Shimazu gang from Kansai has muscled its way in.
But that needrt be a problem.
We go into Kansai sometimes too.
It's stupid for us to squabble in a small country like Japan.
We have to dream big, so we made plans to team up with a foreign organization.
But Shimazu got greedy.
He stole the deal from us, and that's why -
That's why he's leaving Japan the day after tomorrow.
We have to stop him before he leaves.
That's enough.
Show me the way.
Very well.
I'll be going.
We're counting on you.
Don't kid around!
All done.
A lot of people order modifications for fun, but I don't get many customers like you.
I can understand souping up the engine, but why a second brake?
Keep the change.
Thank you, sir!
SHIMAZU
I'd like to see an apartment.
- What kind?
- Have anything on the fourth floor?
We certainly do.
I'll show you.
This one is perfect.
I liked it right away.
Is that so?
Thank you very much.
This is the best building in the neighborhood.
I'd like to look around a bit longer.
Please take your time.
Here are the keys.
I'll most likely take it.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
I'll be leaving now.
What do you think?
Very nice. I'd like to live in a place like that one day.
I'll get you some tea.
Please have a seat.
Tell me:
How did he die?
No special way.
Same as they always do.
Long time no see.
What'll it be today?
This'll go straight into the crusher.
This way.
What a waste.
It's all right.
You're still young.
If you want to stay alive, don't get too attached to your guns.
Yeah, but -
The evidence isn't the prints on my fingers but the bullets I pumped into Shimazu's belly.
With the gun gone, that's taken care of.
Here's the call.
Kamimura here.
Go ahead.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Our boss is at the police station
thanks to you!
I told you I'd make sure you couldn't miss it.
But not when he's with our boss!
Pick up the rest of the money
and disappear!
Exactly what I plan to do.
We just received word.
One moment, please.
I can't believe it.
This is way too classy for them.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Please sign this.
- Let's go.
- Thank you.
Let's move it.
Boss... a call's coming in.
What's up?
Don't get on the plane. The Shimazu
gang's staked out the airport.
This isn't funny.
We're boarding that plane.
Don't be stupid.
You must change your plans.
We won't let things go wrong.
We'll figure something out
and get right back to you.
Let's go.
Air France flight 305
passengers
Mr. Shuji Kamimura
and Mr. Shun Shiozaki
are requested to proceed
to the Air France counter.
Boss, they're paging us.
Screw that. We've got our passports and boarding passes.
Hey!
Keep paging them.
We made it in time.
- Whiskey and water.
- Coming up.
Shall we go?
- What's that?
- Answer it.
Why'd you hang up?
I'm trying to help you.
You're better off
doing what I say.
Kamimura, answer!
What's going on?
- Answer!
- Hang up!
Bastard!
We worked things out.
What do we do now?
There's a Nagisakan Motel
in Yokohama.
When you get there,
call 28-3545.
A man there named Tsugawa
will take care of you.
Got that? 28-3545.
Got it.
NAGISAKAN MOTEL
Here you are.
Thank you.
We'll settle up on the usual day.
Very well. Thank you.
Who are you two?
This is the back entrance.
Room 21.
First door on the second floor.
Here it is.
What a crummy little room.
If you value your life, don't open that window.
Last summer a guy took a bullet in the head when he opened that window.
A young man due to board a ship just three hours later.
Call 28-3545.
Just say that we're here.
They'll understand.
- Shall I get it?
- Leave it.
Hello?
Room 21? Very well.
Stay put for a while.
I'll be back in touch.
Boss... the two men Otawara mentioned arrived at the Nagisakan.
I see.
What about a boat?
Boat 14 leaving at 9:00 tonight connects at Pusan with the Emoru.
Get them on that one.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Senzaki of the Shimazu clan has arrived.
Already?
Show him in.
- In here?
Of course.
Hold off a while on the boat.
I'd better hear what Senzaki has to say.
- Oh, pardon me -
- Come in.
Sorry to intrude.
I have a special favor to ask.
What is it?
Our boss, Mr. Shimazu, was shot earlier today.
These two did the job.
We're sure they fled here after being blocked at the airport.
From here they have to go by boat.
Only you can help them with that, Mr. Tsugawa.
Have they come here?
No idea.
If they have, they're as good as dead.
They can only be at the Nagisakan or a couple other motels.
Can't you do that harder?
If you happen to see them...
You can put that down there.
I hope we can count on you.
- That was quick.
- How much?
Feels like 100.
What do we do?
Tonight's boat is no good.
Whers the next one?
Tomorrow morning - No. 7.
- Make it that one.
- Yes, sir.
And tell them not to stay at the Nagisakan tonight.
Can't you call them from outside?
And draw the blinds.
Morals or money - which will it be?
Money.
Just as I thought.
- Here's your tea.
- Thank you.
Here you go.
Evening!
Long time no see, granny!
What happened?
I haven't seen you guys in ages.
They're always changing our routes.
Some grub, quick.
- Isn't Mina here?
- Of course she is.
That's what I like to hear!
How you doir?
I've been driving back-to-back hauls for 30 hours straight!
I'm dead tired too.
I need some sleep.
Ma'am, wake me up in two hours!
- Will do.
- Two hours, okay?
- I'm not deaf!
Mina!
Where have you been?
You haven't been around at all!
Mina, bring me some tea.
Listen to that guy.
Ah, that's hot!
Don't play with fire!
I'm sorry.
Don't scowl like that.
What is it?
- Are those the only occupied rooms?
- Yes.
Just what do you want?
Come on.
Knock.
Open it and go in.
- Mina!
- What about Mina?
- Are you all truck drivers?
- Keep it the hell down!
And what if I don't?
Bastards!
Check carefully.
If the 2000GT isn't here, there must be tire marks.
Thin ones, not like truck tires.
You understand my feelings,
don't you?
After we met six months ago,
I turned over a new leaf.
I gave up drinking, fighting, and gambling.
Make no mistake -
I'm not like the others.
I'm not kidding around.
Please be my wife.
I saved this up for you.
Please take it.
I'm happy you feel that way, but it's impossible.
Another man once spoke... those same words to me.
But he got himself killed.
The god of death follows me everywhere.
Lots of pretty girls will fall in love with you.
That's right.
Now beat it.
- Who the hell are you?
Didrt you hear me?
Beat it!
Hold on.
Still sending money to that punk's family, aren't you?
What's his mother to you?
You can't be a fool forever.
How about coming back to me?
You can't run away.
Don't get any stupid ideas, or I'll blow a hole in your head like I did with that punk.
Who are you?
Where's Senzaki?
Out of my way.
All we get around here is the riffraff.
- Where are the sewer rats?
- No sign of 'em yet.
That's because you only went after the rats.
You gotta flush out the sewer where they grow fat.
- Meaning?
- Just leave it to me.
But they might come through here.
Use your head.
They won't be coming here today.
You've got pull around here.
Take me somewhere.
Somewhere nice and fancy.
She's a looker, isn't she?
- That was harsh!
- Mina, are you mad?
Son of a bitch!
Please!
All of you, just stop!
MOTEL
- You going through Yokohama?
- That's right.
Will this get us there?
Sure.
Buddy... isn't it time we stopped playing tag?
I don't have the patience.
Who are you?
That's not important.
Now, how about taking me to those sewer rats?
You can go now.
What are you going to do?
I'll wait here for the sewer rats.
- Was that the boat?
- That's right.
- And the next one?
- No idea.
For now we have no plan.
What about our agreement?
Stop it, Shun.
Sorry about all this.
The truck got a little banged up.
I hope this'll make up for it.
I'll set something up.
Go back to the Nagisakan.
I'll call you later.
We're back.
Come all the way back here to get killed?
Were they here?
If you want to stay alive, you'd better get out now.
I'm hungry.
Could you bring us some food?
Boss -
Relax, Shun.
Bring us some food.
This room is dangerous.
What do you care?
It's not your problem.
My room's better.
Nobody goes there except the proprietress sometimes.
Come with me.
It's a bit cramped.
Boss... what do we do now?
Hold it.
You trying to ruin this place?
Those men are wanted.
Stupid girl.
I'll fix your food now.
Boss... we're just sitting here waiting to be killed.
We've been in fixes like this before, and we got out alive every time.
It'll be the same this time.
Still -
Shun, drink up.
It'll calm your nerves.
It's been a while.
Sing something.
A song will make you feel better.
There's just one person
I want to meet
When I go to the wharf
Far off in the night sky
Even if you became
a twinkling star
You would whisper
That you'd wait only for me
Your star
Is a lonely little star
There's just one person
I want to meet
Chasing memories
Wandering aimlessly
"I'm sure happiness
will come soon"
You once said with a smile
But now your face
Is a ghost town in the mist
Arert you open yet?
Bring us some food!
Right away.
- Serve the customers.
- Those men ordered first.
- He fell asleep?
- Must have been tired.
You gave him a sleeping pill.
Sometimes it's best. Especially when you're about to be killed.
Sure you don't need one yourself?
Are you brothers?
Why do you ask?
No reason.
I guess it makes no difference.
It was you two, wasn't it?
They found a body.
The wharf's crawling with police.
So that's why Senzaki and his goons haven't come around.
Get out of here!
This is no place for killers!
You're one to talk.
You want people to know you siphon gas from the trucks?
Who would do such a thing?
Stop telling lies.
Stop the chatter and take some food to the barge.
All right!
- She mentioned a barge.
- What about it?
Forget it.
You can't get away on a barge.
Just take me there.
It's no use.
I already tried it once.
You?
Take me there anyway.
- Why?
- I want to take a look.
Don't worry about Senzaki.
With the police everywhere, he won't come around.
- Give me something to write with.
- What for?
Poor guy won't know where I've gone when he wakes up.
You're very thoughtful.
I envy you men... the way you can be friends.
I was born
and raised on a barge.
It was dark and dirty and miserable.
People called us
"the ones who live on the water."
They looked down on us just for that.
I hated that life ever since I was a child.
I tried to escape so many times... but it was no use.
Then one day
I finally did run away.
I wonder what
I was looking for.
Nothing's really changed since I first arrived on land.
Then I met Senzaki.
I disliked him from the start, so I ran away from him too.
But I can't seem to get away from him.
All that's left for me is dust and the smell of men and gasoline.
Always running away.
I'm exhausted.
We're a lot alike, don't you think?
I'm not running away.
I'm surviving.
That's how
I've stayed alive this long.
If I hadrt fought when I was a kid,
I'd have starved to death.
I'll make it out this time too.
Now that everything's worked out, yesterday's bloody incident seems like a mere dream.
Eh, Mr. Shimazu?
Violence isn't the only way to increase our gang's power.
My father never understood that.
Your father was a very good man, but you and I understand each other much better.
I think business will go very well now that we've teamed up.
There's nothing to fear now.
Everything will be just fine.
Just one thing: I want the head of the rat who killed my father.
That's right.
He's still alive.
What shall we do?
I'll take care of it.
I won't let you down.
Where is that rat?
At the Nagisakan.
I'll be on my way.
Good. Very good.
- We're here.
- Thanks for bringing that, Mina.
Not at all, Captain.
How's the game?
This guy's winning, as usual.
You can see it on his face.
I'll win a little back before we set out this afternoon.
Ah, please join us.
He's not here to play.
Is he your boyfriend?
Mina's a good girl.
If you make her cry, these guys'll kill you.
You're leaving today?
Wasn't it tomorrow?
We work for a crappy company.
They're always changing cargo and destinations on us.
No job's ever gone as scheduled.
Captain, could you take me on your boat?
You?
Me and one other person.
We have passports.
Passports!
Makes no difference one way or the other.
Hide in a corner of the hold.
We'll drop you off wherever you want.
Is the other person Mina?
No, it's not.
I won!
Damn! Again?
My rotten luck!
- Is there room for me too?
- Of course.
There's always room for you, but you always stand us up.
Buddy, don't believe her if she says she's running away with you.
She always stays behind at the last minute.
Those raised here can't go anywhere else.
NAGISAKAN
Son of a bitch!
Don't try anything funny.
Tell me where your friend is!
Bastard!
Fine with me if you don't want to talk, but you'll pay for it.
So get ready!
I don't know anything.
Tsugawa asked me to put them up.
If you don't like it, go tell Tsugawa!
You idiot.
Tsugawa's the one looking for them.
Just today, he and our boss
Shimazu decided to join forces.
So you better talk if you know what's good for you.
- What is it?
- Get down!
You bastards!
Let me go!
We have a problem.
There's one rat left.
Where was Shun?
A dirty room in the attic.
I knew it was Mina.
So they'll try to escape by sea.
The rat's probably on a barge right now.
A barge?
That's bad news.
That's outside my territory.
I can't do anything.
Why not?
You see... those outcasts who work those barges stick together and don't listen to a thing we say.
There must be some way to flush the rat out.
Hello.
All right.
It's from the Nagisakan.
They say Mina came back alone.
I'll go.
Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
- Again?
This time it's really good-bye.
Really?
You tried to escape a long time ago too, but you never made it.
Well, not me.
I'm getting out.
Together with that wanted man?
No.
They took his young friend away.
They beat him up bad.
They'll kill the other one too.
Still leaving?
Yes.
Not so fast.
Come here a minute.
Take it.
It's Senzaki.
Listen...
tell Kamimura that
his young friend's life is in our hands.
If he doesn't want him killed,
he'd better come to Tsugawa's.
Where's Shun?
- He took off.
- Took off?
Did those men show up?
Yes, but I asked the old lady to bring him here.
It'll be fine.
He'll be here soon.
What are you hiding?
Tell me the truth.
What do you mean?
Let's go!
- Stop!
- Hey, don't be so rough.
Cut the crap!
They went to the Nagisakan.
When you got there,
Shun was gone, right?
I told you: The old lady will bring him for sure.
What are you doing here?
You don't belong here.
I know.
I just want to talk to that guy.
Take me to him.
I'm unarmed.
Search me.
All right. Come on.
Go ahead.
What a shame.
You almost got away.
Why have you come here?
She didn't tell you?
Then it's a good thing I came.
We've got your young pal.
He's our hostage.
But it's me you want.
Yeah.
Now will you come with me?
Not so fast.
Let Shun go.
When does the ship sail?
In three hours.
Very well.
We let the little rat get on it.
Then what?
Nothing happens until the ship leaves.
I won't run away or hide.
In exchange, you promise to let Shun go.
We won't lay a hand on you until the ship leaves.
You trust this bastard?
You gotta feel for her.
What are you gonna do with me?
What are you planning?
Tell me!
Little rat... stop your hollering and take a good look.
We have no use for you anymore.
Go somewhere far away and disappear.
You're up to something.
Hurry up!
Boss, it's a trap!
Shun, we came to an agreement.
Come on.
Hurry up!
Shun.
Say a word and I shoot.
Mina, is it true?
Come on.
Set his mind at ease.
Come on. Please.
Come on up.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Boss.
- Shun.
That's better.
Please take care of him.
How could you agree to something so stupid?
Let's go.
Take care now.
I just got off the ship.
Like I said,
I won't run away or hide.
If you want a deserted spot to kill me,
I'll be at the landfill tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
Fine.
See you at the landfill at 7:00 a.m.
Where are we?
Boss!
How many will there be?
Three... five...
maybe even ten men.
With a pistol I'd get one or two,
three at the most.
A shotgun?
With one well-aimed shell,
I could get two of them.
Might not kill them,
but they'd be out of action.
Then there's the Beretta.
Double-barreled.
It can take out four men.
This is a shotgun.
It's often used for hunting... because it scatters shot over a wide area.
He might try to kill us all at once with one of these.
Please excuse us while we play a recording to cover the noise.
That's really something!
We've also considered the possibility he'll use a rifle.
This is a.45 caliber, the largest and most destructive.
Let's see what one of these does to the car.
She cost me a fortune, but she's a sweetheart, isn't she?
A real tank.
We'll ride in this tomorrow to watch them trap the rat.
Just as I thought:
A shotgun.
Please take a look.
Go!

- No good.
- Faster?
No, slower.
Your rhythm is compromising the hole's caliber and you're not allowing the residue to fall.
- Yes, but...
- Please don't interrupt.
You're not pausing properly.
The only hole will be in your thumb.
- But I...
- You have eight seconds...
One, one, one... pause...
One, one, one... pause...
Go to it.
- Keep going with the R50!
- Right.
Listen, Badalamenti.
The laminators are running behind.
We have to take care of it... fast, fast, fast!
Otherwise...
- Badelamenti, Antonio.
- No. Bad-A-lamenti...
- Fifteen days vacation.
- Fifteen?
Then I get the rest of my bonus.
Sure. Sign here.
Right...
- Thanks.
- Hey, my pen!
Department Head Badalamenti to see Dr. Zanchi...
- You are...?
- Badalamenti.
Wait there.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Sir, Mr. Badalamenti is here.
Send him in.
Go in.
Merci beaucoup.
May I?
Young man...
Please come in.
Sit down.
Cigarette?
You wish to convert your bonus into vacation time?
I've given up vacation for work for so many years.
Thank you, sir.
I'm taking my family to my hometown.
My folks never met them.
And we're allowing you to do so.
I don't smoke.
Your record has been exemplary.
It proves the Sicilian technician now equals his counterpart in Turin or Milan. Even the Germans.
The modern Sicilian, as they say, can hold his head up high in Europe and the world.
Excuse me, sir, are you Sicilian yourself?
- No, I'm from Trenton.
- Veneto?
Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.A.
My folks came from Calamo.
Calamo! My hometown!
Precisely. I noticed it when signing your leave.
So in Calamo you must know...
Absolutely everyone.
I meant Don Vincenzo.
Who doesn't know him?
Everyone knows him and he knows everyone.
We're all in his heart.
I remember being a kid at the Villa Traglia-Daragnà, managed by Don Vincenzo...
- Do me a small favor?
- A hundred.
Take Don Vincenzo this gift.
- From some mutual friends.
- Gladly.
It's very valuable.
- Don't worry, sir.
- Give it to him personally.
- It's a great, great honor.
- Good.
- Then...
- Tell me, sir...
Thank you and have a safe trip.
Thank you. Very kind of you.
The door.
Let's move it!
Hey, Marta!
Is that you?
- Did you remember everything?
- Sure.
Suitcase repaired, laundry, cakes, blue dress.
Why the blue dress? For parties?
No, for Sunday mass.
- Got the gifts?
- Sure.
- What did you get?
- What?
- What did you buy?
- I got everything downtown.
I trust your taste.
Still not dressed? Hurry up, or we'll miss the train.
Can't you step on it?
I'm doing my best.
I haven't had a moment's rest.
I can't even feel my legs anymore.
Anyway, Sicily won't run away.
Sicily won't, but the train will.
If we miss the 3:10, it'll upset our plans.
Wouldn't it be better if we left in the morning?
Don't be silly.
I've got it all planned.
Reserved seats on a comfortable train, depart today at 3:10, arrive Bologna at 5:31.
Just in time for a nice lunch of hot tortellini.
Coffee in Firenze, arrive in Rome at 11.
We'll buy pillows to sleep.
Tomorrow at 10:07, we board the Sicily ferry, fresh as daisies.
Know what would happen if we left tomorrow?
We'd get there a day or two late.
Gee, what a disaster.
Mommy! Daddy! Telephone!
It's long distance.
I'll get it.
Badalamenti residence...
Mommy! Daddy!
It's Grandma and Grandpa!
Come here a second.
Ciao, Dad...
We're leaving now... Fifteen days...
I know.
We won't make it to Bellagio.
Marta, we're running late!
Let me talk.
- Get ready, girls.
- Antonio wants to say hello.
Kisses... I'll write.
Hello, Papa...
We're just leaving...
No, don't worry.
What? Typhus vaccine?
Dad, it's just my hometown, not Mau Mau Land.
Careful, girls. Watch your step.
Give me your hand.
Keep to one side, girls.
Thank you, Sister.
Let's go now. Quick!
It's so windy at night.
A humid wind, hot during the day...
But the two weeks will fly by.
I'll come home early if I feel sick.
Here we are. Seats 2, 7, 9, 27, 29.
See? The reservation worked.
A minute later and we'd have missed it.
It's leaving...
Away from the window and sit down.
Just smell that air!
We're here! Marta! Cinzia! Caterina!
Wake up!
We're on the sea!
Look, girls!
Let's go up on the bridge. Quick!
Hurry up, girls.
Look over there!
Sicily!
Island of the sun and Cyclops... inspiration to all the poets!
What's the matter, Marta?
Nothing. I was just watching Italy fade away.
I feel strange.
And this isn't Italy?
We're not even separated anymore.
Look up there.
The world's biggest power line unites us to the continent.
Four years of hard labor.
Through those wires run millions of kilowatts...
And tomorrow the bridge!
Happy?
You bet.
Marta, after so many years...
And you'll be happy, too. You'll see.
Look, that's Messina.
Just smell it.
The oranges, the lemons.
Let's go to the other side and watch the boat dock.
Look, we're arriving.
- What's so funny, Marta?
- Nothing.
I know what you're thinking.
Go on and say it. You, too, girls.
"Hey! Hey! Fresh off the boat!"
Very funny.
Mama, I'm tired.
Don't fall asleep now, girls.
We're there.
We sure are. Italy has vanished.
Cinzia! Caterina! Look!
A Sicilian carriage!
Isn't it beautiful? Only my country makes such beautiful carriages!
Such workmanship.
The painted warriors, Rinaldo, the great paladino...
The hero of the Holy Land... the cruel Saladino.
This is Sicily, hospitable and joyful!
They're shoeing a horse, girls!
- Look.
- It's nothing. Someone died.
It's an old custom. His friends are throwing a party for him.
How'd he die?
- Two bullets.
- Right... Let's go.
Nino! Nino's here!
Mama! Papa!
Nino's here!
Papa!
My handsome Papa!
You look great!
Marta, this is my Papa!
Girls, give my Papa a kiss!
Rosalia! Beautiful Rosalia!
Marta, my sister!
Some new hair!
My cousin Carmine!
And his beautiful wife Nedda!
And is this your son?
When did he arrive?
These are my little girls!
Tony, handsome Tony!
Strong as an oak!
Auntie Ninfa!
You still with us?
No hello for your Mama?
Your Mama? No hello?
Mama!
I'm your Aunt Carmela.
My beautiful Mama!
Let me look at you, Mommy!
These are your granddaughters.
Kiss your grandma... kiss your grandma.
Mama, this is my wife Marta.
- Papa, Mama. The silver bed?
- Why not?
Marta, see the silver bed?
It's an old custom.
Every newly married Badalamenti sleeps in it.
You'll be comfortable and left alone here.
No one will disturb you.
And the new dining room you wrote about?
- Did you use the money I sent?
- I got it.
Was the trip hard?
No, perfect.
You bought a car?
You need one in Milan.
- Auntie, you look the same.
- No, I'm old.
What's this? The pictures!
Papa, you had them enlarged?
How thoughtful.
Look, the cap and gun.
I was always hunting.
I was 20 here. A bald soldier.
I'm playing the mandolin here.
Look at my wavy hair.
That was the fashion then...
Marta, let's see the gifts.
Not really gifts. Just little things.
This one's for Mama.
- Pretty colors!
- She has taste.
Happy, Mama?
This is for you. Hope it fits.
You look so chic, Rosalia.
It's real Milan fashion.
And this one's for Papa.
All this for Papa!
What do we have here?
Ah, a wallet!
And a panettone for everyone!
What else for Papa?
- You got him gloves?
- I shouldn't have?
- You never told me...
- Sure I told you.
Yes, that he's crippled...
Don't worry.
It's no disgrace.
Why shouldn't I wear gloves?
- Come see the house.
- See what kind of man he is?
Here's Rosalia's new sewing room.
Very nice.
- I'm glad about your new job.
- I did my best.
You could be a seamstress in a fashion house. Eh, Marta?
She worries about her mustache...
What's wrong? Dad's hand?
- How did it happen?
- Just a game among friends.
A guy pointed a gun, he said "stop" and he lost his hand. Just like that.
Let's see the new terrace.
Everything's exactly as I left it!
And the new living room?
It's a surprise. Wonderful.
Wait'll you see it.
We're eating outdoors for now.
After all, it's summer. Like it?
Beautiful, elegant, such rich-looking furniture.
Looks really nice here.
And much more spacious this way.
Marta, come here.
Look, Marta, that's Calamo... the cathedral, Monte Calvario.
Ever see an outdoor living room?
Charming, isn't it?
- Sure, but what if it rains?
- Rain?
How could it rain with a blue sky like that?
Gather 'round, everyone.
Now I really feel at home.
Are you hungry?
We're setting the table.
Here's the land, between Roccatello and Canizzano.
Calogero wants 50 lire a square meter. I can't afford it.
Don't worry.
We'll go talk to him.
We'll become landowners ourselves, build a nice house where you can vacation with the girls.
Happy?
She's shy, but the idea tickles her.
Just caught today!
- What is it?
- Fried swordfish.
If you prefer hake marinara, we've got that, too.
Just a small piece.
Nice and fresh. It won't hurt you.
I don't like that sweater.
Why not?
It's indecent.
That's what they wear in Milan.
Progress! Female emancipation!
Opening night at La Scala is all naked backs!
Rosalia is refined.
She's engaged...
Engaged and nothing else.
Rosalia engaged?
- To who?
- Domenico Legasi.
- Since when?
- Two and a half years.
- You never wrote me about it.
- It wasn't official yet.
- What does Domenico Legasi do?
- He sits.
Works in an office?
No, he sits.
Our way of saying he's unemployed.
I'd let them marry, but it'd be another mouth to feed.
Domenico wouldn't go for it.
He's a hard worker, but unlucky.
Pass me the eggplant.
Have the second course.
- And my old pals? Ignazio Miccichè?
- He moved away.
- Ciccio Lacanà?
- Emigrated.
- And Alfio Calì?
- In prison.
What for?
For being a man of honor.
And Filò?
Dead?
He dug his own grave.
- What does he mean?
- He betrayed his friends.
Got into politics, bought himself a motorbike and began showing off. Screw him!
What about Totò Primitera,
Nicola Scardaci, lano Nicocia?
All well. But you, my son, are the luckiest, even if you deserve it. Don't forget it.
Who forgot? After lunch
I'll pay my respects to Don Vincenzo.
I've got something for him from a big wheel at my company.
He's from Calamo, even if he is an American.
Sorry. The smoke bothers you?
They're just not used to seeing a woman smoke.
Well, if it doesn't bother them...
I always have a cigarette... at the end of the meal.
End of the meal?
Those were the appetizers!
The meal hasn't even started!
Ferruccia, the pasta!
Here's something we don't have in Milan!
It's a delicacy, dear cousin Marta.
The sauce is black as ink.
I'm back...
in Calamo!
What a joy!
And water flows here, and it flows there!
FOR MY DEAR SON-IN-LAW
FOR MY WIFE
FOR MY BROTHER
They're the dearly departed.
It's an old custom.
The memories will never die.
The inscriptions keep their memories alive.
Sorry to ask you to do this, but seeing Don Vincenzo is my duty.
To you maybe! We could've stayed home!
All that food and now this sun.
Don Vincenzo would be offended.
Who is this Don Vincenzo?
Marta, please!
They're watching us.
There's no one around.
Don't shove!
Baciamo le mani!
See that guy?
President of the sports association.
A champion cornuto... Ex-referee.
If it isn't Nino Badalamenti!
Hey, Niccoloso! Girls, over here.
You can't refuse.
No, please. We just ate.
But these are so light and fresh.
You never used to say no.
It's a specialty. We can't refuse.
Have one, Marta.
Baby lamb guts.
A real delicacy.
Filò's coming.
Pretend not to notice him.
I know you want to try some, too.
- Good?
- Yeah, but I don't want any.
That man said hello to you.
I didn't see anyone.
Is that the one who betrayed his friends?
Thanks so much, Niccoloso.
Come on, girls, it's getting late.
Isn't that Nino?
- Nino! Ninuzzo! Over here!
- I told you it was him!
The Milanese big shot's back!
Hey, you Northerner!
My old pals!
Great to see you again!
Nicola, Jacopo, Clelio, Turri...
Marta, girls, come here.
These are my friends.
Friends, this is my wife.
And these are my girls,
Cinzia and Caterina.
This is Cinzia.
Say hello like a good girl.
And this is the youngest, Caterina.
What do you say to daddy's friends?
Domenico Legasi, come here!
This is Rosalia's fiancé...
Domenico, my wife.
You're a lucky guy, Nino.
- A beautiful woman.
- We've got to go.
I'm visiting Don Vincenzo.
Say goodbye, girls.
Baciamo le mani!
Here we are.
Freshen up. I want to make a good impression.
If he asks you a question, answer.
Make me proud.
Fix your hair.
I know you're tired.
Tomorrow we'll go to the beach.
Is Don Vincenzo in?
Nino Badalamenti to see Don Vincenzo.
He has important guests.
He's not seeing anybody.
I'm to deliver this personally.
Personally!
It's personal!
Your friends, huh?
She's just an ignorant woman who doesn't know about me.
She's following orders.
I should've called first.
Let's go home, girls.
Wait, Marta.
We can't leave just like that.
You're crazy!
Beautiful!
Nino Badalamenti brought it.
Our friends' names are on it.
An object of great value.
Our American friends do things in a big way, dear uncle.
Rocky Pennisi from Catania...
Mikey Corrado from Catania...
Frankie Sciscione from Caltanissetta...
Johnny Caruso...
Turri Lo Prete...
Tommy Cefalù...
Tommy Natale...
Frankie Scellorì...
Rosario Patanè...
One name's missing, just as we thought.
Pescalise di Calamo.
He dug his own grave.
Too bad for him.
Go get Nino.
Nino Badalamenti!
Don Vincenzo wants you!
It's a really beautiful heart.
So elegant.
Such beautiful stones.
Gorgeous! Magnificent!
A sign of devotion.
It should be displayed on
Santa Rosalia's Day.
You do things well, Don Peccone.
Not everything.
Like having to leave you so quickly, after such hospitality.
You won't have dessert with us?
Sorbetto?
You'll make me miss my penance.
I've sinned enough as it is.
If you'll excuse me.
My respects, ladies.
Dear Don Vincenzo,
I'll do all I can for you.
This way I'll do good for all Sicily.
But it's a big deal.
The northern firms all want a piece of the action.
My esteemed friend,
I'm an old man now.
I want to be remembered for leaving the reservoir to these desperate people.
What can these Northerners do?
They don't know Sicily.
Remember the laco River business?
They didn't scratch our backs, so their machinery caught fire.
How come they still don't trust us?
We know our poor people.
Instead they go to the police.
But what do the police have to do with it?
I know, I know...
But keep the costs down.
Trust us.
We know how to deal with these people.
We have our price list.
- When do you leave?
- My flight's at six.
You have plenty of time.
My nephew Liborio will take you.
Gaspare!
Right here, Don Vincenzo.
Give the gentleman a shave.
Right away, Don Vincenzo...
This way, please.
Can I go watch?
I hardly recognized you.
God bless you.
Marta, girls!
Say hello to Don Vincenzo.
- Sorry Nicoletta didn't let you in.
- It's nothing.
She's even dumber than my father.
Thank you for the package.
This is my family.
Beautiful girls...
How long are you staying?
Twelve days.
Do you like our town?
Yes, it's very beautiful.
The lies of a woman, when softened by grace and courtesy, are always welcome.
Witty and sarcastic as ever.
What are your names?
Nino, come here.
How are things for you up there?
Everything's beautiful... work, home... all thanks to your generosity,
Don Vincenzo.
You always stood out.
And that makes us all happy.
One of our sons does honor to Sicily.
Always, Don Vincenzo.
I expected to see the accounts.
Did you forget?
Better not look at them now, Baroness.
They're fairly depressing.
Baroness Manuela?
Jesus, she wasn't that black as a kid!
She's a bastard.
Did you see her? Last heir of the land Don Vincenzo administers.
Last heir of what's left. Nothing.
Some cassata?
It's homemade.
We've got candied fruit and cannoli for the kids.
Don't be shy.
Have some, Marta.
Marta... cannoli!
Nino's a good kid, don't you think?
A good kid.
Keep an eye on him.
He may be the one.
Is this the end of the world?
I think it's the A-Bomb.
So much for your blue skies!
What can I say?
Everything's changed.
Keep going! Keep going! More!
This is where you're sleeping?
- You're doing this for us?
- Don't give it a thought.
Papa, dear Mama.
What do you think of Marta?
- Honestly.
- Honestly?
- Yes, honestly.
- Stuck up.
She's stuck up.
Stuck up?
A bit of a snob.
- Not at all.
- Full of herself.
- No, you're wrong.
- She's conceited.
No, she's just shy, modest, very humble.
She's a Northerner.
They don't open up so easily.
She was just telling me how much she likes you, how easy it is to get along with the two of you...
And she thinks you're handsome, Papa, despite your handicap.
- What are you doing?
- I'm here, Marta.
I was kissing Mama and Papa good night.
They're nuts about you.
They think you're nice, humble, down to earth... and blonde.
It's true...
I'll switch off the light.
Already in dreamland.
They're so tired.
To the ship, men of the sea!
What's so funny?
Are you crying?
I can't take it anymore.
I don't feel welcome here.
Maybe it's my fault, my personality.
Your mother hasn't said a word to me since we arrived.
She stares at me as if
I was some kind of exotic animal.
Listen, Marta, let me explain.
My mother just doesn't want to rush to judgment.
When she finally does open up... she'll tell you everything.
She'll know you like a book.
You just have to get used to her.
Give it some more time.
More time! The idea of staying two more weeks drives me mad!
Okay, let's make a deal.
Instead of twelve days, we'll stay ten.
We'll spend the last two days with your folks in Bellagio.
Happy now?
You little rascal!
Let's not say anything that might upset my folks.
We'll find some excuse, like...
Like what?...
Ah, that your mother's dying.
- Antonio!
- Too much?
Just kidding. Pretty funny, eh?
Cover up.
My God! What's that?
It's only the hen.
- Where?
- Under the bed.
It's not funny.
Are we supposed to sleep with a hen?
Don't wake the girls.
Come here...
Gotcha! Tomorrow we'll make her into a nice broth.
Behave.
The exact terms were
50 lire a square meter.
I've got a good memory.
Exactly! So why do you want 200 now?
Did the land change?
Did it turn to gold?
No, because now...
Now what?
It's got water.
Water?
- Water, where?
- Calling me a liar?
No one did.
I can't read books, but I can sure read looks.
- What are you saying?
- I saw the looks between you.
You won't find a more honest man than me!
What are you saying?
You doubting our intentions?
Not doubting, Mama's boy.
Nothing's been signed, so you can't sue me!
You don't understand.
Don't I? Think I'm stupid?
You say there's water.
Then show us.
- Come on.
- Show us.
This will end badly.
Calm down, Papa.
Here! I feel it! I feel it!
It's here!
Someone shut him up!
Watch your step!
Goddamn monk!
It's here! The water's here!
I don't see anything!
According to my stick, there's plenty of water here.
It's special water.
Mineral water!
Well, it could be mineral water.
- Mineral water?
- Maybe.
And plenty of it!
That's why it's now 200 a square meter!
Take it or leave it!
That's baloney!
If a man gives a price, he should stick to it!
You're jacking it up
'cause some monk says there's water?
It wouldn't even be fair if there was Pepsi-Cola down there.
It's silly to listen to this mumbo-jumbo...
Excuse me, Brother...
I say, dig first, bring the water up, and then maybe you can raise the price!
Oh, yeah?
So I should dig for you?
Are you a beautiful woman?
Will I get laid?
Calogero, watch your language!
Watch me smash his face in!
Who's gonna smash whose face?
Let go of me, you cornuto!
What are you doing? Not the knife!
Who's a cornuto?
Stop it!
You're acting like kids!
Let go! He called me cornuto!
That bastard!
Damn you and your whole family!
Let me go! I won't touch him.
- Insulting your mama and...
- My mama?
If I'm a cornuto, your mama's a whore.
What are you saying?
What are you doing?
Know what you can do with that stick,
Brother?
It's harder to stay calm than to regress.
Let's act civilized.
Why do they say Sicily's uncivilized?
It's very civilized.
And we have to live up to that.
No! We have to act like men!
And that snake was right... you are a woman!
No, Papa, please don't say that.
Fuck off!
Hello, Don Liborio.
Jump in.
I don't think you're what your father says you are.
He's just old and bitter, like all old men.
He's bitter all right.
But Calogero's downright dishonest.
We agreed on 50 lire for the land.
Now it's 200.
He wouldn't give in if we killed him.
You want to buy land?
I wanted to.
So you still love your homeland.
Why wouldn't I?
We thought maybe you forgot Sicily and all of us here.
Why?
Thanks for the ride.
Don't you have a cap?
I'll buy you one.
Thanks. That's kind of you.
A nice cap for the gentleman.
What color do you want?
Black or checked?
Black.
Wanna try it on?
Now you're really one of us.
I haven't worn one in years.
See you later, Don Liborio.
I asked you a question, Nino.
I asked if you'd forgotten us.
Didn't I answer you?
No, I didn't forget you.
Then you also didn't forget that you were once picciotto d'onore.
Of course not.
How could I?
I was 18, Liborio.
Those were some times...
The Allies, the chaos, the hunger, the black market...
The lawlessness.
This poor land of ours!
And our friends never gave you some important job?
I was a messenger boy.
Once I climbed up Mt. Perrusa to be the lookout.
I did as I was told.
We all remember you, Nino.
You've always been a good picciotto...
What you learned here and here... should never leave here.
Are you trying to offend me?
I never even told my wife.
Besides, who would I talk to?
The Northerners?
They only talk about our friends with contempt.
They only know the word Mafioso with no idea what it means.
And for someone who lives in Milan, a specialized technician...
I left that all behind.
Understand?
Left behind?
You can't leave your old friends behind.
Least of all Don Vincenzo.
Of course, it's not even a question.
My mama and papa come first, then Don Vincenzo.
Actually, they're all equal.
- Care to shoot a little?
- Why not?
Have a go at it?
Pistol.
I've lost it.
You give it a try, Nino.
Me?
- It's been a long time.
- Go on.
The bottle?
Still the old hunter.
Fantastic! Real Marsala wine.
How'd you like it, Don Liborio?
Great. Now go on home.
Put your hat on.
This sun's no good for you.
Totó, nobody told you not to do business with Volponi,
Moravia and Nosso from Carbuto Ferdinando.
But if alienation is an industrialization problem, doesn't that mean we're all alienated?
What are we otherwise?
Happy and contented?
Domenico Legasi, are you happy?
The South's sickness isn't psychological.
It's due to economy and society.
You're wrong.
We're psychologically isolated.
People don't communicate.
That's another issue.
They're two sides of the same coin.
Sure, we don't communicate.
Among friends we do.
We know all about each other.
But with the ladies, we never communicate.
Hence, alienated.
That's why you don't have a clue, Totó.
Look at how pointy her tits are.
What do you know about it?
The varieties are endless.
Last year I was in Palermo to have a tooth infection treated and I got it on with this chick.
She was from the north and had pointy tits.
Let me set you straight, Mr. Expert.
These are Polynesian boobs.
Got anything against Polynesians?
Getting some sun?
You guys are exactly the way
I left you eight years ago.
Same sand woman and everything.
Domenico Legasi, you here, too?
Shouldn't you be thinking about a job and marriage?
Thinking fully dressed or half-naked is still thinking.
But thinking isn't enough.
That's all I can do.
We're not lucky like you.
Are you jealous?
Sure I'm jealous.
Tell us about the ladies in Milan.
Tell us about your adventures.
Such morbid curiosity.
Masculine curiosity.
To be honest,
I never was much of a gigolo.
I mean, I had my share... maybe five or six at the most.
Women?
Let's clear one thing up.
It was when I first got to Milan.
Later I got married.
But of all those women,
I do remember one in particular.
Her name was Clara. A divorcée.
Blonde, melancholy, round...
With her clothes on, she looked like an icebox... but in bed... she was a tigress on fire.
As the Milanese say,
"Lifeless eyes, burning thighs."
Most Milanese ladies are like that.
Hey guys!
That's my wife!
Watch it! I may live in Milan, but I'm still Sicilian.
You hear me?
Let's take the boat out.
Shouldn't I say hello?
No, just smile.
So long, you loudmouths!
Have fun with your sand woman!
Look, girls. Daddy's going to dive in!
To the ship, men of the sea!
I don't see him.
There he is!
Mussels!
They taste of the sea.
Smell them.
What time is it?
No idea.
I don't have a watch.
Mr. Antonio Badalamenti is on vacation, with no timetables, no orders, no obligations...
If anyone asks for me,
I'm not available.
- What is it?
- Don Vincenzo wants you!
Come on, girls!
Take your seats!
- Marta, in the back!
- What is it?
Don Vincenzo wants me!
So? There's no need to hurry.
Come in.
Bless you, sir. Are you ill?
Nino, a word between friends is sacred.
I said 50 and 50 it is.
The land's yours. Okay?
Leave us, Calogero.
May we be blessed by you for a thousand years!
It's nothing.
Friends must help one another.
If you ever should need me, just say the word and I'm at your command.
Your sea has a marvelous color.
The girls didn't want to leave.
Don't you like the beach?
Sure I do.
But I embarrass Domenico.
You really care for this Domenico?
Then listen to me. First you have to get rid of your complex.
What complex?
The one you have about those hairs.
Anything can be fixed.
Trust me?
Then let me take care of you.
That heart from the Americans is priceless.
Really beautiful.
Is it cold?
Right away, Don Vincenzo.
So, Maruzzo?
We're agreed. It's all set.
Who's the picciotto?
Nino Badalamenti. Sound good?
Does he have the stomach for it?
Not only that. He's a great shot and out of the loop.
He'll be back in Milan in a few days with none the wiser.
Then it's decided. I'm off.
May God's will be done.
Rosalia, I have something to tell you!
Coming.
That stuff's arrived.
- What stuff?
- Nothing that concerns you.
Sure, I'm always the last to know!
Domenico Legasi doesn't count, ever!
Poor and unlucky!
I'm leaving.
Let him go.
It's worse if you run after him.
Greetings, my friends.
Congrats to your sister.
You coming with us tomorrow?
We leave at 3 a.m. for a two-day hunting trip.
Hunting trip?
In Montecaiano, by the woods.
Pheasant, partridges, hares...
You name it.
Isn't hunting season over?
Not for Don Vincenzo.
The Traglia family is putting the land at our disposal.
Sorry, but we're leaving.
Vacation over already?
No, I promised my wife we'd visit her parents in Bellagio.
I always warned you off marriage.
Don't exaggerate.
There are disadvantages and advantages.
Doing what your wife wants isn't a sign of weakness.
Get married, then we'll talk.
Here we are.
You didn't tell me you were going hunting.
I just heard it myself.
If you want to, why not go?
Aren't we leaving?
Look, I've changed my mind.
Your papa convinced me.
He told me so much about you as a boy, how you loved to hunt.
He insisted, so I had to say yes.
Right, Papa?
And I'm happy to stay, too.
Good, so we all love each other.
You've got yourself an understanding wife.
I know. I'm very lucky.
There's the band, girls!
Santa Rosalia!
Stay still!
It's nothing. This is the last one.
Now go take a look at yourself.
Happy?
Come and see.
Gorgeous. A new woman.
Like a flower, Rosalia.
Marta... You're a good woman.
What'd I tell you?
Isn't she great?
You were right.
Let me look at you.
So white, smooth as porcelain.
Listen, Rosalia, you better get married before they grow back again.
- How'd you do it?
- It was nothing.
You won everyone's heart.
I'm so proud of you.
Did you see how impressed
Don Liborio was?
They should elect you
Wife of the Year 1962.
Don't exaggerate. I didn't do it just for you. I'm happy here, too.
And so are the girls.
What did I tell you, Marta?
Remember? I said,
"Give it time."
Exactly... Give it time.
Now behave.
You have to get up at 2 to go hunting.
Go to sleep.
You're an oracle of wisdom, Marta.
Be good. You have to get up early.
All right, I'll be good.
Good night, you meany.
You know, your husband's the best shot around.
Once I saw four hares popping out of their hole.
I sacked two of them.
If only I had that...
Win... Winchester...
I'd have nabbed all four.
I never miss.
I love to shoot.
I'm coming.
How do they fit?
Just fine. Perfect.
Top quality.
I traded Cuturo two chickens for them.
He got it from Carmelo Provedera for just one chicken.
Prices go up, Papa.
I kept it like a holy relic.
Cleaned and oiled it.
- There's a cartridge inside.
- Impossible.
Look, a lottery ticket.
Santa Rosalia!
So that's where I put it!
I looked all over for it.
I won nearly 20,000 lire, but some Roman asshole wouldn't pay me!
That cornuto!
What can you do? Don't lose your temper.
God bless you, my dear son.
Papa, I'm only going hunting.
And I'm so happy.
Liborio!
Did I scare you?
Me? Why?...
What are you doing here?
Mind if I come along?
Mind? Why do you say that?
The more the merrier.
What's the matter?
This way.
And the friends?
Later. A more important friend's waiting for you.
You?
Nino Badalamenti, give me your hand.
Will you do me a little favor, Nino?
A little favor? Of course.
Nino, you offered to be of service.
Remember?
So I recommended you.
The friends are happy you'll do it.
Because you are good.
What must I do?
Mama orders and child obeys.
Know who Mama is, Nino?
Of course... I do.
And what does Mama order?
A trip.
Where to?
You'll know when you get back.
And the hunt?
It will be just like hunting.
You come back when the hunt's over.
And my family?
What will they think?
You mean your wife and little girls?
You love your family, don't you?
Yes, very much.
We too love them, because we love you.
And we're grateful for what you're doing.
Just what am I doing?
Doing?
Something important, Nino.
But if you wish... you can say no.
Will you say no?
Will I say no?
I say yes.
Here's a letter you're to deliver in person.
It'll take you where you have to go.
You'll always be among friends.
Give me the gun.
Go on, Nino.
Here.
- I have to deliver this letter.
- Yeah, I know.
Get in.
Did you piss yet?
- What?
- Go ahead.
- Go on.
- I don't have to go.
Suit yourself.
- Will the trip be long?
- Long and short.
See that suit?
Put it on.
Pull the canvas down.
Oh my God! Santa Rosalia!
Where are they taking me?
A long and short trip, he said.
Fine.
Mama orders, child obeys.
Out.
- Gotta pee.
- Over there.
- I'm to deliver this letter.
- Not for me.
Sorry...
Where am I? Where are we exactly?
Don't worry about it. Just walk.
Go on.
- Where?
- Get in the car.
I've got a letter...
Want a better look?
Yes, do you mind?
- Gorgeous.
- Very.
She's hot.
Sit down. Eat.
- I'm just thirsty.
- Eat!
I have this letter to deliver.
Sorry. It's not for me.
So tell me what I've got to do.
Since I'm here in America... know what I mean?
- Eat.
- I'm really not hungry.
- Then drink.
- Happy to.
Good morning.
Let's hope it is a good morning, Nino.
I hear you're a precise guy.
I'm a regular stopwatch.
Your job is simple, but you gotta be real precise.
Here, Nino.
Sit down.
Pay attention, Nino.
Who's that cute little girl?
Nino, see that man?
Look at him closely.
You both look good.
- Looks like a nice guy.
- Pay attention.
What's his nose like?
That guy's? Why?
Doesn't he have a big one?
And his mustache?
- What mustache?
- Perfect!
At last...
So the letter's for him.
No, for me.
Drink up.
Drink it down. Real Scotch.
This one goes with the Canadian stuff.
And this one with the Scotch.
- Full of vitamins?
- Good for the stomach, nerves, head.
I've got two daughters,
Cinzia and Caterina.
Do you have any kids?
That's enough!
Put it in your right pocket.
How d'ya say "lefty"?
- I'm not a lefty.
- Right pocket, then.
What's that?
Some things can't be done half-way.
I hear you got a real nice family.
The only way to go back is to go forward.
It's stupid to be scared.
Everything's simple and well-planned.
As if it already happened.
We just need you to do one small, stupid thing that we haven't taken care of yet.
What's on your mind?
I was thinking... why not do this small thing yourselves?
It's gotta be done by a friend nobody knows, who lives in another country.
We all live here.
That's why, when it happens, we'll be at the Piccolo Club.
Some of us will be playing cards, or drinking whisky, or with some blonde.
Listen...
You'll see a barber shop.
You walk in, calm and relaxed, do what you have to do and leave, always calm and relaxed.
Don't run. Stay on the sidewalk.
Now pay attention.
A truck will be waiting.
One last thing.
You gotta do it first, before you even notice his suit,
'cause he's as precise and quick as you.
It's for your own good.
You got a family.
What are your girls' names again?
Catinzia and Citerina.
We always give our girls such beautiful names.
Our Sicily's shaped like a heart.
And that's just what we are, one great big heart.
Don't you agree, Nino?
There's the barber shop. See it?
There's our friend. He'll cover you.
That's the truck, just 20 feet away.
Understand? Is it all clear?
Nino, that son of a bitch betrayed us...
Don Vincenzo and all our friends.
Now go.
Get out.
Before I left,
I took your pen by mistake.
If everyone was like you, it'd be a better world.
Thank you. Have a good day.

{338}{429}through the trepidations of his soul,|his passion and torments,
{429}{537}widely utilizing|the symbolism and allegories
{537}{666}specific to the tradition of Medieval|Armenian poet troubadours (Ashough).
{906}{1026}THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES
{1105}{1196}I am the man whose life|and soul are torture.
{1568}{1671}I am the man whose life|and soul are torture.

{3172}{3296}Poet's childhood
{3395}{3519}In the beginning, God created|heaven and earth.
{3529}{3622}On the sixth day, God said...
{3634}{3699}"Now We shall create man...
{3699}{3788}according to Our image|and likeness."
{3802}{3896}And God created man|according to his image.
{3912}{3994}According to His image|God created him.
{4013}{4116}And the Lord God created man|from the dust of the earth...
{4135}{4277}and blew into him the breath of life,|and Man became a living soul.
{4294}{4378}And God took the man he created...
{4378}{4449}And made him live in the Garden of Eden...
{4452}{4541}so that Man would till the earth...
{4548}{4598}and tend the Garden.
{4613}{4689}And the Lord instructed him|and said...
{4836}{4965}Many have come ahead of me,|and vaguely known this amazing world,
{4965}{5018}they have extinguished and expired|ahead of me.
{5905}{6003}Books must be well kept and read,
{6027}{6094}for books are Soul and Life.
{6116}{6264}Without books, the world would|have witnessed nothing but ignorance.
{6288}{6399}You should read aloud for the people|to hear, in benefit of their souls...
{6423}{6521}since many are unable|to read what is written.
{9074}{9175}From the colors and aromas|of this world,
{9175}{9274}my childhood made a poet's lyre|and offered it to me.
{13544}{13704}Saint George, we implore you,|let your good fortune, your kind thoughts...
{13707}{13805}spread over our family, on our people,|along with your white horse...
{13805}{13870}be a stronghold for our people,|give prosperity to this family.
{13872}{14002}Give them good thoughts|and prosperity.
{17946}{18054}Poet's youth
{19394}{19523}We were searching for ourselves|in each other.
{22532}{22741}The river has overflown its banks.
{27210}{27325}Poet at the court
{27325}{27402}A prayer before hunting.
{33027}{33183}We were searching for a place|of refuge for our love,
{33183}{33290}but instead, the road led us|to the land of the dead.
{35002}{35180}You abandoned us and went away,|but we the living wrapped you...
{35182}{35326}in a cocoon, so in your new world|you would burst out like a butterfly.
{36153}{36278}How am I to protect my|wax built castles of love...
{36278}{36352}from the devouring heat|of your fires?
{37218}{37450}You are fire.|Your dress is fire...
{37522}{37755}You are fire.|Your dress is fire...
{37793}{37911}You are fire.|Your dress is fire...
{37971}{38093}You are fire.|Your dress is fire...
{38093}{38191}You are fire.|Your dress is black...
{38393}{38455}Which of these two fires|can I endure?
{40160}{40299}I am a nightingale trapped in a foreign land,|and you are my golden cage.
{45487}{45636}Poet leaves for the monastery.
{47288}{47446}The wedding merriment, the sadness,|the festive singing are all here.
{47448}{47623}And they shall never leave this place,|if we respect the path of spirit.
{50354}{50429}What is your name?|What is your name?
{50448}{50484}Aroutin.
{51117}{51253}Beautiful one, come quickly,|quickly come, or beautiful one,

{53255}{53279}Aroutin.
{53294}{53327}Aroutin...
Anyway, it was worthless.
Couldn't even speak.
There... there ain't much.
Get up.
It's crazy to go on.
We'll never get there.
We'll never get there this way.
You're so stubborn.
Try going back.
There's no end to it.
We should have arrived at midday.
The sand's hard on the feet.
Keep walking, you lazy critter!
Come on! Lt's there!
Lt's going to rain.
God willing and the Holy Virgin too!
Lt's a sturdy house.
Good pasture.
Good for fattening up.
Good pasture.
What happened to Tomás?
He went out on his own, like us.
Think he took everything with him?
I bet he left the grinding wheel.
Think he took the leather bed?
Lt was so lovely.
So soft and cozy in the corner of the room.
Tomás of the sugar-mill had the best.
Tomás was a worthy man.
Nice smell of tanned leather.
All it needed was a bit of lace and it would look like a chapel.
A man of letters.
He always said the right things even when it was going to rain.
He knew how to do things.
He could always mend everything even other people's lives.
Even that! But he could never forgive the drought.
The farm has died without Tomás and the mill.
On day we'll have a leather bed like Tomás's.
Get your tools and go back.
I don't want anybody here.
I told you to leave!
And now!
I'm a good cowhand.
I'm a good cowhand.
I can do anything.
Maybe...
Are these your men?
That's all?
And the dog.
I'll do any job.
How much do you charge?
My usual.
One calf of each four born.
A quarter's fine.
You can stay.
Let's go, girl!
Spotty... you'll grow, my lovely!
100,000 réis per head.
Isn't that fair?
The boss says it's 100,000 per head.
The money will do to settle accounts with the boss.
We'll buy the leather for the bed with what's left over, just like Tomás's.
We could spend less.
Yes. We'll spend less.
We'll sleep in a leather bed.
We'll be real dandies!
Do you want to settle today?
How much do I owe you?
Well... I mean...
Get the book.
It's on top of the desk.
Sorry, but that's not quite enough.
No, it's right.
What my wife said is more.
There must be some mistake.
It's the interest.
Haven't I been lending you money all year?
There's no mistake.
My wife knows her business.
She knows accounts.
That's not enough.
Here's your pay.
There's no more.
This isn't right!
I'm no slave!
There are no slaves here.
Take your money.
Otherwise, look for work elsewhere.
I don't employ impertinent upstarts!
No need for arguments.
Sorry, I didn't mean it.
It was my wife's fault, Boss.
I can't read.
She told me, it was that.
And I believed her.
All right, Fabiano.
Get to work.
But I won't fall for it again.
Sorry, sir.
I tell you Manezinho's wife betrayed him.
I tried her, but she wouldn't.
Do you have the tax form?
You have to pay taxes, you know.
Never heard of taxes.
Is this pig yours?
Ls it for sale?
Then you must pay taxes.
But that's not a pig.
It's a bit of a pig.
If you sell, you pay tax, you trickster!
You offend me!
Sorry. I thought I could just sell off my belongings.
I didn't know about no taxes.
Well, now you know.
I didn't know the Town Hall owned part of my pig.
But as you said, it's over.
I'll give the meat to my family.
Can I eat the meat?
Can I, or not?
Stop gabbing and go home!
Come on!
Don't dirty your clothes.
Give me one.
How much?
400 réis.
Why do you water it all down?
See you later.
The party'll be good?
Shall we play a hand inside?
Yes or no.
Let's see.
Go away... There's people here.
Sit down.
Take another.
Give another.
Give another.
What's the card?
Turn it over.
- Whose turn?
- Wait a minute.
Hold on, mister.
You have no right to harass the law-abiding.
Back off, you low-down critter!
That's no way to treat your partners, to turn away and leave.
Is it my fault you threw in all your belongings?
That's bad manners.
Please take your foot away.
Son of a bitch!
Mummy, where's Baleia?
I don't know.
Has Baleia come back?
Neither has Father.
He resisted arrest and insulted me in front of everybody.
He must learn not to poke fun at the authorities.
Hand over the civilian.
Shut up!
Bastard!
Scum of the earth!
Where's Baleia, Mum?
She's disappeared.
Disappeared?
- Anyone home?
- Coming!
What can I do for you?
Tell the vicar
I need to talk to him.
- Your blessing, Father.
- God bless you.
Tell the doctor
I've come for my godson.
What are you doing here,
Fabiano?
Nothing, he's getting better.
Send him away.
Get on.
I can walk.
The captain pays well.
Going farther?
St. Ilifonso, as I sew... make flesh and bones regrow.
Hear my plea three times o'er!
To hell with you!
May God bless you.
Mum, what's hell?
Lt's a horrible place.
How horrible?
Put your foot here.
Out!
Father, what's hell?
What?
Hell.
It's where the damned go.
Fires and red-hot pokers.
Have you been there?
Baleia...
Hell...
Hot pokers...
Hell...
Horrible place...
Hell...
Horrible place...
Horrible place...
The damned...
With hot pokers.
With hot pokers.
Hell...
Miserable wretched life!
Working like a dog!
And what for?
Not even enough to eat.
Imagine! You earn a pittance and lose it all gambling!
All I needed.
It's all drying up.
Devils... Hot pokers...
I want to die and get it over with.
We'll never have a real bed.
We were saving up.
We'd bought the leather and the wood.
All you do is talk.
I want to see something...
I want to see!
There was money.
Who works here?
Lt is what it is.
It all went to gambling and drink.
Cost less than patent shoes.
Why expensive shoes?
To walk like a parrot?
A bad sign.
The desert will catch fire.
The sun sucks up the water and that wretch takes the rest.
They want to kill the cattle.
They want to kill the cattle.
You drink the water...
And the cattle go thirsty and die.
You kill the cattle.
It will catch fire.
No use waiting.
Rustle up the stragglers.
I'll get the rest tomorrow and settle up.
I want it all here early tomorrow.
Go and find pasture.
We need to move tomorrow.
We can't.
We have to get the cattle.
We must move early before the boss arrives.
Go get the orange cow's calf.
It could be a long trip.
Baleia...
Let's find the calf.
How do we get to the road?
Which way?
The end of the trail, to your right.
Come on, boy.
We got to go.
Baleia...
Let's go, Baleia.
Go play with Baleia.
Stay still there.
Come here.
He's going to kill Baleia!
He's going to kill Baleia!
Filthy varmint! Cry baby!
She's sick.
No use to anybody!
Baleia...
So where are we going?
Will we live like we did before?
Maybe. Who knows?
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Maybe we'll find somewhere even better.
Why couldn't we be real people one day?
People who sleep in leather beds.
Why do we always have to be wretched?
Running in the wild like animals.
We could run like animals like we've always done.
We have to walk a long way.
But my sandals are brand-new.
We can walk, can't we?
Yes, we can.
You're good for walking.
You're strong.
You're well.
You can walk a long way.
No matter.
I'll just lose weight.
Down to the bone!
What are you thinking about?
Children don't think.
Them? A bit more and they'll put on weight.
They'll be herding the cattle.
Hard to imagine!
May Our Lady free them from that misfortune.
Cow-herding?
There must be a place for us in God's world.
Even just a poor plot of land.
As long as it gives enough to eat all year.
The Virgin will help us change our lives.
Nice land and plenty of corn and beans.
More than enough to bring up children on.
We'll have a new life.
Without having to run after cattle through scrub.
And then, living in a big city.
So many things to see.
These eyes have only seen misery.
The children will go to school and learn.
Until they can read a book and do arithmetic, just like Master Tomás.
Big dreams.
Master Tomás knew a lot.
But when he started out he never got there.
Did reading help him?
Lt didn't even get him two leagues down the road.
Who goes running in the scrub?
Hiding like an animal?
One day, we'll become real people.
We can't go on living like animals, hiding in the desert.
Can we?
No, we can't.
AND THE DESERT WOULD GO ON
FORCING STRONG
BUT SIMPLE FOLK LIKE
FABIANO, VITÓRIA,
AND THE TWO CHILDREN
TO THE CITY.
Is your husband in?
Who are you looking for?
Ibrahima Dieng.
He is the husband of you two.
I bring good news.
- A money order.
- Money order?
Yes, a money order... and a letter.
They are from Paris.
Who does Ibrahima know in Paris?
How much is it for?
- 25000 francs.
- 25000 francs?
Don't delude us.
We are honest women.
This money order is for your husband.
Here's the letter.
He can collect it today... at the post office.
We'll find out if this is true.
Aram, let's go to the store.
Today we'll eat well.
Praised be Allah! What did I just eat?
Blessed are women.
Uncle! Here's some papaya for you.
Let me wash.
It's been some time since I've eaten so well!
Allah will never abandon us.
Allah helps those who help themselves.
How tired I am!
Uncle! There's a beggar outside.
Is he young or old?
Give him the leftovers so as to ward off evil.
Aram! Massage my legs.
Easy, don't touch the belly.
Did you tell him about the money order?
Let's give him a chance to rest.
Who wants to buy water?
Maty?
- Can you spare 50 francs for water?
- No, not even one.
- Aram, do you want water?
- Yes, but on credit.
- Until when?
- Until tomorrow.
Show him where to put it.
Just look at that!
When your belly is full you think only of sleeping!
What about Allah? My house is not for the wicked.
Where do I get money to... feed us?
It's been four years
I haven't had a job.
Today is Friday, and nobody thought of waking me up, what a shame!
There is a proper time for prayer.
Uncle, uncle!
What happened?
What is it? I am penniless!
Look, nothing! - I don't mean that.
You received something in the mail.
What?
It's not a bill.
It's a money order from Paris.
Who sent it?
Your nephew Abdou.
Don't talk money in the street.
I hope the neighbors don't know about this.
Actually, we did go to the
Mauritanian's store.
So everyone knows!
There was nothing for the kids to eat today.
They borrow without telling me!
I'm the husband of both!
Only I can decide what to do!
Good wives wait for their husband before making a decision!
You went to spread the word that I have a money order?
Your wives came to take rice, oil...
You have done well to give it to them.
I'll pay.  What do I owe?
That's not why I wanted to see you.
You know I do trust you.
I received a shipment of good rice.
The kind you ate for lunch.
It is neither American nor French.
It comes from Indochina.
It doesn't stick.
Look how good the grain is.
How much per kilo?
You are not just a customer, you are a brother. Why are you suspicious?
This rice...
Mbarka! Do you have rice?
No, my son.
Did you see?
If you weren't a friend,
I wouldn't sell it to you.
I'll keep 15 kilos for you, no more.
Come to get it when you return from the post office.
If you see one of my wives, give it to them.
Add this to my account and lend me
50 francs to go to the post office.
- Dieng, how are you?
- Praised be Allah!
Mbarka has rice.
He sells it under the counter.
I didn't know.
He won't to lend me anything because he knows I'm broke.
- Where are you going?
- With you.
The letter is from Paris.
The letter is from Paris.
It's from your nephew Abdou.
Dear Uncle, I am writing to you from Paris.
Thank Allah I'm well.
I think about you day and night.
I miss all of you.
I didn't come to Paris to become a vagabond... or rebel against authority.
I came to find a job... to make some money and learn a trade.
I left Dakar because there is no work!
I couldn't spend my life... without work... waiting for handouts... or some used clothing.
At my age I need to get married and start a family.
Don't listen to what others say.
If someone becomes a vagabond in Paris... it is because he wants to.
Allah willing, not a single drop of alcohol will touch my lips.
Every day after work, I attend evenign school to learn something.
Here's a money order of 25000 francs. Keep 2000 for me.
Give 3000 to my mother... and keep 2000 for yourself... because I know you don't have a job.
Tell my mother I'm doing well.
I miss her and the kids.
When I return from working,
I say my five prayers.
My regards to aunt Maty and aunt Aram.
Allah willing, I will return home.
Don't forget me in your prayers.
Your nephew Abdou.
That'll be 50 cents.
I'll cash the money order and then I'll pay.
- Ibrahima Dieng.
- It is I.
Identification?
Identification?
I don't have one.
Any document with your photo?
Driver's license, draft card?
I don't have any of those things.
- Go get an identity card.
- Where?
I have mine.
Is the money order for you?
It's for my friend.
Sir, I have no identification.
Go to the police station in your neighborhood.
The money order will be here for 15 days.
And my money, my 50 cents?
We haven't cashed the money order.
Ask for your due politely without grabbing me.
I am a man of faith, not a thief.
You crook! I worked for you!
You have to pay me.
We'll be back and pay you
Why didn't you say so before?
- Did he soil my outfit?
- No.
Can you believe it?
Soil me over 50 cents.
Want to walk with me to the police?
To scrounge some cash off me?
Indeed, I want you to lend me 5000 francs.
This is the house.
It could work.
- Is it for sale?
- Leave that to me.
The guy is broke: two wives, seven children; an an insatiable need to keep up appearances.
What's happening inside?
It seems there is a party.
Ah, I didn't know!
Here comes his first wife.
- How are you, Auntie?
- Mbaye, how are you?
Good day, ma'am.
We came to see Uncle.
Uncle went to the post office.
What's going on in your house?
Looks like a party.
You know how it is in this country.
When they hear "money" everyone shows up.
Maty, when Ibrahima returns tell him to come see me.
I'll tell him.
Allah willing.
Mbaye!
Do come in and wait for him.
Tell Uncle I stopped by to see how he's doing.
- Can I help you?
- I need an identity card.
Birth certificate, 3 photos... and a 50-cent stamp.
Look, I need to cash a money order.
I have my tax bill and my voting card.
My friend, I need your birth certificate... photos, and a stamp.
Here I have a paper that proves my identity.
That won't do. Go to City Hall
- How are the children?
- Allah be praised.
Here, have bread and sugar.
I stopped by to see you yesterday.
My wives told me.
Life is difficult for people like us.
That's why I came to seek your help.
Allah is my witness, I still haven't cashed the money order.
I need 5000 francs with a security deposit.
Oh no! I couldn't cash the
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Let's talk about life.
I came to see Ibrahima for
We haven't eaten in 3 days.
I just told the Imam:
I haven't cashed the money order yet.
I don't want money, but only some rice...
Ibrahima, so long.
You know me, Ibrahima.
I'm counting on you.
Allah willing, you can count on me.
Ibrahima! Help me out.
Give 3 kilos of rice to Madiague.
We don't have any more rice.
What did you say?
Maty, you are a mother, you must understand, the children are hungry.
Now everyone thinks we have rice.
He said to give Madiague some rice.
Tell him that there's no more.
- This is all the rice we have left.
- Give him a sack.
Never! We will starve
What will happen to our kids?
This is the rice we have left.
Take it.
Allah willing, we'll be fine after I cash the money order today.
Thank you. It's better than nothing. Many thanks!
Any luck?
That's it.
That's all? They say he has at least 100 kilos of rice.
It's Maty who refuses.
May Allah protect us from the women's dominance!
Does anyone have 25 francs to loan me?
It's for my bus fare to City Hall.
I have nothing. Maybe Aram.
She's at the water fountain.
Aram, do you have 25 francs?
I need it for my bus fare.
Not a cent!
He won't have a penny left after he pays Mbarka.
Is that okay or not?
It works for me.
20% is not deadly.
Credit has never killed anyone.
Stop bullshitting!
Deal or not?
- Take it or leave it.
Yes, I know, (switching to Wolof) but it's hard.
Borrow from John and pay Paul.
You should be grateful that I offer this to you.
(in French) All night
I tried to work out a scheme.
Six months without salary, to pull through that? Come on!
You know, many can't get credit. I'm on my third.
You know how I do it?
I change banks.
The gov't knows about that. That's why they take payroll deductions.
- Well, I'll take your offer.
- As I said, I'm trying to help.
I'm sick of working!
How are you?
What do you want?
A birth certificate.
Your date of birth?
Here are my papers, I can't read.
Forget your papers.
What date were you born?
- (in Wolof) What's up?
- (in French) Get in line.
You better be polite with citizens.
Name: Ibrahima Dieng.
Born in Dakar around 1900.
Tell me the month, wise guy!
- About 1900!
- In a year, how many months are there?
Twelve.
In which month was he born, your Ibrahima Dieng?
When you know your date of birth... come back to see me.
Make it quick, we're in a hurry!
- Step back.  If not...
- If not, what?
Who to turn to?
Someone influential.
What will I tell the neighbors?
How can I face them?
- My name is not Amath.
- Sorry, I mistook you for my nephew.
He is a very good boy.
I'm sure he would have given me
20 francs for the bus.
I'm dry, my friend.
What a resemblance!
The fact is that the world is upside down.
I'm glad you came to see me.
Say hello to Uncle!
I saw someone on the street; as if he was your twin brother.
I came to see you... because I have a money order to cash at the post office.
But to exchange it, I need an identification card.
For that, I need a birth certificate.
I just came back from City Hall... but I don't know anyone influential there. You're my only hope.
Look, here is the money order.
Take this, it's the only cash I have on me.
I'll write you a check.
You can cash it in a bank.
For the rest, I have a friend at City Hall.
Let's go see him.
Uncle, it's settled.
Come and see him tomorrow.
Here's the information: born around 1900 in Dakar.
- This will do.
- Thank you, my friend.
See you.
Sir, help me.
I need 20 francs to return home... and my children are waiting.
Many thanks. May Allah bless you.
What a misfortune!
I didn't even ask her name.
May all of my misfortunes...
Hello, sir. How are you?
What do you need?
I have a check I want to cash.
Do you have identification?
This can be sorted out.
- Ask for 100 franc bills.
- It's a deal.
Did everything go well?
It was thanks to my friend.
He only wants 300 francs.
How much?
Life is hard these days.
He has a family to support.
I come to you, a good believer.
I'm a foreigner.
I've eaten nothing all day.
You have some nerve! You just... asked me for 20 francs... and I gave it to you!
You're confusing me with someone else.
I recognize you... even with these clothes.
Sir, don't make these propositions to me.
I am an honest woman.
Where is this country going
Look over here.
Close your mouth.
You came to the right place.
Lift your chin.
There.
The bird has flown.
- How much?
- 300 francs.
When will it be ready?
Come tomorrow around 6PM.
Aram, when are you going to pay me?
Take it easy. If I had money, you would have been paid.
Stop rushing me.
Come back tomorrow, I'll pay you.
- Has Ibrahima returned?
- Not yet.
Tell him we passed.
Maty! You see how many have come asking for money?
How many? For what?
As long as they think we have money... they'll be harassing us.
By the way, we're out of rice again.
The 15 kilos lasted only 3 days.
We also owe 3 kilos you borrowed from the store.
15 and 3 makes 18 kilos.
There are 5 liters of oil.
Add 300 francs we borrowed in cash.
You have to add the bra.
Then there's the charcoal and the waterboy.
You forget the tomatoes: 8 cans
We can't give or lend anything else.
If one wants to help 9 poor, he will soon become the 10th.
Did you deliver my message?
Yes I did, but Uncle is too busy with his money order.
It's okay. Tell him to come see me.
I'll be waiting for him.
Who do I see?
Isn't that Astou?
It is her!
I repeat that I must return with 3000 francs.
Don't tell me you didn't get that money order.
Even the rice we served you was borrowed.
That's none of my business.
I can do without your rice.
I didn't come to beg.
My son earned this money you are refusing to give me.
You and your wives are here indulging on my son's sweat.
Astou, calm down.
You'll return tomorrow with your money. Ibrahima will see his connections.
You stand beside your husband.
But I want my money.
I'm tired of borrowing clothes from neighbors when I come here.
He hasn't gotten the money yet.
I'm not leaving empty-handed!
- Sell this.
- But it's yours.
Wealth protects us from dishonor, but not from death.
Mbarka, I have not forgotten you.
I need your help.
This is gold. I want only 5000
I am being harrassed by my sister.
I'm sure to cash the money order in a few days.
You think I have that much?
Do you know how much you owe me?
I can't give you more credit.
I can leave it on consignment.
What do you want?
It's gold.
I'll take it for 2000 francs.
You have 3 days to pay me back.
I paid 15000 for it!
Here, have it back.
In two days I'll cash the money order.
Mbarka here is my witness.
Give me at least 4000 francs.
To do you a favor...
I'll give you 2000 francs for 3 days, and add 500 in interest.
Interest is immoral.
You don't fear Allah?
2000 francs, plus 500 in interest,
Final offer. Take it or leave it.
- Well?
- Okay.
If you don't come in 3 days, it's mine.
I told you I have a money order.
Allah willing, I'll pay you.
Praised be Allah!
I just came from your house.
I want you to loan me 5000 francs.
You are my last hope.
Allah is my witness,
I cannot.
Money has no roots, but it grows in a man's heart.
Don't be selfish.
Help people in need.
This money belongs to my older sister.
Don't let your women mislead you.
A man is nothing without his fellow men.
I want to lend you that sum.
I wish I was able to help.
The money order is not mine.
The money you see is not mine.
It belongs to my sister.
That's why I can't help you.
Yesterday I saw him count a bundle of bank notes.
His wives run his house.
Solidarity has become a thing of the past.
If I don't have the rest in 3 days, I'll return.
You still owe me 1500 francs.
Allah willing, I'll get the photos today.
I repeat: if I don't have the rest in 3 days, you will see me again.
Allah willing, you'll get your money.
I'll write to Abdou today.
Don't dare mention my name. I'll write him myself. He's my son.
A man like you, without papers.
All aboard. Time to leave.
It's the third time I come!
Your photos didn't come out.
Go away!
I paid for them!
I'm going to kill him!
He broke my table!
Go away, while you still have a head.
He took my money,
I want my photos.
I'll kill kim!
Let me go, I'll kill him.
Malik!
Give me the bottle of wine.
Buddy, some day you'll get caught at this game.
In this country, only the crooks live well.
They've killed him, he's going to die!
What happened?
They robbed Ibrahima.
More than 100000 francs!
It seems there were two of them.
They were four, and they jumped him!
The money order wasn't even his. It was his nephew's.
Because of this money order the whole neighborhood hates us!
Return to your homes,
Look at all the things people brought us.
Why did you lie? Spreading the word that I was robbed...
Now I too must lie.
A lie that unites is better than a truth that separates.
What I mean to say is... won't it be known that the
I'll be the laughing stock of the whole town.
Forgive us.
We are not alone in distorting the facts.
This conduct is not in our nature.
We just wanted to keep away the gossip about you... that they are encouraging.
Rumor has it you've been robbed of the money order.
The 2nd notice, the money order is still at the post office.
I was in my room for 3 days.
I lost one day at the post office.
One day at City Hall.
Another at the home of Amath.
One day at the bank.
Two more days for the photos
I didn't receive.
Nine days the money order has been here.
Six days left before it is returned to Paris.
Who can I ask for the 300 francs for the photo?
What now?
The money order is still at the post office.
If I don't get an ID card in
6 days, they'll return it.
Return it to Paris?
Allah be praised.
The assault you suffered is hard to believe.
That's how things are these days, nobody can be trusted.
But is it right to measure all grains with the same cup?
A cup of whatever grain is still just a cup.
True, but one should try not to lose everything.
Maybe you're right.
But it's also true that a river never flows back to its source.
So what are we going to do?
Be patient.
Wait another 3 or 4 days.
I need your help, just 500 francs.
Where would I get the money?
I know that.
By the grace of Allah,
Mbarka, help me.
You know you're not going to get that necklace back.
Lend me 500 francs, and I'll pay you back 1000 francs.
I have a message to give you...
Someone is interested in your house.
Never. Never!
Sell my house to pay you?
I'd rather die!
Being poor is well and good, but being homeless? Never!
- Why are you shouting?
The bottom line is you owe me. Pay me.
Yesterday, when you crawled in for a handful of rice... you didn't scream so much.
You trusted me, I will pay.
But sell my home, never!
Get out of my store, or I'll call the police!
You and your family can starve, but no more rice from me!
When you have a debt, you pay it.
Leave me alone. I'm tired of being the whole world's toy!
You say you've been robbed. Liar!
You just want the money yourself!
Stop spreading poisonous rumours.
He was robbed! I am a witness!
Let me through, let me through!
Mbarka, we owe you money, but we won't be sacrificed for you!
I'm talking to your husband, it's none of your business.
That's exactly why
Let me get to him, he'll be sorry.
Imam, tell them to leave.
It's true: when you have a debt, you must pay.
The mule driver is always
A stooge has no dignity left.
Tell them to leave, he owes me and his wives want to beat me up.
That's not true, he wants me to sell my house.
Come now, madame, go outside.
OK, enough, you too, come on.
I heard about your money order.
Come to the house in two hours.
It's time. He woke up.
Ah, Uncle. I'm sorry.
No, it was I who came early.
They stole your money order?
No, that's a lie that was started by my wives.
Sometimes women are ingenious.
I'm off.
Until this evening.
(speaking French) Hello?
This is he.
I've seen the place.
All is well.
Listen, don't push.
He's here.
I'm telling you he's here.
Indeed, it didn't work out at the store.
Oh, I know it's for your
Listen, he's crippled with debt!
You'll have it, your house.
I'll call you tomorrow at the
Minister's office. Okay?
Good, goodbye.
Come on, Uncle. Give me the power of attorney to cash the money order.
How much will he ask for a commission?
1000 francs is too little for a man of his caliber.
3000 francs? That's too much.
The money order isn't mine.
If he asks for 3000,
I'll accept.
I'll write to Abdou... and explain that I had to pay a businessman... to get my identity card.
I'm his uncle.
Sign this paper,
In French or Arabic?
Give me the notification.
Take this, for the taxi.
I have an important appointment.
Come see me tomorrow.
MBAYE SARR: BUSINESS AGENT, CERTIFIED
Get a 2nd cup for Uncle.
I never drink coffee.
- What about some milk?
- Only herbal tea.
I was about to come see you because you missed me yesterday.
Really? Allah be praised!
Many thanks.
What I will say is true...
A pickpocket stole it.
I know you won't believe me, but Allah is my witness.
Along with your 25000 francs
I had another 75000.
Mbaye, that money was not mine.
I have a family to feed. The money order wasn't mine, it's my nephew's.
I know all of that.
Mbaye, the money is not mine!
I have no money on me today.
Tomorrow, I'll pay you.
Have mercy on me. The money order was not mine. I have a family.
Uncle, you don't have to
Don't you believe in Allah?
Listen, I'll give you some rice to take home.
Put 10 kilos of rice in a bag
If I had money I'd pay you.
Mbaye, help me...
The money order is not mine.
Get up, I'll take you to your home.
We too have children!
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's not well?
What's the matter?
What happened to you?
It was Mbaye! He stole the money order and gave me this!
What will become of us?
And my necklace?
Shut up!
That money order wasn't mine!
Ibrahima, so you're distributing rice?
No, that's not true.
The truth is that here, being honest is a crime.
Me too, I'll become an opportunist, a thief, a liar!
Why?
Mbaye stole the money order.
Honesty is a crime among our people.
Here's a letter.
It comes from Paris.
We will change our country.
Who?
You.
Me?
You, your wives, your children, me...
All of us.
Sir, we've heard about your generosity.
For 3 days we haven't eaten.
I told you I would come after 3 days.
"and keep 2000 for yourself... because I know you don't have a job."
"Life is difficult for people like us."
"Maty, you are a mother"
"You must understand, the children are hungry."
"Help me, I'm a foreigner... and my children are waiting."
"You and your wives are here indulging on my son's sweat."
"My son earned this money."
"Wealth protects us from dishonor, but not from death."
"Do you know how much you owe me?"
"In this country, only the crooks live well."
"Rumor has it you've been robbed of the money order."
It was Mbaye who stole my money order!
I repeat that honesty is a crime in this country.
It's a hot summer evening.
You're hungry.
You wonder where to go, what to do...
You'd like to go swimming, but you haven't got enough money
You'd like to meet a girl!
You met that girl the other day.
You wonder, if it'll happen again.
You'd like a woman to come along, buy you a meal...
...and take you off to a hotel
That's the sort of thing you're imagining!
Imagining... imagining!
Imagining her body makes you want to play with yourself...
...but you can't do it at home, because you're never alone
You think of going to a lonely field
But unfortunately... you didn't go there
If you had, you wouldn't have killed her
Anyway, there may be someone at the station
This girl has nice breasts
She's got a very nice figure.
You'd like to sleep with her!
KEEP YOUR HOME DECENT.
PUT DIRTY BOOKS IN HERE
HELP YOURSELF TO SMALL CHANGE
You must insert the coin!
Hello, I haven't seen you for ages.
Is Sachiko in?
That's right!
No one of that name lives there?
That's strange
I see... sorry to have bothered you
She's pretty old!
You don't mind, eh?
You rather like them mature
No money problems with them; they pay for everything!
Speak now, then!
But, no, you can't do it
No self-confidence! You don't know women, certainly not nice women!
Excuse me, please
How do I get to Komatsugawa?
I'm a stranger here myself
I see... I'm a student there
"I'm just no good!"
You run and run and run
When you get tired of running, you stop
Stop now! Stop!
It's nice to eat ice-cream after running.
But you must hurry on
The ice doesn't satisfy you: it begins to taste like sand
Water, please
I see!
It's her you wanted
Unrequited love!
Now you hurry to the school gate
As though drawn to it, drawn to the fatal spot!
You feel funny... sort of strange...
It's the feeling which comes before carnal desire
It's not six yet...
...but some men and women are already doing it somewhere
Why do I have to sit alone in this place?
Something within me stirs!
Now, up to the roof!
Quickly up the fatal steps!
Up to the roof!
It is forbidden to go on the roof
She's not here. What's wrong?
There she is! You stare at her
You imagine her naked
Her skin is quite soft
Not yet!
You're not desperate yet!
You're joking!
What do you want? You can't kill me.
That won't kill!
Don't hesitate, someone's coming!
Quick! Quick! Quick!
You can hear someone coming!
It'll be terrible, when she recovers!
See, you've done this!
Now you can do anything you like
Someone's seen me!
Come here! Help me hide her!
R IS PROVED TO BE A KOREAN
Are you going to kill me?
Hang me?
What are you talking about?
I didn't mean to kill her!
She's dead! I didn't mean to, really.
Please help me!
Dead? What do you mean?
There!
Are you all right?
There's nothing there
But that there!
It's here! Take it away!
You mean, you think there's a woman's body here?
Here! Of course!
There's nothing
Can't you see it?
Look at what I'm touching!
Her foot... her hand, so cold!
Put his head under the shower
You can see her, can't you?
Can you?
I am not a killer!
You can see her!
Can you?
No, I'm sure he can't
He's looking at it!
You can see it!
Good! I thought I was going mad
But, R, what shall we do?
I've killed her!
They'll execute me!
What shall I do?
You're already condemned, but can you advise me?
Wake up. No one's going to kill you
Wake up?
I'm not asleep! It's there!
What's where?
Look at her carefully!
Look!
I can only see the concrete floor
I'll make you touch her!
It's there!
I can see it now!
You too?
Three of us can see it
Does this mean we're all dreaming?
Maybe
People don't dream together!
But we have been imagining together
If you imagine, does it come true?
Yes, if you imagine it, as though it were real
Then those who don't see don't imagine well enough?
Didn't you hear that?
We didn't start all this to begin imagining things with R
R, do you now admit that you are R?
I'm still imagining
Stop imagining! You are R!
I must say, I feel a little like R
But I'm far from feeling really him.
Let's imagine some more...
It ended when you killed her
We kindly began with your childhood, unveiled both crime and cause
But I feel something's missing still
What's missing?
For me to be really R
I can see it now!
You've seen it?
What have you done?
And you an Education Officer!
I'm sorry! I got carried away!
That's no excuse! Get rid of it!
What are you doing? He's crazy, take no notice of him!
If you can't see her, shut up!
- Can you men see her?
- From the beginning, Sir!
Now, everyone, shall we keep this to ourselves?
Otherwise, I'll loose my pension,
I'll be hanged.
Why did you have to die?
Why don't you wake up?
Please, wake up for me!
She's warm! She's not dead!
She's alive!
Thank you!
I'll get my pension after all!
Now go home and keep quiet.
Ordinary people don't come here
R, I haven't seen you for ages
Sister
R, don't get confused!
You didn't have an elder sister!
Are you my sister?
Yes, R, I am
She should have never woken up!
If she's really his sister, then R really isn't R at all
I'm all mixed up. Do you understand?
No one understands you.
I understand.
I can see her right there
Purely a personal opinion
Sister, am I R?
The R you've known?
Yes, you are a Korean called R
You used to be called by the
Japanese name Shizuo
But you began to use R...
...after you were awakened to nationalism.
That's fine! Aren't you glad?
I don't know who you are, but thank you!
Thanks to your assistance, we can finally complete the ceremony
I'm against capital punishment!
I don't know whether to laugh or cry!
R, you should not die
Instead you should repent your guilt by getting better
What are you doing, Education Officer?
What she is saying is dangerous!
What she is saying?
We can't even see her!
She opposes capital punishment
Tell me what she says.
You can see her
Priest, tell me, just the most important things
I can't repent until I'm sure I'm R
But you called me your sister so you must be R
That's it! You are R! Listen to her!
May I touch your hand?
If I understand you, sister, perhaps I'll understand myself
He just touched her
Where?
His hand is on her flesh
Her skin flushes
"Those who look at a woman with lust, have already sinned with her in their hearts."
Did she say that?
No, Christ did: he knew the meaning of sexual desire, too
R, you are touching the Korean skin...
...which bears the long, painful history of the Korean race.
When the race is sad, we women are especially sad
There are no women of my age...
...from the Southern part of Korea, who do not bear scars.
They were beaten by their fathers, or injured by their husbands...
...and some of them committed suicide, slitting their wrists.
"The history of the Korean people comprises a five-thousand year occupation by other races.
"Especially in modern times, its cities have been ransacked and its people murdered,
"as victims of Japanese imperialism for 36 years... "
Where's his hand now?
It's slowly moving, then it stops
Her excitement makes her talk like this
Sister...
You remember?
You remember your mother?
I feel strange...
My head is...
How?
Slightly sick
Rest your head on me
Now his head is on her knee.
Higher than her knee!
I can see her!
Talk to me
R, how do you feel?
My head is still a bit dizzy
"Like Cain, long pursued, his sadness is profound
"Even though it makes a beast of me,
I will endure this suffering"
The Korean poet Yu Chi-han wrote that
I remembered it when I saw your father's face
I visited your home
I saw the grape vine for the first time
The grapes hung purple, glowing in the dark
R, after you graduated from junior high school...
...you worked for a factory, and went to night school.
A young Korean among the Japanese
We've already covered that part!
Your job is to make R realize he's the condemned man
Let him admit his sin and die properly
You repent by living
R now knows, who he is: he knows his Korean race!
"She is saying that R will prove himself...
...to be a fine man by striving for the unification...
...and prosperity of his country...
...and thus will atone for his crime."
That's what she's saying.
I'm only repeating it
R doesn't have another life.
The law is the law after all
The unity of your county is all very well, but law is law
But that is Japanese law!
Certainly.
R committed his crimes in Japan
R did not want to be born in Japan!
No Korean does!
His father was brought to Japan as a serf
We covered that, too. We also know his mother was deaf and mute
You Japanese will never understand how we Koreans feel!
R's crime was caused by Japanese imperialism!
Thus, Japan has no right whatsoever to punish him
If we follow your logic, 600,000 Koreans living in Japan must all commit murders
If every one of them killed two Japanese...
1.2 millions would lose their lives... our population problem would be solved
Japan has not enough execution chambers for that!
You're going too fast
Look, this is an execution chamber
It's neither time nor place to debate with an imaginary woman
This won't do.
If you can see her, remove her!
Then I'll go with R
We're going to work for the unity of our country
Nowadays they even use sex for politics
Sex comes first. To hide it people talk politics
It's interesting.
Too bad you can't see
The Public Prosecutor can't see her, either!
I still can't see her.
Does this mean I'm not fit for my job?
How are you?
Can you stand up?
Will you follow me?
Why don't you answer?
In your letter you said you'd join our ranks, didn't you?
Maybe. I don't remember very well
And now?
Being a revolutionary doesn't seem to fit R
Though I'm trying to be and think like him
You mean, you don't care about the unification of your country?
It doesn't fit...
When did you change your mind?
R, you're no longer R!
You're no longer a Korean!
I've said that all along.
Pretty smart for a woman!
Who are you? What right do you have to talk like this?
I'm a Korean in Japan. I'm sad and angry that he's become like this
You've lost R's spirit, and you've lost the Korean spirit!
You're now simply a culprit!
A murderer!
You would not have been able to commit a deed like this
After he killed, the real R...
...telephoned the police as if he had been challenging all Japan. How about that?
R's crime was a Korean crime!
Your crime is the only way for a Korean to wreak revenge upon the Japanese
In the name of the Japanese nation, the
Japanese have murdered innumerable Koreans!
However, we, who belong nowhere, can only take personal revenge upon the Japanese!
The world is upside down.
But the pride and sorrow of Korea are subsumed into this murder
R, isn't this the only way, to understand your crime?
Answer me!
Sister, if what you described is really the way R is... then I'm not R at all
Who has done this to him?
You! All of you!
What do you mean? We've done our best to turn R back into R!
Why, I almost killed a woman, when I tried to be helpful
That's a lie! R is not R!
As a Korean I reject him!
I've said he's not R all along!
Go ahead and execute R!
It is Japanese imperialism...
...that has stripped R and the Koreans of their racial pride
And this crude imperialism still thrives today... among you, officials, you representatives of Japan... who are nothing but blood hounds of imperial authority!
All right, let's get on with it
It doesn't seem right to hang him now, after all our efforts
Go ahead, I'll watch!
Wait!
What's that?
Now you've seen her
This woman, I see her!
She's crying, I can even hear her
I wonder if I'm fit for this job?
She's holding on to him, to delay the execution
But according to section 447, paragraph 2...
...no one may enter here without permission
We can't permit anyone invisible!
If that's the case, I hereby order her to be executed. You can rely on my decision
Kill her?
Yes!
Yes, Sir!
R FINALLY BECOMES R
Come on, priest, dance!
He's not used to drink
But we all get worked up on execution days, don't we?
Alright, buddy...
I know how it is!
Want another one?
I'm going to get stinking drunk!
- Am I dreaming?
- No, you're not
I didn't know you fancied boys
Prosecutor, don't you think it's best to abolish capital punishment...
Just a personal opinion, mind you.
What do you think, Sir?
I didn't know you felt like that
Actually, I don't know much about it, but you, who work here...
All right, you're a dog! Lick away!
You, who've made a fine reputation here...
...you are all right, no doubt you'll be retiring soon
But I have to carry on here, so I think about things a lot
About this capital punishment problem
You make it sound as though
I'm some sort of killer
Come, come, now!
You shouldn't talk like that!
Well, maybe there just might be some killer among us
Maybe the doctor!
I don't dislike hangings, you know
- Are you my sister?
- Yes, you are R
If you are my sister...
I am really R
So it's no dream
No, it's not, it's real
"That's the one who killed Pierre!"
Koreans were the only foreigners
I ever killed!
She was accusing me
In 1946 I was about to be repatriated from Saigon
It was a beautiful evening, the sun was setting
"Non, je ne sais pas, non!"
But the old woman's finger pointed at me!
"You killed Pierre, your prisoner!"
But I didn't kill him!
Let's not talk about killings
Some other time
I can't stop now!
Every day for three years:
"You killed Pierre!"
I didn't, but I had to think about it every day
Our army was disbanded, so they couldn't give evidence on my behalf
Even the emperor....
No one helped anyone in those days
You were the one!
You came up to me one day
"Won't you help a poor sick prisoner, doctor?"
You lied!
All I do here...
...is see whether they are dead or not!
You knew what was involved
I explained it all when I offered you the job
That night I went home drunk, my girl was waiting
I told her all about it
I told her I'd be getting a much better salary...
...just for saying if they were dead or not
Until then, I had to take work as a salesman
She never came back.
In all, 29 girls haven't come back!
Don't speak to him like that!
Why not? I'm only an official loyal to Japanese law
Official! That makes me laugh!
But the girls don't laugh, they get angry
They cry, then they leave
Tonight another girl will be waiting for me
Very nice, Doctor! Please go home and get on with it!
Get on with it?
When the trap is sprung, that's when the girls run away
It's not natural, but it's just then, after an execution...
...I need a woman most
I see. It means that you personally hate executions
Not at all! I chose this job because I like it!
I'd go to Vietnam or Korea or the Philippines to work in the death cells, if they didn't hang here!
Shut up! You're insane!
Death by hanging!
Sister, you're touching me
It makes me tremble
This isn't a dream, it's real
Yet it's like a dream
A dream seems real, reality seems a dream...
Such things happen, don't they?
Are you confusing dreams and reality?
Isn't that a weakness of yours?
Maybe it's bad to imagine doing something to a girl
When I play with myself,
I sometimes look at the photo of an actress
Looking excites me at first, but it's only a photo, really
So I imagine tearing off her clothes, to make her different
Nothing happens really...
...but my imagination is changing, spreading
Spreading?
Don't you think that sex controls the soul more than the body?
Bodies have limitations, imaginations have none
Some people even love chickens
There was a man, who made love to his wife every day...
...but still raped and killed
R!..
Imagination is limitless
In imagination, I fantasize of a girl with a bathing suit on
I let her refuse me, seduce me...
...and I even kill her
Stop it!
Why didn't you have an ordinary love affair?
I stabbed all of you, there was blood everywhere!
Then, somehow, got stabbed, too
Then I caught you, embraced you, we fell down
You were very heavy, heavy...
...as though you were the earth itself
Then I woke up
It was a dream, but my hands were sticky with blood
It was merely my own sweat.
This happens every night
I'm sorry I talked about you that way...
...but you were so poor...
...and you were Korean
You only had dreams to live on
I began living in dreams long ago
I wanted good food...
...nice clothes
But you can't admit it
You learn to give up, really
But you imagine...
...you get the food...
...you get the nice clothes, you can be happy in your imagination
So when, as a man, you want a woman, you're used to imagining things
Of course...
...imagination doesn't satisfy
I follow girls...
...I steal
But that excites the imagination even more
When I was trying to be R just now,
I felt I'd done such things
But whether real or only imaginary,
I don't know
Because in my imagination I've done crimes like those over and over again
But why does your imagination do this?
When men are miserable they usually wish for pleasant things
Maybe, but it was different with me
My imaginary scenes were all like that
Maybe imagination had already disturbed my mind
When I repeat my crime, in my imagination...
...I feel more confident
For example, I imagined a girl coming along on a bike and raped her
I would repeat this imagination
Then one day it happened in reality
The girl rides along just as I imagined...
...so I feel very confident
I imagined her coming from the right
So I hesitate
If she does not come from the right...
...it's neither imaginary nor real
At this moment
I do not have any sexual desire
I just have a desire to combine the real and the imaginary
Unless she comes from the right,
I can stop
But then I change my position, so that she is coming from the right
Now the real and the imaginary are one
Then I'm ready
I'm confident
Just as I imagined...
...I pull her off the bike
It's a dream, as always, isn't it?
I've seen as many as 15 or 20, all in a line...
...machine-gunned to death.
That really stimulated me!
But it was my job, to write the official report:
"Fifty enemies killed"
You saw it?
It was you who killed them!
Yes, I remember the first seven...
...but after them I didn't feel anything much
How did you feel?
Nothing. I had this gun, so naturally I killed
This was in the war, remember...
Japan's war!
And I was called a war criminal!
He did what he did for the sake of his country
Even being a war criminal
Thank you, soldiers brave, who work for your country's sake!
But I don't understand, why this crime of mine...
...should feel so dreamlike
I imagined it, then went and did it, imagining it
Then I imagined it again afterwards
And so, feeling as I do...
...I can't really feel that the people
I killed were real
When I think of them, they're so vague and misty
I wonder why
Sister, I met you during such a moment
Met me?
Met you
Sister I met you, didn't I?
Yes, you did, R
R?
R!
Yes, sister, I meet you during such moments
I've become very fond of you
...and I began to worry
You'd hurt your foot, I remember...
...yet you still came to see me
You got off the bus... before the right stop
You had to walk to my house
It was dangerous: lots of criminals like me around
If anything happened to you...
...my heart would stop
...my sister
And if you were killed and raped...
...like I did to them?
All day long, my heart pounded until it hurt
And that night
I remembered these girls
It was as though...
...I'd been hit very hard
The girls I killed...
...they've disappeared...
...all for my sake
Too bad about the Koreans. They fought for their country, too. They are very...
...But let's not talk about that today
Koreans are no good!
Kill the lot!
600,000 in Japan
They could be killed!
"Not enough execution chambers".
But when you're police chief...
I'm talking about Korean communists!
I think of the red flag flying at Pusan
The Japanese have done plenty to the Koreans
When the red flag is strong enough, they'll come for us
Revenging themselves for all we did to them
All our women will be raped, of course...
...but I'll be killed before then
Public Prosecutor, you're not saying anything.
What do you think?
Older people seem to share your opinion
Don't you believe it?
Well, we lawyers don't usually think about...
...problems between nations
Don't you? I thought you were headed for the Supreme Court!
Because he doesn't think, he's sure to get there
He's a good man
Well, we all do our best for our country
Killing people
A lot's happened today, but I've learned one thing from you all
It's patriotic to kill a man here, or shoot him in war
It's all the same
This sort of work is just a job...
...but, personally, we hate war and execution
Let's pray for the day when there'll be neither war, nor execution
Am I right, Public Prosecutor?
Yes, let's drink a toast to that
Get up, priest! Time for a toast!
"Lest the wine be soured, all we weak sinners ask compassion."
Cheers!
Sister, don't cry
In my imagination it is me who cries...
...and you comfort me
I've come to love my sister
I wonder why I confuse my sister with my victims
I mix them all up in my head
When I think of someone I love dying...
...I suddenly realize the true meaning of death
Maybe I killed two people
Now that I've come to like you so much...
...my mind is no longer merely imagination
It contains a world that others can enter...
Because now, when I think about my victims...
...who were previously so vague and misty...
...they now seem more real to me
Not only the victims themselves...
...but what I did, and thus what I am
...this, too, I see more realistically, more objectively
Now, for the first time in your life you are able to face reality
A young Korean in Japan
Now, I think, I can die
That's right, let the old R die, let the new R live on
But the old R killed in reality
But now I know more, more about my place in the world
Careful, careful. You will fall!
No, I'm not, I'm all right
I'll tickle you, sister!
R ACCEPTS BEING R...
...FOR THE SAKE OF ALL Rs
I have understood. I am R
Hurray! This sort of thing makes the job worthwhile!
You admit being R?
Don't question too much.
Discussions are fruitless
Let's execute him now
All right, let's get on with it
I shouldn't be executed
This is what I hate about the job!
Why shouldn't you be executed?
I am R, but I am not the R you've been thinking of
R!.. Keep God out of this, or we'll have another non-R!
Sure, I'm the R who did all those things
But...
You don't feel guilty?
I don't feel guilty
You, convicted man, don't talk like that!
R is guilty, all right, but he's different from me
Now he's good, thanks to all your efforts
"The accused is condemned to death"
"I felt carnal desire...
"I decided to rape her..."
Only I didn't
"Fearing she might remember...
"I was afraid she might identify me...
"I decided to kill her and rape her".
But I didn't!
You did!
No, that R is not me
Those are just set phrases, maybe they're not quite appropriate
Maybe "carnal desire" and "rape" aren't quite what you had in mind
The important fact is that you killed two girls
Yes, I'll admit to that
At last! So it's only natural you should be executed
Is it wrong to kill?
Yes, it is wrong to kill
Really?
Then, killing me is wrong, isn't it?
Such questions are the result of all this post-war education!
A fine idea.
First we kill the murderer...
...then, being murderers, we'll be killed, and so on and so on
Don't say such things!
We're legal executioners!
It's the nation that does not permit you to live
I don't accept that.
What is a nation? Show me one!
I don't want to be killed by an abstraction
The Public Prosecutor represents the nation
Then you are my murderers
I'm only a Security Officer
A small part, not the whole thing
Then who is?
Are you?
But my rank is only a little bit higher than his
Public Prosecutor?
If you were the whole thing, you would be evil for killing me
The next Prosecutor will kill you, and he'll be killed in turn...
...and finally no one will be left
What slippery talk is this?
You'd make a good lawyer!
I killed two people...
...but not like it says
You say I'm guilty
But this is only to get at me... to kill me
Enough! Stop!
But it wasn't me, who killed
So you think, you're not guilty?
I'm not guilty
As long as you feel not guilty, you're not
We won't execute you
If this gets out...
R, you are not guilty
You are free to go
Go!
What's the matter R?
You've stopped. You can't go?
You've seen God's light, and now you feel guilty.
You didn't feel like this before!
R, do you understand why you stopped there?
Out there is the nation...
This also is the nation
You said that the nation is invisible
But now you see it, and cannot escape its existence
The nation is in your mind, and as long as it exists there, you feel guilty
Just now you realized that you should be executed
He's a great man!
I've never seen such a great Prosecutor in my whole career!
You could even be Prime Minister!
Happy Japan!
Though I may not live to see it
Wait! Wait a moment!
R, you are lucky to have met such a great Prosecutor
Tell us, how you feel: it will comfort those who follow you
Something like:
"Oh, the morning sky is clear"
Or:
"Love to mother"
I'm not guilty!
You can't retract!
For a time I thought that maybe I was guilty, somehow
But I remain innocent
Because I'm not R!
A nation cannot make me guilty.
Well, with such ideas you shall not be allowed to live
I know, that is why I admit it
For all Rs, including you,
I'll courageously admit to being R...
...and I will die now
I thank you very much
You've done a good job
Education Officer, thank you for taking part in this execution.
Security Officer, thank you for taking part in this execution.
And you...
And you...
And you...
And you...
And you, dear spectators, thank you for taking part in this execution.
NARRATOR:
Berlin, 1944.
 A secret radio message from Adolf Hitler
 personally to his spies in Great Britain.
"Kill General MacKenzie-Smith, please."
 There was terrible headaches, you know.
 Here in London, this is how the message was passed on.
 It's only now that we of
British Military Intelligence
 have been able to piece together fully
from captured German documents.
 We thank Paramount Pictures in Hollywood
 for having the courage to put this on the screen.
 I know we wouldn't.
 The German Secret Service didn't hesitate a moment
 in placing Hitler's orders into effect.
 MacKenzie-Smith was drawing up the plans
 for the Allied invasion of Europe
 and had to be stopped at all costs.
 Here come General Eisenhower,
Field Marshall Montgomery,
 General de Gaulle,
 and Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith himself
 wearing the familiar eye patch.
MAN:
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!
NARRATOR:
Dear, dear. We don't seem to be catching up.
 Well, after all, the Germans are in a Rolls Royce
 and our lads only have American Jeeps.
 Not that we're not grateful, mind you.
 Uh, it is better than walking.
Oh, come, come. Let's get those ruddy names off the screen
 Never heard of any of those chaps. Have you?
MAN ( over speaker ):
This camp area is now sealed.
NARRATOR:
That night MacKenzie sealed every military area in Britain.
 Nothing could move in or out.
Not even two American soldiers assigned to a British base.
MAN ( over speaker ):
...permitted to leave this base
 by personal order of the General Officer
MacKenzie-Smith, that so and so.
Boy, you can say that again.
Cheer up, Joe.
So we can't leave for home
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and smile.
Smile. Smile.
Sure. After all the trouble to get the Red Cross
My poor wife having
My mother isn't desperately ill.
She's on Miami Beach.
She sent me a picture of her in a bathing suit,
My poor sister works for the Red Cross.
Want to get her in trouble?
No, I don't wanna get her in trouble.
How many times have I told you
I'm on the salt-free, fat-free, high-protein low-calorie diet?
What's so difficult about that?
It's not easy to get it on a shingle.
No.
We don't even belong in this teabag outfit.
Well, I know that.
The, the--
Our company was just loaned to the British Army to show them how to open spam or something.
All right.
Why don't we see the captain?
We'll explain the whole situation to him.
He's a nice fellow.
He'll cut some orders for us, and then in a couple of days, we'll be home.
Ernie, this is the army, remember?
There are a couple of boys trying to get home from Gettysburg.
They'll make it.
Inspecting something,
I guess.
Why ain't they out fighting the war?
What do you want?
Why aren't we fighting the war?
Because we want our side to win. That's why.
Sit down, chaps.
We're all in the same leaky boat.
Not us. We're supposed to be sailing on one tonight.
Our sick ones are waiting for us.
This military camp is now sealed by order of the general commanding by order of
His Majesty's government, and by order of the Prime Minister.
Uh-huh.
( imitating MacKenzie ):
Hey! We shall fight them on the beaches. We shall fight them on the streets.
But, uh, how can we fight them if we can't get out of this ruddy camp?
Quiet, will you?
I've gotta think.
Now, there must be somebody we know that's got enough influence to get us out of here tonight.
( in normal voice ):
There's only one man.
( imitates Hitler ):
Sieg heil!
Now he'll run his whole
Luftwaffe for you.
He has a gamut of three.
It's because he was raised in the German section of Brooklyn.
( in English ):
There'll always be an England, but they will be driving Volkswagens.
We will have the--
Ernie, your mustache fell in the potatoes.
It looks right at home.
( in normal voice ):
Yeah, well...
See, without my patch,
I have one good eye with 20/20 vision and one bad eye uh, in case of extreme myopia, you see.
And, uh, I wrote a letter to my draft board about it,
He's jolly good, you know?
The life of the party.
Do an imitation of the boat sailing for the States without us.
( in rough voice):
When the saints go marching in.
Will you quit fooling around?
( normal ):
Honestly, we'll get going.
Of course.
I can just see
MacKenzie Smith, that one-eyed old slave driver giving you permission to go.
Yeah, so can I.
Yeah, here.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
Uh, um, speak up, young man.
Huh, what's his mother doing around in Rip Rolls. What?
Nuh-uh.
Good heavens, man.
Why didn't you speak up sooner?
Oh, yes.
I say unseal Britain, and let my people go.
Don't encourage him, please.
Oh, that's the old bird to a tee. your duty is merely to do your duty.
Do you understand?
Obey orders.
Now yours is not to reason why.
Ours is not to reason why either.
If any stops to reason why, we should all be in Miami Beach with Mother.
Ha, ha, I say, that's a rather witty one.
Well, uh, what?
Carry on.
Come on, chaps.
On the double.
Ernie.
Well, what for?
We're going out to the motor pool.
Grab a car. You'll sit in the back seat and I'll drive you out,
General.
I won't be impersonating an officer.
That's what I mean.
I'll impersonate an officer.
Ernie, it's dark outside.
Don't you see how you fooled that limey captain? wearing all that brass.
I'll make like your chauffeur.
It's a cinch.
You must be out of your mind.
You don't even know how to drive.
The incredible just takes just a little bit longer. and categorically no, no, no.
MAN 1: Hey!
MAN 2:
Who goes there?
Oh, sorry, sir.
I didn't know you were visiting the camp, sir.
But I have strict orders, sir.
Your orders not to let anyone
Quiet, sergeant.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
Um, very good.
But I've just revoked the order, and I am in a bit of a rush.
Open the barrier.
There's a good man.
Sorry, sir, but you must prove your identity.
Blasted man,
I have urgent business at Supreme Headquarters.
I have no time to play
Tin Soldier. Never have.
Now you know who I am.
Open the barrier or I shall have my man drive through it!
Open.
( in normal voice ):
Once we get out of sight,
I'll take the wheel.
I've got to hand it to you.
Maybe it was you who had the IQ of 185.
I guess it was mine.
Listen, you better get out and change that tire before they try to come and help us.
Where do they hide the tools in these things?
I don't even know where they put the motor.
I can't do that.
I'm the general.
So, be democratic.
Oh, stop worrying.
They didn't even notice us.
Hey, I think I found the jack.
Heh, look.
Look, I think I found a fuse.
Oh, what fender.
What to do?
Let me get out of here!
Lift up, so I can put the jack under here.
( screams ):
Yeah, oh, God!
Get this thing up--
We have transport for you, sir. Please get in.
We'll take you to Supreme Headquarters.
I've got a better idea.
Take me to jail.
MAN:
Yes, yes. A remarkable resemblance to the general.
But we must be absolutely certain.
The Nazis,
I'm sorry to say, escaped.
They've slipped through our fingers again, up our sleeve as a last resort.
Finally, we seem to have stumbled on a man who has a chance of carrying it off.
Yes, but yeah, you've seen the report on this fellow?
He's a hypochondriac, a malingerer, a confirmed grouser, he's got flat feet--
But it made a monkey out of the Sergeant Le Garde.
Nonsense. At night, and for a few seconds only.
Colonel.
We're both in intelligence and both understand that could get us committed to a booby hatch
There's something in that.
Now sometimes the long chance is the only chance.
Perhaps you're right.
Well, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll have this fellow,
Private Williams, brought in tomorrow and leave it to the general to make the final decision.
How's that?
The general himself?
Heh, one thing we've learned from you Americans, my boy, the higher you pass the buck, the longer it takes to come back to you.
NARRATOR:
Our code name for this chap was to be Dead Pigeon.
 Goodness, do you think he heard me?
Okay, Corporal.
We'll take it from here.
Come along.
Sir Lawrence, this is Project 402.
Good heavens.
Oh, please don't judge by his present unprepossessing appearance, sir.
Z-2 has investigated him thoroughly, sir.
This man has an amazing ability for mimicry.
Oh, jolly, we'll have to make sure.
Step forward, man.
Step forward, damn it!
Uh...
Turn around.
Faster!
I can't turn around any faster, sir.
If I turn around fast,
I get dizzy and nauseous and everything, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's like this, sir.
You see, sir.
It's a form allergenic vertigo, sir.
It's, uh, a deviation of the inner ear.
It's quite an interesting problem medically.
I wrote a letter to draft board, explaining the whole thing.
MACKENZIE:
What is this ruddy nonsense?
I say, stop it, you hear.
Halt!
I say there is a vague physical resemblance, but I do say, chaps, don't you think we're going a bit near the knuckle?
Oh, excuse me. MI-5 have also investigated this man, sir.
Tested him thoroughly.
His impersonation of you is skillful even uncanny.
Please don't judge too hastily, sir.
Yes, yes, yes.
Of course.
Mm, uh.
Uh ,what did you say this chap's name was?
Williams.
Private Ernest Williams.
MACKENZIE:
Yes, of course. Uh, you.
Let me hear you play
General MacKenzie-Smith in your uncanny and skillful way.
Would you mind putting out that cigar, sir?
I'm allergic to tobacco.
My sinuses simply are not equipped to handle it, sir.
It's all in that letter, page four, paragraph three.
Look here, man!
I haven't got all day!
General Eisenhower is waiting.
Oh, tell him not to, sir.
I don't do him.
Of all the blithering idiots,
I give you exactly five seconds to comply with my order or I'll ruddy well have you taken out and shot!
Or are you allergic to that too?
( imitates Mackenzie ) :
Of all the blithering idiots,
I give you exactly five seconds to comply with my order or I'll ruddy well have you taken out and shot!
Or are you allergic to that too?
Rather good, me boy.
Rather good.
I say, that's quite a remarkable resemblance.
I'm glad you think so, sir.
Yes, I do.
My congratulations, dear fellow.
Yes, yes.
Quite remarkable.
Blast me if I don't think he'll do.
( in normal voice ):
You're not going to shoot me
Have you been told about your assignment?
Assignment?
We'll take care of that later.
He hasn't been told a thing.
Face the general.
Oh, excuse me,
Sir.
Uh, what will you have?
What?
I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, sir.
Blast it, man!
Anyone who wants to step into my shoes better learn to drink my brandy.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. I think they let me keep it, sir.
I have it. Oh, uh.
No, that's the Hitler mustache.
I can tell by the mashed potatoes.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
All leaves casual forthwith for the fortnight.
That's the wrong eye, you idiotic nincompoop!
A mistake like that might be tragic.
Well, you see, sir,
I have one good eye and one eye with very poor vision.
When I imitate you, sir,
I always put the patch on the bad eye so I can see.
But if you insist on it, sir,
I can put it on the good eye,
Here, man.
Here's your drink. Drink up.
Sir, I have a liver condition--
There'll be steel through it if you don't.
Alcohol makes the enzymes in my blood have their own--
Be quiet, man, or I'll have you hanged for insubordination!
( stammers ):
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
If that's what you really want.
Sorry, sir.
I, uh, can't see a thing, so I should always wear it on.
Ooh, uh, say, huh...
For heaven's sake, man, drink up and get out of my sight.
Oh, uh, excuse me, sir.
Yes, sir.
Uh, yes.
Take him out and try to persuade him to desert.
Yes, sir.
Come along.
You've got him, Jeff.
MAN:
The enemy expect the invasion here.
Now, at all costs, we must confuse the German high command as to where the blow will really fall.
Already we've sent an actor who resembles
Field Marshal Montgomery on a tour of North Africa to convince the enemy that the attack will be launched from there.
Sound thinking.
Thank you,
Private Williams.
Very kind of you.
Now, General MacKenzie-Smith will shortly take off by air for Yugoslavia where the second front will really begin.
He must travel, of course, in complete secrecy, disguised.
Disguised perhaps as a private in the American army.
Private Ernest Williams.
I see.
And you want me to impersonate the general for a while so that the German high command will believe he is still in London?
Sound thinking.
Uh, thank you, sir.
Very kind of you.
Uh, I've been doing some more sound thinking, sir and, uh, ah, I don't think
I want the job, uh, sir.
ERNIE:
Well, sir, doing it for the fellows is one thing but in real life, day after day uh, heh, I'm not even British.
I honestly don't think
I could carry it off.
In that case, soldier,
I'll arrange for your Court-Martial immediately.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, Court-Martial, sir?
Uh, Court-Martial?
Impersonating an officer is a capital offense.
I think the fellow is quite right.
An American. How could he be convincing as an Englishman?
You did, of course.
When does a colonel listen to a private, sir?
I mean, uh, I've been doing a lot of sound thinking and I don't think there's anybody else
You don't?
Yes, sir.
Uh, certainly on the surface
I may appear American to you but dash it all, underneath, my roots go back to the Pilgrim fathers.
( imitating MacKenzie-Smith ):
You do realize I play cricket every Whitsuntide?
For old Genenid...
I don't know, sir, but I do know I'd like the job.
Under those circumstances,
I'll be happy to see that you get it.
You have nothing to worry about.
We'll give you a complete make up job.
Gray your hair.
We'll put you through a whale of a training program.
You'll study the general's actions, appearance, friends, the whole works.
When we get through, you'll not only look like the general
That may be necessary too.
I can't do that.
You see, Colonel?
I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-cholesterol low-calorie diet.
We'll cross that alcoholic bridge when we come to it.
Uh, I want you both to know that
I'm very happy to do anything that will make sure that the government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from this earth.
Thank you, Honest Abe.
Four score and seven years ago, or forefathers brought forth upon this land a low-calorie, cottage cheese, which is the only--
Don't you think perhaps we ought to tell him?
Tell him what?
That a spy ring of German agents are operating within our own headquarters?
That's already made three attempts on MacKenzie-Smith's life.
It may be wise to risk someone else's life for the generals but--
I don't altogether agree with you Americans, you know? ought to be told the truth and allowed to volunteer.
Colonel, in two years of army service
Private First Class
Ernest Williams has never volunteered for anything including volleyball.
My only regret is he only has but one life to give to his country.
Consider him our rebuttal for Britain.
All right, Jeff, my boy.
You may be right.
Here you are, then.
Heh. To Lend Lease.
Will you be needing the car again this evening, sir?
Uh, no.
That will be all.
You're dismissed, sergeant.
Thank you.
Yes, sir. Uh, the usual tonight,
I assume, sir?
Uh, yes, yes.
Yes, of course.
Very good.
You certainly fooled the general's driver.
Yeah.
How's the contact lens we fitted for you?
I had a little bit of difficulty with it at first, sir, but I see out of it wonderfully now.
Oh, good, good.
I was wondering, sir.
Can I have this contact lens after I finish this job?
Don't quite know how we'd be able to get it away from you.
By the way, have you got the spare lens we gave you?
Yes. Yes.
I have it right here.
Where is it?
Don't lose it.
The general's suite
Yes?
Sergeant Twickenham and his bad manners is waiting.
He's been told everything.
Tomorrow you make your
I do?
Launching the Joint
Allied Red Cross with General Zlinkov of the Red Army.
Don't forget
No, I won't, sir.
Go straight upstairs.
No, I won't.
Good night.
Good night.
I said "evening."
Pretty good, huh.
You should have caught me at the airport.
Ahem! Men, we have an enormous job of work to do. the Allied victories there is nothing in the world that we must value as highly as discipline.
Heh, pretty cute, huh?
The resemblance is absolutely astounding, sir.
But if I might suggest?
Head back.
Not too far, sir.
Uh, slight trace of a limp in the left leg.
Wounded in France.
Oh!
No, sir. Paris.
Lady in a spiked heel.
The general was barefoot at the time.
They told me he was married.
Yes, sir. That too.
Lady Margaret, lovely girl.
She's in Canada, you know, on a war savings bond drive.
That's good. I'll have to remember to keep my shoes on.
You forgot your briefcase, sir.
As usual.
Yes. Thank you.
Uh, yes, uh, quite.
Thank you very much.
Good night. Pip, pip.
Cheerio.
Thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.
You may go back to the motor pool, Sergeant.
Beastly night, though, isn't it, sir?
Double beastly, actually.
Well, good night, sergeant.
Carry on. Press on.
Pip, pip.
Tally ho, and, uh, you may fall out.
What?
What's wrong with you?
Of course, Larry.
You're the general.
Yes, of course.
Quite.
I must investigate this absolutely thoroughly.
I think you'll find everything where it should be.
Good night, sergeant.
Good night, general.
Sergeant!
As usual.
Twickenham!
Comman--!
What's wrong with you tonight, darling?
You're acting a little cold, aren't you?
Cold.
Yes, that's what I have.
A beastly...
You had better leave.
You might catch it.
I know a lovely way to break up a cold, Larry or have you forgotten?
You were very distant towards me in the car tonight, darling.
I, uh, hope you're not holding what happened last Thursday PM against me.
Not at all.
Not a bit.
Not a smidgen.
Not a wit.
No, no.
Not even Wednesday AM.
Wednesday AM?
Larry, you mad fool!
Ah, you haven't change a bit, after all, heh.
Do...
Do you really think she has a cure for the common cold?
I wouldn't doubt it for a moment, sir.
That's what my speech is about tomorrow.
I did try to warn you, sir.
Yeah. Well.
Uh, what am I gonna do?
It would be dangerous to arouse suspicion, sir.
After all, the general has got a reputation with the ladies.
I know that, but I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-calorie low-cholesterol diet.
You better get me out of here.
Tell her anything.
Tell her something.
Tell her
I've, uh, gone to visit a war.
I'm engaged in a secret conference.
Tell her anything.
I've got to get out.
Oh, no, sir.
I once asked her.
It's Lady Margaret, sir.
The general's wife.
Lady Margaret? You told me she's in Canada on a bond tour.
What kind of a war is this, anyway?
I thought we were fighting the Germans.
Hey, you keep Margaret busy.
I'll get rid of Dr. Cronkite.
Sergeant. Sergeant?
Where are you?
Sergeant?
I say, Sergeant, where are you?
STANHOPE:
In here, Larry.
What? Oh!
Ah.
You impetuous beast.
I'm sorry, your baggage.
My wife, you know.
What am I supposed to do?
Out of the bath, into your clothes,
Hm, the usual.
Larry.
Maggie!
I say it's absolutely wizard to have you back, old girl.
Larry!
I--
Don't I do that to you?
I'm terribly sorry. I was absolutely overcome, you see.
Been ghastly lonely, you know.
Just me and Ike and Monty and Charlie de Gaulle.
Larry, you know I don't find you amusing any longer.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a bath
What?
I mean, there's been awful trouble with the plumbing.
I had to pitch in myself, you see.
Do you realize that all the good plumber are in intelligence now?
That, ha, ha...
That's a rather good one.
Rather I'll have it fixed straight away.
Now what, darling?
Oh, you are a bit slower this evening.
Quickly, dear.
On the double.
Oh!
You seem so different.
You've changed.
What's happened to all the passion?
Passion. Poetry.
Yes. Good night.
Good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I say good night till it be morrow.
Oh, Larry!
In dreams
I kiss your hand, madame.
But drink to me only with thine eyes.
I'd be down to get you in a taxi, honey, but you'd better be ready
Yes! Here, dear!
Sorry, I took so long.
I had a bit of difficult, but it's all fixed now.
Eh, dreeded it for.
Uh, drewed it for you.
Difficult language, isn't it?
Oh, capital idea.
Absolutely capital.
Yes.
Uh, I'm a bit fagged out myself.
I think I should turn in myself.
Come over here, Larry.
Come here.
What ever for?
Well, I want to talk to you.
Yes.
How are Toronto Maple Leafs doing this season?
And how is your dear mother?
Gears lock.
Absolutely smashing.
Received a letter only yesterday.
My dear Larry, your mother has been dead for over two years.
Well, the mails are terribly slow these days. and traffic lights and that sort of thing.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Twickenham!
Twickenham!
Your Ladyship.
You'll excuse my forwardness but
I took the liberty of calling
MI-5 military intelligence.
Colonel Somerset's on the line he'll explain everything to you.
Well, I certainly hope so.
Don't let him out of your sight.
I guess
I didn't fool her at all.
Don't worry, sir.
The general never does either.
Larry's where?
Yes, I did return unexpectedly.
Project 402?
Dead Pigeon?
What is this soldier supposed to do?
Now, Colonel Somerset, are you serious?
Does he know this?
He should be told.
Well ,yes, Colonel, if you say it's top secret, not a word.
Poor unfortunate fool.
Uh, her Ladyship.
Ah, sorry, sir.
She'll expect this.
That will be all,
Twickenham.
Ah, yes, my lady.
I'm sorry about all this. or I was supposed to try to convince you I was Larry or--
Oh.
You may put your hands down.
Oh, thank you.
I, uh, wouldn't like to cause any embarrassment.
I could sleep outside on the couch or something.
No, heh, we'll play the game to the hilt.
You sleep in Larry's bed.
He seldom used it anyway.
I still have the gun, soldier.
I hope you'll forgive my being a bit shaky, but, uh,
I mean
I've met a lady, but
I had a peculiar idea that you'd be wearing a crown or coronet or a halo.
Something like that.
Oh, I haven't worn a halo in years.
You could have fooled me.
Lady Margaret, I'm curious about something.
Did I play the part well enough to fool you?
I wouldn't mean permanently, but momentarily when we first met.
Oh, that's when you made your first mistake.
Because Larry hasn't kissed me hello in ages.
He hasn't? he never bothered to hide them from me.
That might be an expression of an inferiority complex.
It could mean that he loves you very much.
I wish I could be as forgiving as that but I came back from Canada to ask Larry to give me a divorce.
War hero or no.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Maybe all he needs is to go and see a psychoanalyst.
I once had an uncle who hated my aunt.
He went to see an analyst every day for six months at $25 a visit.
He learned to love her all over again.
Then he ran out of money, so she divorced him.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this, except that it has absolutely nothing to do with your situation at all.
If you're supposed to have fooled Larry's friends and I presume you are, you've got an awful lot to learn.
You have?
Yes. I've been down to the headquarters, and they've been showing newsreels of him and I've been reading biographies and I've been practicing too.
Yes.
Limping and swagger-sticking.
I ever put a mark on my eye where the patch is supposed to go over, heh.
Larry doesn't need any patch any more than you do.
He doesn't?
It's just that one eye has a tendency to become quite bloodshot after five or six brandies, his usual condition.
I don't like officers like that
They think they're winning the war.
You're winning the war,
Private Williams.
No, not me.
I'm not doing anything much.
I'll be finished in a few days.
I think you'd better get some sleep
Yeah.
Uh, good night,
Your Ladyship.
Good night,
Project 402.
NARRATOR:
Our man from Brooklyn remained a perfect gentleman all night.
( suspenseful theme playing )
What'd I say?
Ah, you said, "My old friend, Marshall Zlinkov.
It's been a long time since those gay old days in Moscow."
Yes, I've got that phrase down pretty pat, but suppose the general asks me something else in Russian.
I can't keep telling him about the gay old days in Moscow.
I shall be on the platform with you, and I shall tap you when you must answer.
Once for nyet, meaning no.
Twice for da, meaning--
Three times for mozhet byt, meaning yes.
We're getting close to the area.
Once for nyet, meaning da.
Once for da. Two nyets for mozhet, meaning--
Here, here. How about a spot of brandy for the nerves?
No, thank you. I don't.
You don't happen to have any yogurt in there?
Yeah.
None.
You better have the brandy yourself. Ah, twice for yeah.
I get out of the car and everybody cheers.
I step on the platform.
Everybody cheers.
I deliver the speech.
Everybody cheers.
I get back in the car, and they go out of their minds, cheering, heh.
We're here.
Ah, Twig, we're here.
Ah, Twickenham.
It's no time to fall asleep.
I've got to remember the nyets and the--
Twickenham!
Twickenham, say something.
Take him out.
Hurry, they're cheering you.
What's the matter?
Yes, yes.
Poor Twickenham.
High blood pressure.
And a touch of malaria.
Malaria, I believe.
But he had such a good complexion.
But he also had cirrhosis of the liver and a weak heart.
Cirrhosis.
You never know who's gonna go next, do you?
Sometimes you do.
You take care of him.
Go on. They're waiting.
Good luck.
Uh, maybe if he'd been on a fat-free--
I don't think that would have helped.
Look, I can't go out there.
Look at that crowd.
You've got to.
You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time.
But the first fellow who said that was shot.
MAN ( over PA ):
May I welcome you on behalf of the United States Army.
 Also on behalf of our distinguished visitors,
 Marshall Gregory Zlinkov of the Army of the Soviet Union,
 General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith
 of the British General Staff.
We gather here on the eve of the invasion.
You men will spearhead the attack and rest assured in the knowledge that today as we launch a new drive for the plasma that will bring to the floor--
Tovarish, doctor.
General MacKenzie-Smith, you speak the marshal's language.
Would you explain to your old friend
We're not taking any blood samples.
I believe he said this reminds him of the gay old days in Moscow.
I say, what are they doing there?
Da.
MAN:
Hero.
Carry on.
Men, we have further good news.
After intensive research, the medical corps of the United States Army is passing along to its allies
Those two enemies of seaborne landings mild burn exposure have finally been conquered.
One shot of serum D-104, and seasickness becomes an old wives' tale.
We have also developed S-604, a new anti-influenza vaccine.
Gentlemen, never has the army had two such distinguished guinea pigs.
Not at all.
Ready? Oh, yes.
Uh, pardon me.
Ah, no, sir.
These are in the arm.
Oh, terribly sorry.
I say, do be gentle.
Thank you.
Uh...
Molodets, heh.
Men of the invasion forces, the hero of Dunkirk,
El Alamein and Tobruk,
General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith.
As you are, men.
Men... no longer the discomfort of seasickness.
As you men are the spearhead of the invasion disembarked from your landing craft, you will be so healthy and so fit that your condition will come as a complete surprise to the German army.
And so I say to our gallant allies, hip, hip.
Achoo! Pardon.
Let me hip, hip, achoo.
I'm afraid
I'm not much of a cook, but this is the best
I could do without Twickenham.
Twickenham.
That was the fastest case of cirrhosis I've ever seen in my whole life.
What about that stray bullet that knocked my hat off?
Boy, that was really close.
You'd better eat properly.
I'm supposed to ride through
Trafalgar Square in an open car.
They want me to sit up on the back so that the people can see me when they cheer.
I'm a symbol, you know.
You're a target.
A target.
A sitting duck.
Do you know what the code name for you is?
German Secret Service has been trying to kill my husband and you've been set up to take his place.
No, no. He's going to Yugoslavia to open a second front.
All the English troops are going to Yugoslavia because he said that when he went to Yugoslavia, all the troops would be able to be able to attack behind the Danube.
Dead Pigeon?
Do you know why we're giving that party tonight for the officers of
Larry's old regiment?
No. You mean the MacKenzie
First Highlanders? No.
They've learned that the chief agent
And tonight, they've invited everyone they suspect of wanting to kill you.
I'm sorry. I'm getting out of here right now.
I'm turning in my eye patch, sir. And my mustache.
I figured out your whole cold-blooded scheme.
Pretty clever, wasn't it?
If they don't get me at the party, at Trafalgar Square.
You can have your pips back.
I'd rather be a private in the front lines under fire from shot and shell, sir.
Don't take that literally, too, sir.
I'm sorry, Colonel Somerset.
I suppose I've broken security but I couldn't let you do it to him.
That's all right.
I understand how you feel, of course but it's a matter of military necessity.
But there's been a change in the situation.
Why? Are they switching to knives?
No.
I'm sorry to have to break this news to you, under these circumstances.
What's wrong,
Colonel Somerset?
The aircraft that was taking
General MacKenzie-Smith supposedly to Yugoslavia was in point of fact headed for invasion headquarters in Kent.
He was going a roundabout route to confuse the enemy.
It was, I regret to say,
Everybody lost, including
I'm afraid, your husband.
You have my very deepest sympathy, Lady Margaret.
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you.
I'm all right.
It's strange that at a time like this you only remember the good moments.
So you understand our strategy has completely changed.
The sad death of
General MacKenzie Smith will delay the second front for weeks.
You must be at the party tonight for the general's old regiment.
Even though you think somebody at the party is going to try to knock me off?
We're sure of it, but this will make the whole thing work.
When they expose themselves, that will give us opportunity of breaking the spy ring.
I see. Before or after they try to kill me?
Oh, before, naturally, heh.
We hope.
Oh, look, sir.
I like to go to parties, but I'd like to go home afterwards.
Under the circumstances,
Williams, the decision must be yours.
This is not an order.
Oh. well, in that case--
But you must realize thousands of Allied lives may depend upon you.
We have no right to ask you to commit what might be suicide.
Well, in that case--
But the whole of the
United States Army is at stake.
Williams, what do you say?
Help!
Don't forget for a moment that you're in danger.
Be careful.
Heh.
Don't trust anyone.
Um, ahem.
Remember, if you want to convince them you're really Larry.
Fine.
How's it going, vicar?
At the end of the evening you'll get boring drunk.
And you and I must have a large family brawl.
How do you do?
We may even strike each other.
You must try.
How do you do?
Mm-hm?
If anything happens to me tonight,
I want you to know these have been nicest two days
I've ever had in my whole life.
Mm-hm.
MAN: And there he was
General Biff Browningham with only one chukka to play.
And I.
Pardon me.
Excuse me. Who's the gentleman that just arrived in?
Oh.
He was in the
MacKenzie Highlanders.
Just an acquaintance of Larry's -Mm-hm.
Been in the Middle East.
Hmm.
Well, that's good because
I couldn't stand all details.
MAN:
A drink, your ladyship?
No, thank you.
Um, look here, sergeant.
WOMAN: That's General
Brown Wiffingham.
Commanding South Hampton
Staging Area.
Oh, yes. I recognize him from the regimental photo.
Uh, we're supposed to be very good chaps.
And he calls me, oh, um, he calls me Binky, and I call him Puffy.
Puffy.
It's kind of nauseating.
Isn't it?
Well, you're very fond of him.
But you're not crazy about him.
Oh.
Binky, heh!
Hello, Penelope.
How are all the children?
Didn't you get my letter from New Delhi?
Oh, yes.
That was too bad.
What is too bad?
I mean,
I was absolutely overjoyed.
About what?
Em, eh, I save stamps, you know.
You can have you head blown off and still say something witty.
Have your head blown off?
Oh.
Good evening.
It's a pleasure,
Lady Margaret.
I don't think you or the general know my wife.
How do you do?
Head blown off.
We intercepted a radio message.
They've changed their plan.
I don't know what they're trying now.
No, no, no, no.
Uh, I'm following it up.
Nothing could possibly happen.
Oh.
I know everything about everybody.
Oh, my dear.
Now, what can we do for you, eh?
What would you like?
Oh, the usual.
WOMAN: Good heavens.
Lady Vivian.
I was hoping she wouldn't find out about the party.
She'll ruin everything.
Come on. Let's meet her.
Yes.
Yes?
What have you got to say for yourself?
Head blown off.
Oh, Aunt Vivian,
I'm so sorry.
Larry's favorite aunt and I forgot to invite you.
Yes. A complete oversight, but my apologies, dear auntie.
Auntie?
You've never referred to me as auntie.
I didn't?
Old Iron Drawers was the kindest word
Yes. Iron Drawers.
I know this was a deliberate slight.
It wasn't at all,
Auntie Drawers.
I mean the Larry, what's wrong with you?
Wrong with me? There's nothing wrong at all.
You know when I walk into a room your eye always twitches.
You see there I finally managed to over come it.
I don't twitch at all now that.
There's something strange about you.
I can't quite put my finger on it.
Well, you see,
Iron Drawers, I mean auntie,
I'm not quite myself tonight.
Oh, I have noticed improvement.
( stammering ):
Yes. I, uh, um...
A drink?
Well, I can't have.
Where's the bar?
What's wrong?
My contact lens.
She knocked it out.
No. Who are you?
Head blown off.
Must have gone under the table. -Everybody's looking.
Drop your earrings so we can go after it.
My goodness. I lost my hearing. -Oh, you clumsy fool.
You've dropped your earring?
Oh, where's the table?
Left rudder, you fool.
Pss. Pss. Pss.
Puss, come on.
Give me that lens.
I'll buy you a monocle.
Would you gimme. Gimme.
Pss. Pss. Pss. Pss.
What are you?
A German spy?
There you are.
Did you find it?
Where's the other contact lens?
But wait a minute.
There's a car in the street blinking its light and I think it's a signal of some kind.
Don't worry. I'll see to it.
Go and get the lens first.
You join the others.
Yes. I will.
Oh, good heavens. The cat.
Ooh.
No.
Where have you been all this time?
I have your drink ready.
No, but I'm not thirsty actually.
Yes.
A toast?
Eh, to the king.
ALL:
To the king. God bless him.
I shall be going back there then.
Come back.
God bless him.
I've forgotten, sir.
Eh, favorite what?
Why Captain Patterson, everyone knows Sir Lawrence only smokes these.
Eh.
Binky, you always had the finest taste in cigars and women.
Another toast.
To the, uh, regiment.
No.
To the regiment.
You have to sing something.
Okay.
The regimental song,
Larry.
Don't you remember it, sir?
Of course I do.
Yes. He always leads us into it.
Come on, love.
♪ Drink a toast ♪
A toast, Larry.
To the regiment!
ALL:
To the regiment!
To the regiment.
ALL:
To the regiment!
I tell you.
I think he's marvelous.
Yes. Isn't he?
Gracious heaven.
Larry! Larry!
( woman speaking indistinctly )
Stop, Larry! Stop!
You're making a travesty of the regiment.
And of our native land.
One thing you never made fun of,
Larry, was Scotland.
Well, look at me.
What?
There's something strange going on.
WOMAN:
Do you know what I think?
I think you're not even--
Not even sober.
Larry. How can you disgrace me like this?
Night after night?
Look here old girl.
I've had about enough of this.
I'll drink how I want,
Oh!
You sober fish wife.
No, I.
How dare you do that to me!
( crowd speaking indistinctly )
Ooh, that's our Larry, all right.
One thing Scotland knows how to make and that's whiskey. and you missed me and you hit Lady Vivian.
No, I was cheating.
I could see a little.
Heh, and what was the last thing I hit you with?
( in low voice):
The cat.
Yes.
Uh, is your eye all right?
Oh, no.
No, it's quite all right.
Just like old times.
Em, do you know that song I coughed tonight?
Yes.
It, eh, it's very much like a song we used to sing in the 4h grade.
Well, that's quite possible.
Many of these old Scottish heroes were used over the years with different person.
How did it go back in the 4th grade?
I wonder
If I can remember it.
♪ When the fine mist of
Scotland ♪
♪ Is over the land ♪
♪ I am dreaming of making

Why not?
Well, it was all right before,
I don't think I should sleep in this room.
That doesn't make any sense at all.
It's not supposed to.
MacKenzie Smith here.
Oh, hello,
Colonel Somerset.
Well, that's wonderful.
Fine.
Good work. Yeah.
Well, I think they've got their man.
Tomorrow at this time, they think I'll be able to back to being
Private Ernie Williams again.
Just a minute.
Will you tell me something?
Do you want to go back to being Private Ernie Williams?
You can get used to almost anything.
Sorry. Go find a louse.
Yes. the entire show magnificently. would ever have been.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not as brave as Larry
I'd be brave enough to do what I really want to do.
And what do you really want to do?
But I'm too much of a coward to do that.
This.
ERNIE:
Who is it?
Sergeant Stanhope, sir.
An urgent message from Major Houston.
Ernie.
The eye patch.
The moustache.
Thank you, sergeant.
Hmm.
Ordered to headquarters immediately.
The car's waiting down below with the major, sir.
I'll be down directly.
Thank you, sergeant. Press on.
Well, I guess they got him. and the general's eye patch and the general's wife.
Well, for taking advantage of the situation just now.
I, uh, I guess we both had a little too much to drink.
Oh, uh, would you do me a great favor?
Of course.
Well, after the war, if you ever get to Brooklyn,
Yes?
Don't look me up.
Nobody'll ever believe it.
I say, this is silly bother, scurrying about at night like a ruddy obstetrician.
I'll wager there's no emergency at all.
Would you care to risk a fiver?
Three sheets of the wind, eh?
Aw, what you need, young man, is some, uh, tomato juice, raw egg,
Worcestershire sauce and...
Head blown off.
I say, the Major is dead.
Uh, would you stop...
The Major...
I say. Would you...
Uh, the Major is quite dead, you know.
I say. Would you stop...
Uh, look, the man...
Well, here, please.
You're out of uniform.
Uh, um...
The Major is quite...
Say something.
Say something else.
Don't attempt to escape or the Major will have company. but not quite clever enough.
You'll never get away with this.
I say, Stanhope, turn the car around.
Not tonight, General.
But if you turn the car around,
I'd promise you the usual.
I hated every minute of it.
Good show there.
NARRATOR:
I never suspected her for a moment. This is terrible.
Welcome to Berlin,
General MacKenzie Smith.
You are now the guest of the Third Reich.
Now, all we wish is a little information.
And we shall see that you are given a charming house in the country, servants, wine, frauleins.
Whatever you may wish.
And you will be able to sit out the rest of the war in complete comfort.
All we ask is that you tell us the truth.
MAN: Precisely.
You see, uh,
I'm an American soldier and my name is Private First
Class Ernie Williams, serial number, uh, 347236.
And I was supposed to go back to America because my mother is very sick.
Only she isn't very sick.
She's in Miami Beach with a bathing--
Oh! Oh!
What happened to the house in the country?
My dear General, you have a reputation for playing games.
We have not.
Unless you answer our questions honestly and quickly, we will have no alterative but to order you shot.
Oh!
MAN;
And we are waiting to hear it.
You see this eye patch?
MAN:
Oh. General.
And, uh, look at that moustache.
Oh. What ha...
Ugh. Must be the glue.
It got stuck in the sea air.
You see I haven't had it off for a few days.
Forget it . It's mine.
But you simply have to believe how it all got started.
You see, I was doing imitations for a couple of the fellas.
And uh, heh, I do imitations, you see.
Well, look. Maybe I can explain it to you better.
We survive them on the beaches.
We survive them in the villages.
We will never surrender.
Uh, I got a better one.
Oh, when the saints--
Ahem. Well, maybe this one will do it.
I got a real good one here.
We have, hmm...
ALL:
Heil Hitler!
Oh. Well, I...
Heh, nobody seems to like that one.
MAN:
General MacKenzie Smith.
Perhaps you do not understand us.
You have vital information on the timing and location of the second front.
I have?
But because of your respect for you,
I do not with to see you reduced to a shattered hulk of a man.
MAN:
Are you trying to make us believe
That's right. It was all a phony and you fellas fell for it.
You see this grey stuff they put in my hair?
It washes out with soap and water.
Look. I'll show you.
I told them it was no good.
I have to touch it up every night.
Even in the rain it comes out.
Here. I'll show you.
Maybe they used a new brand
It...
Oh, it's me.
I've turned white.
See you've done it.
Poisoning Twickenham and that shot through my head and, uh, the submarine.
Oh, if you fellas only knew what I've been through.
Oh, you do know.
Don't you?
It is only the beginning my dear, General.
Take him away.
Throw him in a cell.
Use the usual methods.
Not the usual.
MAN:
One more thing.
Our operatives in England are everywhere.
You understand?
Everywhere.
And they are led by a man so highly placed
British intelligence would never suspect.
It is not only your life that is in jeopardy.
But that of your wife.
Lady Margaret.
Heil Hitler.
You'll never get away...
NARRATOR:
The news spread through
 the German high command like wildfire.
 MacKenzie Smith had broken down
 and agreed to talk
 after being tortured continuously
 for three solid minutes.
MAN:
Good evening here, General.
Let us get this filthy business over with.
MAN:
This is a great moment for the Third Reich.
We have broken
MacKenzie Smith.
Heh, this will please the Fuehrer immensely.
I presume, gentlemen, he will go into his dance again.
Be careful, general.
May I remind you once more.
We have many operatives in England. Many of them.
The one who leads them is a very good friend of your family.
And of your wife.
It doesn't matter.
She will be safe enough.
If you talk.
Now, here, General.
We have here a most interesting map.
England, German, France.
All military objectives carefully indicated.
You shall be the professor and we will be your willing students.
The time, the location and the strength of the allied invasion.
Gentlemen, when I finish you will know as much about this blasted invasion as I do.
Perhaps even more.
Sorry. I was carried away, old chap.
Uh, bit of tear in the eye and that sort of thing.
I say, it's a bit of a blur to realize
ERNIE: Righto.
Well, a concentration of troops in Southern England actually is a ruse, you see.
Uh, we shall do the main attack in the soft underbelly of Monte Carlo, right here.
You see. I say.
Surprise, eh?
Caught you on a sticky wicket. What?
Well, you see actually, um, mm, right here is where we're going to a small attack of naval vessels.
The LCTs, the BBDs, the LSMFTs, the IRT and the CIO and the, uh, SMFR are our IUT.
What artillery? What infantry?
Who are their commanders?
What are their immediate objectives?
Okay.
Write this down over there.
I shall tell you in a minute.
You see, Captain, Brigadier
General, Father Ingrad,
( gibbering ): the Argyle Highlanders, have taken the largest one of the troops as a haven for...
And of course, there's...
Tech here, which, hmm, of course will terminate at the edge or tip.
And here, regarding the subways, they will have a remarkable incentive, and, of course, the troops are all employed and all the frontal assault which have nothing...
I suppose they...
Busy...
Than bottom, you see.
What have I done to England?
I simply can't go on.
Control yourself, General.
You are a military man as we are.
We didn't understand a word.
It doesn't matter.
Above all the signal.
Which signal do you mean?
Do not pretend, General.
Counter intelligence has told us a signal is to be broadcast over the BBC two days before D Day.
A meaningless phrase.
To the French underground to announce the date of the invasion.
I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey.
And the hour.
The hour of the attack?
You'd better be ready about half past eight.
We'll be ready.
I wish I could be there when the band starts playing.
But you won't.
If I had a gun,
I would shoot myself.
It's the only decent way left.
 Einen moment.
 Einen moment.

The German notes on this point were somewhat fragmentary.
 But bear in mind that Sigmund
Freud came from this country.
MAN:
Fraulein Lilly.
Oh!
I have to start the machine.
ERNIE ( speaking in English ):
Stop! Stop! Let me outta here.
Just in time.
Don't shoot. Oh.
( Ernie speaking indistinctly )
Sir, we've captured a German paratrooper attempting to infiltrate this headquarters.
He's demanded the right to see the commanding officer personally.
MAN:
Very well. Bring him in.
Bring in the prisoner.
Heh, Puffy!
Puffy, am I glad to see you.
All right.
I'll talk to the prisoner.
Prisoner? Puffy, don't you know me? I'm Binky.
ERNIE: I'm not really Binky.
Ernie. Yes. Private First Class
Ernie Williams.
Heh, I fooled you.
I fooled the Germans.
Heh, call Somerset.
He'll tell you.
Wilson. This seems to be a top secret matter.
I'd like to get to the bottom of this alone.
Dismissed.
Oh, Puffy, if you know what I've been through.
I've been in submarines, airplanes. I've been in Berlin.
I've even been at the Gestapo headquarters.
Know what I did?
I stole some of the papers out of the secret files naming all the agents in England.
People you would never suspect.
I've got them right here.
General Carleton Brown
Wiffingham. Sergeant, er...
General Carleton Brown...
Yes, my dear
Private Williams.
If that is who you are!
You'll never get away with this, Puffy.
Um, hello?
Open up, please, sentry.
Urgent.
I'm sorry, sir. You can't enter this headquarters.
Colonel Somerset is general staff.
He has my identification.
I'm sorry, sir.
Where's the Sergeant of the Guards?
This is a matter of life and death, Sergeant.
Open up, please.
Sorry, sir.
All entry permits have been cancelled for the day.
Orders of
General Brown Wiffingham.
We've had
General Brown Wiffingham under surveillance for weeks.
Wilson!
Hold that man.
The whole project, the Dead Pigeon.
Or I will be.
Yeah, hello?
This German paratrooper is masquerading as an allied soldier.
Under the king's rules and regulations he is guilty of espionage and subject to immediate execution.
CARLETON:
Wilson, the penalty for insubordination is still the same. Take that spy out and have him shot.
Shot? Uh...
But Puffy, you and I played
Rukka together for Scotland.
Ah, the MacKenzie Smith
Highlanders.
WILSON:
Firing squad is ready, sir.
Dismissed.
No. Not you.
Maybe she's forgotten who I am.
You will tell her, won't you?
I mean you'll tell her that
I wasn't scared at all.
I'll get word to Lady Margaret.
Cigarette?
No. No, thank you.
But I don't think one could hurt me.
Match?
That won't be necessary.
Prepare to aim!
Squad ready!
Aim!
Just a minute. I think I will have that blind fold.
WILSON:
Squad rest. Rest. Rest!
Uh, not too tight.
I get dizzy. See?
Squad ready! Aim!
MAN ( over radio ):
It is only fitting
 that Britain today should do honor
 to the valiant heroes
 who have made this day possible.
 are already familiar to you.
 General Eisenhower forthwith...
Good afternoon,
Lay Margaret.
Lovely day for England.
Huh? Thank you, madam.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you before.
Security reasons.
Anyhow we dashed down to the South Hampton staging area hoping to get there on time.
By jove, that's a pretty dress you've got on.
Never mind about the dress.
We were held up at the gate.
The firing party had raised their rifles.
I heard the command,
Yes?
Good Lord.
I'd love a cup of tea.
Oh, yes. Oh, tea.
Yes.
And what then?
Um, some milk and sugar if I may, please.
Private Williams.
Oh, yes.
Yeah. He's absolutely fine.
We only got there in the nick of time.
It was a bit of a do.
Where is he?
When can I see him?
How many lumps you put in here?
He can see you any time.
He's at the base hospital.
Not much matter with him.
Just shock and fatigue and the after effects of smoking.
( man speaking indistinctly over radio )
Wonder if you'd mind if I turned up your radio.
MAN ( over radio ):
General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie Smith.
The architect of the invasion.
 The master planner
 whom we had believed killed
 in performance of his duties,
 actually survived
 and was taken prisoner by the Nazis.
 I rejoice along with all of England
 that he was liberated in the first among...
MARGARET:
Larry.
We've just heard the news that--
Yes. I know.
Do try to control your joyous hysteria at my return from the grave, Maggie.
I know how pleased you are to see me.
Oh, sir, Lawrence, you can't even begin to realize--
Oh, come off it,
Somerset.
You were just as pleased to see me
Oh, no, please, please.
Lawrence.
Will you get out of here!
I have a few matters of a very intimate nature to discuss with my dearly beloved.
You may listen at the keyhole.
If you'll pardon me,
I'm going over to the enemy.
Heil Hitler!
I see you haven't lost your charming ways with your subordinates.
I hear you haven't either, my dear.
What's this I hear about you and that American private?
It's all true.
Oh, come now.
A penniless common soldier.
A complete nonentity.
I've had my fill of entities.
Next thing you'll be saying you're in love with the blighter.
I am in love with the blighter.
Heh.
How did you manage?
I mean, how...
Well, look, you see.
They wanted to give me a medal, but all I asked for was a smart technician from the Signal Corp with a recorder and a microphone.
That's why you heard what you did on the radio.
General Lawrence
McKenzie Smith, the architect of the invasion, the master planner.
Did you mean it?
And I had you fooled every minute.
Every minute.
NARRATOR:
For those of you who are curious
 it's just the usual.
I love the city.
I feel inside the life of it because there is always some face, some noise to interest rne.
It must be because I grew up in the country.
A farm we had.
And the house was in the middle of a field.
Trees and wind and dogs barking was the noises I heard most except for Baba laughing.
She's my friend.
We went to a convent school together and now we're here in Dublin lodging with Joanna.
Our lives vary.
Some nights we just lie in our beds and think because we're having a drink that we're getting fast.
We go out of course too.
That's what Baba calls 'real living'.
LIVELY MUSIC

Hey, you've ruined it.
There's nothing to ruin.

It was full of fleas last time.
Hey, what you doing?
I want to go in front.
It's alright, you get in the front with me next time.

Ah, 2O Sweet Afton, please.
Thanks Kate.
I have your biscuits, your Brillo and your Rice Crispies.
Will that be everything now?
Everything apart from the vegetables.
Oh, Willy will bring them around. That's the onions, the potatoes and the carrots.
You'll have him up early, will you?
- He'll be there as soon as yourself.
- What quantity? Eight ounces?
Yes, make it eight, and I hope you cut it thin this time.
The last time it only went between three of us.
Well, this ought to do ya.
You get a free cup and saucer with this new Andrews Tea.
I'd rather a decent cup of tea 'til Friday.
Bye now.

Oh, Willy can take that down.
Here, put that down to her account.

You can go on with those accounts, and get Willy to deliver the two orders.
Righty-o.

Hey, a couple of girls got dragged off to Phoenix Park last week so don't accept cigarettes from strangers. They might be doped.

But what will I do?
You'll cause a sensation, that's what you'll do.
Hey, come on!
ROCK MUSIC
So, are you dancing?
Oh I can't. I've twisted me ankle.
You want to be careful of that.
I did that one time me whole foot came up like a balloon.
I had to go down to the hospital and they kept me in for a fortnight.
Matter of fact I was expecting to meet one of the nurses here tonight but she hasn't turned up.
I wouldn't miss this dance for the world.
I come every Sunday.
I find it very relaxing after work, like, you know. I work for a television service.
You meet some terrible ones.
Now, last week I went out to Merrion.
I saw a television, I took it down.
Looked immediately, I said the oscillation transformer and the base was gone.
I told her it'd be £3.10 to have it repaired, she said that was no good.
I said 'well, leave it', but I said.
'Do you know that anytime your output circuit transformer could blow?'
- It's a very personal one...
- Excuse me.
Doped cigarettes?
SLOW VIOLIN MUSIC
- Did you make free with me?

You're not going to the dog trials, are you?
- No, indeed I'm not.
I'm taking this thoroughbred up to some track man
- who wants to train 'em backwards.
- Oh, come on.
Well, I'll be getting ten quid I hope.
- We'll have a few jars later.
- That's a bit brighter.
We'll for Pete's sake get a move on.
This yoke is not taxed.
Hurry up around the back, pull it down as hard as you can.
Don't let the dog out whatever you do.
LIVELY MUSIC
- Are we there?
- Yup. This is it.
I hope he has real money.
It will be too late to cash a cheque.

She's always doing that.
Hang on. I won't be a minute.

- How?
Well, get him interested in your bust or the scenery or something.

- Bumps in all the wrong places.
Got no bumps at all.

Thank you, Mr Counihan.
Well, goodbye, Mr Gaillard.
And thank you very much.
- Come on, get in, my lovely girl.
- What's the hurry?
There's no hurry but you get in all the same as quick as you can.
Don't take all day.
Are the doors closed at the back?
Good, that's it.
What's his name?
Erm, Eugene Gaillard.
Well, I got me money anyhow.
Not even a cup of water,
I bet he's a foreigner.
- What does he do?
- Huh? He does sweet damn all.
He wrote some book about the bloomin' savages in Africa. He lived out there I think.
Oh, come on out of this morgue.
Haven't you been here long enough?
'Tender is the Night', that's a daft title.
- Oh, tender is me feet that are killing me.
- Oh, shut up.
Well, I'm away next door to see what genuine bargains I can pick up.
I don't want to be sent to devil's island for wearing no nicks.

Very well, thank you.
You'll like that, it's melancholic.
Yes, I've read some of his before.
Well, enjoy it.
Oh, hello.
Oh, I must tell you this marvellous thing that happened to me one time when I was at Cannalli Races.
Kate wasn't there anyway. I met this man and he looked at me and he said.
'I want to propose to you', he said, and then, the next morning I came downstairs and there he was, and he said
'are you a nurse or something?
Your face looks familiar.'
- Does she always go on like this?
- Um hum.
Would you care to join us for a cup of tea?
We were just going to have one.
- Well, I have to meet a man...
- About a dog? Come on.
Alright a quick cup.
We always have a cup of tea when we are out shopping.
Makes such a change, don't you think?
- Bertie says you write about savages.
- Savages?
Well, I haven't always lived here.
I have written some books.
- Really? Are you writing a book now?
- So you're a cosmopolitan.
Homeless. No, not now. I'm doing some translations for an American publisher.
America? That's where we wanted to go.
When we were in school we wrote to Gary Cooper.
'Dear Gary Cooper, ' we said,
'we admire you and we have blue and green eyes respectively.
Please send us some money to get out of here.'
And which of you has green and which blue.
- Oh, she has blue.
- It was a convent, great gas.
How exciting. So you're convent girls.
- Did you wear a lot of holy medals?
- She's covered in them.
No, I'm not.
How long were you there?
Five years. We'd still be there now if it weren't for me.
One day in chapel I had this great idea.
I'd get Mother Superior to expel us, I thought.
So I got this holy picture and I left it in the chapel where Sister would find it and on the back
I'd written about Father Darcy's...
Well, I'd love to hear about it sometime, but I have to go.
- Already?
- I'm afraid, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Snow melts.
SOFT CLASSICAL MUSIC

- No, thank you.
SHOP DOOR BELL RINGS
Yes?
Hello.
Hello.
I hope you didn't come into Dublin specially.
Well, it's not everyday that I get asked to tea.
Baba's so sorry she can't come but she has a terrible headache.
Oh, I'm sorry. Sit down.
What do ya have? I invited you.
Well, I'd like tea and toast.
They have beans on toast.
No.
That's tea and toast for two and some cakes, please.
Buttered toast?
- Yes, please.
- Right.
Do you live all by yourself in that big house?
Not all together, I have a woman that comes in every now and again.
She tells me all the gossip and cooks me bacon and cabbage.
In an inadvertent moment I thought
I'd like to sample bacon and cabbage and I've been having it solidly ever since.
SHE LAUGHS
When I was at the convent we had cabbage a lot and one day there was a slug in mine and I wouldn't eat it.
'Eat your cabbage', the nun said to me.
'Oh, there is a fly in it, Sister', I said
'cause I didn't like to say slug and all the girls laughed and I was put to stand in the refectory.
Barbarous.
Where do your family live?
Oh, my mother's dead and my father lives down in the country.
Baba comes from the same place.
- Her father is a vet.
- And where do you work?
I'm in a grocery shop and Baba's at secretarial college, but um...
- ls that alright?
- Oh, yes. That's fine, thank you.
But what?
But I'm thinking of studying to be something else.
I know, a tubercular heroine.
Dying of love.
I was... going to ask you about the books you write, and if I could read one.
Well, a bit aseptic for your taste, I think.
I'd still like to read one.
Alright. We could meet next week.
Can we rely on Baba to have a pain in the head again?
SEAGULLS CAW.
- Was America nice?
- Nice? No.
Let's say it rather frightened me.
All those blue skies and tanned faces.
You talk of the places as if you were always alone in them.
Yes.
My mother always said
I was born to be a monk.
- It sounds very Irish.
- She was.
In her teens she ventured abroad as a tutor. My father was a Hungarian.
Was he a gypsy?
No.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- My father has a farm.
- What's he like?
Oh, I don't know, it's hard to describe people.
If I went to tell about you, what would I say?
I hate to think.
Is he reasonable?
We don't say much.
Oh, but I tell Baba everything, except about you.
I'm fated to get girls in pairs.
I suppose a lot of girls have been in love with you.
A couple.
- Were they very sophisticated?
- They thought they were.
You are a mixture of innocence and guile.
- What's guile?
That chiffon scarf.
That was a danger signal. I said to myself,
'that girl's got more than tea on her mind.'
Oh, I hadn't, honestly.
Tell me, why did you invite rne to tea?
Because you had that look of mystique on your face.
- Mystique? You better stop reading books.
- Why did you come?
Urn, imponderable questions.
Why did I shave myself, put on a tie, get my car out, drive 7O miles
- to see a girl that I hardly knew.
- To study savages, I suppose.
You're not sorry, are you?
I'm not sorry, Kate.
I don't want to get involved.
I suppose it's my puritanical caution.
You're a nice girl.
- But you're...
- I'm twice your age.
We have different upbringings, tastes, everything.
- I don't want to get involved.
- But you're not involved.
I don't intend to get married, ever.
It's not marriage that I fear.
It's passion, emotion, and need that tie people up.
When I listen to you talking, it's like reading a book.
When I look at you listening, it worries me.
You're like a lemur.
Have you ever seen one?
It's a beautiful night animal with big hungry eyes.
SOFT MUSIC
You know what lights remind me of?
They remind me of all the people in the world waiting for all the other people to come to them.
'The girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still gazing out to sea.'
- James Joyce.
I always think you're not waiting for anyone.
Maybe not.
'Why can't it always be dark, when your brown eyes whisper lies that your phenomenal heart afterwards denies.'
Young girls fill me with such sadness.
They want so much.
I want nothing.
Mrs White had a fright in the middle of the night saw a ghost eating toast halfway up a lamp post. I'm a lemur, hooray!
Hey, you're just in time. Ls my hair alright?
- Eugene is here.
I was supposed to meet him at the corner but I'm late.
Yes, he was waiting for a full half-hour.
Come in says I, delighted says he.
- Hey, you've no shoes.
- Not with this outfit.
You waggle your toes at the men, they love it. Toodeloo!
Oh, Joanna, don't put that plastic cloth over the other one and don't tell him how hard up you are.
- I not invite him? I'm not good enough, huh?
I wonder says she. Can you help me?
I have a big wash on Mondays and my husband always makes love to me on Sunday nights and I'm dog tired.
- What should I do?
- Wash on Tuesdays. Hello.
- Hello. I didn't know you'd arrived.
- Mary Mother of Sorrows.
Since when have you been showing cleavage?
It's just tea we're having.
- She's flopping about all over the place.
- Call Arthur. Tell him tea's poured.
Arthur, the tea!
He's the other lodger, I bet he's upstairs now dousing himself with hair oil.
- He fancies our Kate, you know?
- Really?
Truly, he buys her chocky biscuits and sits on them in buses and hands them to her all squashed.
Here we are.
I made a lovely pudding with lots of raisins in for your nice new friend.
My own home-made from good old Austrian recipe.
- Good evening.
- Arthur, this is my friend, Mr Gaillard.
- Hello.
- Pleased to meet you.
For my special friend.
- No, thank you. I just have tea.
- Oh, is the tea nice?
- Breathtaking.
- I must tell you that one about the day
I was having my tea in the restaurant downtown.
Christ sakes, you've just met the man.
'I don't like your cracked plate, ' said I to the waitress.
'Don't be so ignorant', says she.
That's your rasher.
BOTH MEN LAUGH.
Eug, Arthur, his da from down the country and a couple cousins took Kate and I out one evening after a football match.
And his da did the ordering.
'We'll have tea and meat for the men', says he
'and confectionery for the ladies.'
- It was the other way around.
- Oh, but you shouldn't talk so much.
You should concentrate on the flavour.
I always say, no tea party is complete without roly-poly pud.
EUGENE LAUGHS - Here you are.
I don't want any.
Yes, but you should for the nourishment.
I borrowed me cigarette holder today because that mope went and...
SHE SCREAMS.
I'll have to go and change now.
You alright?
Oh, I got a bit wet.
Well, don't worry.
I wanted you to be so impressed.

There are no innocent girls, they're all like Baba with guile in their eyes.
You're beginning to talk like me.
Where are we going?
Out.

- Yes, I wish you didn't have to go back.
What's the time?
Oh, I'm late. We must hurry.
Eugene!
Well, well, squire.
I thought I recognised the noble profile.
It's been months since I saw you.
- How are you?
- Gracing Dublin with your presence.
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine. Struggling with the muses.
How interesting.
Did you ever finish that piece you were writing about, eh...?
I haven't started it yet.
Well, you're looking very well anyway.
How's the wife?
Alright, thank you.
I've been so busy lately I haven't been able to get around to see you.
- Well, why don't you drop in...
- I'm sorry...
I really am very late, I'm sorry.
I must go.
Who is that little fawn from the bogs?
You're in holy Ireland now, you know.
You shouldn't be meddling with the infants.
Bran? Wood-85.
Hello, who do you want?
Me or Mr Gaillard?
Hello?
You're going to sit and drool over your misery.
Oh, God, you'd make a marvellous hard mourner.
- What did he say his wife's name was?
- I don't know.
Bet she's 8O and got a moustache.
I'll make inquiries.
Well, he won't get far in this outfit, that's one thing... without a bit of help.
'I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
I wish I was a child again but that I know will never be,
'til apples grow on a willow tree.'
Kaate, Kate!
It's the telephone!
LIVELY MUSIC
- Hello?
- Hello, Kate? This is Eugene.
Oh, hello.
I thought you mightn't be speaking to me, so I gave you some time to decide.
- Beckie what'?
- If you're coming to visit me tomorrow.
- Well, I don't know.
- Please yourself.
Don't come if you don't feel you ought to.
I don't know, really.
Oh, come on, make up your mind.
We'll be cut off in five more seconds.
- Alright, so I'll come.
- /'// pick you up about ten.
Alright, meet me on the corner.
Otherwise they'll all want to come.
Maybe they should.
It sounds as if we'll need jollying up.
Goodbye, love.
CHURCH BELLS RING
Hello.
You look like a child bride in that hat.
Yes, I had it on at mass?
Do you think it's suitable for the wicked day which lies ahead?
Oh, Angel of God, be at my side
to light and guard, to rule and guide.
Alright, out with it, tell me
I'm a cruel, crooked, deceitful bastard.
Sorry, Kate, I didn't want you to hear my history on the street like that.
- Will she be there?
- No, she won't be there.
- Is she dead?
- Not quite. She's living in America.
- When is she coming home?
- She's not.
Who was it that answered the phone?
Uh, it must have been Josie. You know, the one who cooks bacon and cabbage.
Oh.
You look so nice today you deserve a kiss.
Oh, I wrote something about your round face.
Not as poetic as yours, but it'll do.
'You're face may be round but your heart is quite pure and girls with pure hearts get fewer and fewer.'
Oh, it's lovely.
HE LAUGHS
Kate, get the parcels out of the back, will you?
- Is that all?
- Yes, sorry.
DOG BARKS
Our mutual friend.
- What do you call him?
- 'Kip'.
Hello.
I'll put these in the kitchen, then I'll show you around.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Josie, this is Kate Brady who's come to the country in this ridiculous pair of shoes.
How do you do, indeed.
I'll suppose you'll be wanting a dinner.
If you can manage it by six, yes.
- I hope this is booze.
- It is.
- Can you cook?
- Oh, yes.
Well, you may have to.
I indulge her tantrums on Sunday.
That's the guest room straight ahead and my bedroom is down the hall.
I don't use the others.
- Where do you work?
- When I do, in the big room downstairs.
Lovely dishes, aren't they?
Laura took most of the good stuff with her.
Prized China and things.
- Was that Mrs Gaillard?
- Yes.
She was a smasher.
She looked as well without make-up as with it.
He took a picture of her one day out in the yard without lipstick put it in a beauty competition.
Oh I miss her.
This house isn't the same at all.
- It's a nice house.
- A devil to keep clean.
Now that we don't have any more big parties
I have no interest in keeping it up.
- Kate, we're going now.
- Oh, I better be off. We're going for a walk.
He's a great one for walking.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm getting ready for a party.
HE LAUGHS
Ah, so, Josie's been regaling you with stories about the good old days, eh?
Sort of.
Do you miss Laura?
Yeah, you can miss somebody you dislike.
Why is she not coming back?
Because she's gone to Reno to get a divorce.
She doesn't want a husband, she wants a... social success, a millionaire, a father, a psychoanalyst.
'Anybody for golf?'
Was she like that when you got married?
Well, people don't really see each other until they get married.
While we are still friends, what are you thinking?
Won't we always be friends?
Not if we become lovers.
Well, then we won't... become lovers.
Alright, back to the convent with you.
I've had enough cabbage.
VIOLIN MUSIC
Tell me three things about you that will stop me inviting you to my house again.
I bite my nails, and I'm not sophisticated
- and...
- And you're jealous.
Because I've got green eyes?
What does this remind you of?
Rain.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, I like music with words.
Well, I'm off now, I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night, Josie.
- The dinner was lovely.
- Goodbye, I hope I see you again sometime.
So... as soon as the housekeeper retires, leaving the strange troubled girl alone.
- I'm not sure that I'm staying.
- Aren't you?
I'm certainly not driving you back at this time of night.
I'll get you to the shop in the morning.
Will it be alright?
Kate, you soft, daft, wanton thing.
Did you know that you are mad in one eye and therefore have no sense?
Good night.
Good night.
- It was a nice day.
- It was.

SHOP DOOR BELL RINGS
- Staying out in his house again?
- I may.
You know very well you are.
You gonna find yourself in trouble.
You're the one that used to talk about me being out late in cars.
If Joanna finds out some night you're not here, she won't half make a stink.
She won't.
She's like Eugene, she doesn't worry about the narrow conventions.
Narrow conventions?
So, he'll never marry you.
It's not marriage that ties people together.
It's emotion, need.
That's youth.
- What is?
- What you're doing.
Picking things up and dropping them again.
Hairpins, feelings, anything.
- Well it's only a stick.
- Only a stick, only a person.
Well I'm not like that.
It's the other way around.
I always stay fond of people.
The thing that maddens me is you take someone to tea and two weeks later you meet them on the street and they hardly say hello.
Well, that's different.
Everybody has their off days.
They have indigestion, hangovers.
- Well, if I like people I like them always.
- Impossible.
There is no always in human relations.
You like people but you don't always have to meet them.
I often cross the road to avoid somebody I like.
Well that's daft, would you cross the road in a year's time to avoid me?
Who knows?
I might be dead or different.
People die, change, outgrow their best friends.
Nothing's permanent.
Can I come next weekend?
I'll probably have forgotten you by then.
Where are you off to now?
Come back, come back.
Good night.
- It was a nice day.
- It was.
If Mother Superior could see you now.
I expect she can.
Should we go to bed?
SHE STAMMERS
Isn't it a bit early?
Perhaps you better take your boots off.
Try the beach hut in there.
In the convent we had to undress under our dressing gown and if it fell off, we got killed.
In this monastery we have built-in shelters.
I have no night dress.
Here.
- Whose is this?
- Mine.
Kate Brady, the girl with one mad eye, what are you doing in my bed?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Why are you shivering?
SHE STAMMERS
Just the strangeness.
We're not strangers.
I'm sorry,
I'd be like this even if we were married.
I do love you, it's not that I don't love you.
I know.
Try and go to sleep.
What's wrong? Where are you going?
- I'm just going for a stroll.
- I'll come.
No, you rest.
I often go for a walk by myself at dawn.
You're leaving me. I'm sorry Eugene.
Don't keep saying you're sorry.
You make it sound like a road accident.
Even married couples go through this.
At least 5% of them anyway.
DOG BARKS
Eugene! Eugene!
Getting ready for the next orgy?
Yes, I'm a fast woman.
Uhh...
SPEAKS FRENCH
Alright, get in.
I'm sorry. Don't be cross.
Nobody's cross.
You're different to me.
Everybody's different at half past seven on a Monday morning.
Good morning, Mr Gaillard.
DRAMATIC M USIC
I found a child's book this morning.
Whose is it?
I have a daughter.
I didn't know you had.
Yes.
- Do you miss her?
- Of course.
Everything will be better next week,
I know it will.
I meant to tell you, I have to go over to London for a week or two.
Oh...
Will you write to me?
I'll send you a postcard.
Well, I better go in.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
CAR ENGINE STARTS
Friends, romans, folk men.
I come to bury Eugene, not to praise him.
The evil that he did pines after him.
You're getting duller every day.
I know.
That's alright, thank you.
Oh, I wanted to get some tea too.
Take it yourself there, Mrs Dormand.
And what can I do for you, Pat?
- A quarter of tea, please.
- A quarter of tea.
And a turnover.
I haven't a turnover.
Will a sliced pan do ya?
Oh, yes, that's alright.
Exactly right.
Dada, what are you doing here?
You can get out from behind that counter, me girl.
We've got plans for you.
And pass me down one of those bottles.
It's my father and uncle Andy.
Never mind the fancy manners, just do what your father tells you.
Not much future in this place, and we want something stronger than that.
Not here, I'll meet you later.
We're busy.
Busy? And what do you think I'm here for?
Listen to this.
'Dear Mr Brady: It was high time you knew about your daughter and the company she keeps.
For over two months now she's having to do with a divorced man.'
To tell you the truth, Mr Brady,
I've noticed a lot of things lately.
'Signed: A friend.'
- It's not true.
- Where does this blaggard live?
- We'll disable him, that's one sure thing.
We'll burn his house down around his ears.
Who do you think you are to talk like that about someone superior?
Watch your language, me girl.
God, I hope we can all keep our tempers!
Get your coat on.
You're coming home with us.
- I'll do no such thing.
- By God you will!
- I won't!
- Get your coat when you're told!
I won't!
If your poor mother was only alive... she'd turn in her grave!
INDISTINCT SHOUTING
Clear to christ, if it isn't Jimmy Brady!
Tim!
Andy, will you look who's here.
You're looking great
Jimmy, not a day older!
This calls for a celebration.
- Stout.
- Stout.
And tell me, how is every bit of ya?
And where ya heading for?
I was up in Dublin. That little girl of mine got into hot water and I had to rescue her.
There, she is over there.
You've known her since she was a baby.
That's a fine girl Jimmy, and why shouldn't she be?
She has a decent father.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
A very natural requirement, James.
Come on inside, your auntie's waiting for ya.
Good night, Johnny, and mind yourself going home.
I said, 'Kate would die rather than do a thing like that.'
- His wife has left him.
- He's still married.
He's going to get a divorce.
Divorce?
It's worse than murder, far worse.
Are you sure there's nothing wrong with you?
No.
There isn't.
It's a good thing we got you home in time.
Oh, I'm going to bed.
I'll talk to you again in the morning.
Katie, come back here!
I know where you're going.
They're expecting me back at work.
I promised Mrs Byrne.
Don't mind Mrs Byrne.
She and I fixed up all that between us.
Look, there's lots of jobs you could be doing here.
I'll get you a job in Limerick,
I've lots of influence over there.
I must go back and get my clothes from Joanna's house.
Get ye, child.
I'm longer in the world than you are.
And I know right from wrong.
Come on and help me find the rest of the cows.
I've been brewing things over in me mind...
I just thought that if we pulled our socks up, we might have a little stall...
Katie, Katie, there's someone to see you!
Oh, there you are, Kathleen.
Hello, Father Byrne.
Ah, it's nice to have you back with us again.
I never like to see the boys and girls go away.
Draining the countryside.
- Well, tell me all about yourself then.
- Nothing much, Father.
Well, the country looks lovely at this time of year, doesn't it, hum?
You must be very happy to be back home again.
I'm just home for a while from Dublin.
For a while. I see.
Well, now, Kathleen your aunt has told me the whole shocking story about this business in Dublin.
This man is dangerous company.
He has no faith, no morals.
Now, you'll have to stop seeing him,
Kathleen and stay at home here with your father.
Father's alright.
Auntie looks after him and he has his drinking friends.
Now, that's a different matter.
A man needs a drink.
It's the climate.
You are in a state of mortal sin.
You have committed the sin of adultery.
You must got to confession now and beg God's forgiveness.
Come now, Kathleen, no more prevarication.
God is testing your love.
He has sent this man across your path to tempt you.
So that you can reaffirm your love for him.
Now you must give me your oath that you will never see this man again.
SHE SCREAMS No!
When's the next train to Dublin?
Well, you'll have to wait here for two hours and then get the local train to the junction and then maybe you'll catch the midnight train from Cork.
3O shillings, please.
Thank you.
- Baba, it was awful.
- Oh, Mary Mother of Sorrows.
Everyone kept telling me how wicked I was and they brought a priest.
I thought I'd never get away.
You better watch out.
Your old man will be right after you.
Lucky Eugene wasn't here, they would have murdered him.
He's back.
Since when? Did he call to see me?
Came over a couple of nights ago.
But he went away again when I told him the news.
- I wonder what that means.
- Well, there's one way to find out.
Here, come on, pack your belongings.
You can't go there with too many things in your fist.
He might not want me there now.
Try it. They say helpless women always appeal to men.
Not that I'd know.
- What will we do about my father?
- Oh, I'll send him a telegram.
'I'm just preg, on the way to London, drop dead, Kate.'
I wonder what'll happen.
Kate!
I'm sorry. I had to come.
- I heard all about it from Baba.
- I ran away.
I thought I'd never see you again.
Dear Kate.
Do you know, I actually missed you when I was in London.
Baba sent them a telegram telling them I've gone to London.
Well, that'll keep them quiet for a day or two.
Well, I don't know.
They'll murder me if they find me here.
- Well, we won't let them murder you.
- You don't know them.
A Jehovah witness was stabbed in 29 places with a tin opener in the village next to ours.
Nonsense.
Sit down.
If you're that nervous I should have taken you to the airport tonight.
Can't we lock all the doors?
Nonsense, you're being melodramatic.
All I want is peace and you're roaming around the room with your teeth chattering.
You'll have some peace when I've gone.
Don't feel wronged.
I'm not abandoning you to the wolves.
You can stay in London for a couple of weeks and then come back when everybody's calmed down.
I don't want to leave you.
I don't want you to leave.
You brighten up this hermitage.
I'm just being sensible.
- Alright.
- DOG BARKS.
It's only a fox.
Will you write to me?
Everyday. Big long letters.
LOUD RUMBLES
Katie!
- This is beyond endurance.
- Are you there?
I'm going to talk to him.
- Don't tell him I'm here.
- Where's my daughter?
Where's Kathleen?
Kathleen, it's your dad.
- Now, I trust I can forgive this intrusion.
Now I'm the guard who serves as the voice of moderation...
INDISTINCT SHOUTING
- A divorced man.
- This is my house and you're trespassing.
Now look, she's not in Dublin, and if she's not there, she's here.
Ah, show me your house and I'll tell ya what ya are.
- God on earth!
- Now, don't stand on ceremony.
- Come in, do.
- Now, please, let's all sit down now...
I suppose you know what class of a business it is for an old man to be getting young girls up to his house to interfere with them.
- Where is she?
- Are you a catholic?
Are you a heathen?
Produce the girl here or else we'll search the house.
Now go home and we'll discuss the whole thing tomorrow.
What the hell do you take us for?
It's our country.
And I've said all I'm going to say.
Now will you please get out of my...
INDISTINCT SHOUTING
And there's another in case you don't get out.
Come on!
These people could kill you... Savages.
Get out!
HE GRUNTS
Are you hurt?
- I'm not sure.
- You are lucky, sir, they didn't kill you.
I had more than luck, Josie, I had you.
I'll get hot water and Jeyes Fluid.
Never mind about the Jeyes Fluid, wait
'til they get a letter from my solicitor.
I think I managed alright, sir.
At least I didn't lose me head.
- It was awful.
- It was ridiculous.
I'm still here.
Haven't you been to sleep?
No.
I kept guard for the savages.
- All night?
- It's 4:30.
You moaned in your sleep.
Are you alright?
I'm a bit bruised.
- I only wanted to say something and then go.
- Like what?
Now you're awake I don't know.
- Will you drive me to the airport?
- No.
Really?
We'll stay for a day or two.
Anyway, if I'm moaning in my sleep who's going to comfort me?
Some other girl.
There aren't any girls with such a nice face and such a thrillingly awful family.
You were the one who said I had to go.
Well, it's done now. You are eternally damned and I've lost any respectability I had.
Anyway, you'd get lost over there. Wolves.
Well, I don't want to stay if you feel sorry for me.
You want an ardent proposal?
Come here.
Well, we've got the ring even if we haven't had the ceremony.
That will have to last you a long time.
How long?
- As long as you keep your girlish laughter.
Do you promise to love, honour, obey and support me 'til cheerlessness do us part?
- I will.
- Alright.
With this ring I thee bed and board for such time
- as you remain reasonable and kind.
- Amen.
- Could you look after these for me?
- Certainly.
Oh, no, that's too much all together.
- Oh, it's alright. I just got married today.
Such a young girl.
Madame.
Oh, I feel so sophisticated.
To love.
To simplicity.
- To you.
- To us.
- Forever after.
- For while we're happy.
- Can I keep the cork?
- Gathering up a past?
Well, it's a nice past.
It's lovely.
Consommé, cod, corn, caviar, cockles cookies, colcannon, corned beef, coffee, carrots, curry, cabbage.
Jesus.
Kate, have you taken my fountain pen again?
Oh, it's here.
- Somewhere.
- I wish people wouldn't keep using it.
I can't write with it anymore.
Where?
Thank you.
- Haven't you finished yet?
- I'll never be finished.
HE TALKS IN FRENCH
- It's cottage pie.
- That's what I said.
Why are you sad today?
Well, it's Sunday and I didn't go to mass.
Will you take me next Sunday?
I might if I'm up.
Hey, treachery.
I thought you said you can cook.
Oh, I can. Baba taught me.
Well, never put that much garlic in anything. Just a tiny bit at the most.
Don't you believe in God?
I do when I'm driving a car at 8O miles an hour. It varies.
I don't want to go to church by myself.
Alright, I'll take you as far as the porch.
Have a nice mass?
I forgot that you were waiting for me.
Isn't that funny?
No, it isn't funny.
In there you become a convent girl again.
Deep in it, crucifixes, bleeding hearts, hell and I'm outside reading about atomic bombs.
- How can you endure it?
- I was never a convent girl.
Oh, we are gonna have one of your emotional blubberings?
No.
It's just that it's so extraordinary.
You don't seem to be the same girl that strews hairpins all over my study floor.
- In there you revert to barbaric origins.
- Well, I like mass and God and good things.
And when I don't go,
I feel the goodness going out of rne.
- I know you hate it.
- I don't hate it.
It just perplexes me.
Here, smell this.
The flower of May for a girl of May.
It's not all of this or the New Statesman that unite two people.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink and wash all that sanctity from you you've just acquired.
SOOTHING MUSIC
- Kate? Kate!
- I'm here.
Come on, Mary and Malachi are here.
Oh, he's that awful man we met once in the street.
Oh, pay no attention to him.
Some girl laughed at his manhood once and he's never forgotten it.
Who's Mary?
Just a friend.
What will I do? Who will I say I am?
I'll say you're Kate Brady, a guest for the summer.
He's taken down all
Laura's paintings. The beast.
I heard that.
I didn't want to live with muddy canvases.
This is Kate, whom I think you've met.
Ah, briefly.
She danced away like the morning dew.
How do you do?
Mary Maguire.
- How do...?
- Hi!
Kate, would you get some tea?
Won't you sit down?
Ah, just in time.
- Allow me.
- I can manage.
Should I finish buttering these for you?
I always seem to butter bread in this stately home.
'Werther had a love for Charlotte, such as words could never utter.
Would you know how first he met her?
She was cutting bread and butter.'
Has he you baking bread with compost-grown flour?
- Josie buys the bread in the village.
- Ah.
- So you're Lord Ireland's little daughter.
I heard your family brought hatchets to bear on poor old Eugene.
Stories in Ireland always get exaggerated.
Well, it'll give Laura a good laugh when she hears about it.
Oh, what a sweet little tray cloth.
Was it a wedding gift?
I suppose you look on this as your honeymoon.
'Honeymoon, the time during which the bride believes the bridegroom's word of honour.'
Quotation: H. L. Mencken, born 1880.
Editor, critic, biographer, lexicographer.
Oh, and sadist.
You're a clever girl.
I can see you have a clever tear in your eye.
Now, I'm I a poet and I know these things.
Tell me Kate, you don't mind me calling you Kate, do you?
What do you really think about Eugene and his translations?
I'm sure they're very good.
A little insignificant, though.
That you must admit.
He says it doesn't matter what you do so long as you have a conviction about your work.
Oh, isn't that lovely.
His greatest achievement is that he talks with such solemnity.
- He's a man of conscience.
- Oh, the milk of human blindness.
You know his greatest ambition?
To write an epic that will make money on the VistaVision screen.
You know nothing about him.
He says he's filled with broken best-sellers.
Don't you fish, you're more
Harper's Bazaar than ever.
Not bazaar, bizarre.
Bizarre, schmeezarre, what does it matter, I'm pretty.
- Shall I be mother?
- Auntie, rather.
Kate, you've brought the wrong cups.
Heathcliff, you're looking quite virile all things considered.
Against all the laws of nature.
You're looking younger if such a thing is possible.
Shall we retire to the grotto?
I'm beginning to feel a little out of things in here.
Have I told you about our trip over to the west?
Where the Irish protest is much in evidence on ditches and walls.
It was marvellous.
So windy and primitive.
Good, I'm glad you got rid of your penthouse obsessions.
And this woman there had a face of a retired BrUnnhilde.
And I can tell you, there were no chinks in her armour.
THEY LAUGH
They caught a shark and we ate it.
We swam at night.
- Even the police thought it was fun.
- When they arrived.
- Well, it's just as well for you they did.
- Oh, I don't know.
Listen, next time why don't we all go up there?
You, and Malachi, and me, and... and whatever's left of the Trinity Pack?
I'll just get some hot water.
I don't think I'd relish what's left of the old Trinity Pack.
Oh, you never know what might happen when you get down there.
DRAMATIC M USIC
Eugene, thank's so much for having us, the tea was marvellous.
INDISTINCT DIALOGUE
Kate, are you in one of your emotional states?
- You'll be happy to hear they're gone.
- Oh, that must be sad for you.
What does that mean?
You seemed to enjoy their clever conversation so much.
It's not a case of whether
I enjoy it or not.
It's just a sad, old game that they play.
Anyway, it's good to have articulate friends out here.
Even friendly enemies.
You made so little of me in front of them, all that talk about Laura.
Well, it's perfectly natural, she was Laura's friend.
The same way that Baba is yours.
They went everywhere together, they came to Europe together...
And he writes to her and tells her everything, and suppose you write to her and tell her everything too.
I'd like her to have the authentic version.
Why do you write to her at all if it's all over between you?
Nothing is ever quite over, as you put it.
You mean you want to stay married to her?
That's immaterial to me but being unmarried seems to trouble your country soul.
You didn't do one thing to show them that you love rne.
What do you want me to do, sing you a Hungarian opera?
I don't know.
Kate, I honestly don't think I can do it.
I can't start from scratch on a purely simple level.
There's not enough time left in the world anymore.
I like it when it's just us.
It's not just us, unfortunately.
Then the Malachi fellow asked Eugene about me father coming and they were sneering over it.
You should have sat there as brazen as a pig puffing fags.
This morning this telegram arrived.
'Well, everyone deserves a little fun now and then.
Enjoy yourself writing. Love, Laura.'
She's a right clip.
Wasn't it lucky? He was out when it arrived.
You want to bribe that postman.
There'll be big sob stuff coming up soon.
What will I do?
- Stuff him in the boiler.
- If he leaves me I'll die.
I wouldn't like to be like that.
Fancy free, that's me.
I've got some exciting news to tell you,
I'm off to London next week.
- Oh, no.
- Yes, I'm off on Tuesday.
Hey, can you loan me 20 quid?
- Don't go.
- I want to.
I'm sick to death of this hick town and those slobs learning to be secretaries and roly-poly pud, and men with damp hands up rne thighs.
I have no one to turn too.
Look, what about the cash?
Can you manage?
It was worth it letting you dive into a life of iniquity.
His brown eyes whisper lies. Hum.
SOUNDS OF TYPEWHITER
Well, of course Mary wrote.
She said you had a little backwoods girl who's shy and thorny.
Darling, don't rush into anything.
You're wise and full of talent and I must help you.
The ticket is a gift from me to you.
I think I owe it to you to have a long talk.
And besides, you'll see Boo and me and the sunshine.
AII my love, Laura.
Oh, chapter nine of the drama.
You're opening my letters now.
Good job I did, I'd have woken up some day and found you gone.
- In what way?
- There's an air ticket for you.
- She's getting generous.
- That's no way to talk.
- She says I'm thorny.
- Well, you're not exactly benign.
You're not going to go, are you?
Are you?
I don't know, I'll have to think about it.
What about me?
One relationship doesn't cancel out another.
I have a child there, I might like to see her.
- Anyways, it's nothing to do with you.
- But it has.
If you go to them it means you don't love me.
And you're the girl who said,
'I want nothing.'
But you like me in bed and everything.
- Please.
- I don't know what I'm doing here then.
I don't know what you're doing here either.
I was just thinking I'd be better off if I'd never met you.
I liked you better before you started thinking.
You are the one who's always urging change and things.
When I met you those first few times in Dublin I thought to myself.
'Here's a simple girl, gay as a bird delighted if you could pass her a second cake.'
- I could be like that again.
- You never were like that.
It was an illusion.
Young girls are like stones, nothing really touches them.
It's not true.
I'd do anything for you.
Apparently, that's why we're having this lovely conversation.
Only I don't want you to go to them, I don't!
- I haven't said I was going.
- Well, decide now.
I have to lunch in town today, do you think we can postpone the scene?
- Can I come?
- Alright.
I'll be a while getting ready.
- I'm just going in to comb my hair.
- You do that. I'll be in the lounge.
I wonder, could you give this to
Mr Gaillard? He's in the lounge.
- Certainly.
- Tell him Miss Brady won't be joining him for lunch.
CHILDREN YELLING
Maybe you ought to go to the hotel and see him for me.
Oh, I wanted to get on with my packing.
Anyway, what would I say?
Tell him I'm here.
Suppose he says, 'That's great.'
Oh, he won't.
He wants me back, I know he does.
When I was small and lived on the farm my mother was always leaving my father.
It didn't last for long, though.
After a while he always used to go to her and ask her to come back to him.
Ah, bloomin' men.
You never know what they're up to.
What did you say in the letter?
Oh, I don't know, things... that I was going to England with you.
Why don't you?
We'll have a whale of a time.
I'm sure he wouldn't want me to leave.
Oh, alright. I'll go and see him.
God grant he is there.
I want to borrow some more money.
CLINK ON THE WINDOW
CHILDREN YELLING
- Was he there?
- Yeah, I caught him at the door.
- What did he say?
- Well, stay there, I'm coming in.
Well, I told him you were here and that you're coming to England with me and all that sort of bluff.
He didn't say anything for a long while.
But he looked awful.
Where is he now?
He's gone home.
Without me.
He said it was probably the best thing.
And he wishes he could feel young and intense and cry the way you cry.
- I'll go to him now, I'll do it...
- No, he says you'd to stay here
'til, perhaps, you've grown up a bit.
He said old men and young girls are all very well in books but not anywhere else.
SHE SOBS Don't tell me anymore.
He didn't say anything more.
Oh, Jesus! Don't go off your head or have a nervous breakdown.
He must come back to me.
You know what? Come upstairs and have a gin and lots of tonic, lucky I have some.
He'll come back.
Just give him a day or two to cool off.
INDISTINCT CHATTER
- Did you talk to him?
- There was no reply.
In two weeks you'll have forgotten all about it, don't you worry.
INDISTINCT CHATTER
Please do write to us.
SHIP HORN HONKS
God bless you.
Bye bye, bless you.
Don't forget your case, that's it.
Hey, lucky we brought the pills.
We don't want to puke up all over the damn ship.
I wonder where he is?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Bertie.
- Don't forget us.
- Bless you. Goodbye!
- Goodbye me loves.
Me two lovely girls!
Baba, do I look like a woman with a past?
Oh, no, just a right-looking eejit.
Oh, come on, let's stop moping and join this lot, come on.
IRISH FOLK MUSIC - PEOPLE CHEER
He wrote to me in London saying what a nice girl I was.
And what a pity that he hadn't been younger or I hadn't been more mature.
I haven't heard now for months so I expect he's gone back to his wife.
Once or twice I've seen someone who looks like him
and I've run to them the way I'd run to kiss him if he appeared now.
It's funny.
I remember all the things we talked about.
He said once
'We all leave one another.
We die, we change, we outgrow our best friends.'
It's true. Because I have changed.
I go to school at night.
Meet different people, different men.

The black list I made.
The Caesarean section of the map
Morning...
August 8th.
Morning.
August 8th...
Morning...
I'm still alive.
Good morning!
This is the 2nd time
I've been raped.
Were you dreaming then?
No, I wasn't.
I was just exhausted.
- I said, "Good Morning!"
- Good Morning.
What's wrong?
Do you want some water?
Let's go downstairs.
No, I like it here.
On the morning of August 8th,
I was raped again.
I bled.
Crimson blood will dry.
I...I sleep on that puddle of blood.
Sleep...live...
Hey, wake up!
Let's go!
It's morning.
The bitch's still here?
Did you fuck her?
I...
I want to die.
So kill me.
OK, I'll kill you.
Looks like he's rushing to make a deposit.
Kill me!  Kill me!
Kill me!  Kill me!
He's killing you.
But he ain't much of a killer.
See ya again.
Come on, kill me!
Make him kill you.
Won't you kill me?
I do want to die.
- Won't you do it?
- No, I won't.
Do you think you could kill yourself by jumping?
No way.
I wouldn't like   ,
I would not die.
But it probably feels bad when you're falling down before you hit.
I'm 17.
I'll jump from this floor up when I am 20
It'd take 5 seconds to fall.
One is fin
A friend jumped from here it took about 3 seconds
He didn't blink the poor guy
I guess I'll kill you...
I'm an expert, after all.
My mother was gang raped.
And then gave birth to me.
Are the tears we two shed when raped... the tears women shed?
What tears?
What sadness?
I'm not a woman.
I'm not sad...not sad at all.
I don' cry.
I'm never sad.
I...
I'm... not at all sad.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Did she do it?
Whaddya doing?
"Go, go, second-time virgin.
"The masterpiece picked by men.
"Go, go, second-time virgin.
"Take the bright road even when a detour."
Here.
Thanks.
- 竑ood?
"Go, go, second-time virgin.
"                 of love." it? second- time             virgin? , 17 year old high school girl.
Why'd you say that you liked this place?
Because I'm a second- time virgin.
I don't get it...
I like it here, too.
I guess because it's hot.
Not even the shadows will disappear.
How many others before me?
They always rape together.
I want to try it.
Why?
Do you want to die because you were raped?
No, that's not it.
Then why?
Bask in the sun until you can't sweat.
Get thirsty and drink up the sun.
Get sleepy and open your red eyes. off peeing and shitting
If you want to die... holding off death.
I'm just sleepy.
Did you enjoy being raped?
I've never done it.
Aren't you going home?
No.
Go home.
You wanna be alone?
It seems I am alone.
Wanna go?
No.
Let's go.
I won't.
I'd like to see lightning hit that  lightning rod.
But it's never struck here because it's so low.
I won't go.
Then I won't.
I won't go.
I won't.
Let's go.
I tried once but failed.
Leave me alone.
Let's go.
No.
What if I kill you?
Tell me why you want to die... and I'll kill you.
Really?
Yes.
OK, I'll tell you.
I'm just too hopelessly unhappy to live.
Even rape didn't erase the sadness.
Father committed suicide with a mistress.
Mother killed herself with I was nine.
I know that people love and kill one another.
But why did mother hang herself?
I learned that at age 12.
Mother was just sad and lonely.
She said she killed herself out of anger at Father.
You're alone?  So am I.
That's why I don't want to kill myself.
It's too painful...
Don't you start anything!
But...
It'd look like a double suicide.
I really hate lightning.
Scared?
I wrote this.
-                             sell?
- They were all returned.
"eye                 closed. when open, if open

"Eyes open, eyes open.
"A host opens repeatedly, progressing into an open eye.
"P   k woman and
Open, open your eyes again."
You can rape me.
It's really OK.
What's your name?
You can't rape without it?
Yeah.
I'm Poppo.
My name's Tsukio.
I can't do it.
Impotent?
No!
Then why?
I just cleaned myself.
That's not it. the roof, lying concrete... it's damp here.
I hate it! thought about taking on a trip
A trip?
Going away or something.
Hurry up!
This building's 7 floors, plus the roof.
I live on the 5th, so it's a 6-floor trip.
But the sixth is too high.
It'd take 4 seconds to fall.
So a three-story roof is closer.
That's why I like the roof.
That's the door to my room.
You want to be killed, right?
OK.
I...
It's OK.  They're dead.
Wonder who they are?
You wouldn't know.
Don't think I'm crazy.
I did kill them, but I didn't like it.
The bastard rented this room and did these acts everyday.
Before I killed them, they grabbed me... and did "perverted" things to me.
Those fucking pigs!
Stop it, you bastards!
Stop it!
Stop it, dammit!
Lay off me!
Stop it!
Pigs!
Get your hands off me!
Fuck off, bastards!
Pigs!
I said stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Fuck off!
Please stop it!
I didn't mean to upset you.
You can leave if you want.
When I came to,
I wanted to die.
I tried with the knife, but it didn't work.
What?
I wanna go.
It's OK to go.
You can go now.
It's nice to have a place to go back to.
You want me to kill you.
It's easy to kill if there's a reason.
I can't kill without a reason
Still want to die?
These pigs!
They were pigs to me, so I killed them.
Can you kill the guys who raped you?
No?
You killed him!
You'll miss the bus!
The bus?
My father locks the doors at 7.
Hey!
Who's that?
The chick we did.
You still here?
She must like the concrete.
You can't forget me?
We went for a walk.
Liar!
Do it!  Do it!
Let's do it!
Stop it!
She's got big tits!
Feel good?
- It hurts!
- Strip down!
Stop it! It's painful!
Don't do that!
Don't bite like that!
It hurts!
Why've they gotta be so big?
Not today, OK?
Why've your tits grown so big?
That hurts!  Stop it!
Hey, quit it!
You said you were going to throw a party.
You're having fun.
This only tires me out.
Stop it!
Do it!
She always says that!
Quit it!
That hurts!
Stop it, ouch!
The concrete bed...
Quit it!
No!
Stop it!
Stop!
Quit it!
No!
Get off!
Stop it, you bastards!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- You can't even kill me!
- I'd rather do someone big.
That's just talk.
I do want to die.
To die.
No use playing courageous.
"Go, go, second-time virgin
"Your prick, it gets protracted
"An empty flat without extension.
"Like thin soup rising,
The incest kitchenette.
"Your swollen abdomen,
"And your cycle, bicycle."
Look, she's a masochist!
Everybody!
Look at this!
It's true!
She's a pro!
Why don't you do it?
OK.
"Go, go, second-time virgin
"Riding in your hand
Like a yellow dream
"Towards the virgin spring.
To stash away...
"Dead birds below a window,
Like the ultimate thief."
What're you doing?
He's crazy!
"The nitro of love."
I loved my father... even though we had good sex.
I finally had a reason to be killed.  I messed up.
Hurry up!
It won't be opened till morning.
Fuck you!
You gonna make us accomplices?
He did it by himself!
I'll testify!
I'm scared.
- I wanna go home.
- Shut up, bitch!
When the super comes in the morning, we'll escape and no one will know! we'll escape and no one will know!
It's better than getting caught now.
Mama,  I'm taking off...

Now the park is patrolled...
My living room watched.
My policeman's coffee.
No seeing you again.
The black list I made.
The Caesarean section of the map.
Mama,  I'm taking off...
For now, in the city night.
A naked lunch, a blood filled lunch.
Slit my wrists from impotence and drugs.
Mama,  I'm taking off...
To kill them all...
To execute all about me.
Is that your song?
Yes, but I won't sing it again.
Why?
Why?  Because you heard it.
Forget it.
If you're not impotent, do it.
I...I've never done it.
Please make love to me...
Or kill me, if you want to.
I hate those punks.
I'm really the son of the superintendent
I didn't know the people in that room.
But since they were pigs...
Want a reason to kill me?
They made a plaything out of me, so I killed them.
It's easy to make up a reason.
I...I'll kill you and then take off.
I...I'll murder you.
I'll murder you.
Kill me!
I love you.
I love you.
I adore you.
You love me?
Yes.
That's got to be a lie.
You can't possibly love me.
But it's true.
Tell your lies to someone else!
Tell somebody else you love him.
I...I'm the son of this building's super.
I'm the daughter of a school janitor.
Use this if you want to leave.
I love you.
I do.
Lies!
Go away!
It's true.
I love you!
Lies! Lies! Lies!
I'm not lying.
I love you.
You're lying!
I love you even if you say that.
Isn't that a good enough reason to kill?
It's all a lie!
It's true.
Liar!
I love you!
I've never loved anyone in my life.
I couldn't even love my mother or father!
That's the way it is.
Stop it!
You'll be caught!
Shut up!
We're done for if you're caught.
Who's done for?
You killed two people and got us involved.
Involved?
Please, just stay quiet till morning. Please!
OK, I'll quiet things down.
I'll quiet you down!
I'll shut you all up!
Kill all of you!
Kill them?
NO, kill me!
If you want to go, here's the keys.
You don't want to go?
Fuck you, you impotent bastard!
Pig!
Bitch!
Die you pig!
Die you bitch!
You killed them.
Can you kill me?
Stop!
Go away!
If you don't, 
I'll kill you!
Please!
Why kill me?
It's just because I hate you.
Stop!
Police!
I only killed for real the first time.
Kill me!
If you don't,
I'll kill you.  
Stop it!
Quit it!
I'll kill you!
Do it quickly!
I'll murder you!
I'll kill you!
Kill me now!
Kill me!
I'll kill you now.

50-KILOMETER WALKING RACE
The rule in the walking race is that one foot may be lifted only after the other foot is on the ground.
Both feet may not be off the ground simultaneously.
To cover 50 kilometers in this fashion and in the rain is difficult and frustrating.

Five events in five days.
The athletes came and participated, only to leave once again.
What remains is the story of this lone athlete.
He placed 37th in the competition.
We can only surmise what he might have learned from his hard experience.
He alone swam the breaststroke on the fourth day because his shoulder was injured, so he couldn't do a crawl.
In every Olympiad, the marathon is the climax of the Games.
So it is in Tokyo as it was in ancient Greece.
The approximately
40-kilometer race will be held on this highway.
Traffic has been rerouted.
The course is empty.
But running on pavement is difficult compared to running on a prepared track.
They're ready to run this very great distance of 42. 195 kilometers.
The current best time of 2:13:55 was set by
England's Benjamin Heatley.
The best Olympic time is currently 2:15:16.2, set by Ethiopia's Abebe Bikila in Rome.
Quite a fast start.
Great athletes from all over the world, each one the best in his country.
A red uniform in the lead.
They're already spreading out.
Hedhili Ben Boubaker leading.
The trailers are 80 meters back.
Who knows what kind of a race this will turn out to be?
The athletes leave the track and exit the stadium.
Is the blanket wrapped around that concrete post to prevent injury?
It's cloudy and warm, with rather high humidity.

Applause bursts out in waves.
The most exciting closing ceremony in Olympic history!
The formal opening ceremony was beautiful indeed, but tonight all barriers of nationality and race have dropped away.
The whole mass of humanity celebrates together as one and feels sad the time must come to say good-bye.
It's just wonderful- that's all I can say.
This moment brings tears to my eyes and warms my heart, as if understanding for the first time what world peace would be like.
Sayonara! Good-bye!
Till we meet again.
Good-bye, friends!
NIGHT.
AND THE FIRE RETURNED To THE SUN.

Catch him, don't let him get away.
Hit him, hit him!
What's going on, why are you doing that?
Get out of here.
- Why are you hurting him, huh?
- We didn't do anything to him.
Oh no?
Why did you through him in the water?
Who will take care of him if something happens?
It's all Saffar's son's fault, he's always playing with kids half himself.
It's my fault? Ok then,
Guys...lets show him
- Hello chief.
- Hello.
I wonder, chief
This son of Saffar has been a trouble ever since he came back from city.
He has learned these well.
Are you going to buy milk?
Hasan's pasturing his cow
And one cow is all we have in this village.
- Hi Hassan.
- Get out of the way, hi.
Come and sit have a tea with us, Come give it a break.
Keep away, Come hold this kid.
Go away, don't stand here,
Keep away from her.
Go on, Get out of here.
- Here you are.
- Thank you chief.
Where have you been?
This poor man has been waiting for a little milk.
I took her gazing.
- Don't give her that, she will be sick
- Get away kid.
What is it Hasan?
You are so touchy today.
The damn bolouries are here again.
What? Bolouri? Where?
- For god's sake, keep away!
- I told you to get away.
I saw them on top of the hill on my way back.
How many were there?
Those three...as always.
See? Chief, I keep telling you we should do something about it, but nobody listens.
- Now what do we do?
- There is nothing we can do.
These bolouries don't believe in anything.
We have to leave it to god.
They'll get worse if we don't do anything.
They have taken three of my sheeps.
They ruined me and no one did anything about it.
And now Hassan's cow is next I suppose.
Huh?... My turn?
No... God forbid.
Let me tell you this. My blood boils when I hear their name.
I'll take my revenge no matter what.
-  What can you do?
-  I'll do something.
Right! You're scared of them like hell.
What in the world can you do to?
The boy has no manners.
Hassan, don't take your cow out.
You don’t need her to gaze all day long.
He's right.
Why do you take the pregnant cow out?
Leave her in the cowshed.
It's almost time for her.
Where to? Stay a little.
I have to take her to the cowshed.
I want to sleep early.
I must take off to work early in the morning.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Woman! Give me that lamp.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Let's make sure there is nothing to harm her.
Give it.
-I'll sleep in the cowshed tonight.
-why what's the matter?
Blories are hanging around.
Give me the lamp.
My life... my dear.
- Is it Bolour's?
- Yes.
- Did you steal it?
- Yes.
Oh God.
Why did this happen to me? Oh God.
What is it? What's wrong?
Move aside, move aside.
Get out of there.
Run Esmayil
Breath, Breath.
- Breath!
- Give her some water.
Shake her arms...
God help her.
Eat, Eat,
In the name of God.
Eslam?  Eslam?
- Is something wrong?
- Mind your own business.
Why did this happen to me?
It's terrible...I'm ruined.
- What is it?
- Tell us what happened, say something!
Hasan's cow died.
I took her some water and found her lying on the ground, with blood everywhere.
But why? She wasn't ill, was she?
No, she was fine this morning.
She was eating nonstop.
It must be the evil eye!
What evil eye?
She says blood came from her mouth.
There you have it!
God save us all from evil eye.
Eslam? Eslam? Is there something wrong?
Leave me be for god's sake.
What am I to do now? Tell me what to do.
Nothing. What could you do?
She's dead, and she'll never be back!
What should we do now, Eslam?
Poor Hasan, poor Hasan...
Maybe it was a snake.
Believe it or not, I say Bolouries did this!
- How could the bolouries have done it?
- It's clear they did this.
Any person or animal dies it’s their fault?
Yes those heathen's steal what ever they can, and kill the rest.
What good does arguing do us?
Let’s be calm and think of what we can do.
See? chief, What am I to do now?
Can you imagine how Hasan would react to finding his cow is dead?
She's right, she's right...
I know how he'd feel when he finds out.
What should we do chief?
I can’t come up with anything.
Listen!
When Hasan comes back nobody tells him his cow is dead, ok?
Don't tell him, but when he doesn’t find his cow, He'll figure it out.
Won’t he chief?
He's right, Eslam, When he doesn't find the cow he'll figure it out
Listen, nobody tells him that his cow is dead, His wife tells him that the cow....
...That the cow is dead.
- Would you let him finish?
- I'm not stopping him!
His wife will tell him that the cow ran away.
Hassan won't believe that.
He knows his cow would never ran away.
He's right, Eslam.
A pregnant cow would never run away.
You want to tell him his cow is dead? That would kill him!
His wife will tell him that his cow ran away and Esmayil went after her!
But Eslam, I'm here.
I haven't gone anywhere.
We'll just suppose you've gone after the cow, Let’s just suppose.
Thank god, It's solved
Tell me, Eslam.
What are we to do with the cow, now?
We must hide her somewhere,
So Hassan doesn't find her.
How about skinning the cow before hiding it?
No, We won’t do that.
First of all it's a sin to use the skin of a dead animal
Secondly, What if Hassan shows up and finds out?
How about using Eslam's cart and dumping it in the valley?
No people would hear and
Hassan would hear of it sooner or later
Then what can we do?
I really don't know
May god help us.
It's such a tragedy
May god help us.
Turn her around
Now...Everyone be careful not tell Hassan about this.
Hopefully no one would say anything
Even if nobody tells anything, He will.
Hey boy.
I'm talking, Listen carefully.
Don't you tell Hassan anything!
Come here, come!
Move it!
Don't Hassan his cow is dead, got it?
Right.
He won't tell anything.
He's not that stupid.
Wait a second! You'll tell Hassan that his cow is dead, wont you?
Yes.
There is an easy solution to this.
We'll tie him in the old mill until it colls down.
Yes that's right.
- Esmayil?
- Yes.
You'd better go hide so that Hassan doesn’t see you.
- Well...I'll just stay home.
- No, it's better if you come to our place.
He's right, go to Abbas's place!
Dear god and savior, help us...save us from this evil!
Sit down
Let’s go
- Hassani? Hassani?
- What?
- My brother is going to Bolour.
- So?
- It’d be good if you go along.
- Why?
Well, you know the way better than he does.
- Why does he want to go to Bolour?
- He says he wants to get even.
If you go with him you can sleep over at our place when you come back.
He won't let me spend the night.
He wouldn't know, he's a heavy sleeper.
I'd call you once he's asleep.
Why are you sitting there Abbas?
Eslam told me to stay watch till Hassan shows up.
It's late, he won't come this late.
Where are you two going?
Is this all you got?
Yes.
What about the sheep, then?
I thought you had gone after the sheep.
As hard as we looked we couldn't find them.
You and your stealing.
He's near!
Hasan is coming! Hassan is coming!
Hasan is coming! Hassan is coming!
Hasan is coming! Hassan is coming!
Hasan is coming! Hassan is coming!
Eslam, Hassan is coming!
- He's coming?
- Yes.
Don't stand here!
Get to your work everyone.
Go away, go!
Hello!
Hassan? Hassan?
Hassan? Hassan?
Go home, your wife has news for you.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Nice to see you here.
I came to see how Ms. Nasrin is doing.
That's so kind of you.
Did you give her water?
I asked if you gave the cow water!?
For god's sake, one day away from home is enough for the cow to die of thirst.
Well, Hassan, how is everything?
Eslam...
Come here.
- Is something going on?
- What do you mean?
Everybody is avoiding me!
No, there's nothing wrong,
Don’t worry!
What is it Hassan?
It’s an amulet I bought for her, to hang around her neck.
- Hang around whose neck?
- The cow, of course, see like this.
Hassan, hey Hassan, Listen to me!
Hassan? Listen, didn't your wife tell you?
Didn’t say what?
- That Esmayil went after her.
- After whom?
- After the cow, didn't she tell you?
- The cow? What cow?
She ran away.
Who?...Who ran away?
Your cow, your cow ran away!
Don't worry, it's nothing, she must be around.
Esmayil will find her and bring her back.
Hassan...
Hassan? Hassan?
Come, listen to me...Hassan.
Hassan? Esmayil is after her.
He'll find her.
Hassan? Esmayil is after her he'll find her.
It's nothing to worry about, Hassan.
My cow didn't run away, Eslam!
My cow wouldn't run away!
What a crazy situation
Every time I hear a sound
I think it might be Hassan.
He's home, he's not feeling well.
- Have they told him his cow is dead?
- Yes, he thinks it's still in the cowshed.
- That the cow is in cowshed?
- Yes.
I'd better go, then.
They told him you were gone after the cow.
So...what am I supposed to do?
Nothing...just stay here.
- He's broken loose.
- Leave him alone, let him be.
- Hello ma'am.
- Hi.
- We're here to see Hassan.
- Quiet.
What's going on?
He's up on the roof.
What's he doing up there?
He says my cow don't run away she's right here.
What should we do, Eslam?
Yes, Eslam, what can we do?
We should try to talk to him.
- Hello Hassan.
- Hello.
Eslam, why did you do that?
Why?
Chief, you ask him.
What did I ever do to him?
Why did he lie to me?
The truth is...I...
Hassan, Eslam never lied to you.
It's true, you cow did run away.
My cow wouldn't run away.
If she were to run away, where could she go?
Your cow ran away, Hassan.
Hassan, you went to the cowshed and looked for yourself this morning.
I didn't lie to you.
My cow is right here, in the cowshed.
If she's right here why don't you go to her?
Yes, just go to the cowshed then.
- Go on!
- Yes go on!
I'm here watching.
Watching what?
The Bolouries want to come and steal my cow tonight.
How do you know?
If Bolouries want to steal your cow,
Why are you sitting here? go stay near her.
No, the moon will be out any time now.
There it is.
It's rising over Bolour.
Hassan you are sitting here, what if she gets thirsty.
I'll take her water, when the moon is out.
What if the moon doesn't come out?
The moon will come out when my cow is thirsty.
Eslam, is there something wrong?
- Eslam, what's this noise?
- I don't know.
- What's going on?
- It was a Bolouri.
I saw them with my own eyes.
They went this way. There were two of them.
Let’s go, let’s go back.
We have to do something about it.
- Hello chief.
- Hello ma'am.
- How's Hassan?
- He is not well chief.
After I fell asleep he went out. He came back near dawn, soaking in blood.
What's he doing now?
He's making cow sound ever since he came back.
- What should we do Eslam?
- I don't know.
- Let’s go and see what we can do?
- Let’s go.
- Hello Hassan.
- Hello... Hi...
Hassan?
Hoy Hassan!
Yes, Esmayil is back and he brought your cow back.
Yes Esmayil is back, here he is.
Hello, uncle Hassan.
I finally found your cow.
You know where she was? She was pasturating in the valley near Khatonabad!
She's fatter than ever!
Thank god she's fine, Healthy and strong.
Is there something wrong with him, Eslam?
Let’s go in and see what we can do.
Why are you stepping back?
I'm not coming in.
- Why not?
- I can't watch this.
Are you scared? Don't be
It’s just Hassan, our good old Hassan!
Hello, Hassan.
How are you? Are you well?
Hey? Hassan? I'm talking to you!
Are you alright? Hassan?
I'm not Hassan.
Don't say that, Hassan, you are Hassan.
I'm not Hassan.
I'm his cow.
Don't say that Hassan.
You're Hassan, our old Hassan.
Yes, you're our old Hassan.
I'm not Hassan.
I'm his cow.
Don't say that.
God forbid if Bolouries find out.
They'd come and steal you!
- Yes, they'd steal you.
- They'd cut your head off!
Hassan is standing watch on the roof.
He's looking after me.
Cut it out, for god's sake.
What kind of a cow are you, anyway?
Where's you tail, where's your horn if you're a cow?
He's right!
What do you have to say to that?
Ok, stop! Calm down!
Ok, alright, just calm down.
Ok, ok Hassan, calm down, calm down.
Oh god, what should we do?
Get it in his head, somehow!
Listen to me.
Yesterday, your wife came to us in panic and said that your cow was dead.
We threw your cow in the old well.
- Isn't that right, Chief?
- No, it's all true!
If you really were Hassan's cow, you would have been in the well right now!
And if you're not, then you're Hassan himself
Yes, I swear to god!
I swear you are Hassan!
You tell him, is this Hassan or cow?
Of course it's Hassan.
It's our old Hassan...
If you don't believe us, just go look in the old well yourself.
Hassan...
Hassan? The Bolouries are here!
They want to steal me!
They want to through me into the old well!
They want to cut my head!
Hassan!
Come save your cow!
Come save your cow!
We're not Bolouri, we are not...
I'm Eslam, he's the chief.
That's Saffar's son, and this is Abbas.
We're all from this village, friend.
We're not Bolouri...let’s go...
Do you want to get you anything?
Water...water.
Come in.
- I want to go home.
- But I made lunch.
Here.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.
I don't know how he will end up
- Why aren't you eating?
- I don't feel hungry.
- Do you want tea?
- No I have to go.
Where to?
I want to go see how everything goes.
Will you be back?
No, I'll go home.
By the way...I told my sister.
About what?
Everything.
After everything is back to normal, she'll be here to ask for your hand on my behalf.
Which way is it?
Do you know his house?
- Who are they?
- The Bolouries.
- What's going on?
- The Bolouries are here.
I'll fix them.
My sheep...my sheep!
- Why are you shouting?
- They took my sheep!
It's right here!
- You stand watch we'll go in.
- Ok.
- What happened?
- It wasn't his cow, he was there himself!
Get them!
What happened?
What's going on?
- It's nothing, Bolouris had come to steal Hassan!
- What?
- How is Hassan?
- He hasn't touched his food.
Hassan...
- Hello.
- Hello.
Here.
Thank you.
So...Eslam, how is everything?
He ate everything there was in the cowshed, last night, he ate hey!
How can his stomach take it?
I really don't understand.
I can only wonder!
It sure amazes me!
I don't know how he will end up.
He's getting worse everyday
He has wounds and scars all over his body now.
Eslam, you know better than any of us,
Think of a solution.
I think...
How about taking him to the city?
What for?
We can take him to the hospital they might be able to help him.
You mean they can convince him that he's not a cow?
I don't know.
But they might be able to do something.
What if the hospital doesn't take him?
- Why wouldn't they take him?
- What if they don't?
If Eslam is suggesting it,
It must be a good idea.
Who's going to take him, anyway?
Me, you and Jabbar.
I can't come.
I can't leave my sister by herself.
Alright then, I'll go with them,
Is that alright?
Ok that's fine.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Have you told his wife?
Yes. She's going to stay at our house,
So my sister won't be alone.
That's better, You can't leave a young woman all alone in the house.
We're here to take Hassan.
Hassan...
Get up, get ready to go.
Come on, Get up.
There you go...Good!
Let's go, Hassan go on.
Hassan? Let's go, get going.
Get moving...
Come here...Get the rope.
Tie him.
Calm down, Easy!
Abbas, tie him.
We can't take him with the cart.
We must drag him to the road...
Pull him.
Eslam? Eslam?
Eslam...
Bolouries..
- Let's gove faster.
- Let's go.
Come on....pull!
Come on guys...Pull!
Come on, come.
Hold on the rope chief and pull hard.
Move it, animal!
Eslam!
Eslam...Catch him!
Hey Eslam? Eslam?
Didn't you go to town with the others?
I did.
Then, Why are you back?
I came to take my cart.
What did you do with Hassan?
Hassan? I'm going to bring him.
So you are not taking him to the city anymore?
The End.
What is life?
It is the beginning of death.
What is death?
It is the end of life.
What is existence?
It is the continuity of blood.
What is blood?
It is the reason to exist!
AT MIDNIGHT I'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL
I wish you a terrible evening, my brave little friends.
Remember these words:
Those of you who have been watching a funeral, and seen the pale face of a corpse.
Those of you who don't believe in wandering ghosts when you leave this theatre... and have to walk in the dark streets... alone...
There is still time.
Don't watch this movie!
Go home!
Too late.
You've not believed.
You want to show a courage that doesn't exist?
Then, stay!
Suffer!
Watch...
"At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul!"
Oh, Carlos, why did you leave me? Why?
Be brave, Mrs. Joana.
My condolences, Mrs. Joana.
You can be sure that I provided the best of my services.
Excuse me...
Bring my lunch, Lenita.
Coming, Zé.
That funeral made me hungry...
I'm thinking of doubling my fee to follow the burial.
I'm sick and tired of all that crying.
It's your job, Zé. You should take care of your clients.
Look, I'm tired of all these people
Hey, where's the meat?
Not today. Did you forget that today is Holy Friday?
What do I care if it's Holy or Evil Friday?
I'll get what I want and no religious fanatic will stop me.
I'll eat meat today, even if it's human flesh!
Watch out, Zé!
The devil may be tempting you!
If I meet him,
I'll invite him for dinner.
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
What do you want?
Terezinha insisted on visiting
Lenita and invite her to the procession.
I think it is no use... But...
I will talk to her.
As you wish.
- Where are you going, Zé?
Well... I want to buy a lamb.
Save for Easter?
No, to eat today!
I'll go downstairs a little, Lenita.
I know who you saw!
It's that little woman.
You think I didn't notice the way you looked at her this afternoon?
You know that I hate melodramatics!
I'm not a woman to be treated this way, Zé!
And stop bothering that girl.
At least have some respect to your friendship with Antônio.
You have talked enough.
Antônio will be there soon.
I don't want to stay there too long.
Good evening.
Good evening.
- Good evening
Where are you going?
I'm taking Terezinha to Clemencia and Antônio will pick her up later.
What a coincidence!
I'm going there too.
Don't worry. I'll take her.
Antônio may not like that, Sr. Zé.
Well... Antônio is my best friend, right?
So it seems.
You decide, Terezinha.
Well, if you have another appointment...
Ah, but he does.
Don't you, Aristides?
You have a very important appointment.
Isn't truth?
Yes. Now I remembered.
I do have an appointment, yes.
I'll appreciate if you could take her.
Good night, Terezinha.
Good night.
- Good night.
Thanks for allowing me to walk with you.
I don't see a reason to thank me.
Will Antônio take long to pick you up?
Not, he said that he would come soon.
Lucky man.
You know that I suffer with
Antônio's luck having you as his fiancée?
I think you're exaggerating.
I think I'm a happy woman for having the love of Antônio.
Eitheryou are silly, or want to play with me.
You know you aren't the woman forAntônio.
You are the woman for me!
Take your hands off me, Zé!
You're hurting me!
I want to see if your lips are so defiant as your words!
You have the fangs of a snake... and the face of an angel.
Antônio wouldn't know about this.
But I ask you for not let thisscene happen again
Very well, I'll go with you.
Thanks.
I'd rather go alone.
Bring some wine, Maria.
Ranulfo.
Yes, Mr. Zé!
Go to my house and ask Lenita to send me the lamb.
I'll be back soon.
It looks like a good game.
Very good.
There's room for one more?
Thanks! You're very kind.
Maria, more wine.
That man scares me, Mr. Francisco!
Don't let him see it, or things gonna be worse.
I pass.
I double.
The bet are too high for me, too.
Looks like... just you and me.
Will you go on?
I double.
Brave man.
A real man got to be like this:
All... or nothing.
I pay a thousand to see your cards.
But, I-I... d-don't have any more money.
No? Then show me your cards.
It's... three kings.
Bad luck, my friend.
- Four aces.
- It is not possible!
Let go of the money, man!
I can't. I need the money!
Let go of the money!
My hand, my hand...
As I said: I like brave men!
Call the doctor.
I'll pay for the bill.
To.
Ah, you're my witnesses:
It was an accident.
Here's the meat, Mr. Zé.
Excellent, just in time.
Ascene like that can make everyone hunger, right?
You, Bonifácio. You look hungry.
Have a piece of this lamb.
No, thanks, I don't want it.
Come here, boy!
Have a bite... It's very good.
- Today is a holy day, Mr. Zé.
I can't eat meat. - Eat it!
Please...
Eat it!
Ah, the doctor is here!
What's happening here?
An unfortunate accident, doctor.
The victim is Zerequiel.
Take good care of him and I'll pay all the bills.
Your kindness knows no bounds, Zé.
Thank you.
More wine, Maria!
Better take him to the hospital.
Very well.
You act as if you're afraid of me.
No, Mr. Zé.
I have othercustomers to take care.
Leave them to Chico, heh?
Tonight you work only for me, what do you think?
What does he want with my niece?
Is no one here brave enough to face this man?
- Then why don't you?
- That's what I'll do!
Zé, leave the girl alone!
And who's going to make me leave her?
I am, you emissary ofSatan!
Stop, Zé, stop!
You're going to kill the poor man!
Have mercy, Zé! Mercy...
I have enough work with those who die of natural causes.
You can be sure:
I'll charge double to bury anyone I kill!
- Let's go home, Zé.
- Let's go.
Oh, I'm going to the crossroads by the graveyard...
Anyone wants to follow me?
I was passing by with Terezinha when I heard the screams.
What happened, Antônio?
- It's all right now.
- Thank goodness.
By the way, Antônio, let's take a raincheck on that fishing.
It's up to you.
I'm going to take Terezinha home.
Want to come along?
But, Antônio, he has to go home.
Lenita is all alone.
Awoman who can't bear a child needs no care.
We'll talk tomorrow, Antônio.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Terezinha rejects me because the existence of Lenita.
Is life worth living if there's no son to continue the bloodline?
What's one mistress among so many women?
Lenita has to die...
Lenita has to die...
I'm so sorry about what happened.
Will you forgive me?
Tell me you aren't angry with me...
It's all right, Lenita.
You make me so happy!
I can't help but feeljealous.
I want to make you happy, my love!
Your wish will be fulfilled.
You're going to make me very happy.
This will be a very amusing show!
Awoman must belong to only one man.
Since you're of no use to me,
I'll do you a favor and spare you of the sin of needing another man.
Is your life worth living if you can't bear a child... to continue your bloodline?
You wouldn't be an obstacle to the only truth of the existence.
Terezinha will be mine... and from her womb my lineage will continue.
I'll have the honor of seeing you die before my eyes.
Pity... You seemed so unique
Now there you are, in the painful affliction of death!
You suffer, because you can't scream!
Lenita, now you leave me and become the death's mistress.
It was a great show! Thank you!
Let's make sure the doctor takes good care of you.
There's nothing more to do.
She was bitten by a spider.
Poor girl. It must have been so painful.
I'll file the report for the police officer.
Very well, doctor.
I'll take care of the rest.
Well, goodbye.
I want to go home, I want to go home...
- Be quiet, boy, or I'll beat you!
Quiet!
- Ah, you...
- I want to go...
Don't abuse your child!
He's the continuity of your blood.
A real man doesn't cry.
Take your son... but don't hurt him.
It's been fifteen days since Lenita died.
I miss hervery much.
Of course you do.
Lenita loved you very much, and I know that you loved her too.
Yes. One day everything comes to an end.
We are born... and then die.
That's life.
We have got to accept that.
Ah... What ifwe go fishing tomorrow?
Okay.
Oh, Zé, one more thing.
- What?
- Do you want to visit the gypsy with us?
Do what?
Terezinha insisted.
She wants to know her future.
You know, women about to get married...
- And you, do you want to go?
- Well, we always have some doubt, right?
I'll go.
It'll be fun to see two superstitious under the spell of a witch.
- Good evening!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Come in, my children!
Make yourselves at home.
Have a seat.
- I'd like to know...
- Say no more!
Look into my eyes, and I'll tell you your future.
Beware, my child! Beware
Happiness is yours.
But don't forget who you love, and everything will be right.
Otherwise there will be death... misfortune...
Read my future now.
Who knows, it may be a little better
Your lifeline ends right here!
Don't think of your earthly life, and everything will go well.
Fulfill your soul.
Don't allow the earth to receive your body in broad daylight.
Your salvation demands that you be buried at midnight!
Stop that nonsense, you old witch!
Forgive me, but I can't stand this foolishness.
In your eyes I see your fate.
You'll pay for your sins, and when the time comes, you'll suffer the horrors of hell!
You go to hell!
Let's go home, Terezinha.
How much?
You don't have to pay me.
The laws of the supernatural forbid me to accept money when death is foretold.
Go, my children. Beware.
Well, Terezinha, let's forget that gypsy woman and think about what to do tomorrow.
I know. The hard work will be all mine.
You'll have a good night's sleep, and want me to wake you up, right?
So, it's all set? Let's go, Antônio.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Good night.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I feel restless.
A good bath will cure that.
- Come over, and have a drink with me.
- Very well.
Try this wine, Zé.
I think you'll like it.
Drinking is the best way to ward off the evil spirits.
As if you believed in such things...
If I believe it or not, in fact
I must agree with the believers.
Frankly, I don't understand you, Zé.
Where does all your disbelief came from?
It's like a rebellion. Against what?
You have a lot to learn, Antônio.
I can't disbelieve, when I never had any belief.
To believe in what? In a symbol?
In an non-existent force created by ignorance?
Yes, I'm a rebel... against fools like you, who fear what you don't see, and become slaves to that which really exists: Life!!
I don't know why I should fear life.
Because it's life that makes your flesh throb.
Life feeds your feelings, and if you aren't strong... not to fight it, you'll be dominated, and will suffer.
Take a look at your people
Why do they fear me?
Because I use black clothes?
Because I believe in myself?
Because I laugh at their beliefs?
No. Because I'm stronger than then, and I have brain... enough to dominate whoever that it is.
They're weak, because they're enslaved by what they don't know.
I'm free.
Therefore, I'm stronger.
You may have your reasons, but I'm happy the way I am.
I love Terezinha and I know she loves me.
I don't have any innerconflict.
I want only to marry her, and I know that will happen soon.
We like the same things.
I feel good believing in God.
I can't be a rebel against everyone.
You know, Terezinha is like an angel.
We're going to remodel this house... and live here together for the rest of our lives.
That is my biggest desire.
What was all that faith good for?
I'm stronger than you!
Antônio! Antônio!
Antônio? Antô...
I don't know, Barretos.
It was quite a shock to me.
Believe me, I would give my own life for Antônio's.
Don't think that I'm accusing you.
But you were the last person to see him alive, so you must remain a suspect until we have an autopsy
Excuse me...
Commissioner, the doctor needs you.
Excuse me.
I must go to the morgue.
I'm going to my funerary, and later I'll meet you there.
Very well.
"In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit".
Antônio! Antônio!
Antônio!
Murderer!
Damn you! Murderer!
Calm down... Take her outside.
You killed Antônio! Murderer!
Try to calm her down.
Close the casket.
So soon we won't forget
Antônio's funeral.
They say he was buried at midnight to save his soul.
He must have something wrong with him, because he was Zé's friend.
We should run that man out of town!
He's got an eye forTerezinha...
And the girl is at home all alone.
Her father went to the city to see his wife at the hospital.
Look who's here.
Maria, bring me a bottle ofwine.
Hey, did you change your name to Maria?
Leave the bottle there; put there, old man! Leave it!
I asked her to serve me.
I'm waiting, girl.
Come here.
How much for the bird?
But, it's not for sale.
What's the price?
Well, I don't know. I don't know.
Is two thousand enough?
Great... great!
I'll take the bird.
We'll talk some other day.
What now?
You never seen a little bird?
Or shall I take the measurements for your coffins?
Oh, what do you want here so late?
Don't be afraid. I brought you a present.
Thank you. Good night.
Hold on, girl. Show some manners.
Please, Zé. What will the neighbors think?
Don't worry.
They will not think anything.
This people don't have the guts to go out in the streets at this hour.
What are you going to do with the bird?
Throw it away.
You don't want to accept my present.
Oh, no! Poor thing!
He must be hungry, poor one.
I knew you had a kind heart.
Please, you're hurting me!
- You...
- Have mercy...
- You wouldn't treat Antônio like that.
- Go away!
Don't talk about Antônio. Go away!
After all I did to rid you of that fool, you tell me to go away?
Don't touch me!
Respect me, Zé.
- You ain't easy. But I like the hard way.
- No! No!
I want you to be mine.
And I always get what I want.
No! Help!
No! No!
Snake from hell.
You'll be very quiet.
Help!
No! No!
Help! Help!
No! No!
Mercy!
That's right, this is the way I like it.
You'll give me the son I want.
You've ruined me, Zé.
I can't go on living.
I'm going to kill myself.
It's always like that...
All women say the same thing.
Later they regret it.
Life is good, it's not worth trading for death.
I'll be back some other time, Terezinha.
I'll kill myself, Zé, but I promise you'll not have any peace
You killed Antônio and he was buried at midnight.
And at midnight, Zé, you'll know fear, because I'll come to take your soul!
Whereveryou take me, if there are women like you,
I'll be happy to go!
Excuse me...
Today is my lucky day.
The devil himself is here, right?
Spirits!
Spirits!
Do you hear me?
Which of you is going to take my soul?
Behold... I'm waiting!
Arise! Out of your graves... and take me straight to hell!
Can't you hear me?
Can't you hear me?
Take me straight to hell!
Antônio!
I possessed Terezinha.
What will you do to me?
Nothing!
Because you no longer exist!
You're dead!
Dead!
Your hour is coming.
Your end is near.
You'll feel the burden of your sins.
Shut up, old witch.
I'll make your coffin.
Scom the living!
Mock the dead!
You'll live the horrors from hell!
With these few lines, I ask my parents for forgiveness, for my condemnable act.
There's nobody to blame in this tragedy,
I couldn't support the weight on my shoulders.
If must have a sentence for the reason of my death,
I'll be the judge, and wherever
I may be, justice will be fulfilled. Terezinha
How can we charge him, if she left a note explaining why she did it?
There's something strange here.
I can't figure why she didn't put the blame on Zé do Caixão
Idiot!
She had the courage to kill herself.
Strange... she didn't blame me.
Let his soul rest in peace.
Her father insisted she be buried next to Antônio.
Through this letter,
I came to the autorities... to request urgent autorization... to proceed a new autopsy on Antônio's corpse.
Thinking about the last events occurred in this city,
I came to believe that we are dealing with... homi...
Good evening, doctor
Did I frighten you?
Hmm... savior of mankind!
But the people doesn't care for that.
The report is only a formality.
Sorry I'm so curious to read your work, but...
As they say, eyes are made for seeing.
What are you trying to do, Zé?
Nothing.
Just making sure your eyes don't see what they shouldn't
Sorry, doctor.
You make me so happy!
I can't help but feeljealous.
I want so much to make you happy!
We're going to remodel this house and live here together for the rest of our lives.
At midnight, Zé, you'll know fear, because I'll come to take your soul!
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- I want to make you happy!
Together, for the rest of our lives.
I'll come to take your soul!
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy!
I'll come to take your soul!
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy
For the rest of our lives.
I'll come to take your soul!
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy!
Lenita!
Antônio!
Rodolfo!
You're all dead.
I did it foryou, Terezinha.
You've forsaken me.
You didn't give me a son.
You've doomed my bloodline to extinction.
I want a son!
Damn you! Curse your faith!
Terezinha!
Come out of nowhere... and punish the crime of my passion!
Torture my flesh!
Take my soul!
Why don't you come?
You're a ghost from the past.
Yet, I feel the blood boiling in my veins.
I'm alive!
Alive, understood?
You are dead!
Rotted!
Eaten by worms!
HEAVEN!
HELL!
REINCARNATION!
The power offaith!
Symbol of ignorance!
Where are you, Satan?
Lies! Lies!
May the earth crack open!
May the skies be torn!
I want the end of the world!
I challenge your power!
I deny your existence!
Nothing exists. Only life
Nothing's stronger than my disbelief
Destroy me! I have no faith.
I want the proof of the punishment!
Lies!
What an unfortunate accident.
Asad loss for our town.
Such is life. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Evidence! Evidence, my friends.
Well, it's nine o'clock.
Today is Day of the Dead.
Time to go home.
Yes. The night is pitch black.
I should be going, too.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow
What's the hurry, fellas?
Today is the Day of the Dead.
We shouldn't be out.
To believe such ridiculous nonsense.
It's not nonsense, Mr. Zé.
Last year Gumercindo scoffed, and had the punishment.
He saw the wandering ghosts.
It's true, Mr. Zé.
You shouldn't make fun tonight.
Oryou'll may watch the Procession of the Dead
Procession of the Dead...
It's a bedtime story forchildren.
Everyone has a right to their own beliefs.
Okay then, you win!
No more talk of that.
Now you won't go home.
Stay and have a drink with me, right?
Anyone turning me down?
Not at all, Mr. Zé.
I like men with strong opinions.
Chico, drinks for everyone.
Don't you want a drink, fellas?
Come, have a drink! Drink!
Maria.
Here's a small gift for being so kind to me.
No, Mr. Zé, I can't accept it.
Look, my uncle is coming.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'm here to pick you up, Maria.
It's very late.
I was just about to leave, if Bonifácio can follow me.
Were you paid today?
No, uncle, Mr. Zé gave it to me as a gift.
Take your money back!
My niece will take no gift from you.
I gave her the money, and I want her to have it.
If you'll not take it back, it stays right here.
Let's go, Maria.
Old man.
Pick up that money!
Pick up that money! NOW!
Enough! This man has pushed us around for too long!
Time to settle it for good!
I'll not pick up that money!
I'll not pick up that money!
What will you do to me now?
What will you do to me now,
Zé do Caixão?
What will you do to me now?
What will you do to me now?
I'll not pick up that money, do you undertand, Zé do Caixão?
I'll not pick up that money!
Uncle, uncle...
Pick up that money!
I'm going to count to three...
One...
Two...
THREE!
Give it to your niece.
Good evening, gentlemen.
It's all closed in this town.
This is the only place I found open.
There was nowhere
I could go for information.
How can we help you, ma'am?
I'd like to know where the Queiroz family's house is.
I'm here to visit her, but there was no one to pick me up at the station, because I missed the afternoon train.
But, lady, Mrs. Matilde lives far from here...
Her house is beyond the cemetery.
But could anyone of you take me there?
Not tonight, you'll not find anyone.
I'm willing to pay.
No money in the world would be enough.
Today is Day of the Dead, and no one goes out at this hour.
What am I going to do?
I don't know anyone in town and, for what I saw, there are no hotels.
Don't worry.
If you'll allow me,
I'd be honored to escort you.
I'm at your service.
I appreciate it, gentleman.
I don't know how could I thank you.
My reward is to walk with such a beautiful lady.
You are very kind.
You could stay at my place tonight and I'll take you tomorrow.
Thanks. But I'd rather go tonight.
Any other question, gentlemen?
If any of you think yourselves brave enough
I'll gladly step aside.
Let's go?
Ah, by the way...
If I meet a corpse along the way,
I'll send him your regards!
I noticed that the people here are very superstitious.
They try to cover their fear, they're all a bunch of cowards
- Aren't you afraid?
- Of spirits from beyond?
I may fearsome of the living, but I can protect myselffrom them.
Well, you'll have to admit that the night is really cold and dark
A night like any other.
How many births and deaths are happening this very night?
You're right;
I don't believe in this nonsense, either...
Don't be frightened. It's the old witch!
Beware!
Beware of the DEAD!
Go to hell, sorceress!
When you hear the wind blowing over the trees, it'll not be the wind... but the wandering ghosts.
Don't wait until midnight.
When you see a black cat in your path, it'll be the Devil.
When you hear footsteps and there's no one behind you, it'll be the damnation of your soul.
When you hear the death call of the owl, it'll be the harbinger of your end.
Don't wait until midnight.
When you see light in your path, it'll be the candles of the Procession of the Dead.
RUN AWAY!
Because they'll come for your soul!
My God, what a horrible laughter!
I'll take care of you on my way back, witch!
Let's go, my dear.
Well, here we are, and now I bid you farewell.
But why? Would you like come in?
Thank you.
I don't get along with your aunt, and I'd rather not be seen by her.
Well, I hope to see you again before I go.
Don't worry. I'll make sure of that.
My name is Marta Queiroz.
I am Zé... to my friends.
Hmm, looks like someone is coming.
I should go.
- So long, Marta.
- Good night, Zé.
She's pretty.
If I play right, she won't escape me.
When you hear the wind blowing over the trees, it'll not be the wind... but the wandering ghosts.
When you see a black cat in your path, it'll be the Devil.
Don't wait until midnight.
Who's following me?
Who wants to play with me?
Look out! Look out! I'll shoot!
When you hear footsteps and there's no one behind you, it'll be the damnation of your soul.
Don't wait until midnight.
I must be impressionable tonight.
It was only an owl.
When you hear the death call of the owl, it'll be the harbinger of your end.
Don't wait until midnight.
A light?
I'm safe! I'm safe!
It'll be the candles of the Procession of the Dead.
No, no... it can't be real!
It must be an hallucination!
No, no... no!
Lies!
No, no...
They are dead! DEAD!
I know it... I KNOW IT!
No... I must see them.
I must see them!
I must see them.
No... I don't believe it!
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
Lies! Lies! Lies!
There was a terrible noise.
I was too frightened to go alone.
Something must have happened here.
THE END
Look at your mask working.
Now I want to read you something I wrote:
"Isolation in a chamber where external communication is impossible because the atmosphere is deadly, in a chamber where it is necessary to wear a mask to survive, is very reminiscent of the living conditions of modern man."
I don't want to design more of these
"...one can't reflect on this mythical one dimensional man without, unfortunately, analyzing all the characteristics of our industrial society.
But an effective metaphor could be very attractive, clarifying extreme consequences which are not explicitly mentioned;
Which remain implicit."
"For example, doesn't the fact of being forced to wear a mask create a sense of anguish?
The introjection of these obsessive, hallucinatory needs does not produce an adaption to reality, but mimesis, standardization:
The cancellation of individuality.
The individual transfers the outside world inside.
There is an immediate identification of individuals in society as a single entity.
The needs of physical survival are met by industrial production, which now proposes as very necessary, the need to relax, to enjoy oneself, to behave and consume according to advertising models, which precisely illustrate the desires everyone can experience.
The cinema, radio, television, press, advertising and any other good service of industrial production, is no longer directed towards different destinations."
No, this sentence isn't clear.
"The cinema, the radio..."
Excuse me.
I already saw them, they're very entertaining
I'll look at them tonight.
In these conditions of uniformity, the old alienation becomes impossible when individuals identify with an imposed life-style and experience self gratification and satisfaction, anyone subject to alienation gets swallowed up by his existence.
They're notes.

- Do you wear a miniskirt?
- Not miniskirts, short skirts

- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Pass me the celery, please.
Thank you
I'm so thirsty!
I'll hang on to the bottle,
I ate stockfish
- 'night.
- Good night.
What are you looking for?
A nail file.
Why don't you come to bed?
Bring me the sleeping pills, please.
Give me two.
I want to sleep.
Glass of water and a hot water bottle, please.
Good night.
Kiss.
You're the best looking.
Just a moment.
Sabina, do you have a nail file?
It's over there.
Thanks.
Yes?
Who?
Just a moment.
Sabina.
Telephone.
At this time of night?
I'm coming.
Sorry.
Yes?
Fatally.
I can't talk now.
Fatally
...his legend lives on in everyone's hearts.
Coppi, "The National Fausto"
There was no ascent that could tire him,
nor steep descent that could unnerve him,
and he never came second.
Fatally?
Fatally.
Fatally full stop.
Bye.
- At this time of night...
- Take this away.
Oh, excuse me.
Go away! Go away!
Don't film me while I'm playing!
Don't get mad, calm down.
You don't understand anything!
Cut it out with that damned machine!
You're a monster, that's what you are!
You don't understand anything and never have!
You can't get into my brain with the zoom!
Leave me alone, I hate you!
Go away!
Anita?
Anita?
Where do you want to go?
Who is it?
The Virgin as a baby.
Make room for me.
Why do you find me sexy?
The bed's small.
Listen.
Do you like honey?
- What?
- Honey, to eat.
Get it, it's in the wardrobe.
Are you scared war will break out?
Come on, come here.
Please, I'm very tired.
Don't tickle me.
Courageous, strong Ermette, who left the paternal fields
to make the sea your home, we will miss you.
And above all, you were a good boy.
Rest in peace, amen.
Throw him the sea.
- Who's dead?
- The cook.
Let's go, guys.
- Excuse me.
- The ceremony is over, let's go.
- I'd like to ask you something.
- I don't know, I'm the botswain.
- Don't you need a cook now?
- Of course.
I'm an excellent cook.
Ah, this air!
The sea is my ideal.
- I'd like to sail.
- It's not up to me.
The captain commands, but the young lady's the boss.
The young lady?
Why don't we ask her?
Look, she's going away.
Why don't we ask her?
Try me out.
My cooking's very healthy.
- You'd be healthy too.
- I don't doubt it.
OK, let's try, but with no obligations.
I'll accompany you.
Excuse me, miss.
He says he's a cook.
Shall we try him out?
Have him make a chocolate mousse.
Thanks. Thank you very much.
Come on, let's go to the kitchen.
- I was lucky.
- You can see she likes you.
- Where's this boat going to?
- Tahiti.
Seems impossible...

Togawa?
Get inside.
How do you like being out of prison?
I can't complain.
I had two more years to go.
You must have pulled some strings.
- Don't thank me.
The boss didn't want to see a useful man like yourself rotting away in prison.
I felt the same way.
Relax. Let's talk.
I was a man of influence back in the old days.
But look at me now.
Just killing time in this dump.
I don't want to retire this way.
I see.
I've got a plan that will benefit us both.
Let's work together.
You've heard of me, right?
Sure.
Tell me.
What do you know?
You were once an excellent lawyer.
But you got greedy with the mob.
Your license was revoked after you were charged with contempt of court.
I know a little about you, too.
Your name is Joji Togawa.
You were born on June 8th, 1927.
You grew up in Beijing until the end of the war.
On the eve of your family's return to Japan, your parents were slaughtered by the Chinese.
Enough.
You came back to Japan with your little sister.
You got your hands dirty working for the mob.
Stop.
Three years ago, your sister lost her legs in an accident.
You killed the truck driver in the same way.
Oh, yeah.
That was a thrill.
Let me tell you one thing.
I don't see you as just another foot soldier or thug.
The reason you've been recruited for this job is that both the boss and I have faith in your abilities.
I'd rather get a hundred yen sure and safe, than a million by running the risk of getting caught.
I'm a businessman, not a gambler.
What do you want?
Is this why I'm out of the joint?
It did cost us, you know.
I want you to carry out our plan.
You want me to work for you.
Yes.
Consider it a business proposal.
- You've got the wrong guy.
So what are you going to do then?
You're 36 years old.
Old enough that you should know what your future holds.
I've been looking for someone who can carry out our plan.
You're the one.
120 million yen, in cold, hard cash.
This is a one-off gig.
You'll never have to see me again.
What do you want me to do?
- Rob an armored car.
- Whose money is it?
It's all the ticket sales from the Japan Derby.
What's so funny?
You're serious.
I've spent six months perfecting this plan.
Do you want to know why I'm targeting their money?
The money is so clean that you can use it the next day.
Watch it, idiot.
Have you made up your mind?
My sister is in a wheelchair.
I'll pass.
Find someone else.
That's too bad.
Why not make some serious dough for your sister?
Sure could use it, couldn't you?
I don't know anything about your plan.
I'll tell you all about it as soon as you say "okay."
Say it.
"Okay" is not part of my vocabulary.
Nothing will be "okay," until I get a fresh start.
All right.
Let's toast.
Let's hear how it's going to play out, in detail. Then I'll make my decision.
Fine.
I need somebody to assist me.
Someone trustworthy.
I've got four guys you can trust.
One of them is an acquaintance of yours.
Here are the rest.
Use them as you wish.
When can I meet them?
They're waiting to hear from you.
You need some money.
Tell me if you need more.
There's more where that came from.
You can use the car.
Here's the key.
I still haven't agreed yet.
Who are you?
About time.
Shirai?
I've come a long way.
How about a proper greeting?
Not so fast.
I don't plan to make the same mistake twice.
I could use your help.
I appreciate that.
You always looked out for me.
- Do you know anything about this job?
- No.
Almost nothing.
All I know is that it's huge and that you're in charge.
How's your mother doing?
Fine.
She never forgets to get older every year.
Boss? It's me.
He took the bait.
All right.
Stay alert, though.
If you need more money, let me know.
Boss.
Can we really trust them?
It's a fine line between a stray dog and a wolf.
Araki.
Getting him out of prison wasn't easy.
You know why I did it?
Togawa is smart.
He's got skills.
He never betrays or cheats his own guys.
I prefer a guy like him who gets the job done to a guy who asks questions.
Once they're done with the job, there's something I want to ask you.
I've invested a lot of money in this.
Welcome to our "hotel."
They don't put us up the way they used to.
Know anything about these guys?
Teramoto and Okada.
I don't know the other guy.
I have their pictures.
I've never met this one.
Okada used to be a boxer.
He was championship material up until four years ago, but now he's just a punching bag.
He'll have brain damage in no time.
He can barely do simple math.
His woman just left him.
He'll be useful when we need some muscle.
Just in case, you know?
He's not on the authorities' radar.
Teramoto is still young.
He was once a member of the boss's entourage.
A clever guy, but he's always in debt with his bookie.
Don't underestimate him, though.
I think he'll do just fine.
He's greedy.
He'll do anything for money.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
Anyway, tell me about the job.
He told you, didn't he?
120 million yen cash.
It's an armored car from the racetrack.
Did you agree to do it?
Not yet.
I'll decide after I meet the rest of the gang.
If you're up for this,
I'll handle these guys.
Whatever happens, it will be all right if we stick together.
I'm glad you're my partner.
Good to hear it.
I can count on you and this.
And your mother.
Don't say that.
When are you going to get some money?
Soon.
I'll take good care of you.
That's sweet.
Who the hell are you?
Move it, woman.
We need to talk to your girl.
What the hell?
Son of a bitch.
What do you want?
We heard you're about to do a big job.
We want a piece of the action.
Who's giving you the orders?
Is it Ito?
You can tell us.
I don't know anything.
Let's see.
Think this will help you remember?
We just want to get even with him.
This ain't exactly peanuts.
We'd like to hear it from you.
If not, you'll be taking your last breath right here.
Hold on.
Tell me.
We have a good idea.
Just tell us your target.
- The racetrack's -
- Armored car?
Yeah.
I'll know the details later today.
Wait till then.
That's all I know.
Some partner we've got.
Ito will be disappointed when he hears about this guy.
Ito?
We can't use Kondo.
He can't keep his mouth shut.
Take care of him.
Teramoto, isn't it?
You the boss?
Why have you been following me?
Nothing personal.
It doesn't hurt to learn about a would-be partner.
- When do we start?
- That's up to me.
You're clean, aren't you?
Sure.
Though I've gotten my hands dirty.
Especially when it comes to money.
You in trouble with the cops?
Nope.
Can you give me an advance?
I just lost a bet.
Can you meet tonight?
Sure.
I'll stop by.
Pretty good.
- Okada, aren't you?
- What do you want?
Has Ito talked to you?
You must be Togawa.
What do you want me to do?
I'll tell you later tonight.
I want to hear it now.
How much am I going to get?
More than you're making here as a punching bag.
It's about time you quit.
Son of a bitch!
Don't mess with me!
Look at this poster!
YASUJI OKADA V. HIDEO TAKAYASU
I'm -
I'm a champion!
A champion.
Three years ago, maybe.
What good does it do you now?
You'll be brain dead if you keep this up.
What you need is money.
Come with us.
Will it take long?
No.
It'll be quick.
It's me.
Is this it?
Teramoto.
I didn't think you'd be a part of this.
You can leave any time if you don't like it.
I'll be happy to take your cut.
- What did you say?
- Enough.
Why did you choose such a cheat?
Still bitter?
You're the one who volunteered to fight a fixed match.
Because of that, you didn't become a champion, but that's not on me.
You got paid.
You've got muscle, but you have rocks in your head.
No wonder your woman took off.
After this job, I'll kill you.
Oh, I can't wait.
You're high.
None of your business.
I'll do the job just fine.
Let's settle this right now.
Hey, big shot.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Watch your mouth.
What are you going to do?
Should I pull the trigger?
Listen.
We don't need this.
We're a team now.
We're all in this together gambling with our lives.
This is our last chance to score big.
We may not like each other, but we have to work together.
All right, then.
I was just kidding.
Well, Boss, let's hear the plan.
Don't say a word until I say so.
I'm the one who makes jokes and gives orders.
Just do what I tell you.
If you want in, you have to listen to me.
I got it, Boss.
I'm in.
Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to rob an armored car from the racetrack carrying 120 million yen.
The car will get on Route 18 from this street.
There's a shortcut to the city through the woods.
But for safety reasons, the car will stay on Route 18 to reach the city.
Our plan is to get them onto this street.
That's impossible.
Just how do you plan to do that?
Shut up and listen.
That's what you're going to do.
Here's the armored car.
The car's windows are bulletproof.
Even a machine-gun wouldn't make a dent.
The cop in the passenger seat has the key to the back.
The car will leave the track at 3:00.
ACCIDENT AHEAD
USE DETOUR
As soon as the car heads down the country road,
you change the direction of the sign and shut down the street.
As for the cars coming from the city,
we divert them by placing another warning sign.
Now the car with all that money is on the road.
This is where things get ugly.
Surprised, they get out of the car.
We take care of them.
Okada hooks a wire to the bumper of the car.
We unload the money and take care of the bodies.
Then Shirai and Okada dump the car in a remote area.
All of this has to be done in seven minutes.
But are they going to buy it?
Don't worry.
They've never been robbed.
It's all about the routine.
Shirai, look.
They've forgotten that feeling safe is the most dangerous thing of all.
We'll teach them a lesson.
Everything has to be perfect.
- Can I ask a question?
- Sure.
Armored cars communicate with the police and banks by radio.
Aren't they going to know?
Their radio will break down
15 minutes after leaving the track.
Maintenance is scheduled for the day before.
I'll have someone tamper with their radio.
Are you giving him a cut?
No, it's just a payoff.
Glad to hear it.
How much is our cut?
Half the money.
Sixty million yen.
Half?
We only get half for a heist this big?
What are you complaining about?
The boss has spent a lot of money on this.
He bought a 20-ton truck, an electric winch, a getaway car.
Can you get any of that on your own?
- If you can't, don't complain.
- Okay, I won't.
Just curious. That's all.
How are you going to split the money?
We're a team.
If something goes wrong, we all face the same risk.
I won't cheat any of you by paying less.
That would piss you guys off.
And that would mean trouble for all of us.
We'll divide up the money.
We'll each get 15 million yen.
Who are you?
Keiko.
Is she with you?
Why did you bring her?
- She doesn't know anything.
- What did you hear?
Nothing.
I was wondering what was taking him so long.
If you don't believe me, stand by the door and try to listen.
Togawa.
It's true.
I tried it before.
Get lost.
I never told her anything.
Shut up.
Don't get nervous, Togawa.
She didn't hear us.
With a job like this,
I expect trouble to come looking for us, but I'd rather face it sooner than later.
You.
Could you kill her if you had to?
- How did the junkie get the job?
- You mean Teramoto?
- He brought a woman with him.
- Did he?
No need to worry.
He loves money so much he'd sell his own mother.
He's greedy.
That's why I trust him.
Sounds like you have a soft spot for him.
If he gives you trouble, handle him however you want.
Makes your share bigger.
How about the weapons?
Takizawa from the base will get them for us.
You'll use this truck.
You've got an electric winch inside.
That's to reel in the armored car.
ACCIDENT AHEAD
USE DETOUR
Are you okay with just 15 million yen?
We haven't even done the job yet.
So what do you think?
Isn't it a little late for that?
I don't like working with them, but our hand's already been dealt.
Regardless,
I'll be there, keeping an eye on things.
Why don't you go see your mother first?
You know what?
I'll see her afterwards.
By the way, when you get your money, get her another operation.
Don't give up.
Not yet anyway.
Brother.
Rie.
I missed you.
I thought I'd never see you again.
Brother.
You won't disappear on me again, will you?
You'll stay with me, right?
You're going to have another operation.
You'll be able to walk again.
Don't bother.
I've given up.
Forgive me, Rie.
I ruin everything.
That night, if I hadn't sent you to the store -
I wanted to go.
Please.
Just don't leave me.
I won't. You and I, ever since we left Beijing -
Stop.
Mother's voice,
I can still hear her.
Don't worry about anything.
I've got a good job.
If things go smoothly, we'll be able to travel the world.
Our luck is about to change for the better.
But before that, let's get you better.
You're going to start a new life.
This can't be happening.
I must be dreaming.
Up until now, until I saw you, all I did was wonder where and how you were.
I can believe you, can't I?
It's not like before, right?
You won't abandon me, will you?
The doctor would like to talk to you.
Here.
I'm sorry.
Even with the operation, she won't be able to walk again.
The fact she survived without any brain damage is something to thank God for.
God?
To hell with God.
Hey, Boss.
Boss, it's been two years.
- How's business?
- Quiet.
But I can't complain. I get by.
Did you receive the money?
From Calvin?
I thought that was from you.
I found a couple secondhand.
But, Boss,
I have to say,
I don't know what you're up to, but if something happens to you, who's going to take care of Rie?
Are you committed to this?
I need to do this.
Don't ask me any questions.
If I don't,
I'll never make it.
What I need is money.
This kind of weapon is hard to find these days.
Do you remember how to use it?
I know what to use it for.
This one is used.
I got it from a G. I.
It works just fine.
You've got 12 bullets in here.
That's enough for a regular job.
Here are two extra clips.
Remember.
Once you start shooting, there's no time to reload.
Got it.
Just squeeze the trigger gently.
This gun is old-school, you know?
Don't use it unless you intend to kill.
You pull the trigger once, your target gets seven holes in him.
No one's going to survive that.
Thanks.
Take care.
Boss.
It's not too late.
I still haven't paid you back for saving my life.
If you want, the two of you can move in here.
I'll take care of her.
You still love her?
She's handicapped.
She can't even stand up.
Boss.
Thanks, Takizawa.
I'll let her know how you feel about her.
Boss, can I join your crew?
Later, Taki.
The armored car should be here in five minutes.
Look.
Just do what you're supposed to.
Teramoto.
You're the key to the whole thing.
If you do your job, everything will fall into place.
Don't worry about me.
Let's do it.
Damn crows.
They're bad luck.
Let's do it.
ACCIDENT AHEAD
USE DETOUR
We've got a head-on collision.
Take the detour.
Don't get out.
Lock the door.
They can't get to us.
Back up.
Back up, now!
I can't.
Get out.
Get out now!
Let's unlock the back.
No time for that.
We'll have to take the entire car.
Shirai, move the truck closer.
Hurry up.
Come on!
They're going to take us, too.
Set the brake.
Release it when I say so.
- Pull it.
- Go on, roll it!
Now.
Now set it.
Okada, what's going on?
Push it.
What do we do, Togawa?
Are we going to keep them?
What about the money?
I'll contact the boss later.
Change of plans.
Follow me.
This is the armored car.
This is the armored car.
Please respond.
There's a robbery in progress.
Please respond.
It's dead.
TOYO BANK
Armored car, do you copy?
What's your current location?
Hello? What's going on?
Respond!
- What's wrong?
- The armored car hasn't responded.
Their last communication was
10 minutes ago, when they left the track.
An accident?
This is the armored car.
Is it dead?
They stopped.
Don't get out.
When the war ended,
American soldiers partied here.
This is how they left the place.
What are we going to do with them?
- Let me think about it.
- Think about it?
I'll come up with something.
Who cares about them?
I just want to see the money.
Hey.
Shoot the door down.
We need a metal pipe.
The longer, the better.
Smoke them out, huh?
Let's get this done.
Police are investigating the incident, but have no solid leads.
Five or six gang members are thought to be responsible for the heist.
The bodies of two motorcycle policemen who were escorting the armored car
were found in a wooded area near Route 18.
Both officers sustained gunshot wounds.
- Boss. Make it out alive.
The police believe this to be a well organized heist.
The police are still looking for the missing armored car,
the driver and the police officer who were in the car-
Mr. Sato, the driver and
Officer Hiramoto are still missing.
It's a wooded area.
The police have deployed a helicopter for the investigation.
This is what we know so far.
The amount stolen is 127 million yen.
This would be the biggest heist in the history of our nation.
Forensic evidence shows that the two officers
were shot at close range.
Police also found tire marks belonging to a large truck-
How do we exchange the money?
It's not wise for us to contact them.
Let's wait to hear from Togawa.
That's what we agreed on.
Don't make a sound.
Roger.
Let's go.
A traffic accident.
Okay.
That was close.
I don't think they'll be back.
You don't know that.
Shut up.
Just drink your whiskey.
Shirai.
Give it some gas.
Okay.
Just five minutes.
No need to kill them.
That's enough.
We don't want to kill them.
Open it.
Wait.
Shirai.
Hold on.
You got him?
Shirai, are you all right?
It's just a scratch.
You know what?
Let me just see the money.
Okay. Let's open it up.
You bitch.
You've been following me?
You'll have to get rid of her now.
You can't, can you?
Then there goes your share.
- Enough is enough.
Watch out!
- Clean up the mess.
- Yeah.
When did you get mixed up in this?
From the start.
- Did Ito ask you?
- Uh-huh.
To keep an eye on you guys.
It's stupid.
He needs a doctor.
Don't you have anything?
He's your friend.
Sorry about earlier.
And thank you.
Let's divide up the money.
I don't want to be here anymore.
Hold on.
Don't move till I talk to the boss.
I'll call him right now.
Don't go out just yet.
Hey.
Hand over your guns.
What?
I don't trust anyone.
Just give it up.
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Wait.
Let's take my car, just to be on the safe side.
How did you find out about this?
Did Teramoto tell you?
- What's going on between you two?
- Nothing.
I've worked with him in the past.
He's a traitor.
Teramoto is up to something.
I know.
If something happens,
Shirai can handle it.
You and I.
They don't trust us, you know?
The boss and Togawa will split the money.
For all the work we put in, we're getting next to nothing.
On top of that, they may just take us out.
Are you listening?
Togawa isn't that kind of guy.
Don't you want to get back together with that woman?
Anyway,
120 million yen is right there.
If we split it, each of us gets 60 million yen.
Imagine what you could do with that.
Let's take him out and split with the money.
I don't trust you.
Guns.
He's got guns.
Ask him to play cards with us.
Make him the dealer.
He needs both hands to cut the cards.
Hey.
Give us a break.
Play cards with us.
We're going to be rich.
Let's bet some of that money.
The boss has been waiting to hear from you.
I'm happy it's good news.
Your so-called plan didn't work out like you had hoped.
- You got the money, right?
- For now.
We shouldn't move it tonight.
Let's wait until tomorrow morning.
You'll take me to where it is.
Stay at the hotel tonight.
I got you a room.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
What about the girl?
Well.
I thought she could be of use.
But we don't need her anymore.
Do what you want.
I'm disappointed in you.
This is business.
I gave her some money.
To keep an eye on us, right?
Come on. Everything went smoothly.
To the hotel.
We're going to stay there.
Can I come with you?
Why do you work for Ito?
For the money.
But -
But now,
I'm here for a different reason.
I like you.
But there's no room for you in my life.
I'll make sure you get paid well.
Stay away from them.
I'll be on my way as soon as I get my cut.
It's me.
He just left.
WINSTON HOTEL PARKING
I understand Ito called.
Yes, sir.
The key is at the front desk.
Sign here, please.
The son of a bitch turned on me.
You screwed up? Idiots!
Call the boss right away.
I'm on my way.
Follow them!
It's your turn to deal.
Wait a minute.
What about those two?
Shouldn't we do something?
You have a point.
Shirai. Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Where's the money?
In the car.
What happened?
It's them, isn't it?
They betrayed us.
Must have followed me here.
Damn it.
What happened to the girl?
- I left her with Takizawa.
Togawa and Shirai are inside.
- What do we do?
- What do you think?
It's Togawa we're dealing with.
Without a plan, it'll be a bloodbath.
Let's wait until the sun comes up.
We can't.
If we turn him against us, we'll lose our leverage.
We shouldn't have betrayed the guy for money.
- It's too late.
- Yeah.
You can say that again.
We must kill Togawa right here and now.
I have an idea.
Break down the door.
Then take them out.
Let's do it.
Get out of here, before it's too late.
Go out through that window.
There's a field about a mile from here.
Run until you see it. Go.
- I wonder if he'll make it.
- I don't know.
Damn.
We're surrounded.
- We have nothing to lose.
- Yeah.
Ready?
Go.
Are you all right?
- Damn it. The money!
- Hurry!
Shit.
It's in the car.
Son of a bitch.
Wait. We'll keep them away from it.
Shirai.
- Can you make it over there?
- Yeah.
I'll cover you. Go for it.
The sewer leads to the river.
I'll stay behind.
I won't be able to make it.
You go.
Hold on!
Well?
I don't know.
It's quiet down there.
Here.
I found it.
Check the nearby manholes.
Don't let them get away.
Climb up.
- Which way did they go?
- This way.
Let's go.
There are three exits.
We'll make it, Shirai.
They'll never know.
Please.
- Go see my mother for me.
- Hey, don't be foolish.
Let's go.
Boss.
Mr. Togawa.
Mr. Takizawa.
He can't be dead.
Not at the hands of those guys.
I know where he's going to come out.
We lived here for more than five years.
Come on, let's go.
Here they come.
Don't shoot, Boss.
It's me.
Takizawa?
Call an ambulance.
- He's dead.
- No, he's not!
Shirai.
Okay, Boss.
We have breaking news.
The unit investigating the armored car heist has just announced
that a truck was found abandoned
18 miles from the site of the incident.
The armored car was found inside the truck.
The bodies of the driver, the police officer,
and seven unidentified suspects were also found at the scene.
The area in Yamato used to be an American military base,
but since the military relocated, the site has been abandoned-
For us to pursue our happiness -
THE BLUE BIRD
These are all I got.
What are you going to do with Matsumoto's son?
Nothing.
I just wanted to take a good look at him.
You'd better get out of here.
The police will be looking for you.
A friend of mine is a successful businessman in Brazil.
I'm sure he can take you in.
I can get you a passport through the base.
You should go.
I'll bring Rie in a year or so.
Please.
I want to see Rie happy.
You may be right.
I should run away.
But I need payback.
And if I can't do that,
I'd rather kill myself.
This isn't a game.
I can't say,
"Sorry. They got away."
I've lost all human decency since I took this job.
I didn't allow myself to feel, or lose control.
A lot of people died because of that.
That's why I was able to kill.
I've killed by any means necessary.
Do you understand the way I feel?
I wish I could kill myself.
Boss.
I have nothing left in me.
What I need is that money.
I can fix her legs with the money.
You've changed.
Ever since the accident you're nothing like you used to be.
Those bastards played me and won.
Now it's my turn.
I'll turn the tables on them.
You'll be killed.
They'll kill you like a dog.
Let's just get out of here.
You go by yourself.
You shouldn't be with me.
Please, leave.
You're young, beautiful, and smart.
Just go where they can't find you.
I won't go alone.
After all of these years I've suffered and I've finally met you.
I can't just let you die.
- Go.
Forget about me.
Go, now!
- Boss.
- Shut up!
Hey.
You're hard to find, Togawa.
Drive.
Togawa.
We're not with Matsumoto.
We're on your side.
This is the only way you'd talk to us.
Forgive us.
- What do you want?
- We just want to talk.
Follow them.
Put the gun down, then.
You know why you're here, right?
No clue.
But you invited me here.
So you can lose the attitude.
You did a great job.
It was you, wasn't it?
We're in the same line of work.
I know Matsumoto treated you like a piece of trash.
Thugs these days.
They can't keep their mouths shut.
I see.
So you sympathize with me.
Not really.
I want to settle a score with him, too.
I've lost all my turf to him.
This betting parlor is all I've got left.
However,
120 million yen can open a lot of doors.
What do you say?
Shall we join forces?
Us... we'll get the money back from Matsumoto.
I'm a ticking time bomb.
Not only is Matsumoto after me, but the cops too.
The whole thing could blow up in your face.
The reward is worth the risk.
I've lost so much.
I lost my life and the only friend I had left.
This is Matsumoto's son.
The apple of his eye.
Kidnap him.
Don't kill him, though.
We need him.
One wrong move and we're all dead.
I have to go somewhere.
Think it over.
- Thank you.
- See you.
Hi.
- Good evening. See you around.
You know who I am?
You'll regret this.
- Shut up. Don't piss me off.
Don't hurt me. Please.
We don't work for your daddy.
Are we sure Haruhiko was kidnapped?
Yes. We're searching everywhere.
Stop that!
Obviously, Togawa's responsible.
This is Matsumoto.
It's you.
Matsumoto, listen to me.
I've got your son.
We're both running out of time.
Listen carefully.
You want your son back, don't you?
Don't you lay a finger on my son.
What do you want?
Tell me what you want.
Calm down.
I'll let you hear his voice.
Hold on.
It's me, Father.
Help me.
Do what he says.
Everything will be okay.
Get me Togawa.
Let me speak to him.
Let's trade.
There's one condition.
I bring your son by myself.
You bring the money all by yourself.
All 120 million yen.
If it comes up short, you don't get him back.
Hey, are you with me?
Where?
Understood. I'll get the money.
Give me half an hour.
Boss, the money doesn't belong to us anymore.
It belongs to the family.
Without me, there is no family.
Don't tell me I can't use that for ransom.
You don't have to hand the money to him.
Just eliminate Togawa.
Go ahead and bring the kid.
- What about you?
- I'll be there.
Keep an eye on the money.
I trust you.
- Where's Togawa?
- There were only three of them.
It's me.
What?
Haruhiko is dead?
They found out that it wasn't the money in the bags.
I'm sorry.
Hello? What about Togawa?
Hello?
I knew it.
You're wrong.
I was going to give up the money.
It was Ito's idea.
It was him.
You're right.
He's the one who killed my friend and your son.
He wants to take your place.
You can have the money.
It's all yours.
Help me.
I will.
Takizawa? It's me.
Get me that passport.
I'll take your advice.
And I'll be taking my sister with me.
Okay.
I'll see you soon.
Hi, George.
My friend wants to go to Brazil.
It doesn't matter.
They want to leave tomorrow morning.
I'll pay in US dollars.
Two passports.
I have their pictures.
I'll let him know how helpful you've been.
Takizawa.
It's been a long time.
He's coming for those passports.
What time will he be here?
Keiko.
Taki!
Don't shoot! It's me!
Boss.
I thought it was him.
Forgive me.
You missed me.
You missed.
THE END
A SHOCHIKU FILM
At the end of the 16th century,
the decisive Battle of Sekigahara divided all of Japan in two.
The forces from Kanto in eastern Japan were victorious,
and the Tokugawa clan took complete control of the country.
But the defeated Hideyori Toyotomi was still in Osaka,
and many feudal lords secretly supported him,
while ronin displaced by the defeat
looked to him to carry out their revenge.
In 1614, 14 years after the battle at Sekigahara,
antagonism flared up again between Tokugawa and Toyotomi.
Naturally, spies from both sides
were crawling all over the country.
The nominal leader of the Tokugawa espionage network
was Munenori Yagyu,
but in reality the network was run by somebody else.
Heishichi, admit that you are in fact
Keijiro Maeda, a spy for Osaka.
- Why do you say that?
- You don't know me.
I am Tatewaki Koriyama, a Yagyu agent.
I am also a Yagyu agent.
My name is Sakon Takatani.
I can't let Tatewaki take all the credit for killing him.
The key figures in the Kanto spy network were Tatewaki and Takatani.
The leaders of the Osaka network were Shigeyuki Koremura
and his assistant,
Takanosuke Nojiri.
In addition to these two main groups,
there was a clan called Sanada,
which did not declare its allegiance but was thought to be pro-Toyotomi.
I am pursued, always pursued by something.

Sasuke Sarutobi, you're quick as always.
Mitsuaki Inamura, you seem to be well.
You did a good job following me.
I've been a hungry ronin since the Battle of Sekigahara.
It was hard keeping up with you.
Why do you choose such difficult paths?
It's become a habit.
Your Sanada clan has been working hard.
Kakei is on his way to Hachioji from Kawagoe.
Nezu is going to Edo.
And you're on the Shinano road.
If you go to Nakatsugawa, you'll meet Anayama.
If you go to Seba, you'll see Saizo Kirigakure. Right?
How do you know all that?
What's it matter?
We're allies.
We're on the same side.
That much is certain.
Nothing is certain these days.
The ronin are as hungry as the peasants.
Plague has followed upon famine.
But what are they doing in Edo?
Building brothels and enjoying themselves, while the common people barely eke out an existence.
Young women sell themselves to survive.
That's Tokugawa politics for you.
This is rather expensive food you have.
Like some more?
It seems you believe in -
What?
The need for war.
What else is there?
You took advantage of war, and now you live well.
War is something to exploit, is that it?
But we don't start the wars.
It's always like that.
They draw us into their wars and toss us aside when they're over.
We have to ride the wave.
We must catch the cresting wave and ride it.
Mitsuaki.
- What?
- Men create war.
So you mean men can stop war?
Is that Sanada's position?
I don't know what my lord thinks, but that's what I think.
I have to believe that war can be stopped.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm going.
Wait. I'm going with you.
Why won't you leave me alone?
The Suwa clan is up ahead.
They inspect all ronin closely.
I need your help.
He's a Christian.
He's a young ronin.
They're persecuting the Christians again.
Orders from Edo.
How did they find him?
They say there was an informer.
Magistrate Genba Kuni and his men caught him last night.
- Will they behead him?
- He'll be crucified.
Such cruelty!
"Seal your lips tight."
Welcome to my shop.
Some rice cakes.
Bring me some rice cakes.
I've heard Magistrate Genba is extremely harsh.
It's a pity, but that prisoner is as good as dead.
Sasuke.
I'm the one who informed on that young Christian.
What?
Genba was actually looking for me and another man.
Another man?
I had to pass through here to reach Suwa tonight, but they're waiting for me wherever I go.
I knew Genba would be checking this town and that the Christian would be here.
So you planned to escape while they were distracted with him.
Sasuke, help me.
Don't leave me alone, please.
Wait.
Why are they after you?
The fate of a certain man - an extremely important man - is in my hands.
If he sided with Osaka, the situation would change drastically.
So the Tokugawa clan wants to find me.
- Who is this person?
Tatewaki Koriyama.
Tatewaki? The Yagyu agent?
Sasuke, believe me.
Tatewaki has betrayed Tokugawa and wants to work for Toyotomi in Osaka.
I'm his intermediary.
Without me, he -
Are you mad?
Tatewaki and Takatani head the Tokugawa spy network.
Why would he turn on them?
I'm telling the truth.
Tatewaki is now waiting for me in Suwa.
He's coming!
But Mitsuaki, how do you know Tatewaki?
He's head of espionage for your enemy, the Tokugawa shogunate.
You've been selling information on Osaka to Kanto, haven't you?
And vice versa?
Clear the way.
He's just a boy!
Please understand.
The nation's future depends on this.
I betrayed that young man because sometimes the ends justify -
I don't understand.
I refuse to.
Dominus Christe.
Shut him up!
Move aside!
The danger is past.
Your plan was a success.
Your path to Suwa is clear.
Go by yourself.
Sasuke, wait!
Don't you believe me?
If Tatewaki joins Toyotomi, it's like another fortress for our army.
He knows everything about the Tokugawa spy network.
That has nothing to do with me.
But your master, Lord Yukimura, will be interested.
Why are the Sanada men spying on both clans?
We too sell information.
- Would you betray Toyotomi?
- What?
It's a betrayal if you don't help Osaka.
You see things only in terms of war.
Or better yet, in terms of money.
Sasuke, didn't we fight on the same side at Sekigahara?
I was 15 at the time.
Fourteen years have passed without war.
What are you saying?
I don't know my lord's intentions.
We subjects of Sanada are always wandering the country gathering information to send to our lord.
Why? I don't know.
At some point
I stopped asking why.
Are you saying the Sanada clan isn't on our side?
Why divide everyone into friend and enemy?
We have war to thank for that way of thinking.
I have no use for it.
Ours may be an unstable peace, but it's one I've grown used to.
I came of age in this peace.
Don't worry.
My lips are sealed.
I've never betrayed anyone.
Life can be full of unpleasant surprises.
Are you hurt?
I'm all right.
Just a light wound.
I knew you'd help me.
Who was that man in white?
Sakon Takatani.
Amazing.
Yagyu is eager to catch Tatewaki.
But I can rest assured as long as you're with me.
We'll see.
You should dress your wound.
She's very beautiful.
She must be a dancer.
Suwa is having a festival tomorrow.
There's a very famous shrine there, and they put on a splendid festival.
A festival?
OHATA INN
Your companion invites you to have supper in his room.
Drinking is best after a nice bath.
Want a cup?
- I'll drink after my bath.
Sake won't help your wound.
- Nonsense. It's good medicine.
I'm sending for a prostitute tonight.
Do you want one?
No, I don't.
That's the "dance of the gods."
You must know it.
It's become very popular.
I saw it in Edo.
"Seal your lips tight," they sang as men and women danced wildly together.
The deity of the great shrine at Ise tells us if you dance, you'll prosper, and if you don't, famine will come.
That's ridiculous.
"Seal your lips tight" refers to a battle looming between Kanto and Kansai.
I'm not so sure.
The common people are always first to sense impending disaster.
They dance and laugh, but in their hearts -
There's nothing!
You're an odd one, Sasuke.
Are you a fool?
I'm sorry.
Perhaps I am a fool.
If I succeed in taking
Tatewaki to Toyotomi,
I'll be rewarded handsomely.
Do you know how much?
Five hundred kan.
That equals a stipend of 2,500 koku.
Quite a sum.
And I can have it both ways.
Meaning?
Meaning I don't even have to hand him over in Osaka.
The going price is what the buyer is willing to pay.
I'll take him to Sakai and collect my money from Osaka.
Then I'll reveal his location to the magistrate of Kyoto, who's on the Tokugawa side.
What do you think?
You can have half.
One could live in luxury for a nice long time with 250 kan.
Indeed. And if you hate war so much, no need for you to join in.
Just sit back and watch as Kanto and Kansai fight it out to the end.
No need to join a losing side.
You're as clever as all their spies.
But don't forget:
They often get their throats cut while sleeping with women.
What's that?
How can a clever man like you fail to understand?
Those Tokugawa agents
I killed today - do you think that's how they wanted to die?
And Yashiro, the Christian boy?
- I have no idea what you're saying.
No one seems to give any thought anymore to the meaning of death.
Or the meaning of life, for that matter.
Wait!
There are many different kinds of life.
We need money for women and sake.
What else is there to live for?
Those dancing fools are like me.
Not like you, but like me.
What a nuisance.
The road is blocked.
We have to stay here.
They say it's because a Sanada agent is in town.
A horse driver I hired told me several samurai were mercilessly slaughtered at Wada Pass.
Is that so?
The scoundrel who did it is apparently a famous spy who goes by the name
Sasuke something.
The magistrate has been very harsh recently.
The slightest mistake and you'll be arrested.
When we bow, we have to kiss the ground like this.
Make sure you remember that.
Hey, I didn't know she was with you.
I'm ashamed.
Forgive me.
Anyway, I have a feeling the magistrate will eventually catch the guy.
By the way, do you think there will be war?
When our lord goes to war, we have to pay more land tax.
I have a family of seven.
Life will be hard.
So you have five children?
Yes, sir. And when my wife's pregnant, boy, does she have a temper!
Best not to discuss politics too much.
You're right.
"Seal your lips tight."
Excuse me.
May I join you?
Please come to Joshin Temple at 6:00 a.m., Sasuke, sir.
Murderer!
Murderer!
- What is it?
- There's been a murder.
I must speak to you.
Let's go.
There was a lake where I grew up.
Where was that?
Koshu.
Please ask no more.
Why?
Because I'd have to lie.
You don't look like a prostitute.
Did you think I was because I came with you so easily?
But you didn't choose me.
I chose you.
You smell of flowers.
I picked a lily today.
Near Wada Pass?
What is your name?
Okiwa.
Mitsuaki was killed tonight.
You knew, just as I thought.
What are you? A spy?
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
What do you want to know?
I know nothing.
I have nothing.
Why do you seek to get close to me like this?
Welcome to my temple, traveler.
What is your name?
I've forgotten.
A man who serves only Buddha needs no name.
But this girl has one.
It is Omiyo.
For reasons I won't go into,
I brought her here and raised her.
And your father?
He died in the Battle of Sekigahara.
I had just been born.
My mother took me and traveled about.
She ended up here, broken in body and spirit.
She'd been a courtesan in Kyoto.
Shigeyuki Koremura has asked to see you to talk about Tatewaki.
Miss Omiyo, do you know who those people are?
Tatewaki leads Tokugawa's spies, and Koremura leads Osaka's spies.
Many of Koremura's men have been here.
Takanosuke Nojiri as well.
Suwa is crawling with spies from both sides.
Do you think war will break out here?
Genba persuaded his lord to side with Kanto.
But Minister Horikawa is with Kansai.
Koremura is now at Horikawa's estate.
Koremura's men are waiting to see whose side the lord will take.
War is already starting.
I am Sakon Takatani of the Yagyu clan.
As you may know,
I want Tatewaki.
What?
I want you to bring him to me, or at least tell me where he is.
How should I know?
You must know.
I knew Mitsuaki couldn't be the brains behind this, but I didn't think it was you.
If you turn over Tatewaki, we won't interfere with the Sanada clan.
What are you saying?
Do you know how many Sanada men have disappeared?
Kimura,
Nezu,
Mochizuki.
Who killed Mitsuaki? You?
I don't know.
I doubt you'll believe me, but a double-dealer like him deserves what he gets.
Wait!
Are you afraid?
I don't want you to die now.
I'll wait for your answer.
We'll meet at 6:00 p. M... at the Joshin Temple.
Look!
The woman in there is dying.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
- Somebody's here!
- This way!
I must go.
There he is!
There he goes!
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
You fool!
Who are you?
Stay back!
I am Magistrate Genba Kuni.
Arrest that man in white!
Don't let him take Sasuke away!
After him!
Who is the young man?
He took Sasuke away!
Are you conscious?
Sasuke, sir?
Where am I?
The Horikawa estate.
Don't worry.
Lord Koremura is here.
You mustn't try to get up.
What happened to me, Omiyo?
You were chased down and about to be arrested when some unknown men came to your rescue.
A man in white led the group.
Sakon Takatani.
Why did he do it?
Why did he bring me here?
Do you really plan to betray the Sanada clan and Lord Yukimura?
What?
They say Kanto will hire you for 2,500 koku.
Who told you that?
Ask yourself that question.
Lord Sasuke, I see you've regained consciousness.
Who are you?
Just call me Jinnai.
My full name, as head of this house, is Kazutaka Horikawa, minister of the Suwa clan.
Lord Sasuke, I've been looking forward to meeting you.
I am Shigeyuki Koremura, and this is Takanosuke Nojiri.
He is young, but an accomplished swordsman.
If it weren't for him, you wouldn't be here.
Then it was Nojiri who rescued me.
I'm glad you weren't badly hurt.
I passed out and was almost captured.
Thank you.
Save your thanks for Takatani.
Why?
He and his men attacked Genba's officers so that I could rescue you.
An unprecedented event:
Takatani, working for Yagyu, and we, working for Osaka, cooperated to rescue you, a member of the Sanada clan.
Sasuke Sarutobi!
Is this Sanada's policy, or only yours?
- What are you speaking of?
- Your secret alliance with Takatani.
Did Sanada end his loyalty to Toyotomi?
Or did you betray him?
Koremura, please refrain from such talk.
I believe Takatani rescued me because he didn't want me in Genba's hands.
I know nothing of his motives.
How do you explain the girl at the inn?
She worked for him.
What?
Her name was Okiwa.
She was famous for her singing and dancing.
But a female entertainer can hardly survive on her own.
She must have somebody to protect her.
Female dancers who travel around the country are all paid by Yagyu.
She accompanied me along Wada Pass.
I don't know what she wanted from me.
She was certainly quite beautiful.
He gave you the girl... and you brutally killed her.
You think it was me?
If she refused you and you killed her, then that's truly pitiful.
But it could have been for money.
And you killed Mitsuaki for money, did you not?
You're wrong.
He was dead when I entered his room.
But the people at the inn thought I killed him.
It was the same with Okiwa.
Takatani had been there before me.
I don't care either way.
You're all of the same stripe.
I don't care who killed those two.
But I feel terrible pity for the young woman who died with a knife in her throat.
Then you were there?
When I hurried there to see Sasuke, she was already dead.
I saw her for only a second, but her death was clearly a very cruel one.
What would be my motive for killing her?
Enough of this pretending!
You planned to capture Tatewaki after he escaped from Edo and keep the reward for yourself.
Mitsuaki intended to deliver
Tatewaki to us.
But when he asked for your help, you saw more profit in giving him to Tokugawa instead.
Mitsuaki and Okiwa knew your plans, so you killed them.
The dead can't talk, after all.
You'd better hand
Tatewaki over to us.
If you do, we'll overlook the fact that you sided with Kanto and arrange for you to be rewarded.
Tatewaki will be hired by Osaka for 3,000 koku.
You'll receive 700 or 800 koku.
- You've made a terrible mistake.
- What?
I truly know nothing about Tatewaki.
TO SASUKE SARUTOBI
FROM TATEWAKI KORIYAMA
"As you heard from Mitsuaki,
I have left the Tokugawa clan.
I have waited but can wait no longer:
I'm going to Yashiro.
I beg your assistance.
Tatewaki Koriyama."
- That letter was in your sleeve.
- That can't be!
It is Tatewaki's writing without a doubt.
We studied the letter while you were unconscious.
He asks for your help, but no rendezvous is mentioned.
So we attempted to decode it.
The hidden message is
"the Kadoya Inn."
I immediately sent my man to the inn.
It seems a middle-aged samurai resembling Tatewaki had been there.
Last night a man resembling Mitsuaki visited him.
After he left, the middle-aged man also left in a hurry.
Anyway, we have proof that this letter is no fake.
Mitsuaki met Tatewaki here in Suwa?
He then returned to the Ohata Inn to talk to you.
That's when he gave you this letter.
I know nothing of these things.
How can I make you believe me?
Give us proof.
I don't think you can.
If you didn't kill
Mitsuaki and Okiwa and didn't inform on Yashiro, tell us who did.
If I knew who did,
I wouldn't turn him in.
I'd kill him myself.
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- I don't ask you to believe me.
There are personal reasons why
I'd never forgive him. Leave it at that.
Personal reasons?
That's right.
She was dearer to me than anyone else.
Nonsense!
She was just a dancing girl.
More important is the identity of this Yashiro.
He was arrested in town by Genba.
He's a Christian.
I was there. I saw him.
What's he have to do with Tatewaki?
I don't know. But Mitsuaki told me that he himself betrayed Yashiro.
Did you speak of war?
These days, any discussion leads to talk of war.
It's terrible.
You don't know war, do you?
When I was a child, all I knew was the misery that follows war.
- Is that so?
- It's all I remember.
After my mother died and I was taken to the temple,
I read the sutras every day, chased rabbits and squirrels in the hills, caught magpies and swam with friends.
It seems like only yesterday.
Omiyo, why do you serve Koremura?
Is that wrong?
It's not good, is it?
I didn't say that.
I just don't want to see you involved.
In what?
In all this filth and ugliness, in anything that stands opposed to a life of health and goodness.
I'll stop, then.
But why did you begin?
I couldn't refuse
Nojiri's request.
Do you love him?
He's a dreadful man.
More than Koremura?
I don't know much about Koremura.
He just arrived yesterday.
Nojiri comes here often,
I suppose?
In any case...
I'll do as you say.
That's good.
You'd better leave the temple immediately.
Why?
Because Takatani is coming.
He'd kill a person for no reason at all.
I think the logical conclusion is that he killed both Mitsuaki and Okiwa.
He rescued me because he thought
I could lead him to Tatewaki.
I'm not a man who talks under torture.
Koremura and Nojiri let me go for the same reason.
You spoke of Sanada's clan.
Friends in the clan like Saizo Kirigakure and Jinpachi Nezu are dear to me.
But I don't know what's on Lord Yukimura's mind.
He studies the armies of Kanto and Kansai in silence.
I've come to believe that he too looks at everything in terms of war.
Omiyo, I see now who my friends and enemies are.
I see who cares about people and who doesn't.
I have to meet Takatani at 6:00 p.m.
It's almost time.
You'd better leave.
Why not?
What will you do?
I will meet Takatani.
I'll go with you.
No. Don't worry about the priest.
Best for you to stay with someone you know for a while.
I don't know anyone.
I have no place to go.
Nojiri told me a woman called Okiwa was killed with a spike in her throat.
Was it you who did that?
No, it wasn't.
She approached me, thinking I knew where Tatewaki was.
Her beauty stood out among the dancers.
She wasn't a woman who would sell her body.
But she gave me her body in order to find Tatewaki.
Can you understand the sorrow of such a woman?
I can't forgive the man who killed Okiwa.
Omiyo!
Wait!
Sasuke!
Sasuke Sarutobi, you're under arrest!
I am Magistrate Genba.
You're under arrest for the murder of two people.
Do not resist.
Arrest him!
Run for the trees!
What are you doing?
Arrest him!
Let me go!
Sasuke!
I've come to help you, though earlier than I had promised.
I remember no such promise.
I must discuss something with you, but first we must deal with them.
Even if you get the girl back, can you outrun them with her in tow?
Look at that demon Genba's men!
Retreat!
- What's your answer?
- I made no promises.
Then I'll pay you 300 kan.
I don't trust you.
Did you kill Mitsuaki and Okiwa?
I already told you no.
She'd already bled to death when I arrived.
Was she your woman?
I need no woman.
I'll add another 100 kan.
Where is Tatewaki?
- I don't want money.
- Then what?
I want to rescue her.
Hey you, Stutterer.
And you, Sato.
Go with Sasuke.
Obey his orders as if they were mine.
These two follow orders to the letter.
Make full use of them.
The three of you can get her back.
Where was she taken?
We applied a scent to her clothing.
Sato can track it.
This is all I can do.
Genba claims to be on our side, but he hates us who work for the shogunate as if we were snakes.
Most of the provincial lords are like that.
Despised throughout the country in which we do our work.
- Your work for what?
- Who are you to talk?
Your work is for nothing more than a woman.
And yours for nothing more than the power of the Tokugawa, and Toyotomi for nothing more than his own glory.
Don't you understand?
This will tell you where to find Tatewaki.
Is this Genba's manor?
No, it belongs to one of his men.
Where are they?
What is it?
You're mute?
They're waiting for Genba.
Then we must move quickly.
Where do you suspect she is?
The warehouse?
One of you create a diversion in that woman's bedroom.
Now! Lead them away to the front gate.
An intruder!
Get him!
Omiyo.
Omiyo.
It's me - Sasuke.
We must hurry.
Come on. Hurry.
Sasuke, look.
Over there.
Yashiro Kobayashi.
Yashiro Kobayashi.
Where did he go?
That way!
- Did you find him?
- No.
That way!
We can't escape unless I kill some of them.
Take Yashiro to the gate.
There he is!
Pull back!
Use bows and arrows!
Run to the gate!
Aim!
Fool!
Now, Omiyo!
Who are you, friend or foe?
Lord Horikawa!
Omiyo, don't let your guard down with him.
Yashiro!
Grandfather, is my father -
Is my father all right?
Where is he?
We haven't found him, but I'm sure we will.
Who is his father?
My son, Tatewaki Koriyama.
Tatewaki abandoned his faith and joined the Yagyu clan.
Naturally, our relations were severed.
But Yashiro was brought up in the Christian faith and is loyal to it.
He alone escaped
Edo's oppression.
Tatewaki saw his son's faith as a liability to himself.
Yet no parent can stop loving his own child, so he asked Mitsuaki to recommend his son to Osaka.
Mitsuaki and I belonged to a clan that served Toyotomi.
But Mitsuaki betrayed your grandson.
I saw my grandson arrested by Genba in the post town.
I didn't have my men with me.
Even with them we wouldn't have been able to escape Genba's forces.
I waited impatiently for a chance to rescue Yashiro.
Was it you who killed Mitsuaki?
No.
Why harbor hatred for a double-dealer like him?
Where is Tatewaki?
I thought you knew.
Perhaps he hesitates to burden me with his troubles, so he hasn't let me know where he is.
But aren't I his father?
Isn't Yashiro his son?
What will you do now?
I don't know.
I want to go west and find a place where we three can live in peace.
Perhaps that's just a dream in such a harsh world.
Jinnai.
It's dangerous for you here.
Genba's men will arrive soon.
Go to Yokokawa.
You'll find a man named
Saizo Kirigakure at a shrine there.
He will help you safely out of the Suwa area.
So you'll help us?
Hurry.
What about you?
I'll find Tatewaki.
No, you mustn't stay.
Let's escape together.
Come with us, Omiyo.
Genba went to Joshin Temple to force the priest to tell him where Tatewaki and Sasuke were, and then tortured him to death.
The priest is dead?
At long last
I know clearly who I am.
At last I understand what I must do.
I must not run.
I cannot run.
Use my men.
And please find my son.
I will.
Sasuke!
Is it true Horikawa betrayed us?
"Betray" is a strange choice of words.
You planned to start a war here in Suwa using Horikawa's influence.
But he didn't believe you and left.
That reflects distrust of you, not of Toyotomi.
Say what you want about us, but I can't forgive an insult to Toyotomi.
That's right.
We've left your Lord Yukimura alone until now.
But if he gets in our way, we'll attack without mercy.
I don't doubt your loyalty to Toyotomi.
But I dislike you.
That's all.
Why did you return?
Tatewaki.
You know where he is?
I believe Tatewaki may have killed
Okiwa and Mitsuaki.
You said Takatani was the culprit.
He might be.
Where is Tatewaki?
The singing has started.
There's a festival tonight.
The dancers will attend the festival.
It will be quite noisy.
What is it?
What are you thinking?
"I have waited but can wait no longer:
I'm going to Yashiro."
That's a line from the letter.
You decoded two words from the letter, that is, "Kadoya Inn."
But read what comes after that.
"I'm going to Yashiro."
Yashiro can mean "shrine."
- Maybe he means the Suwa shrine!
- He's going to the shrine.
Where is Tatewaki?
- That's it!
- What?
The best place to hide is in a large crowd.
We must find him before Takatani does.
Sakon will kill Tatewaki.
If a fight breaks out, Genba's men will arrive. We'll be in danger.
I heard they were guarding all the important parts of town.
We can't move about freely.
I thought I had decoded everything in that letter.
But there's more to it.
- What?
The line with "Kadoya Inn."
In this case, "Kado" means a diamond-shaped crest.
That is Tatewaki's signal.
So if we see a diamond, we'll know it's him.
I'll go that way.
Very well. Go.
Lord Koriyama.
Who are you?
Sasuke Sarutobi.
I am Tatewaki Koriyama.
I'm glad to meet you.
Is that so?
I'll go to Yokokawa.
Thank you for everything.
What about Koremura?
I asked you to help me.
But I didn't ask
Koremura and Nojiri.
Let's go.
Wait. Can you walk?
Were I in good health,
I wouldn't have asked for help.
Takatani pursued me as I left Edo.
We fought and I barely escaped.
He's a fearsome man.
Lean on my shoulder.
Sasuke... don't you hate me?
Many Sanada men were killed on my orders.
I've never forgiven you as chief of espionage.
But as a man, I see you as Jinnai's son and Yashiro's father.
It's been a long time, Tatewaki.
We were very close friends, but I didn't get to bid you a proper farewell.
I regret that.
Tonight we do things properly.
Stay out of this, Sasuke!
Tatewaki, escape into the crowd!
Stutterer! Sato!
Go! I don't want to kill you!
He went that way!
After him!
Out of my way!
Hurry! Hurry!
Arrest the rioters!
Kill them if necessary!
Kill them!
Show no mercy!
Who's that?
Are you Sakon Takatani?
And you're Shigeyuki Koremura.
"Seal your lips tight."
Sasuke.
What?
You're a strange man.
You truly are.
Hang on, Yashiro.
The pass is near.
We're near the Fukashi clan's domain.
Just a little longer, Yashiro.
Soon you can rest as long as you want.
He can't go on like this.
Genba's men may overtake us.
I'll hurry ahead and meet
Saizo Kirigakure at Seba.
With his help, we'll be safe.
Take me with you.
Omiyo.
We'll be there soon.
Catch your breath as we walk.
We've passed the border.
Hold on, Yashiro.
Omiyo, when I return home to Kudosan -
Will you marry me?
There's no war in Kudosan, is there?
I can't take this anymore.
You walk quickly.
Go on ahead.
Leave here now.
What's wrong?
The man who killed
Mitsuaki and Okiwa is you, Nojiri.
It can't be!
You're mad, Sasuke.
I was such a fool.
I should've figured out sooner this was all part of your plan.
As for Tatewaki's letter to me, you killed Mitsuaki and took it from him.
I should've realized that.
How can you talk such nonsense?
And without proof!
Mitsuaki and Okiwa were killed with throwing knives.
Takatani was a leper.
He couldn't have thrown a knife with his bandaged hand.
Tatewaki lost his right hand.
Of course there were other suspects, such as Genba, Koremura and Horikawa.
But what did you say about the way Okiwa died?
"She died with a knife in her throat."
Omiyo heard it too.
You said you saw her after I had left the inn.
But when I saw her, she had the knife in her hand.
Takatani said the same.
After you stabbed her,
Okiwa somehow drew it from her throat.
It was then the blood spurted out, forming a pool.
Was Okiwa your woman?
I felt it when I saw you dancing.
Were you once a professional entertainer?
Or had you worked with Okiwa as a dancer?
You used her and then murdered her in a most brutal way.
Her will to live made me think of your words.
You're actually Kanto's - no, Yagyu's spy, aren't you?
Ridiculous.
How did Genba know where Omiyo and I were?
Why was Takatani at the shrine?
They couldn't have decoded that letter.
You told them.
Sasuke,
I'll kill you, and the girl too.
I already killed Tatewaki.
I have a secret document in my sleeve.
It details the movements of all secret agents working for both Kanto and Osaka.
Koremura and Takatani are nothing now.
With this document,
I can even topple Yagyu.
I will rule over all the spies working in the shadows throughout Japan.
I will decide whether there is war or peace.
I, the son of a wandering dancer.
You're pitiful.
You spies like to talk big, don't you?
Sasuke, how many people have you killed since last night?
Saizo Kirigakure!
Six months later, the Winter War took place in Osaka.
The Sanada clan was approached by both sides
but allied itself with Toyotomi against Tokugawa.
But there is no record
that Sasuke Sarutobi fought in Sanada's army.
THE END
It is cherry blossom time
In Katsushika town
It is 20 years ago. My old man and I had a big fiight
He knocked my head all bloody so I left home
I swore I'd never return again
But cherry blossoms reminded me ofhome
And the time we kids played at parks
River banks, and the temple
My parents and brother died
Only my sister's left. I heard
Still I didn't feel like returning, so I keep my silence
But now I'm looking at my birthplace
I feel something warm welling up in me
Yes, I was born in Shibamata at Katsushika, in Tokyo
Tora-San Our lovable tramp

Theirwhole family's coming
I can't help it
We can't postpone it for his hangover
It'll ruin the marriage-meeting ifyou go alone!
I don't mind. My Chief's idea
Don't saythat! Have you had a better offer?
What'll I dothen?

He's a fool!
I reminded him last night!
Aunt, what's up?

Her company's...
You be still! You worthless drunk!
Don't shout. My head aches
What?
Now, now, don't fiight. What's up?
It's a wonderful offer!
Oriental's subcontractor likes hervery much
He wants herfor his son's wife
Your uncle was to gowith hertoday, but he drank too much
She says she'll go alone
I'm not interested anyway
You mean marriage-meetings are old hat?
Is that what you think?
Isn't it a mistake?
Yes, we told herthat too
Tora, will you go in my place?
Me?
Yes, it'd be a great help
Frankly, it's at a hotel
I don't want to shame Sakura
I'm not used tofiine hotels
Tora'd bejust right. Her brother
Aren't you busy?
No, I wasjust brushing myteeth
Hotel's English, but don't let it surprise you
Inn for lovers are called hotels now
Don't be scared!
That
The hotel
What is it?
You must be happyyour brother's back

Well...books mostly
Publications?
Well, yes. Law and statistics too
Well, well
English, hypnotism, moxibustion dreamreading, mental tests also
Nursing, taking out stains, suicide tales whodunits, and soforth
Nothing to it. It's stupid work
A drink to get acquainted
Please drink
In March each year, there's a personnel reshuffle
All the Chiefs want Sakura then
Chief. Personnel calls it the Stove League
Orders come out during cherry blossom time
I'm sorry
Sakura (cherry) is an unusual name.
Yourfather named you?
Yes, but written in Chinese letter
Yes, that's so
Like Cherry in Cherry Blossoms?
People think her surname's her name too
Kuruma Sakura's funny, they say
I see!
Sakura's funnywritten in Japanese
Pulled apart, it can mean,
I'm worried about the girl upstairs.
That's good
Good, isn't it?
Chinese letters are fun
Corpse and Water become urine
Corpse and Rice become dung.
The funniest is Corpse and two Hee. Hee
I guess fart sounds like that to some people
Say, you!
Beer?
No, thanks
I see. Fine as a cat with furfull ofashes
Laughing. It's funny?
There's more. The cat fell in the horse manure.
Not very elegant?
Sake!
Strange, isn't it, for a pretty girl... to have a brotherwith a beat-up face?
Isn't it, Pal?
No, it's...
No, it isn't
Nowonder. She's my half-sister
You're tight
Tell us some othertime
No, I can't. Poor girl. I have to clear it up
My old man was a woman chaser
My old lady's a geisha
My old man told me he sired me when he was dead drunk
Not through
When my old man beat me up, he'd say...
I begot you when I was dead drunk, soyou're a fool.
It used to make me so mad!
He fathered me when he was drunk
Brother
Should've been serious!
Excuse me
Where to, Mother?
Toilet? Please. Please
Can't put offgoing there
Me too. I'll gotoo
Don't worry! Be right back!

Being fast is sort ofan art too.
Wish I could show you how fast I am
I'm going
Mother! Which way?
Listen, where's the toilet?
We're back!
Don't worry! I went alone with her!
So it was a great success! Through
Is it true? A success?
I wonder. Afailure?
Don't you cry, sister ofmine...
Who's wetting myfence?

I was born and bred in Shibamata,
Katsushika, Tokyo
I'm Torajiro Kuruma, but called Hippie Tora!
Like you, Tokyo ofthe neon lights andjazz is my abode now
Fate threw us together 'V
I'm working like everything for my only sister
Whether I travel west or east
I'm always indebted tothe local folks
Please rememberyours trulythe Ugly Japanese, and help me!
Tea
Excuse me
I'm sorry about yesterday
No, no. Sit down
Hard getting him home?
Mr. Kamakura was here.
He asked to be remembertoyou
So I'll give you the answerfiirst

Yes. I'm sorry
It's all right. I knew it.
I see
I'm sorry
It's all right
Magazines, folks
Dirt cheap. A big bargain
All sorts ofmagazine
All cheap
Lousy sales pitch!
Can't you do better? Dummy!
Pal? Pal Tora?
I searched foryou!
You're trash! I said go home and help yourfolks!
I'm desperate! Take your pick!
So desperate I'd bite into a sun-ripened eggplant!
But can't with store-bought teeth!
Girls, made up pretty,
Would pay 500 or 600 yen at department stores!
Know why it's cheap?
A bookstore couldn't paytax 'V a sacrifiice sale!
$D400! $D300! $D200! $D100! How about it?
You still won't buy? All right then!
I'm back! ls my sister in?
There you are!
Don't hold back! Come in!
I'll introduce toyou to sis. Hurry up!
Pretty?
She's working in an offiice. She's way above you.
Noboru's like a brother
He's a fool that you can see, but the poor devil has nofamily
We're going towork together, so look after him
Why are you looking so sunk? What's up?
How can you act so unconcerned? Apologize!
What's bugging you?
Sakura's marriage! She was turned down!
She was? She was turned down?
Isn't she plain lucky?
That immature slob!
She'll have a string ofsuitors
A hard time refusing them!
I see. That's whyyou were drinking?
Like a desperate egg-plant
Dark and good to eat
But can't with store teeth!
Stop it, fools!
Let me talk!
Tora, she was turned down because ofyou!
She can't expect a better offer!
Frankly, Sakura's an orphan and has no dowry.
When it came to marriage, it's been harderthan we'd care to say!
Speak right up then!
She can't marry because ofme?
Stop it. I'm resigned to it
Yes, that's important
And you asked me to goto the marriage-meeting. Griping hag
What's that? Hag?
Mad, old fossil?
How can you?
You're indebted to him! Apologize!
Apologize? Only a kid sister- don't be fresh!
You are! Acting the big brother!
Don't you know how you've made me worry?
How dare you slap her?
Don't be rough!
What're you? Afactory hand?
Go ahead, Hiroshi! You've my permission!
Give it to him good!
Sure, go ahead! What have I done anyway?
Try and hit me!
Stop
How about it? Did it hurt? I didn't hit you!
It was your dead father's fiist!
A laugh! His hurt more!
When you left, your pa was worried sick!
When I saw you again,
I thought he'd be so happy ifhe could see you!
But I'm glad he's dead!
I bet he'd think sotoo ifhe saw you like this!
He's thinking so underthe sod!
Sakura, my medicine
What is it?
Pull yourselftogether!
Don't stare!
Is Uncle all right?
Yes, he is
Let me!
Sakura!
It's late!
Hurry! You'll be late forwork!
My brother left!
Sis. I'm sorry about last night.
I'm going away but I'll always be praying your happiness.
Take care of Noboru for me. Goodbye.
Yourfoolish brother, Torajiro.
There he is!

Don't mind! Go on!
Pal! Have a heart! Don't leave me behind!
Brother! Don't go!
Boatman! Come back!
Don't go back even ifthey call you
You wouldn't know but mine's a hard world
Brother!
Why are you going away?
ONE MONTH LATER
Special letter
Special delivery? Whofrom?
From Fuyuko Tsubouchi in Nara.
The priest's daughter
Miss Tsubouchi?
You read it.
Are you all well?
I have been in Nara almost 3 months.
I am well now and Father has come for me, so I am coming home.
Today, while I was showing father around, we ran into a rate man.
It seems sofunny remembering it.
Not tired?
No
It's very noisy around here
Hey, Tora-san!
Yes
Beautiful, fiine, fiine
Even beauty has its drawbacks
Beautiful but I'm all fagged out
No decent meals
But you folks eat steaks
Right, Master?
The good priest!
Well, well, how doyou do
Thank you forthat time
Here to see how people live?
Why're you here? Your relatives are worried
I was selling things in Kyoto
I got hold with them - Take them here and there
You do get around. She's beautiful. I'll leave now
Fool! My daughter!
Forget? You nicknamed her Popeye and teased her
Popeye!
You remember him?
Yes. You're Tora? You haven't changed at all
He left the foreigners and stayed with us all day long
Here I go. Please smile
Please smile, sir
I've none ofyou smiling
Yes, a pokerface. Smile
Be still! I'll smile! Hurry!
Really?
Smile. Smile now
Butter
What's that?
Anyway, hurry!
Butter!
What's the matter?
It's cheese. You mean cheese?
What about cheese?
Never mind! Hurry!
Yes, yes, here I go smile, please.
Butter
Ifyou'll excuse me...
Tora, not returning to Shibamata
So, please excuse me
Why? Wouldn't Sakura want you to?
She can't even marrywith a brother like me
He knows about it
I won't insist, but live decently
You'll be laughed at wearing those
Thank you foryour kindness
Please be good to Sakura
Not going home? It's a shame
Ifyou'll excuse me...
Tora
Leaving at 9 tomorrow.
Call me ifyou change you mind
Yes
Thank you
Sowe parted from Tora.
We goto Kishu tomorrow
We may be home before this card reaches you.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
What's he doing in Nara?
Selling kimono goods?
Imitation silk, I'll bet
He's a fool, a real fool
He should help out here
Shouldn't he?
Maybe he can't live a decent live
He must know it
Excuse me
200 yen's worth ofsweets, please
200 yen's worth ofsweets, please
You will? Thanks
Go out the back way. It's nearer
I see. Thanks
Humming. She likes him too?
Yes. Leave them alone. It maywork out
Leave them alone?
Tora would ruin it
Miss!
I'm back. How doyou do
Welcome back
You seem verywell
We were talking about you. Please
Received your card today
I see. You're both well?
Yes, thank you. The good priest?
He's tired. He sent his regards
I see. Thank you
Say, tea
You must be tired
You saw Tora overthere?
Yes, accidentally
I see
He up and left a month ago.
We've noword from him since
We've been worried about him. Is the fool well?
Miss, I saw the good priest and the luggage safely home
He's pretty old
His hips hurt, his knees knock - a bother
Hi, Uncle and Aunt. You're well? I see. Good.
Miss told you? So I'll stay a few day
It's burning
I missed this place. It hasn't changed a bit
Just an old dump.
See the people here are creaking too
Sakura home?
I'd like to see her. At work?
She's home...
She is?
Sakura!
Brother!
Sakura
What happened? Back so suddenly!
See Fuyuko? And then?
Worried about you, so I tagged along
After her? I see
Fuyuko...?
She's here
Shop?
Back? It's nice!
Sakura was worried
Sakura?
Acting familiar!
Don't come into other people's yard!
Don't think you can hook Sakura!
A college graduate for her!
She's too good forfactory hands!
Ifyou know, get lost! She's not married yet
Don't gape
Tora!
I'm leaving
You are?
Pal!
You still alive?
Miss! A present!
He's a fool, really a fool
Hi. Gain a lot!
What's up? Still a fool?
That scum! Only a gangster!
Big trouble!
My men went to Edogawa
Rivertofiight Tora! What'll we do?
Tell the police? A goryfiight?
Think so? It's terrible!
Say, stop fiighting! Don't fiight!
Hey, acting like a pup caught bythe pound man!
Tora and your man's talking it out!
Is Hiroshi safe?
Simmer down!
Is he safe?
Hiroshi's okay. He can handle a couple ofmen like him!
Any complaints?
Sakura's husband must be a university man?
Sure! Griping? Fight it out then?
Tell me. Are you a university graduate?
For instance, you love someone
What would you do ifher brother said that toyou?
What? I love someone and her brother...?
Fool! Got none! Don'tjoke!
But ifyou did, you'd feel like I do
Stopjoking!
Not me! Don't insult me!
Why?
Why? You're dumb
We're not the same
If I eat a potato, would it make you fart?
See? Just horse sense is no help!
Speak up!
Brother. A question
Ever been in love?
How about it? Not even once?
Ifyou're a man, you must've loved someone deeply once. Have you?
What, you bum? You're in love with Sakura, aren't you?
Talking about love and a whole lot ofnonsense!
In a word, you want to marry her?
I wouldn't go sofar...
Not in love?
Yes, I love her
What then? Make yourselfclear!
So as I said, I've nofamily and
I'm not a university graduate...
See here, you. Can't you marry ifyou're not?
I see. That's your rule?
So brother, l...!
Don't call me Brother so easy like!
Okay, then, go ahead
It's a democracy. Dating, kissing, petting - give herthe works
Yes
Yes? Can you hook a girl with you face?
Sakura's got a strong mind. You're confiident?
No
No? Awful ifshe turns you down
You make me cry! I'll give you some pointers
Please, Brother
Too soon to call me that!
In short, the eyes catch girls
I don't mean to stare like this.
They'd think you're crazy
Sojust a quick glance
Like this
I'll pierce her like Cupid's arrow
So she looks at you
Quick, you look down
She'll look surprised
Meet her eyes then, don't let them go
Gaze at herwistfully, longingly, asking herto pamperyou
I'll mesmerize her
So give a last push --- talk with your eyes with my eyes
Sure, theytalk. Watch me
Theytalked?
About what?
What? Oat! They said, I love you!
What is it? Dust in your eyes?
No. Dusty here now, isn't it?
Not here
It's caught. I'll turn it around
Tora!
Don't move, Miss!
Brother
What is it?
Came for a look see
A big company. How many employees?
About 1200 here
Men all university grads?
Most ofthem
Great
Why'd you come here?
I just dropped in
I'd better run along
Leaving?
That reminds me. What doyou think about that?
That?
You know. Hiroshi next door
What about him?
Nothing. Just asking
Impossible?
What doyou mean?
Nothing. Nothing at all
Are the toilets here foreign ones?
Yes. Why?
Nothing
My regards tothe president
Sorryto botheryou
Working overtime, men?
Fine, fiine. Work beats poverty any day
How was it?
Nothing doing.
Give up. No hope
Did you ask her?
Sure thing. You're notalker so I put it to her good
That I want to marry her?
Sure, but there's no chance
I see
Cheer up. Let's gofor a drink
Torajiro
Here we go. Getting formal on me. What is it?
Have you ever been in love?
I know. I know how you feel
Go ahead, cry. Have a good cry
Say, don't stand around! It's nofree show!
Get towork, lazy pigs!
Noworkmen's spirit?
What's the matter?
I can see yourwindow from my room
When I wake up I watch you
You open the curtains, yawn and put awaythe bedding
On Sundays, you sing
On winter nights, you read and cry
During my 3 years in the factory
I enjoyed seeing you every morning!
It was the onlything I looked forward to!
I'm leaving but please become happy!
Goodbye
What's going on? What did he come here to say?
Brother, what happen inside the factory?
Nothing,...what did he say?
He said he will leave here!
What?
Brother, wait a minute!
Tora, what have you did to him?
What's the matter, yourface is so red?
Nojokes anymore, he wanted to resign!
What?
Without him, the factorywill be fiinish
That's a good thing?
He needn't slave in a dirty place
Tell him I praised him.
What?
Brother!
Tell me what you said and did.
Nothing much. I said to give you up
Can't be helped?
Then coming to my offiice...?
Yes. You behaved coldly
I didn't!
Boss! Hiroshi really left!
Is it true?
Leave him be!
Fool! You big fool!
Hiroshi!
I was thinking ofSakura's happiness!
Don't meddle!
What? Me meddle?
Yes! lfyou hadn't, it would've turned out well!
Fool! It's a laugh!
What lout can't even hold hands!
Hiroshi a lout?
He's my chiefengineer!
We mayfold up without him!
Good. More sunshine!
Repeat that!
Didn't get me? More sunshine then!
You don't know how hard it is for small enterprises!
Pal!
Shut up!
Get out!
Yes, that's best!
It wouldn't have happened ifyou hadn't come back!
That does it!
Kicking me out?
It's the end ifyou say it!
Okay. I'm the odd man here!
I'll never come back!
Shut up!
Tothink you'd say it!
I'm back
Brother. I'm going to marry Hiroshi
We're engaged
Boss! Hiroshi's back!
Really?
You don't mind? Doyou, Brother?
Thanks
Where were you? They're waiting!
I know! I know!
I clean forgot my note was due today!
The go-between?
I'm here!
Octopus! Where were you hiding?
Making people worry! Ruining the wedding?
It's beginning!
Why're you here? Go away!
First...!
What is it?
Please introduce both families
Wait. Both families?
A mistake? His old man's farming in Hokkaido
After a fiight, he cut offhis ties with him
So he wouldn't come
A mistake. Let's go
Tora, see him and then...
Say, girl. No, no, a mistake
I'm sorry, Mister
Father
I'm his father
I'm his mother
Suwa...Honorary Professor
How doyou read his name?
I don't know
He didn't want to come
Afiine professor!
A phony?
Ready?
I'll take you. Please smile
Butter!
I was bad awhile and was expelled from school
He cut me offthen! want no part ofhim!
But he came from Hokkaido?
Just for appearance's sake!
But...
Brother?
Starting pretty soon
I understand
I knew he lacked manners
Don't worry. Leave it to me. I'll handle it
Please applaud!
The groom, Hiroshi...Suwa
He was born in lshikari County...the 3rd son...
I'm sorry I'm such a poor go-between
Stupid octopus!
Hiroshi and Sakura quarreled
Sorry! A mistake
I mean theyfell in love after he had a big fiight with her brother
It started when her brother said nofactory hand could marry his sister
I didn't!
Unlike Torajiro, Sakura was a gentle and warm-hearted child
She'd go out and crywith him when he cried, scolded by his father
She was like that
On the other hand, Torajiro...
You're too slow
That face --- Iaughing at a poor man's wedding!
Ifhe speaks, he'd insult us! Don't let him!
We have to. The groom's father
No, let me talk!
I'll tell him what's what!
You against it?
No, no. After his father
I'm last?
Okay, fiine. Forget and I'll bust your head!
It was a very nice wedding
And now, a word from the parents ofthe newlyweds
First, Hiroshi's father, Mr. 'K lchiro Suwa
Ordinarily, as the father ofthe groom
I should thank you all
But we do not have the right to do so
But even parents like us feel like all parents
In all frankness, I saw my son for the fiirst time in 8 years
Watching him surrounded byyourfriendship and Sakura's gentle love...
I can hardly bearthe shame I feel
What did I dofor my son as a parent?
My guilty conscience tells me what an inadequate father I was
I know mywife who is beside me is thinking the same thing
These 8 years were a long, long winterto us.
But due toyou, spring is coming to us at last
I thank you, everyone
Sakura
Please take care of Hiroshi
Sakura's brother. Please keep an eye on both ofthem
Wait!
Father!
Mother!
Thank you!
I know Hiroshi is very happy!
Thank you!
Sakura!
Sakura, isn't it nice?
Thank you! Thank you!
I'm back!
Took the sweets tothe temple
Thanks. Was Miss in?
Yes. She said you must be lonelywithout Sakura
She's gentle
Pal?
He's around?
Pal, Miss said you must be lonelytoo.
Joking? Feels nice without that tomboy!
That so?
She said to come over
Going out, Uncle
Sure
Not much ofan errand.
Having mywatch repaired
I see. Gothen
Oh, yes, the temple wants their bath fiixed, so I'll go over
Yes, gothere
Thanks
Why'd you say, Thanks for?
Why?
Trying to needle me?
No. I'm sorry if I upset you. I didn't mean to
Just soyou know
Goodbye
Take yourtime
Take mytime?
I said I'd be right back!
I've notime to loaf! What doyou mean?
I'm sorry
Now, now, he meant no harm
Noboru apologized
Just so he knows
I'm going
Yes, do
When she was at home,
I thought Sakura noisy and bossy
But the house seems deserted now that she's gone
I know. Especially since she's your only kin
That's right
You're thinner?
Yes, about 8 pounds
You're pale too
No appetite
That's bad! You'll become sick!
All right?
I expect so
Who's he?
Listen...let's go and chase awaythe blues
I feel depressed too
Let's go
Quick! Quick
Well done
I'll treat you. I won $D2000
This dump?
Never mind
Eat it while it's hot. It's good
Good?
It's good
Sure. Cat's inside
No, it isn't!
Fooling her again! Saw you strangle one!
Can't fool me, I know!
Why can't I sing?
Whistling was a childhood friend.
Whistling whenever I chose
Everybody's asleep
Shall we goto sleep too?
Yes
Tora, goodbye
This
Thanks
Good night
Goodbye!
I could killer her, loving her so
But I nevertouch her, you know
Laugh at me a sentimental fool
I'm nowolf, I play it cool
It's the rule that I live by...
I'm home
What the... The stair's over here
He's a really a fool
Hot every day, isn't it?
Excuse me. Going fiishing with Miss
Fool! Where are your eyes?
Watch out, dim it!
A guest?
I'm sorry. I promised to gotoday?
It's all right. Please, please
I'm sorry!
Going home?
A relative?
Yes, he's going to become one
Fuyuko's future husband
Had a hard time, but I found a good man
Don't tell anyone yet
I could kill her, loving her so...
Miss, laugh at me
I could die, loving you so...
Thank you
This one?
You may break it?
Oh sorry!
You're back?
Sakura, when'd you get back?
Late yesterday
I see. A nice honeymoon?
Yes. Thank you for everything
No at all. Fine, fiine!
Is Tora back, Noboru?
At the temple. He promised Miss
It's awful. Sakura!
I saw Miss Fuyuko's groom at the temple
She has one?
University professor. Afiine man
So?
Tora ran intothem
Oh, no!
Gen told me.
Where is he?
He left, his face pale as a ghost
He won't drown himself?.
Hardly
He will rave tonight. I beg out
Awful! Awful!
Does he love her so much?
Does he? I'll say. Doesn't he?
Everybody knows he went there every day afteryourwedding
There's gossip?
Only he didn't knew
Miss is so gentle, she didn't mind, I guess
But he was a nuisance
Miss should have told him off!
She's to blame too
No! It was Tora's mistake tofall in love with her
That's so
He fault, so he can't complain
But it's troublesome
Sakura, get me my pillow. I feel sort oftired
Poor man. I wonderwhat he's doing
What's he doing? He's really a fool
Don't saythat. He's my brother
But he's a fool.
You were back?
Yes
What were you doing?
I don't know
Here all along?
I heard
Don't laugh!
Boss! Phone!
Say! Phone call!
We got back last night. Thanks a lot
I see. That's fiine. Fine
What's up?
Nothing
What would there be?
Pal
I'm in pain
Medicine for my heart
What happened?
Where to?
Atrip
I meant to, anyway
Brother, I don't know what to say
Never mind
You're really mad?
Forgot it. It's one ofthose things
A lie. you're really angry
You've no place to go!
You're a fool!
Listen, Tora! Really going away?
Pal!
Hachinoe?
Your home's there?
So go home. Be a good son
But Pal!
Get this, kid. It's about time you thought ofyour age
Can't even sell stuffand tagging along
Everthink how you'll end up?
What'll you do? End up like me?
Yes, I want to be like you
Fool!
Become a fool like me? You that big a fool?
Pal! Take me along with you!
Fool! Don't act like a spoiled brat!
Want the truth? I'm sick and tired ofyour sugaryface!
Get lost!
Get lost, I said!
I will! That suit you?
What're you gaping at? It's no show!
ONE YEAR LATER
The baby's smiling. It's smiling at me
Good baby. Good baby
Who does he take after?
Again?
Never mind!
How about it?
Well...not exactly like Sakura...
Not like Hiroshi either
But like someone?
Stop it, Aunt!
Whothen?
It's Tora
Yes, you're right
Oh, no!
A card foryour daughter
I'll send it on to her. Leave it
Is she well?
Yes, getting along fiine.
She's plumper, she says
Now, now, don't cry, Tora. Don't cry!
Dear Mrs. Tsubouchi:
I haven't written toyou a long time.
It's over a year since I left home.
Time does fly. I heard my sister has a child and I am very happy.
A stupid sister but my only kin, so pleased be good to her.
When I think back,
I'm ashamed ofmanythings.
So I spend my days with Noboru regretting what I did.
I beg you toforget them toofrom the bottom ofmy heart.
Girls, made up pretty,
A bookstore couldn't paytax 'V a sacrifiice sale!
$D400! $D300! $D200! $D100! How about it?
You still won't buy? All right then!
I'm desperate! Take your pick!
So desperate I'd bite into a sun-ripened eggplant!
But can't with store-bought teeth!

- Mornin'. Taxi?
- That's right.
- American?
- How d'you figure it out?
Your clothes don't fit proper!
- Maybe you can recommend a tailor.
- Too much responsibility.
Tailoring's personal.
You here on holiday?
Sorte. I'm going to the Witley place.
You're not.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing wrong.
- Can you tell me how to get there?
- No. Sorry, mate.
- I wonder if you could help me.
- Possibly.
I'm anxious to get to the Witley place.
Sorry. I can't help you.
Can you help me?
Excuse me. This man following me.
He's asking for the Witley place.
Here he comes.
Hello. Is there any place around here where I can rent an automobile?
No. Bicycle, maybe.
Where are you going?
- The Witley place.
- You're wasting your time.
- How d'you figure that?
- The Witley place!
He wants to go to the Witley place!
Anything wrong with wanting to go there?
- Is there anything wrong with that?
- Well, is there?
- Bicycle shop's down the street.
- "ls there?" he asks!
- Hello.
- Something you want?
I'd like to rent a bicycle for a few days.
Where would you be riding it?
I'll pay for it in advance.
- I asked where you'd be going.
- To the Witley place.
- I'd need a bicycle, wouldn't l?
- Yes.
And more than that.
You'll not be using one of mine.
Why? You've got loads.
I don't see anybody waiting.
- No bicycles for rent.
- What about the motor?
I've nothing for rent.
What will it cost to get to the Witley place?
More than anything you have to offer.
Why? What's the matter with everybody in this town?
Nothing's the matter. Here.
Just what's that supposed to mean?
It means the only way you can get to the Witley house from here is on your own two feet.
Hello?
Hello?
How do you do? There was no answer so I took the liberty of entering.
The signs clearly say to keep out.
You must have seen them.
Oh, yes. I saw them.
By what right have you entered this house?
- I've come to visit the Witleys.
- Oh? I am Nahum Witley.
Well, sir, actually it's Susan
I came to visit.
Susan? My daughter's not receiving visitors.
I must ask you to leave.
- This the way you treat your guests?
- Guests? Guests are invited.
- I don't remember inviting you.
- Oh, I have been invited.
By Mrs Witley.
"Stephen Reinhart".
You are Stephen Reinhart?
Uh, yeah. That's right.
My daughter did mention your name.
She met you in America at university?
- We were in the same science class.
- Science!
It would disturb Mrs Witley to see you.
Again, I must ask you to leave.
- It isn't her I've come to see.
- Quite impossible.
I will have Merwyn take you to the village.
Steve!
Susan will ask you to stay.
But for reasons I cannot go into,
I must insist you tell her that you have to leave at once. Merwyn!
Get the car.
Steve!
Susan!
- You look great!
- I thought you'd never get here.
- It's only been a month.
- Is that all?
- Father, this is Stephen Reinhart.
- I know.
- I must speak to you alone, Susan.
- I'll take him to meet Mother.
It's forbidden for your mother to have visitors.
Only for a minute.
Mother's been waiting to meet Steve.
I had no idea you lived in a house so, uh... sumptuous.
This is my great-grandfather, Elias Witley.
He built this house over 150 years ago.
This next one?
It's my grandfather, Corbin Witley.
Oh? What did he do?
He went insane.
We must get rid of him, Merwyn.
He must not stay.
Steve, you must understand about Mother. She's not well.
Mother?
Come in and close the door.
Mother, this is Stephen Reinhart.
We have been expecting you.
I'm, uh... I'm sorry you're not feeling well, Mrs Witley.
It will pass.
You are a welcome guest in this house, Mr Reinhart.
- Thank you.
- My husband will protest.
- But I shall speak to him. Susan?
- Yes?
I would like to speak to Stephen alone.
Yes, Mother.
Please, sit down.
I am glad that you have come at this time.
Merwyn!
Merwyn, are you all right?
Yes, sir.
I'm going to need your help.
You can trust me, sir.
- About what, Mrs Witley?
- Come here.
Closer.
That box, Mr Reinhart, there.
Open it.
- It's an earring.
- Yes.
It's an earring.
Take it out of the box. Examine it.
- Looks like gold.
- Yes. It's gold.
But its importance doesn't lie in the metal it is made of.
- I'm afraid I don't understand.
- Why should you?
You probably think this whole house is obsessed with mystery.
I tell you, that single earring you are holding is surrounded by mystery.
It... It belonged to my maid, Helga.
She was a nice simple girl and completely devoted to me.
Well, about a month ago, she went down with some terrible disease.
I begged her to go to the doctor in Arkham.
- Did she go?
- No.
No, I don't think she did.
Chains for devils!
Whatever it was, she seemed to be overcome by... by something, well... Well, it almost seemed like self-loathing.
She took to wearing a veil as if to hide herself from prying eyes.
Why, um...
Why is the earring so important?
About a fortnight ago, she came here to see me.
She was crying.
She said she was... she was frightened of what was happening to her.
- What was happening to her?
- I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Anyway, she left, and she dropped that earring.
Stephen, I haven't seen her since.
Well, perhaps Mr Witley knows.
My husband says he knows nothing.
Stephen, it's because of all these things that I had to be sure of you.
You are my one hope for Susan.
Take her away from here as soon as you can. Tomorrow. The next day.
You must promise me. My husband may not allow me to speak to you again.
I must have your promise now.
- What did you talk about?
- What? Oh! You.
I want you to know,
I have the parental blessing.
Well, half of it, anyway.
- My room's supposed to be down here.
- I'll show you.
This is the room. I'll have Merwyn bring up your case.
Susan, how long has your mother been like that?
Ill, you mean?
Well, that and the uh, darkened room, shaded bed.
Not long.
She's been worse the past few days.
And the doctor's forbidden her to have any visitors?
No, she hasn't seen a doctor.
Father wants to look after her himself.
- And what about Helga?
- Helga?
Why all these questions?
Your mother's very concerned about her.
She's disappeared.
Susan, what's going on here?
I don't know, Steve.
What else did you and Mother talk about?
Come here.
Your mother did ask whether my intentions were honourable.
- Are they, Steve?
- What do you think?
You shouldn't have invited Reinhart here.
You're a difficult woman, Letitia.
No. Not difficult.
Only afraid.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
The sins of the fathers, huh?
Well, let me warn you, nothing is going to deter me from my purpose.
- Yes, that's what Corbin said.
- He's dead, Letitia.
He's been dead for a long time.
If there was evil, it's buried with him.
All that remains of Corbin is a few harmless objects in the cellar.
- No! You know how light pains me!
- Why persist in this delusion?
Please, Nahum, close the curtains. Please.
I wonder if you realise how like Corbin you've become.
There's no similarity whatsoever.
I've uttered no incantations.
Neither have I cried out to any of the other so-called... creatures of evil.
- It's only your methods that differ.
- And do you know why?
Because I don't believe in it.
I never have believed in it.
It is you who would perpetuate these blasphemies, these absurdities.
Nahum, I saw your father change from an upright God-fearing man into an old man possessed of the devil.
Whatever happened to my father will not happen to me.
It's already happening.
I could see it happening to you,
Letitia, not to me.
It's happening to all of us.
There's evidence of it all around us.
There is nothing to do with Corbin Witley.
Corbin was invoking the dark powers when he died.
Now, his call is being answered.
So that is why you sent for Stephen Reinhart.
I sent for him to take Susan away.
- What have you told him?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
- I don't need to tell him anything.
- He can see for himself.
- I don't want him here.
- One way or another, he must leave.
- He is a guest here, Nahum.
I will not have him interfering.
Would you prefer that I went into the town and showed myself?
The once beautiful Letitia Witley.
Very well.
A day, perhaps, but no more.
Then he must leave.
Well, perhaps by then you will have seen the truth.
The truth?
The truth is that I see the future, and all that I've planned will fill it with a richness we've never known.
Yes, that is what you see.
All that I can see is horror.
Horror!
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a very large room.
Big enough for a king's banquet.
There used to be many parties here in my great-grandfather's time.
- But none since?
- None that I remember.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
Perhaps the name of Witley no longer commands the affection and respect it once did.
Is that why no one in the village would drive me out here?
- You had to walk all that way?
- Mm.
The villagers have no use for us,
Mr Reinhart. The feeling is mutual.
- Merwyn.
- Yes?
Has Mrs Witley had her dinner?
I placed a tray before her, but she didn't want it.
I'll take her up something a little later, Father.
What was that?
Uh, Mr Witley, I um... noticed a strange blackened area on the way to the house.
What happened there?
- There was a fire, Steve.
- A fire?
- Why do you say it like that?
- Well, did you see it?
No, but Father did.
- Why are you so curious?
- Everything is dead in the area.
Nothing grows.
I touched a branch and it fell to ashes.
My daughter had already told you.
There was a fire.
But, Mr Witley, no fire leaves a place like that.
Father's never allowed me to go on the heath.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
After the fire, some villagers disappeared there.
No one's ever explained what happened.
I think, Susan, you're inclined to exaggerate.
I would suggest that you both...
Merwyn!
- What's the matter with him?
- This has happened before.
- But he's unconscious.
- It's perfectly all right.
I know exactly what to do. Susan.
Come on, Steve.
Steve.
Mother? I've brought your dinner.
It's your favourite.
- Take it away.
- You must eat.
Sh.
Quiet, child.
Listen.
- What is it?
- Sh! Quiet.
Yes. Yes!
- Steve!
- What's wrong, honey?
- I saw something outside the window.
- What? Who?
I don't know, but something was staring at me.
Are you sure you weren't imagining it?
- Oh, I don't know. It's this house!
- What about this house, Susan?
There's something in it, something smothering.
- I'm taking you away.
- I wish I could...
- Tonight!
- I can't.
- Why?
- I can't leave Mother how she is.
First she couldn't stand the light.
Now she won't eat.
It was your mother who made me promise to take you away.
- I want to go.
- We're leaving right away.
- It's impossible.
- Tomorrow morning, then.
I'm afraid she won't be any better in the morning.
Oh, Steve. I wish I knew what to do.
- Steve!
- What?
The window!
- Nothing. It's your imagination.
- I'm not imagining it.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.
Now, you have to get some rest.
Oh, Steve. I love you.
And I love you.
Everything's gonna be all right.
It came from downstairs.
- Where does this go?
- It leads to Merwyn's room.
- Father!
- You shouldn't come here.
But the screaming and the noise.
It's Merwyn. He's dead.
It was terrible.
Please go back to your rooms.
Nobody can do anything to help now.
Now, wait a minute.
What's this all about? How did he die?
- He's been ill for a long time.
- Where's the body?
- That's none of your business.
- I think it is my business.
- No, Steve...
- You don't realise what's happened.
This is my house. I ask you to allow me to run my own affairs my own way.
- But a man is dead!
- Steve!
- Get dressed. We're gonna leave now.
- I can't leave now, Steve.
Please don't make trouble.
Good night.
Good night.
- Yes?
- Is the doctor in?
- Did you have an appointment?
- No, but I'd like to speak to him.
- Is it an emergency?
- It's important that I speak to him.
Come inside.
This way.
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Dr Henderson? Steve Reinhart.
I had to talk to you.
Nobody in the village recommended me,
I'm sure.
- I found you in the phone book.
- I've been out of practice for some time.
I didn't come to see you in your professional capacity.
I... Something funny's happening.
The family I'm staying with may be involved.
- Why come to me? Oh, drink?
- No, thanks. It's a little early.
I thought someone objective could help me, give me some information.
- About what?
- About the people I'm staying with.
Why was everyone frightened when I said where I was going?
Frightened? You're talking about the Witley place.
Only "Witley" could bring out that reaction.
- Can you tell me why?
- Sorry, I can't tell you anything.
An old man died out there last night.
I don't give one damn what happened there, neither does this village.
You're scared. You're a doctor, don't you have pride in what you are?
- I may have seen a murder.
- Murder?
- That's right.
- I'm sorry, I can't help. Go away.
You too. What's happened here?
Why is there that fear when "Witley" is mentioned?
Miss Bailey.
Will you show Mr Reinhart to the door?
You asked the doctor about the Witley place.
Can you tell me anything about it, anything about the Witleys?
Only this. Dr Henderson was a good doctor, a wonderful man.
Corbin Witley died in Dr Henderson's arms.
Dr Henderson returned from that visit and he's never been the same.
- What did Corbin Witley die from?
- It's never spoken of.
On the death certificate it said cerebral haemorrhage, but there was no autopsy because there was no funeral, and I'll tell you why.
With the exception of Dr Henderson, no one in the village saw the body.
I've said enough.
I've said more than I ought.
Mother?
Mother, please let me in.
- Susan, dear.
- I heard her moving about.
- Mother, please open this door.
- It's all right. I'll talk to her.
- I've tried to...
- I know, dear. Now, you go along.
I'll talk to her.
Letitia, I must speak to you.
It's very important.
Letitia!
But no one ever goes to the greenhouse at night.
If there was no one inside, why was there a light?
- A light?
- The entire greenhouse... the only word I can think of is glowed.
I've seen a glow like that before, in a radiation lab.
I don't understand. What were you doing outside last night?
- I was watching your father.
- Father?
- What was he doing?
- Burying Merwyn.
- Something else has happened, too.
- What?
I was attacked on the heath.
I'm sure it was Helga.
Oh, Steve.
What's happening?
- Why is the greenhouse locked?
- It never has been before.
- Well, it is now.
- Well, it shouldn't be.
- Have you been in it lately?
- Not since I've been back.
Come on.
Letitia, now listen to me.
It's very important.
I should have done this before.
I'm going to take you to the village, to see the doctor.
Letitia.
How long have these windows been whitewashed?
- They've always been whitewashed.
- There.
- I've never seen that lock before.
- Is there any other way in?
Steve, I don't think we should.
The answer to what's going on may be inside. We've got to get in.
I know a way.
When I was a child, I'd hide from
Merwyn when Mother sent him for me.
I used to get in somewhere here.
Here it is.
- I see it, but I don't believe it.
- How could plants grow like this?
It's fantastic!
Yeah.
How can this happen?
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Remember the cry we heard at dinner last night?
I heard one just like it this morning.
What's in there?
It used to be a potting shed.
Oh, come on, Steve!
It's dark in there, except for a kind of glow.
Oh, Steve! Please come away!
We can't. There's something going on that's affecting all your family.
We shouldn't.
If Father finds out he'll be furious.
Let him. We're not leaving with questions unanswered. Stay here.
No.
- I'm coming with you.
- OK. Come on.
- What is it?
- Those flickering colours.
It must be some kind of energy.
Uranium!
This room is being exposed to some form of radiation.
It's horrible.
It looks like a zoo in hell.
Oh, come on, Steve! Come on!
It's all right!
A menagerie of horrors.
What were they?
Genetic mutations, probably caused by radiation.
It's a scientific fact that exposure to radioactive energy can change characteristics of living things.
It's what happened to these plants, to those creatures.
The scent in here. It's so sweet.
It's sickening.
It's the effect of decay.
- Steve, what is it?
- There's something down here.
This stone's like the ones in the potting shed.
What is it, Steve?
I don't know. I've never seen anything like it before. I wonder if it's an element.
It's giving off heat!
Looks like it's been cut away from some larger stone.
There's one under every plant.
This is the answer. No doubt about it.
- The stones?
- Yeah.
They make everything in here grow this way?
Yeah, and in there, too.
Oh, but Steve!
If it does this to plants...
Exactly, if it affects plants this way after hours and days of exposure, what would it do to a human being?
Mother and Helga.
They worked in here.
Merwyn must have come in contact with these stones, or the larger one from which they were cut!
I wonder where the larger stone could be.
I don't know. In the cellar, perhaps.
- The cellar!
- There are many rooms down there.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Letitia.
Letitia!
That's the door.
- You stay here.
- You won't find the way.
- I will. Now, go upstairs.
- Oh, Steve. Be careful.
Don't worry.
Where's Reinhart?
I've been looking for him.
- What happened? Where have you been?
- The greenhouse.
- I put a lock on.
- I knew another way in.
- You had no right.
- Why have you kept it a secret?
- Was Reinhart with you?
- Yes.
- Is he still there?
- No.
Where is he? Where is he?
- You're hurting me!
- Tell me where he is.
- He's in the cellar.
- The cellar!
- Father!
- Stay there!
Get out of this room.
I said, get out.
No. Not until you listen to what I have to say.
- I'm in no mood for words!
- Would you prefer death?
- Don't threaten me.
- Everything in this house will die.
Get rid of that stone and the smaller ones, or this house will become like the burned-out area, those monstrosities.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- It destroyed Merwyn.
You want it to destroy your wife,
Susan, destroy you?
- No.
- Listen to that humming sound.
Look at the way it glows.
- It's only a stone. It's harmless.
- You don't believe that, Mr Witley.
You know what it can do.
You know Mrs Witley needs a doctor!
Susan. Are you all right?
- Susan!
- Oh, Steve.
What happened?
It's all right. I got you now.
Susan, are you all right?
- What happened to your mother?
- I don't know.
I heard her smashing things.
I tried to get her to come out.
And then the door burst open and I screamed.
I don't remember anything after that.
Can you get up now?
- I think so.
- Come on.
- Are you OK?
- I'll be all right.
I must find Letitia.
- I must help.
- No. Come on.
Letitia!
Letitia!
Come on.
Letitia!
Let's try this way.
Letitia!
Father?
It's only the wind. Come on.
Letitia.
Steve!
No!
Reinhart, get my daughter out of here.
Please take Susan away.
The evil that Corbin created has finally come to root here.
I refused to listen to her entreaties.
Now Letitia's paid with her life for Corbin's blasphemies.
And my own, too.
Mr Witley, blasphemy had nothing to do with it.
In my heart, I must have known that she was right.
It is as she said.
A curse is set upon this house.
How could I have been so blind as not to know that stone was sent from the other side by the hand of Corbin, reaching out from beyond the grave?
- A curse?
- What do you know of this house?
- Or the people who've lived in it?
- The stone was not sent by anyone.
It's easy for you to say that, but you didn't see it that Sunday morning, screaming out of the heavens to crash and bury itself in the heath.
It fell from the sky!
Then it was a meteorite.
I thought it was a gift from Heaven.
The people from the village came to see, but they wouldn't come near it.
They knew because the fear of Corbin was still in them.
The next morning, the heath was covered with a lush vegetation that should never have grown there.
Why did you bring it into the house?
Why?
Because I thought, as Corbin knew I would...
I thought I'd found a way to turn the wasteland into a place of beauty.
Great vineyards, gardens.
That was my dream.
I thought the name of Witley would mean something once again, and Corbin's iniquities would be atoned for.
Everyone he came in contact with was touched by it.
Father, please come back into the house.
Susan! Stephen, will you take Susan away, please?
What about you?
I will stay here to destroy this monstrous thing.
If you go near it, there can only be one result, and you know what it is.
You seem to forget this is my home.
I live here.
And l, like my father and his father before him, was born here.
I'm an old man and if I'm to die,
- I will die here.
- I'm not leaving without you, Father.
Susan, there's nothing we can do.
Let's go.
Something dreadful's going to happen.
Now, please!
Susan, go with Stephen.
Go away! Go away!
Come on. Let's go and pack.
Helga!
That'll do. Come on.
- Father!
- Stay here.
Mr Witley!
Susan! Get back!
Come on.
Get over there. When I say run, head for the door. Go ahead.
No!
Come on!
- Run, Susan! Run!
- Steve!
Susan! Susan! Hold on!
Oh, Steve.
We're going and we're not gonna look back.
I don't understand, Steve.
Why did all this have to happen?
I don't think it had to happen.
In scientific hands, your father's discovery could have been beneficial.
He used it to fight the only way he knew, for his house and the Witley name.
It was his choice and he made it.
Come on, let's get outta here.

A Hyogensha-ATG Production
Miss Tomioka?
How's the script going?
The suicide part is difficult
The lovers' suicide journey will be through a graveyard
You found a location?
In a ravine near Mt. Toribe in Kyoto
It's full of strange headstones
I think it's stale
But it captures the space on stage, the nothingness
There's something there
A sort of fetishism of space
The vivid contrast between that and the bodies of the couple
Can I see the photos?
A suicide sequence in Kabuki style won't do
You have to pull them in
It should be realistic
It shouldn't be as beautiful as death is in Kabuki
You don't have to follow the script for that scene
The words could be random
The essential image needs to be captured
- Let's talk about it later.
- No, I'll see you tomorrow
- I'll be waiting.
- Goodbye

Story by
MONZAEMON CHIKAMATSU
DOUBLE SUICIDE
A vow a month...
The 29th time
Though I vowed that I'd redeem you
The 30th will come next year
Next year?
It's already December
How long will I have to wait?
Well... I don't know
Are you going to desert me?
You despise me because
I can't redeem you
How could you say that when I love you so?
Jihei
As a courtesan, I must entertain customers
How I hate myself!
You may think my promises to be a courtesan's silly talk
No, Koharu
Did I ever doubt your love?
Even as I see you
I worry about money to see you again
I want to take you as soon as possible, but
I still can't redeem the woman I love
I fear you won't love me any more
The body was bought with money
I've never hated it as much as I do now
I'm bound by money from head to toe
Who thought of selling women as courtesans?
I wish I could raise the money.
But I can't live without you
Neither can I.
What shall we do?
We can't run away together
I want to stay with you like this forever
So do I.
But why do you love me?
Because you're a woman and I'm a man
I'm glad you're a woman
But a courtesan must not fall in love
You regret it?
I want to die.
Can I die with you?
- Can I?
- Jihei, what can we do?
Meeting is joy and pain.
My Koharu!
Good evening
Koharu, we've been waiting for you
I'm so glad you agreed to come
As the weather changes every day
My mood often changes
My customers always shout,
"Bring Koharu!"
Don't mention my name so loudly
He's outside...
The man I hate
Koharu! It's nice to see you
You stopped seeing me, so I missed you
You flatter me
Has Jihei redeemed you?
You're kind and pretty enough for me, Tahei
Why be with a poor man like Jihei?
So you're spreading the false rumor
False? You know it's true
I don't want to hear it
Then do you want to hear the sound of gold?
You fell in love with the wrong man
There are many men in Osaka.
Why Jiehi?
He married his cousin, and has two children
The paper business is slow and he's always poor
How can he raise ten kan of silver for you?
He's asking too much
That's none of your concern
On the contrary, I have no family or relatives
Maybe Jihei uses sweeter words but, unlike me, he has very little money
Is she going to meet
Jihei tonight?
I'll pay twice as much as he pays for her
There's nothing in the world money can't buy
Let's have some drinks first
Her customer tonight is a samurai
Please go somewhere else tonight,
Mr. Tahei
Who's afraid of a samurai?
He may have swords but not many, only two.
Who's afraid?
I'll buy the samurai together with Koharu!
I'm lucky to have met
Koharu here tonight
Maybe the priest I met has brought this luck
I thank him
Let's chant a sutra
Jihei, the paper dealer
His clothes are made of paper
His shop can't stand like paper
He's no better than waste paper
Oh, merciful Buddha!
Speaking of waste, it's him
What a costume!
A hat at night?
Waste paper, why the costume?
Koharu
I have no swords, but I'm armed with money
It's stronger than swords... and much stronger than Jihei's waste paper
How dare he!
It's stupid.
Let's go to a better place
If we see Jihei, let's kick him
No one knows the value of money around here
In this world, money is everything
Remember it.
Let's go
I'm sorry, Samurai.
They offended you
Wait, Samurai. Excuse me
I'm glad you're not
Jihei in disguise
I had to make sure
Then, Koharu, have a good time with him
Please take care of her
You're still open in this cold?
I can't live if I stop vending
That's true
What is it today?
I just passed through the red light district
I heard a rich man is going to redeem Koharu
You already went there?
I mean I went there on business
Koharu, the courtesan?
Koharu of the Kinokuniya
I'd like to be a woman in my next life
Fool
Koharu, you've lost weight
Deep inside you love me
I'd like to elope with you
Where would we go to die?
Umeda? Kitano?
You examine me as if I were an animal
I didn't come here to be insulted
It's not easy to go out
It's not easy to leave the palace,
But since I heard so much about you
I came here alone and asked the mistress to call you
For what?
For a woman who looks so sad without a smile?
I didn't come here to nurse a sick girl
You're right, sir, but there's a reason
Listen to me
Koharu is in love with a man named Jihei
It's always Jihei
She accepts no one else
But she's a courtesan
She has no right to choose
Much less to love
It's bad for business
It's the master's duty to stop her
So he chose good customers...
Like you, sir, for her
You may not like it, but forgive her
Now, Koharu, be bright and entertain him
Which is more painful, hanging yourself or cutting your throat?
What are you saying?
You frighten me
It's too much
You shouldn't say that to a new customer
Let's have sake and cheer up
Judging from your attitude you want to die with
Jihei your love
But take my advice
If you die with him his family will hate you
If you have parents, they'll be sad
You can't go to heaven nor hell easily
Can't we even go to hell?
Although you're a stranger to me
I can't just watch you die
If money can settle it,
I'll help you
You'd better tell me the truth
You're right.
We promised to die together
Because I'm deep in debt to the master
Redeeming me costs a fortune
Jihei told me he'd redeem me
And three years have passed
I don't want anyone else to redeem me
But I'm not free
I have no right to choose my redeemer
What if a stranger tries to redeem me?
We have no other way than to die together
Will it be today or tomorrow?
But, thinking of my mother
I'm her only child
She's poor, living in a slum
If I die, she'll starve
I don't know what to do
You said you'd help me.
Did you mean it?
Samurai don't lie
You may laugh at me
But, honestly...
I don't want to die
I'm afraid
Please be my customer from now on until next spring so he can't come and tell me when to die
If he gives me up he'll live and so will I
Koharu
That's human nature
I understand
Let's get some fresh air
Come over here
I failed!
Driven by jealousy, he draws his sword
He's drunk. Forgive him!
No. Leave him to me
What happened?
Here's a ruffian with a sword
He should be tied up like this
Please forgive him!
Now, let's go to bed, Koharu
A wild one. It serves him right
Leave it to me.
Go with him
Well, if it isn't Jihei!
I didn't see you around.
You're here
I didn't know you were tied here
You stole something?
Are you that poor?
Jihei, what did you steal?
You thief! Robber!
Here's Jihei, who stole and was caught
The thief is tied up here
Jihei, the love-sick thief!
Why shout?
Thief? Tell me what Jihei stole
How dare you lie like that?
Jihei, stamp on him in punishment
Not one of you raised a finger to help me!
I'll remember each of your faces!
You'll be sorry
Everyone laughs
'Catch him! Beat him! '
'He's going that way
'Throw him in
'Don't let him go! '
Jihei
It's you, Brother Magoemon!
Your brother?
What have I done!
I'm ashamed of myself
How could you cheat on me?!
I should stamp on you before Tahei!
I hate you!
I heard all your dishonest appeals
Jihei, stop your nonsense
Cheating is a whore's job
Fool!
You couldn't see through her
I did, as soon as I met her today
I'm ashamed
I let her fool me so easily!
How miserable!
You're almost thirty, not a child
You have a shop to run
You have two children to raise
Yet you're in love with a courtesan.
And now you're ashamed?
Then you didn't mean what you said?
Listen!
Osan, your wife, is our cousin
Her mother is our aunt
Her father is old and stubborn
He says you fooled Osan
He'll take her back and shame you
He's furious
Her mother is worried
Osan is sick from trying to protect you
How can I make it up to her?
So she asked the master here to let me meet with Koharu and find out what she's thinking
Look at me
As if I were in a parade
Because of my stupid brother, a decent merchant like me became a two bit actor playing an incognito official
This is what I wore my first sword for
It's stupid of me even to be angry
Too ridiculous to cry
I'm sorry, Brother
How I hate myself!
I've been taken in by this wench for years
I left my family for her
I even left my shop unattended
Brother, I realize I was wrong
I'll be through with her
I'll break the promises, twenty-nine in all
I'll return them to her!
Take them!
I was a fool keeping them close to me
Brother, get my twenty-nine promises from her
And burn them!
Give them to me!
Yes, I will
One, two, three...
Twenty-nine of them
A woman's letter.
What is this?
It's important to me.
Give it back
It's a letter from Osan to Koharu
Koharu, I'll keep this
I'll keep it for myself
I'll burn it later
Forget a samurai's promise
This is a merchant's.
Trust it. Understand?
Thank you
A woman's obligation will be carried out
Who's talking about obligations?
Jihei...
I don't want to see her
She's fooled me for three years
I'll step on her
I'd been in love for so long
Even if she's a prostitute she cheated me badly
This is my goodbye
Stop it, Jihei
Koharu!
Near a shrine of Tenjin God
Many trodded the Tenjin Bridge
The street was busy and bustling
There was a paper shop run by a man
Named Jihei and his wife Osan
He was honest by nature
And his shop was reputable
Osan
It's cold today
Otama is late.
What's she doing?
I sent her on a simple errand, and this!
It's supper time
Sangoro is gone, too.
Where is he?
My child will catch a cold
It's time to feed my baby
Sangoro is an idiot.
So is Otama. All fools!
I'm hungry
Kantaro
Where were you in this cold?
Where's my baby?
And Sangoro?
At the shrine
Poor boy!
You're freezing
Your hands and legs are cold
Warm yourself with your father
Sangoro! Fool!
Where's my child?
I lost her
Somebody must have found her
How dare you!
I'll kill you!
Where did you leave her?
Answer!
Osue! You must be cold
She was crying outside
Sangoro!
You came home without her?
Look after her!
You must be hungry
Did Sangoro leave you?
I'll feed you
Otama, beat that stupid Sangoro
We ate oranges at the shrine
I've had enough
No beating
A fool trying to be funny!
Otama, prepare supper
Oh, madam...
- The fool almost made me forget.
- Yes?
I saw your mother coming here with Magoemon, the flour dealer
My mother and Magoemon? Why?
They'll be here soon
I must wake Jihei
Is he still asleep?
Please get up
We're having guests
It's a busy season
Merchants can't take naps
Wake up, Jihei
I see
My brother and aunt are coming?
I see
My brother and aunt are coming
So busy!
Sangoro, shut the back door
Brother. Aunt
Welcome. Come in
Please come in.
It's cold today
You look busy. Good
Warm yourselves
Children. Grandmother and uncle are here
Greet them
Get tea
No tea or tobacco!
I didn't come for tea
Watch over him
Let's go in
Osan, even if you're young you're a mother of two
You should be wise
It's your fault that your man stays out
He might go bankrupt
If you get a divorce, it'll be your shame
Osan
Be stern and watch your husband
Aunt, he even tried to fool his brother
He won't listen to her
Jihei
How dare you fool me!
Breaking your promise so soon!
You redeem Koharu?
Stop pretending to be busy!
You want to borrow money for Koharu? Give it to me
You're wrong, Brother
You know,
I went out only twice to the wholesale store and the shrine
Redeem her?
What are you talking about?
I didn't even think of her.
Why?
Don't give me that.
Don't act innocent
We had a meeting last night
We heard Koharu, the courtesan would be redeemed by a rich merchant
The merchant loves her
He says he'll redeem her any day now
They say some rich men are really stupid
Like the merchant
- But...
- Listen to me
Gozaemon, my husband is very strict, as you know
He heard the rumor and thought the merchant was you
You're my nephew, not his
He loves Osan
He said you'd sell her off to redeem Koharu
He was furious
He wanted to get her before her clothes disappeared
He started to come
I stopped him, saying,
"Check the rumors
"before you blame Jihei"
And I sent for Magoemon to come here
According to Magoemon
"Jihei isn't the man he used to be
"He's become a good merchant
"He's through with the courtesan"
I didn't understand
I came here and found out
- You're a lazy worm!
- But...
Jihei.
Your father was my brother
He worried about you until he died
Before he breathed his last breath he told me:
"Take care of your nephew and son-in-law"
I can't forget it
I can't even keep my promise to him
I understand
The man redeeming Koharu isn't me
Brother
Remember Tahei?
You let me step on his face
He wanted to redeem Koharu but I stopped him
Now that I'm through with her it's his chance to redeem her
Aunt
We're through.
Why should I redeem her?
Don't believe the false rumor
Mother. I may be good-natured
But I wouldn't help him if he wanted to redeem her
He's telling you the truth this time
I'll stand witness
You can't believe rumors
Father is too hasty
Since Osan says so, it must be true
They wouldn't take in a courtesan
Would they?
Mother is hasty, too.
Isn't she?
All right
But your father won't be convinced so easily
Let's make sure.
Give me a written promise
Yes, as many as you wish, Aunt... since I'm to blame for all this
I'm sorry I made you worry
Mother, Brother-in-law, thank you
It's settled. I'm so happy.
How can I thank you?
It was my fault, too
He'll work hard from tomorrow on
Osan is right
You can do anything if you try hard
I've written it, Aunt
Now your shop will prosper, won't it?
We're all worried about your family
Because we love you all
Because we're relatives
It's settled.
Let's go, Magoemon
I'll set my husband's mind at ease
Hurry, Magoemon
Osan, the wind is cold
Don't let the kids get sick.
Take care, Osan
Our ancestors will help you.
Namu amidabutsu
Take care, Mother
Did Sangoro close the back doors?
Yes, he did
We must pay our bills tomorrow. Time flies!
I must make a kimono for Kantaro
I'm glad you gave up on Koharu
It was hard to run the shop
I'm so glad
From tomorrow on, you'll run this place
A woman just can't do business like a man
I needn't be jealous anymore
What is it?
Are you crying?
Why?
Oh, no!
Can't you give her up after all?
You miss her so much?
Why then did you promise?
Remember? It was in October two years ago
The last time we slept together
I don't know why you hate me but you stopped making love to me
Today, at last you promised to give Koharu up
I thought we could live like a couple
But you still love her
It's cruel of you
If you miss her so much, cry hard
Let your tears fall into the river
Koharu will drink it
We have two children, but still no love?
Can't you give her up?
What have I done to deserve this?
Pity the children
Finally we're together again
I don't know anything anymore!
Osan, you have the right to blame me
Listen
Tears of sadness and tears of joy flow the same way
They flow from the eyes
If tears of regret flowed from the ears you'd know the pain of my heart
A man shouldn't cry for Koharu
Listen to me
She's a four-legged animal, not a human
Why should I miss her?
She lied to me
She said she'd never let
Tahei redeem her
If her master insisted she'd kill herself
She always said so
Yet ten days after we parted she's already yielded to Tahei.
That tramp!
Why would I miss a courtesan like that?
Osan
Why should I cry for her?
Then Koharu...
Tahei spread the word:
Jihei can't even redeem a courtesan
He said I was about to go bankrupt
Wholesale clerks stare at me suspiciously
I live in shame
Osan
I hate it! I hate it!
I can't tolerate it!
Jihei, what'll I do?
That's why you're crying
Then Koharu may die
Terrible! She'll die
What'll I do?
She'll die?
Osan
You're wise, but you don't know the world
You don't know what a courtesan does
It's her work to fool men using her tricks
She won't die
You're wrong
You're wrong this time
I never meant to tell you this
But I can't let her die for me
She didn't want to leave you
But she acted as if she were fooling you
What are you saying?
What did you do?
You went to the pleasure quarters every night
You neglected your work
I didn't mind that but you were desperate
I thought you'd die with her
As your wife, I can't watch you die
It made me so sad
I couldn't bear it
I wrote to Koharu asking,
"Please save my husband's life"
You may think I shouldn't have done that
But I'm your wife
Koharu is a courtesan, but she's a woman too
Even if you oppose it, she'll kill herself
Even if you don't love me
I will do anything for you
So Koharu...
She accepted my request
She answered she'd give you up
But it's not easy
I asked her to save you, and she agreed because she loves you
I have her letter close to me. Look
She's decent, with a strong sense of duty
She wouldn't break her promise to you
Least of all, to let Tahei redeem her
A woman in love is strong
She won't yield easily
You see? She acted out of regard for me
You don't understand
You only talk about love
What a man!
At this rate, she'll die
How can I let her die?
We must save her life.
Save her!
I remember the letter.
Brother read
You wrote it?
I see
Koharu may die, then
Out of my honor,
I cannot let her die
We must try to stop her.
Go to her
But what can I do?
I must pay her master a pile of money so he'll stop her from being redeemed
I need 150 pieces of gold to keep her alive
I haven't got that much
We can't save her without money
What'll I do? What can I do?
It's no time for questions.
We must raise it
Money?
Eighty pieces of gold!
How did you get it?
I didn't know
I'll explain later
Koharu's life can't wait
It was to pay for paper.
It's honest money
I'll make up for it later with Magoemon
We need seventy pieces more.
What'll I do?
Osan!
You can get seventy from the pawnshop
Pawn my kimonos.
I don't need them
You need yours to keep up a front
Get the money and redeem her
Beat the hateful Tahei with the money
But, Osan...
What if I redeem her?
What will I do with her then?
Keep her somewhere?
Here?
What about you, Osan?
I didn't think about that
I was so worried about her
What'll I do?
Make her a nurse?
Or a cook?
I should be punished
By you, if not by Heaven
Forgive me, Osan.
Forgive me
I'm a hopelessly selfish fool
I made you raise the money for my courtesan
Please forgive me, Osan
A husband shouldn't ask that
It's a wife's duty.
I'll sell my hair if my clothes aren't enough
I paid for paper with my clothes too
My closet is already empty
But I've never regretted it
It's too late if she dies
Go quick
Sangoro
Take this bundle and accompany your master
Is Jihei in?
Father!
- Why?
- Sit down
Jihei, my son-in-law
You're dressed up
Wearing a sword, you look like a rich man
Going to the brothel?
Every night?
You need no wife
Osan, he doesn't need you
You mustn't go out in the cold
I'll get tea for you
You must have heard from Mother
She lectured my man today
He promised he'd give up the courtesan
Didn't you see the letter?
You mean this?
The worse men are, the more they promise!
Look at him
As I thought, he's a liar
He even swore to the gods
They must be amazed by your selfishness
Just write her a letter of divorce instead
You have every reason to blame me
But I have no time to explain
Have mercy on me
Don't take her away from me
Even if I become a beggar even if I starve
I'll never make her suffer
She won't have a hard time
Because
I can never return all I owe Osan
I can't tell you why
Please be lenient and let her stay
Let me live with her
- There's a reason.
- Be quiet!
You're free to become a beggar or to starve
But Osan will never be a beggar's wife
Write her a letter of divorce
I'll count her kimono and seal them first
I'll check
No! There's no need to do that
You don't have to do that
Well!
It's empty!
No clothes at all!
All the clothes she brought are gone
Jihei, what's your excuse for this?
What does it mean?
What's that?
Silk garments
Lining cloth
Even the baby's kimono!
Formal wear!
So many clothes!
Even the boy's coat!
Were you going to pawn everything?
Well done!
You've stripped your family
All for your courtesan!
I'm amazed
All you can do is make love?
What a fool!
You can't fool me.
You're nothing to me
Osan, you're a fool, too
You let him fool you
Write a letter of divorce!
I won't write it with a brush
No! Don't be hasty!
I'll explain to Father
He'll understand
He may be nothing to you, but his children are your grandchildren
Even if he agrees to a divorce
I won't!
Be quiet!
If you refuse to write it
I won't need it!
I'll take Osan home with or without it!
Come with me!
No! Why, when we don't want to part?
He won't divorce me.
Why must I leave?
What about my two children?
No! I've never been away from them!
I must take care of them!
Whom will they sleep with?
No, Father!
I won't go!
I'm not divorced
Jihei! Help me!
What are you doing?
I won't go!
Give the children their usual medicine
And their candy too
I don't want to go, Father!
Excuse me. I came for Koharu
I'm sorry when it's so late
I came for Koharu
She's staying tonight.
Kinokuniya?
Rest a while
It's all right then
Be careful about her
Tahei has redeemed her
She's his now
Don't let her drink too much
I know she's very important
Please look after her
Denbei, who was it?
Kinokuniya sent for Koharu
Kinokuniya?
Are you going home now, Jihei?
I'll get her
Jihei's leaving.
Get Koharu
Don't call her
She will ask me to stay till morning
Send her back in the morning
I must go to Kyoto on business
I don't know if I can return within this year
Pay the bill with this money
Clear my debt to the geisha house, too
- Go to bed now.
- I understand
I'm in such a hurry,
I forgot my sword
I'm lucky to be a merchant
If a samurai left it, he'd have to die
I'm sorry. I kept it
Take care of yourself.
Hurry home
Excuse me
Is Jihei here?
Call him
He left just now for Kyoto
He's gone
Is Koharu of Kinokuniya gone?
She's sleeping upstairs
Who is it?
If she's here, they won't die
We'll see Jihei
Going to Kyoto? Why?
He doesn't know how worried we are
Where is he?
Sangoro. Do you know where he usually goes?
I tried all the places I know
I know!
But I'm embarrassed
You do? Where is it?
Don't scold me
I usually go to the barn on the northern bank with a whore
Who cares where you go
Keep Kantaro warm
Let's search the new pleasure quarters
I don't know the place.
Do you?
There are many places.
I didn't know
Can I come with you?
What for?
To make love, of course
Fool!
Jihei
Koharu
Finally!
- Finally!
- My brother went to the Yamatoya
- Did he find you?
- No. Koharu...
- I'm glad.
- So am I
We're in danger here.
Let's get out
- Jihei.
- Koharu
"Shijimi River to the west
"They often trod Tenjin Bridge
"The plum blossoms in the garden were sad
"Umeda Bridge was good
"But Cherry Bridge was out
"Saddened by the parting."
Koharu!
My feet hurt
Be patient
Where are we, Jihei?
We crossed Ima Bridge
Then your home is beyond the river
Are you afraid of death now?
When we're together like this? No!
Are you afraid?
Let's not complain anymore
I've had all kinds of hardship
But I bore them all for you
Your wife's letter pained me the most
Forget it
She didn't ask me to return you
She asked me to save you
Even if I'm a courtesan, even if I love you so much...
Forget it.
We're going to die
I wanted nothing but to be with you
I shouldn't fall in love
A courtesan must sleep with hundreds of men
I believed it was my work
I didn't wish to be a courtesan
I'm a woman like any other
Why can't I fall in love, like any other?
But there's nothing I can do
You're Osan's precious husband
Why is it that you're going to die with me?
Why?
Out of duty to you
My duty is to Osan.
We're women but we even forgot to be jealous
Duty binds us all, not women alone
I don't want to die
Why, when I love you?
I don't want to die, either
We want to be together
Hurry, or down will break
Kill me here.
Kill yourself elsewhere
Have you forgotten?
Won't we die together?
But I couldn't face your wife then
I'd break my promise to save your life
She'd think it a courtesan's lie
Others may think so but Osan mustn't.
I'd be sad
Osan, to whom you feel duty bound was taken away by her father.
We're divorced
You owe her nothing
Even if you divorced her...
You're my wife now
No one will laugh
I want to die with you
But I'm to blame for Osan leaving you
I caused her to suffer
I caused all this
Say no more
Even when we die a woman only complains
You do, too
We may die apart and birds will feed on us but our souls will be together
So what does it matter how we die?
Take me to hell or wherever it is!
What have you done?
With this hair,
I'd be called Osan's husband
But now I'm a priest
I have no home
Nor have I a family
You're not dutybound to anyone now
I'm a nun now,
I owe no one anything
That's the Daicho Temple gong
We don't belong to the mundane world now
We don't have to die together
With the bridge between us me here, you there
Dutybound even after you've become a nun?
I won't be a courtesan in the next life
You worry about your children?
Don't make me remember and cry
They don't know their bad father is dying
I'm a sinful woman.
Forgive me, Jihei
It's the only thing that depresses me
Jihei, hurry and kill me!
No one shall see your tearful face
Koharu. Smile.
Smile for me
No! No!
I'm afraid!
THE END
Go ahead!
Go to the water, get a move on!
Hurry!
To the water.
Move! Go on!
Hurry, get a move on!
Go on! Get over there, into the water!

Give me a rifle!
So you don't want to do it?
But it has to be done!
Yes
One-two-one!
Go over to the left!
You've never agreed with me!
You only remember disagreements but we have agreed some
Slow down!
Stand there!
You're against me!

You'll never see reason!
Take away my rifle.
Go over there.
Get undressed... and then run!

Get moving!
Step lively!
Get a move on! Hurry up! Get going!
You and you!
Back now! March!

Only since the company was routed.
Why did you join?
A comrade came to the camp.
A comrade came to the camp.
Prison camp number 2 at Dranitsa. He talked to us.
'Boys, who wants to go home to Hungary? ' Was it me?
Was it me?
You said the Russian revolution would bring ours closer
If we fought the officer's army
Our Russian brothers would help our cause.
Keep in step

You aren't Russian?
Why do you interfere in our business?
I'll let you go this time.  Shirts!
Hurry up!
About turn! Take off your shirts!
I give you 15 minutes to get away!
Don't come near us again or we'll show no mercy!
Understand?
Answer!
Answer!

Why you are here?
I didn't understand.
Can i go over there?
Too late now!
You are free! Get going! Don't waste your time!
We told you, you have you have 15 minutes to get away!
Pick up those shirts!
It's no use!
Come to me!
Your fifteen minutes are up!
Come here, you beast! Who are you?
Who are you?
What are you staring at, tartar-face?
Take a look, he must be by there.
Is there anybody here?
Get him, Hungarian!
Halt!
That way, Hungarian!
Put those buckets down!
Quite a beauty! Come with me!
Do you live here?
Won't you answer?
Well, come over here, then.
Are you relatives? Mother and daughter?
Is she your mother?
Is she your daughter?
You won't answer?
Is there a man in the house?
Lost your tongue?
There's a man in the house.
Don't you understand Russian?
You're wearing a shirt.
Take it off
Pretty girl, eh?
Take off your shirt! Go on!
Sava!
Finish him off!
Come, my beauty! Don't be ashamed!
Undress her!
Hurry up!
Face me, my modest one!
Let's go for a stroll!
Take off your shirt! Don't be ashamed
We're in private.
Turn and face me!
Now show me your beauty!
And you woman watch! You might learn something!
Wash her first!
Kneel down!
Ensign! Go down there!
Go down there!
Take off your sword!
Throw down your belt and pistol!
Throw them down on the ground
Take it all off!
The belt, the dagger, and the pistol
And now, speak!
What's your name?
You can go and pray.
Clazunov, Lieutenant of the White Guards
Condemn under martial law
A Cossack ensign for assault on the civilian population!
Bury him.
Fire!
Come over here.
Come nearer.
Come nearer.
Do you know who these men are?
They don't know!
I don't know!
Throw them in the water!
Do we have to throw these Reds in, too?
What did you say?
I said, stop here!
Do any of you speak Russian?
Can you walk?
We must record the names of the dead.
For their families.
I know them.
Who is your commander?
You can stay here
But don't dare speak your own language!
Now get them out of the water.
Get going.
Go back
We'll get the dead out!
We are fishing out the dead
Come here!
Here if you please.

Step forward those without arms!
One, two, three, drop your hands
One, two, three, hands up

Shoulders arms!
Go ahead!
Walk!
Miss!
Please come to look at my comrade.
He's very ill.
Come to the surgery.
That way.
Take off your shirt.
Please, may i have some hot water and tea?
What do you want?
The commander wants you to go.
Alone?
Report to the first calvary division
Twenty five men of the international second company all wounded
And the commandant Sandor Varga is in the hospital on River Pesetka under the jurisdiction of White forces.
The area is strongly controlled. An attack is requested.
Is that all?
I repeat my orders: Report to the first calvary division...
You may go!
You don't have to say you love me.
You don't...
Have to say you love me.
I want to undress for you.
Hide!
Hide!
What are you doing?
To bathe.
Go ahead. I'll watch you!
I don't want you to!
Go on! I want to look at you!
Go away! Aren't you ashamed?
Search everywhere
Catch him!
Halt!
What are you doing here?
Turn to face me!
Face me, I said!
Can you swim?
Swim, then!
Water spirits!
Come over here!
Help her!
Help her!
Stand there!
Do you know him? A Red internationalist, isn't he?
Get going!
Listen, Red!
Who are you?
Hungarian.
Sing something.
Don't you understand?

The Hungarians will come with me.
Who is Hungarian?

Hungarians with me! You too!
Come here!
Single file!

You know how to kiss.
Afraid of me, aren't you?
You think I'll die soon?
I won't die!
You and you! Come with me.
The others stay here!
Come back everybody!
Across to the river.
Hide in the rye!
Hide in the rye!
Move back!
Move back!
In  a line of five!
Come, children of the fatherland...
Once upon a time, seven years ago, to be exact, a young American named Carter
Harrison came to England.
He had been appointed assistant British sales manager of Inter-Allied Petroleum
Products.
It was on his first day in
London, on his very first stroll, that he met Antonia Vincente.
It was a casual meeting.
She was a painter.
She was profusely apologetic, but what was needed was turpentine.
And she knew precisely where to find some.
So she gave the brush to her bearded friend, Harry Jones, and they started out for her studio flat.
Though she came from
Italian parentage,
Toni was basically Bohemian,
British Bohemian.
Her work was Impressionist, and so was she, very impressionist.
No doubt about it,
Toni was a creature of first impressions, a woman of very definite tastes.
She knew what she liked when she saw what she liked.
And she knew what she wanted when she saw what she wanted.
Fortunately, what she liked and wanted was exactly what he liked and wanted, because 24 hours later they were married.
And so the days and weeks went by until their lovely hibernation was over, and it was time to come out into the spring of life and face reality.
And one of the realities
Carter had to face was that Toni was not only a painter, she was also a joiner with very definite beliefs, all of which were the exact opposite of his.
It seemed a joke at first, but suddenly it stopped being funny.
They agreed on nothing, politics, polygamy, peanut butter,
Pushkin, You name it!
They fought their own Battle of
Britain, a battle of words.
And when words failed, she resorted to pure Italian logic.
When logic failed, paint pots flew.
Since her aim was better than her English,
Carter did the only thing a gentleman could do.
He grabbed his pants and ran for his life.
Thus, as their marriage and crockery broke over his head, Carter left.
He left Toni, he left the love nest, he left London.
And for seven peaceful and productive years, they didn't meet or speak or shriek or even write.
Carter had now become an important executive with Inter-Allied, one of their top negotiators, a job which took him to the far corners of the earth.
In other words, the sheik agrees that all oil deposits in this area shall be developed solely by Inter-Allied
Petroleum Products of America?
That is correct.
Good.
Will you please convey to His Highness that these fried grapes are delicious?
Oh. They are not fried grapes.
They're not?
No. They are...
Delicious.
So, his job done, Carter took the first plane to London, where he had an urgent meeting with two very expensive lawyers, because, after seven years of total and blissful separation,
Toni had finally requested a divorce.
In big business, success and divorce do not always mix.
So the company sent
Dick Bramwell, sharpest public relations man in the business, to London.
Bramwell had to move fast, because he knew that in exactly 25 minutes
Carter would be attending a meeting which could very well bring an abrupt end to a very promising career.
What do you mean, no divorce?
Whose brilliant idea is that?
Oh, just a brilliant chap by the name of J.I. Stevens.
The old man?
That's right.
Fancies himself a king maker.
You're being measured for a crown.
Why?
Oh, come on Carter.
You've got to be joshing.
J.I.'s had his tongue hanging out for those leases for years, and you've just handed them to him on a great big spotlighted platter.
Look at this, front pages right down the line.
Yeah, yeah. Look at 'em!
It's promotion time, friend and you're in for something large.
How large? I don't know but it's gonna take top brass approval.
Which shirt shall I wear? Oh come on.
You're not even listening!
This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to you.
Don't you realize Big Daddy's gonna spring this at the annual board meeting next week in Boston?
Yeah?
Yeah.
That's why there's such a hurry for me to get over here and clean up your image.
What's wrong with my image?
You make it sound like I've been named leper of the year.
Well you know the mentality of that board.
They're hipped on the idea of a corporate image, solid American gentry, family respectability.
For their top executives there are not ten commandments, only one.
Thou shalt be married, happily and respectably married.
Whether you like it or not.
That's right.
I've done just fine these past seven years happily and respectably separated!
Yeah. And I've loved every minute of it.
Yeah, well that's all gonna change.
From now on, you're gonna have a new look.
No more gay, married bachelor.
It's got to be Carter
Harrison, family man.
You are out of your skull.
Carter, when that board meets in Boston, you can be Yankee Doodle riding your town on a solid gold pony.
Income in six figures, a private plane, your own yacht, a house in Palm Beach.
It's yours. All you need to do is show up in Boston week after next with one reasonably respectable wife.
Forget it.
Forget what?
What you just said.
Yankee Doodle, solid gold pony, the whole bit. Just plain forget it.
You don't know what kind of a nut I was married to.
No, no I don't.
What kind of a nut was she?
She was a half-Italian fruitcake, that's what she was.
Oh, that doesn't sound too bad.
What was the other half?
Gorgeous.
What did you go around marrying gorgeous fruitcakes for in the first place?
I don't know. It was a cold night.
She had an electric blanket.
It was seven years ago. What took so long getting around to a divorce?
Well, there was no particular rush.
Look Carter, politics makes strange bedfellows.
Why not big business?
Make a deal.
For one month, you stay married.
No chance.
For one month?
No deal. Not with Toni.
Let me tell you something.
She was a crackpot, a bohemian, a hothead.
You know the kind. She used to take a bath in her blue jeans to make sure they'd be tight enough.
Hmph.
She wouldn't consider this sort of deal, and I wouldn't ask her.
Maybe she's changed.
Yeah, she's changed.
From terrible to impossible.
Look, call J.I. Tell him if they want me the way I am, that's fine.
If not, forget it.
He'll turn you down.
That's life.
That's it, then?
That's it.
You know for a fellow who's only going to discuss a divorce with a half-Italian fruitcake in overtight blue jeans, you're looking and smelling awfully pretty.
Evening's young.
Who knows? I might get lucky later.
Yeah.
Excuse me, is this...
Jim.
Carter. Good to see you.
Sorry to rush you over like this, but I don't know anything about British divorce laws.
I got news for you, neither do I.
Mr. Bagshott will see you now.
Buck up. It's no worse than a head-on collision.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Please come in.
Mr. Slade.
Bagshott.
How do you do?
This is my client,
Mrs. Harrison.
How do you do?
Of course, you two, um...
Yes, naturally.
Mrs. Harrison, would you?
Gentlemen?
Before we commence, perhaps I should acquaint you with certain notable points of British divorce law.
While either party may request a divorce, they're not permitted personally to arrange the terms or evidence.
But my client has requested representation.
Even so, I must emphasize that if it's intended to discuss a British divorce, not only is this meeting not taking place, but I am not here.
With regard to jurisdiction, the fundamental rule, with certain exceptions, is that the English courts will only entertain a divorce petition if the husband is domiciled here at the time the petition is filed.
Mrs. Harrison?
Mrs. Harrison?
Carter, is that agreeable to you?
An American divorce, probably in Reno.
Oh, yes. Certainly.
Carter?
Fine.
Mr. Slade, perhaps you and I might talk alone for a moment.
Fine.
Um, you'll hear from me later, my dear. In the meantime you'd best make arrangements to leave for Reno immediately.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Taxi!
Taxi! Taxi!
Oh!
Get in.
Where to, guv?
Where do you live?
32 Chelsea Court Lane.
No, thank you.
You look fine, Toni.
You sound surprised.
It's been a long time.
Yes.
What are you doing with yourself these days?
The usual.
Painting when I can.
Mostly doing fashions for the Daily Echo.
Actually, I've been very successful.
Good.
Would you care for a drink somewhere?
Oh. Well, no. I really...
You know, legally, we probably shouldn't be together like this.
Oh, what could happen in a London taxi?
You should know.
Uh, who's the lucky guy?
Harry Jones.
Harry? Our Harry Jones?
The bearded wonder?
I don't believe it.
I should have married him years ago but for meeting you.
I know. But, seven years?
What's he been doing all this time?
Checking your references?
He was abroad.
Still a crime reporter?
No. Assistant editor now.
Actually, he's my boss.
That's handy.
Do you love him?
Yes, I do.
Good.
That's the way it should be.
With love.
Oh. Better keep him.
I'll walk back.
Do me good.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Um, uh, I, uh...
Uh, what is it?
A studio house?
Mmm-hmm. Uh, you see, it's actually a studio.
I mean, as well as a house.
Oh, that's probably why they call it a studio house.
Probably.
Yeah.
Uh, Toni...
Yes?
Um. I suppose an artist used to live here.
Yes. He was quite famous.
He died.
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
He was 98.
Oh. Well.
Well, I really must go.
Yes, you should. It's cold.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Carter.
Yes?
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Please.
Uh, wait here.
I'll turn on the light.
Make yourself at...
Uh, home.
Would you like to take your...
Coat off?
Do you want a cigarette?
A light?
This is where I live.
It was once a stable.
It's where, uh, they kept horses.
No more empty years.
No, darling.
No divorce?
No divorce.
We must have been out of our minds.
What did we fight about?
Everything.
Everything and nothing.
Never again, huh?
Never, darling.
What about him?
Oh! Harry.
Yeah. Harry.
Well, I don't know.
It's terrible.
I... I hate hurting him.
You couldn't really have been in love with him.
Not the way it is with us.
But Harry's sweet.
Sweet! Ha!
He's nice to have around.
He's big and strong and shaggy.
So is a sheep dog, but you wouldn't marry one.
But, darling, it's time
I had children.
And Harry would make a wonderful father.
If we weren't such idiots, we'd have had children years ago.
We weren't ready.
We are now.
Aren't we?
Real ready.
And he'll be beautiful.
So will she.
It's going to be a big change for you, dear.
From now on it'll be "Carter
Harrison, family man."
It's going to mean diapers and measles and nursery schools.
And nannies.
Does it scare you, darling?
No, no! It's perfect.
Uh, look, dear. I'm due at the office in 20 minutes.
Be an angel and run my bath, will you please?
Certainly, Daddy.
Yeah?
Dick. This is Carter.
Listen.
Everything is gonna be just fine.
Hey, wait. Where are you?
What time is it?
It's 9:00, and I'm in heaven.
Hope you haven't reversed the charges.
You haven't called J.I. yet, have you? No, not yet.
Good. Now listen.
I'm back with Toni.
Aw, you're beautiful!
The old man's gonna be delighted about this.
Just a minute.
What are you doing?
Uh... When a fella's ordering three dozen roses for his best girl, he wants to keep it a secret.
Your robe, milord.
Come here, you.
Oh, darling. Your bath.
Huh.
Better send three dozen roses to the house.
Right. Right. Good.
I'll meet you in the office in an hour. Bye.
Come here, you!
Your tea, sir.
You're insatiable!
Mrs. Carmody, this is my husband.
How do you do, sir?
Hello.
Sir, I'll be off to getting the breakfast.
One egg or two?
He takes four, and the bacon crisp.
Very good, ma'am.
Oh! And, Mrs. Carmody, would you call Mavis Masters for me?
Tell her I can't report today, because it's a very special day, and I don't want to take a chance of getting arrested.
Very good, ma'am.
She's a treasure.
You looked so funny!
Come here, you!
You really are a great big bear.
I must say, she didn't seem very surprised.
Does she usually walk in and find strange men in your bed?
Every morning.
She validates their parking tickets.
I see.
Well, anyway, I think
I like your Mrs...
Did you say "arrested"?
Yes, you big, fuzzy bear.
Arrested.
For what?
Picketing.
Picketing what?
The embassy.
What embassy?
Your embassy.
The American embassy?
Mmm-hmm.
You're picketing the American embassy?
What for?
For ISFAE.
ISFAE?
International Society for
Freedom of Artistic Expression.
You know.
No, I don't know.
Oh, it's growing like mad, darling.
Embraces all the arts.
We are planning a massive protest against the banning of Petracini's statue.
Who?
Petracini!
Petracini! Oh, certainly you've heard of Petracini!
No, but it sounds fattening.
Petracini happens to be the world's leading Expressionist sculptor.
He does wonderful things with a blowtorch.
To whom?
He's a great
Italian artist!
And his work has been banned from
America by petty, provincial minds.
Which petty, provincial minds?
The ones at your National
Gallery in Washington.
If my National Gallery has banned your Mr. Petracini's statue, he must have been pointing that blowtorch in some mighty peculiar directions!
Why was it banned?
They say it's indecent.
That's good enough for me.
It's a simple statue of a woman and a horse.
Doing what?
What's the difference?
Whoever heard of putting fig leaves on horses?
Especially an Impressionist horse!
You wouldn't know where it goes.
Let me get this straight.
You're picketing the
American embassy in London in order to keep fig leaves off of lewd Italian horses in Washington, D.C.?
It's not the fig leaves.
It's the principle!
Ah, yes. The principle!
Yes, the principle!
We artists should be able to paint, write, sculpt anything we like!
Freedom of expression!
Freedom of expression. Yeah, yeah.
Tell me, dear.
Are we still involved with some of our trusty old friends such as "Higher Pay for Women Policemen"?
We are. "Abolition of
Cruel Blood Sports"?
Certainly.
"Rest Home for Gypsies"?
Of course. "Fertility
Control in Backward Nations"?
I'm the co-chairman!
And take that look off your face. Ha.
What look? That smug, disapproving, superior look.
The same ghastly face.
Now, Toni...
Don't you "Now, Toni" me!
I know what you're thinking!
I haven't said a word.
You don't have to.
You're wearing that face.
I'm sorry. It's the only face I have!
And I thought you'd changed!
But, no, you've got the same ostrich mentality you had seven years ago when you were swanking around London with an open car and a closed mind!
And you're still the same half-baked birdbrain you were seven years ago!
Watch it!
Joining every crackpot cause that comes along. Wave the banners!
Yell the slogans.
If you saw six people waiting in line for a bus, you'd join them because you thought they were picketing something!
Oh! Get out!
Thanks. I was just leaving.
Don't let me stop you.
Ah!
You know-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing Knucklehead!
You sneak back into my life like a wolf in snake's clothing!
Crawl back into my bedroom!
Take advantage of my weakness!
Oh! I could kill you!
With what? A slogan?
Oh! Get out!
Grams .
Boor! Go away!
You upset me! Out of this room!
Ugly boor!
Aw, you sound just like your father!
Don't you insult my father!
I didn't insult him.
I said you sounded like him!
That's an insult!
Remember, you said that, not me.
You're not even fit to talk about my father!
Your father was a nut!
Don't you dare!
My father was an artist!
An Italian artist!
An Italian patriot!
You may not realize it, but there are other people in this world beside Italians!
But who needs them?
My father was a martyr to humanity.
Some martyr. He got drunk and fell off a wall.
While making a wonderful speech.
In fluent Italian to a bunch of Cockney garbage collectors!
About as good a group as you'll find for the rubbish you're interested in!
You are the most barbaric, bothersome, boring, bourgeois, b...
Boor?
Boor I ever met!
Morning.
Keep your big nose out of this!
Ah, the same charm, the same sophisticated wit. Oh, butt out.
And getting sharper all the time.
Get out of my house.
When I'm good and ready!
Get out now!
If you want my advice old boy...
I'll thank you to keep your food-stained beard out of my affairs, and my eggs!
Which I might add were slightly overdone. Oh!
I hate to fight and run like this, but I leave happy in the thought that fertility control in backward nations is in such fertile and backward hands!
Oh! Get out!
May I borrow your umbrella?
Yes!
Thank you!
You know I had a growing conviction that his mother was one of those.
Save one for me.
Oh, Harry. I'm so ashamed.
Oh, now, no confessions, please!
It was all arranged,
I was leaving for Reno.
Then he brought me home and...
Oh, Harry.
He stayed all night. I know.
You don't mind?
Of course I mind!
I don't pretend to like it!
But if it's finally got him out of your system...
Oh, it has.
It has.
But what do I do now?
Blow your nose, pack your bags and leave for Reno today.
Tbday?
Today!
All right.
Here.
Oh my, she's done it again.
No, no. I don't anticipate any problems.
Yes...
You can forget what I told you!
What?
It's all off!
She's the same half-brained lunatic she was seven years ago.
Just a moment, please.
What did you say?
I said it's all off!
She's still a fruitcake.
I wouldn't live with her if they made me the next president of the company!
Would you care to tell that to the current president of...
I certainly would!
Please do.
Hello! Who's this?
Oh. Hello, J.I.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Yes, quite rested.
Thank you.
Yes, Bramwell did mention something.
He didn't say which position you had in mind.
What's that?
President of the International
Branch? Me?
Oh, Well
I'm honored.
Well, I only hope I can, sir.
Thank you, J.I., thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Well! That's telling him.
President of the International Branch.
I like the way you turned it down.
Tenth biggest corporation in America.
What about your wife?
200,000 bucks a year.
Your wife.
A 1000 a month expenses, private plane...
Your wife.
My what?
Your wife.
That fruitcake you wouldn't live with if they offered you the presidency.
Oh, yeah. Her.
Yeah, her.
Don't worry about it.
Think I'm gonna let that kook stand in my way?
Dick, how much family image do I really need?
Plenty. When J.I. springs this on the board in Boston you better show up with
Mrs. Respectability herself.
I may have to dope her.
Good!
How much time before Boston?
Ten days.
What!
Yeah, can you do it?
Stand by for communiques.
Oh, soldier. You better put your pants on before the general changes his mind.
Not that you don't have pretty legs but...
Yeah, yeah.
You know, the corporate image?
How much is that?
Four and nine.
Four and nine what? Four and nine.
Four bob and nine pence.
Now don't worry about a thing, darling.
I'll get someone else to cover the Jean Louis show.
I'll call you in New York.
Good-bye, darling.
Put those in a cab, would you?
Yes, sir.
Fourbob. Excuse me, sir.
Comin' through, please.
Not them. The little ones there.
Oh. Oh.
Alright, well, give me one of those paper ones. Do I have any change coming?
Oh, you've been here before, haven't you?
Once or twice.
Bon voyage. And don't lose your nerve.
Those are tanners, those are bobs.
I'd like you to have a bob.
Oh, so sorry.
Not at all. Toni!
Oh, drive on!
Wait!
Listen I'm sorry for all those things
I said this morning. Really I am.
I could bite my tongue off.
Do that!
Toni, I...
Drive on!
Please, l...l love you!
Follow that cab!
Taxi! Air terminal. Fast.
They're gettin' away from us, governor.
I don't think I can catch 'em.
There must be some way
I can reach her.
What about your radio?
Could I talk to her directly?
No, that all goes through central control, mate.
Could I send her a message then?
No, it's too dodgy, guv.
Besides, it's not allowed except in a matter of life and death.
I mean, this is a taxi service you know, not a bleedin' public telephone.
And they're very strict.
That's why the regulations say that that can only be used in a matter of life and death.
Hey, Charley. I got a matter of life and death.
Gent has an urgent message for lady in R-B-4.
Okay, R-B-5. Control to R-B-4.
Stand by for important message for your passenger.
Roger, Control. There's an important message coming through for you, miss.
For me?
Tell her that every word I told her last night was true.
That I am a completely changed man.
Hold on.
Gent says he's a completely changed man.
There's a gent sayin' he's completely changed.
It's a gent sayin' he's undergone some kind of change, madam.
Ha!
And I wasn't lying this morning about having a child.
Now that I find I can have a child, I intend to have a child.
And I don't want to hear that Harry
Jones would make a good father!
All right. Hold it.
Hold it.
Hey, Charley. I got a right one here.
Claims he can have a baby.
Ay, ay! I've read about them in the Sunday papers.
Yeah, but you don't know the half of it!
Seems there's a bloke called Harry
Jones who wants to be the father.
Well the best of luck to old Harry, then.
He'll need it.
Control to R-B-4.
The gent claims he's gonna have a baby, and Harry Jones is the father.
Tell him to drop dead.
Sounds like he might, poor fellow.
R-B-4 to Control.
Lady says she's not interested.
She may not be, but I'm fascinated.
Control to R-B-5.
Right. Lady's not interested, guv.
Tell her she must try to understand my behavior.
I've been under a terrible nervous strain.
First that tricky operation in the Middle East...
Hold it. Hold it.
Get this. Seems our gent's had a nasty operation in the Middle East.
What?
The Middle East!
That explains it then, don't it?
All those fantastic hours in that Arab tent.
Hold it.
Seems as though he spent some fantastic hours in an Arab tent.
Who you got there?
Lawrence of Arabia?
Then flying straight to her arms last night.
And then this morning, that thing with the three of us.
Hold it. Hold it!
I don't think this bloke spent much time watchin' the changing of the guard.
After those fantastic expeflencesinthe Arab tent, he flew back to take up with her last night, and then this morning, some other bird comes into the picture.
Energetic little bleeder, ain't he?
Granted, we don't agree on everything.
But if all nations can practice coexistence, so can we.
Let's face it I'm not in love with the premier of the Soviet Union, but I do want to live with him.
Hold it. Now you're not in love with him, but you do want to live with him.
Right.
Right. Charley.
If I told you who he's after now, you'd never believe it.
Excuse me, madam. Now it seems the gentleman wants to set up house with the Russian prime minister.
They'll make a perfect couple.
Here.
Oh, thanks, guv!
Get out!
What's goin' on here?
Shut up and drive!
I'm her husband. Get out.
Stand by, boys. Hubby's turned up!
His? Or hers?
I was wrong this morning.
I behaved unforgivably.
Oh, what does it matter?
I've come to my senses you can do what you want, join what you want.
Live and let live.
All I know is I love you, and I have to be with you.
It's no good, Carter.
It won't work. It can. It must!
Let me stay with you on any terms you say.
If it doesn't work, I'll bow out and you'll never see me again.
All I ask is for a fair trial.
We both have to learn that there's more to a relationship than just the physical.
We can't keep muddying up the issue with chemistry.
We must try to forget our primeval...
Animal appetites.
Follow that cab and don't lose it!
Shall I help you with the bags?
I'll be fine.
Just hurry back.

Unconditional surrender.
Ah. You're still beautiful.
Worked again, huh?
Boston in ten days?
Well, after tonight, no problem.
I'd like to ask you what it is you've got, but I don't want you to waste your strength talking.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Send a wire to J.I. Stevens.
"Harrison reunited with wife.
"Confirms she is perfectly in line with corporate image
"of solid respectability."
Did you ever get that feeling you've been to a place before?
I have this cleared for you.
I hope it will be enough.
Plenty. What about you?
I moved everything to my room.
Oh. Fine.
Your room?
Yes.
I... I'm sleeping in the little guest room.
Why?
Carter, dear,
I've been thinking.
Everything you said in the cab is true.
We... We must find out if we can live together.
And we can't keep muddying up the issue with chemistry and, uh, our primeval animal appetites.
Uh. Oh, I know it will be difficult for us both, but it's only for a month or two.
A month or two?
Oh, it really is a good idea, you know.
Yeah. Marvelous.
Whose is it? I mean...
Of course, it's a fine idea.
I was gonna suggest it myself.
Now, why don't you take this champagne and put it on ice, and then later we'll have a nice, quiet cozy little supper?
Oh, darling, I am sorry. I...
I'm afraid I have to go out.
Our first night?
You know what you said.
"Live and let live."
Unfortunately, there's been an emergency meeting called about the statue.
Signor Petracini's coming, and I've got to interpret.
I won't be late.
Under the circumstances, take your time.
Sorry to rush you together like this, but we've just received information that Friday at 3:00, there's to be an important conference at the Institute of Arts,
Professions and Sciences, the purpose of which is to discuss improving the American image abroad.
Top American figures, and I mean top, from every walk of international life will be attending.
Top American figures from every walk of life will be attending.
Eh.
Eh.
Now what better time could we choose to present our letter of protest against the banning of Signor Petracini's statue?
It is the right time to send a letter of protest against the banning of your statue.
Listen!
How dare they ban my statue, judging it immoral?
How dare the Americans ban his statue on grounds of moral turpitude!
As a man, I am not interested in physical beauty, but only in the beauty of the spirit.
As a man, he's not interested in the pleasures of the flesh, but only the beauty of the spirit.
My works of art come from the soul, not from the flesh.
And he is right!
We artists should be able to paint, write, sculpt anything we like!
Freedom of expression!
Yes, I'm sorry to interrupt.
But I've just been told there is a thick fog and that buses and trains are unlikely to be running much longer.
So I suggest we adjourn the meeting until tomorrow.
There's fog, we have to finish here.
If it's really a pea souper and anyone can't get home, they are welcome to come and spend the night with me.
- What?
- If you can not get home because of the fog, you can spend the night with me.
Me? With you?
Yes. Yes.
Oh, my lady.
Come on. Come in.
Shh!
Oh, baby.
Do you mind?
What are you doin' here?
There's a thick fog.
I had to spend the night somewhere.
There are ten million people in London.
Why choose me?
I didn't. Toni did. She assured me you'd welcome me with open arms.
Yeah. Didn't realize she meant it literally.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Look if you find it intolerable, dear boy, try downstairs!
Why should I freeze?
I'm not complaining.
Well, I'm not...
So here we are, then.
Do you snore?
I hope so!
Oh! You better take an aspirin.
I don't have an aspirin.
They're at the back of the third drawer down.
I nursed her through a bad cold.
Mmm.
Very bad cold.
Sweetheart.
It's me.
He snores.
Let me stay here.
I promise to be good.
I'm terribly sorry!
Out!
Oh!
Psst.Signor.
Where is the lady?
Hmm?
Uh, where is sleeping
Signora Harrison?
Signora Harrison?
Si, Signora Harrison.
Ah!Signora Harrison.
Right there.
Ah.
My mistake!
But what's the problem?
Ooh!
Sorry.
Yes?
Carter?
Yes?
Dick.
Just checking progress.
Can you talk?
Mmm-mmm.
Where are you? In bed?
Mmm-hmm.
Alone?
Mmm-mmm.
Uh, with your wife?
Mmm-mmm.
Not with your wife?
Mmm-mmm.
Does your wife know?
Mmm-hmm.
And she doesn't mind?
Mmm-mmm.
You realize, of course, we can't have this sort of thing in Boston.
Mmm-hmm.
You call me when you can.
My lawyer.
Mmm-hmm.
Where to now, Carter?
Where to what?
I'm sure your recent, splendid exploits in the field of oil will not go unrewarded.
Your masters must have some smashing job in store for you.
Nothing special, I imagine.
Don't you feel just a wee bit concerned about Toni?
Why? Oh, Toni, the marcher.
Toni, the fanatic.
Toni who paints rude slogans on walls!
My dear boy, we live in a free world.
Toni can do what she wants, she can think what she wants.
Picket! Wave banners!
Chain herself to railings!
Her life is her own.
She can ride naked through the streets of London as Lady Godiva, and it wouldn't bother me.
Well, Carter, you certainly have changed.
But you haven't! Look, why don't we out out all this subterfuge? I know your angle.
I wish I knew yours.
What you're doing with this new found phony liberalism!
There's nothing phony about it...
Oh, no?
No.
Care to put it to a test?
Such as?
If you were to attend our committee meeting today,
I very much doubt that you could sit there and listen to the things being said about America without blowing your top!
Would you like to put your money where I imagine your mouth is?
You'll come?
I'd be delighted.
Good 0l' sport!
Uh... You'll...
You'll find some...
Yéah,yeah,yeah.
Ciao! That's my husband.
Oh!
I suggest you take a cold bath.
Terribly sorry. I...
Hello! Haven't seen you before, have we?
No, I just joined.
American, aren't we?
Yes.
Good show!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Last night we were discussing our protest against the shabby treatment meted out to Petracini's
Woman on a Horse.
This morning, a dear and imaginative friend of mine, an extremely broad-minded American, gave me a very provocative idea.
Nine hundred years ago, another woman and another horse made history in a dramatic protest.
Her name was Lady Godiva, and she rode naked through the streets of Coventry.
Now, my friend proposes that Lady Godiva should ride again, through Soho Square and up the steps of the American Institute to deliver our letter of protest against this outrageous attack on the freedom of artistic expression.
Bravo!
Absolutely wizard, what?
Swell.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm sure we shall not lack for a volunteer.
For example, our old friend
Mavis Masters here, a well-known artist who combines good judgment with sturdy attractiveness.
Well, actually I haven't ridden in years.
Oh, what a pity.
But I'm sure there are others who will not shirk this opportunity to further ourcause.
Toni! She'd be fab!
Bravo! Bravo!
Cheers!
So, if Toni would consent to ride?
Nude?
You wouldn't really be starkers, darling.
Just flesh-colored costume with masses of tresses glued all over the important places.
- Sounds painful.
- Do it, Toni. Please.
Well, if it's the wish of the committee, very well.
He just got into a radio cab.
R-H-7-1-4.
Now find out where it's going and call me back immediately.
Carter, come in, come in.
Have I got news for you!
You've got news for me?
I've got news for you.
Wait till you hear who's coming to London!
What do you think she's up to now?
Number one himself, J.I. in person!
She's going to ride a horse...
He's making the opening speech in the conference this weekend.
In the flesh, nude. Stark, staring nude. And where do you think he's gonna make that speech?
3:00 Friday at the American Institute.
What'd you say?
I said 3:00 Friday at the American Institute.
No, that's what I said.
I said J.I. was arriving...
What?
Yes.
He's going to make the opening speech 3:00
Friday at the American Institute. See.
Oh! That's not all he'll be doing.
He just might be taking a little peekie-weekie at my wife.
I hope he will!
Riding a horse? Bare?
Bareback?
Bare everything.
You're kidding?
That's how you ride if you're Lady Godiva and delivering a letter of protest.
And you know when and where you deliver it?
3:00 Friday at the American Institute.
Boy! You really did marry a nut!
A nut? I married a whole plantation.
Yeah, we gotta get her out of town.
Oh? That's all?
How 'bout a vacation?
She'd never leave.
Not with this Godiva thing.
She'd suspect something immediately.
And that's precisely what that bearded vulture's waiting for!
She wears a beard?
No! She doesn't wear a beard!
I have other enemies in this thing.
She wouldn't leave, not without something very strong.
Got a cigarette?
Over there.
Something irresistible.
Something bigger even than...
See this, Dick?
Yeah.
Don't we have oil installation in Gadonga?
We did. They set fire to them last Thursday. Why?
Suppose I were sent to Gadonga.
Look. If you want to commit suicide, use my razor.
It's electric, but you can hang yourself on the cord.
I'm serious!
Why do you want to go to Gadonga?
I don't! But suppose Toni thought I was going to an almost certain death?
I don't get it.
You will.
Gadonga?
Yeah.
Gadonga.
With a brief stopover in sunny Nassau.
You'll like this.
Special recipe of Sheik
Moulay Yusef Allh.
I just can't get over you, cooking and, well, being domestic.
I feel I'm just beginning to know you.
I feel I'm just beginning to know me too.
Just beginning to know what
I really want out of life.
It's all right here in this room.
Tranquility, peace...
And you.
Isn't that the telephone?
Hello. What?
Yes, yes. He is.
Hold on a minute.
It's long distance from America.
Mr. J.I. Stevens.
Isn't he the...
J.I.?
That must be some kind of a joke.
He never calls anyone personally.
Hello. Who is this?
Oh, yes, J.I. Yes.
Well, now, Mr. Harrison.
I have important news for you.
It's rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb.
You want me to go where? When?
Well I realize that, sir, but I'm long overdue for a vacation.
I feel as though
I'm entitled to decline.
Rub-a-dubba, rub-a-dubba, rub-bub-bub.
Washington!
In whose office?
Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dubba, hub-dub-dub.
The Secretary of State!
He wants to talk to me?
Yes, sir.
I'll hold on.
Yes. Hello, Mr. Secretary.
Rub-a-dubba, rub-a-dubba, rub-a-dubba.
The president feels...
Me, sir?
Well, of course,
I can't say no.
Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, ru-- Oh, what a rhubarb!
Naturally, I-l accept.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
And thank you for your confidence.
Good-bye.
What is it, Carter?
It's nothing.
Just forget about it.
What has the Secretary of State to do with you?
And the President?
I don't understand.
It's best you don't.
Where are they sending you, Carter?
What does it matter?
The dreadful thing is
I must leave you just when we've found each other again.
It's Gadonga, isn't it?
WW do you say that'?
I'm not a complete fool! They're sending you on some dangerous mission.
This is strictly classified information!
No one must know.
Damn it! When will this world grow up?
Oh, I'm sorry. I...
I won't let go again.
When, Carter?
When do you go?
Let's get one thing straight.
While I'm still here, we never heard of Gadonga.
We don't mention it.
It doesn't exist.
All right?
Right.
Dinner's ready.
That's not bad.
You haven't touched a thing.
Carter, when are you going?
Now, we promised not to spoil our last night together.
Tomorrow!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't intend to tell you.
The two men before you were slaughtered in cold blood.
I know. Poor devils.
But don't worry, third time's a charm.
And besides, I'll be safe and sound in a nice, big, new, air-conditioned hotel.
The Gadonga Hilton.
Isn't that the doorbell?
Mrs. Harrison?
Yes.
Murchison. Security Division.
U.S. Embassy.
Come in.
Oh, thank you.
I... I have two pieces of equipment here for your husband.
Oh, right over here.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, your husband's bulletproof vest.
Bulletproof?
I'll take that.
Oh, Mr. Harrison. Murchison.
Security. U.S. Embassy.
Your bulletproof vest.
Is this quite necessary to discuss?
The vest? Oh, very. Very.
For example, it's not only bulletproof, it's also completely operational against poison darts.
So long as they're not blown under a range of 20 feet.
Oh, Carter!
Anything else, Mr. Murchison?
Oh, my word, yes. Survival kit.
Keep that very handy.
Thank you. Is that all,
Mr. Murchison?
I shouldn't be impatient,
Mr. Harrison.
After all if your two unfortunate predecessors had paid more attention to their equipment...
Very well. What else? Automatic pistol.
Moeggler-Cartwright.
Kill a man at 20 paces!
Snake at ten.
A snake?
Yes.
Oh, and speaking of shots.
You'll receive your inoculations en route.
Malaria, diphtheria, blackwater fever, leprosy and plague.
Oh, and, uh, finally, your I.R.P.
What?
A last resort pill.
Last resort pill?
Yes, they're marvelous.
Absolutely reliable. Quicker than cyanide and only a teensy bit more painful.
Do I take it with water?
Oh, no! Never touch the water out there. Deadly, deadly.
Well, uh, I guess that's about all, Mr. Harrison,
Except to say it's been an honor meeting a man like you, and I do hope and pray we meet again.
I really do.
It's been an honor meeting you too, ma'am.
Pleasure.
Yes.
I'm happy to tell you that the weather's fine and balmy in Nassau.
Nassau?
Yes, thank you, Mister...
Murchison. Security Division, U.S.
Embassy. Yes.
I'll see Mr. Murchison to the door, dear.
Oh, here!
Nice work, Sir Laurence.
Oh, I really had it tonight, didn't I?
Just a teensy bit overboard.
You got the plane tickets?
Right here.
First class. 11:00 tomorrow for Nassau.
Sure she'll go with you?
I'm sorry, dear. I would have given anything to have spared you that.
What was that about Nassau?
Oh, nothing.
Now, darling.
All right. I may as well tell you.
There's to be a week-long briefing session in Nassau starting tomorrow.
Secretary of State thought that under the circumstances we might want to spend these last...
I mean, these days together, but...
Well, I nearly begged you to come along, but then I thought, wouldn't it be better to make the break now, cleanly?
Call it selfish if you like, but isn't it wiser to keep ourselves at arm's length?
I mean, if we got any closer, it would be unbearable.
Wouldn't it?
Oh, you're a wonderful person, Carter.
All right. Have it your way.
Mr. Bramwell?
Yes.
Good evening. May I come in?
Thank you very much indeed.
Bramwell I'm going to be utterly frank with you.
Should you pick up the phone and call Brigadier Fanshaw at Ml-5 to check up on me, he will unhesitatingly deny that he or anyone else in Military Intelligence has ever heard of me.
Oh?
Sit down.
Uh, would you...
Not on duty, thank you.
Now, officially, this visit has never taken place. Clear?
Yes. Are you sure it's me you want?
I'm not in the government.
And I'm not here, so we start level, right?
Yes.
Thank you, no.
Carter Harrison.
Oh, come now.
British Intelligence isn't quite asleep, you know.
What's an important American business executive doing mixing with our lunatic fringe?
The Anti-American
Brigade, hmm?
Is he? I wouldn't,
I don't know.
Oh, I think you do, Mr. Bramwell and I could hazard a guess myself.
You could?
Yes.
Since Harrison obviously has nothing in common with these people,
I might draw the conclusion that the C.l.A. has slipped him in.
As some sort of a spy.
Oh, no, no, I assure you sir,
Carter Harrison's not a spy.
What's he up to, then?
I have no idea. I'm not his...
I mean after all, it is a free country!
Isn't it?
You know more than you're saying, Bramwell.
Even if I did, I don't talk to every Tom,
Dick and Harry who barges into my room, waving a dirty little card
I can't even read.
Very well if that's your attitude,
I think this is a matter for Ml-12.
Fine! No, wait.
I assure you. There's no question of security involved.
And if it will put your mind at rest,
Carter and his wife are leaving tomorrow morning for a vacation at Nassau.
Tomorrow? Nassau?
With his wife? Yes.
But isn't his wife riding as
Lady Godiva?
Oh, no, no, no! That's all off.
Really? Are you sure?
Oh, positive.
Oh?
Would you? No. Never on duty.
Thank you so much, no.
I see. Well, thank you and good night, Bramwell.
Thank you, uh, Mister...
I don't believe I caught your name.
Yes, that's quite possible.
Good night.
Good night.
No, no! Please! Please don't!
Help! No, please don't.
No!
Have mercy, please!
Please don't do that! Oh!
Oh, no! Oh, no.
Please don't.
Darling!
Help! No!
What is it? Carter!
Oh!
Oh, Toni.
It must have been a nightmare.
There were people chasing me.
With spears.
Blowpipes.
I was alone.
Oh.
In the swamp. Crocodiles.
Tsetse flies.
It's all right.
But I was alone!
Yes, darling,
I know. Lie back.
Poor baby. You're not alone anymore.
But I will be!
No, darling. Never again.
I know Gadonga isn't possible, but anywhere else you go, anytime,
I'll go with you.
Anywhere?
Anywhere.
Even... Nassau?
Even Nassau.
But...
What about Godiva?
They'll have to find a substitute.
Oh, thank you for just being you.
Well, uh,
I suppose...
Yes.
Better go back to your room.
I guess.
Oh, Harry. lwasjust trying to call you.
Is the master at home?
Still asleep.
He had a disturbed night.
Well, before we disturb him again, as disturb him we must,
I have sad tidings.
It seems Mr. Godiva has persuaded Lady
Godiva not to ride this afternoon.
How did you know?
I have my sources.
I happen to know precisely where he's going.
You know!
Yes.
Though I don't know exactly why.
I can't imagine how you found out about the Gadonga mission.
But, Harry, it's absolutely confidential.
Gadonga? Oh, yes.
And it isn't even about oil.
It's the State Department and the U.N.
He's going as a special negotiator to... Gadonga!
Oh, my poor Toni.
He's going to Nassau.
Yes, I know.
You know?
He has to go there first for a few days' briefing.
Ah, and he begged you to come along.
On the contrary, he begged me not to.
But you, of course, insisted, and, graciously, he gave in.
No, Harry. And I resent your insinuations!
This has nothing to do with Lady Godiva.
But it does most conveniently cancel your ride does it not?
You can get someone else.
I thought you had more sense than to fall for a thing like this!
I warn you, Harry...
I warn you that you require my sanction to take time off from the paper.
And if I went without it?
I'd fire you!
Then fire away!
Because I am going with Carter.
And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
Lovely day, sir.
Yes.
I phoned through to the house, and Mr. and
Mrs. Harrison have left for the airport.
Good. Oh, and the airline just telephoned.
J.I.'s plane is due in an hour ahead of time.
Good. It ought to be landing in 45 minutes.
Perfect. I'll run out and meet him.
Have the car... 45 minutes?
Yes, sir.
They'll both be at the airport at the same time! They'll meet!
Who will? Never mind.
Call the car. Get my coat.
What coat, sir?
Any coat!
You haven't got a coat, sir.
Well forget the coat and get the car.
You haven't got a car either sir.
Well do something!
Call somebody.
Are you sure I don't have a coat?
No, sir.
Then forget the coat.
I'll call a cab!
Good morning.
Hi. Oh, hi.
Oh, not now.
Gotta call a cab. Sorry.
Why is Carter Harrison going to Gadonga?
Gadonga? Yes.
Why is Harrison going to Gadonga?
Well, I...
Oh, you don't deny it then?
Yes, I do! It's a lie.
Is it?
Yes. Good!
I'm delighted to hear that.
You see, British and American views on Gadonga haven't always coincided.
My chief was worried the C.l.A. might be using him as some undercover agent.
C.l.A.? No, no.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm terribly sorry. I've got a plane to meet, but there is no truth in it.
Splendid. I know our Prime Minister's calling your President tonight.
Fine. And when he brings the Gadonga matter up...
No, he can't!
He mustn't-- I can't stop him from phoning, but he mustn't bring up that matter. If there's no truth in the story, what harm...
I swear, I swear he's not going anywhere near Gadonga.
I'll need proof of that.
I don't know how you folks found this out, but it's all kind of a joke.
You see Carter Harrison is in line for a top job with this corporation if he can clean up his family image.
That's all there is to it.
His fa... Yes, of course.
Now I understand.
Fascinating old boy.
You tell me more!

Hmm'?
Oh, Carter!
Darling. Oh, now, now, now.
Don't cry.
Everything's gonna be all right.
And I promise you, you have nothing at all to worry about.
Okay?
Absolutely nothing-
I'm sure I speak for...
There he is! Carter!
Over here!
It's... It's J.I.
J.I. Stevens?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
I don't know.
I'm sure I speak for all my friends here, who represent every aspect of American industry, when I say, we consider each
American businessman abroad to be an individual ambassador of goodwill.
He probably has some special instructions from the Secretary of State.
I'll see him alone for a moment.
You better stay here and fix your face before you come over, huh?
Thank you. Excuse us, gentlemen.
We'll see you in the car.
Well, well, well, Carter.
How are you, J.I.? Nice to see you.
Surprised seeing you.
Rather expected Bramwell. You know Ethel.
Yes, Mrs. Stevens.
Hello, Carter.
Is that the young lady we're so hoping to meet?
Yes, um...
Unfortunately, we're just leaving, uh, the country.
Uh, it's...It's my wife's father.
He's... He's desperately ill.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes, they only give him a week.
And, uh, well... Well, it's... It's a sort of a...
Well, he has a kind of a condition.
And it's sort of a double...
Well, it might even be a triple...
Oh, dear.
Yes.
B.E.A. flight 30 for

B.E.A. flight 3O to Paris...
Oh, there he is!
Bramwell!
Hello.
Hello, J.I. How are you?
Mrs. Stevens.
Richard.
Nice to see you both.
Carter, I see you're here. Yes.
And, uh, everyone else.
Uh, Toni will be here in a minute.
I was just telling J.I. about poor Father.
Poor Father?
Yes.
Oh, poor Father.
Shocking, isn't it?
Oh, shocking.
So, J.I. understands why Toni and I have to leave
London now.
To, uh, bury poor Father.
We hope not.
Latest bulletin has him hanging on by a thread.
Oh, good, good.
I hadn't heard.
Remarkable constitution the man has.
That's where Carter gets it from.
It's not his father, you idiot.
It's hers!
I know, but they were very close.
Oh, Toni. Uh, I'd like you to meet the Stevenses.
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Oh, hello, Mr. Murchi...
Hello. How are you?
Nice seeing you again.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've been behaving rather foolishly, and...
We quite understand.
No one has a better right, but I'm sure he'll pull through.
You must be brave, my dear.
He's the brave one.
I think they called our plane, dear.
It'll all turn out for the best.
You think so?
With blackwater fever, poison darts and plague!
Oh, dear! He has had a time of it. Hasn't he?
Has had?
Um, now, dear, we promised we weren't gonna mention it again, didn't we?
- Now we really must go...
- Will Mrs. Carter Harrison go to the nearest phone, please.
Mrs. Carter Harrison, please.
It can only be Mrs. Carmody.
You'd better hurry.
Excuse me.
She's a lovely person, Carter.
Thank you, sir.
Bring her to Boston, and I guarantee her you'll have no problems.
Good luck, boy. Good-bye, sir.
Mrs. Stevens.
Carter.
Good-bye.
Did she say "poison darts"?
An explorer, J.I. One of those crazy Italians. Climb anything.
Oh?
Yes.
President of the International Branch?
It seems his firm has a corporate image for its top executives.
They've got to be respectable, happily married men. Get the picture?
Go on.
An Italian explorer, eh?
Yes.
Good, sturdy stock.
Didn't you think so, Mrs. Stevens?
Lovely girl.
Yes.
Mr. Harrison?
Yes.
Oh, I have a message for you, sir.
Yes?
I hope I got it straight.
"Good luck, Mr. Executive.
Sorry I can't make Nassau,
"but have pressing engagement elsewhere.
Signed, Lady Godiva."
Godiva!
"RS. Suggest you take last resort pill now
"with or without water."
Where'd she go?
She left the building, sir.
Follow that cab ahead.
Quickly! Right.
Oh! It's you! Look, I need another favor.
Do you remember me?
Remember you?
Yeah.
How could I forget those fantastic hours in that Arab tent?
Will you try to get a message to the lady in that cab?
Hold it.
Charley, stand by, will ya?
Message?
Tell her I love her. Really love her.
I don't care what she does.
I don't even care if she's gonna strip off her clothes, get up on a horse and ride naked through
Soho Square, I don't care!
Hey, Charley. Tell the boys to get their cameras out, will you?
We're in for a very big day!
Naked? Where?
Soho Square.
Seems there's a gent encouragin'you to strip off in Soho Square, ma'am.
Forget it! Just lose that cab and take me directly to Ryman's Costumes.
I don't know why I was worried about
Carter's wife. She's a charming girl.
Yes, J.I. She'll be a credit to the firm.
Now, Harry. I want the newspapers to know who I am.
Mrs. Carter Harrison.
The wife of...
Don't worry you'll be covered by the press of the world.
If you don't sit still, that's all you will be covered by.
Harry do buzz off.
Mavis, more tresses please.
Yes, Mavis, hurry.
Oh, all right.
But it's rotten of you to come back.
I poured my heart and soul into this.
Had a bit of a job squeezing them in didn't you sweetie?
Oh, charming!
I even borrowed a beautiful black horse blanket from a friend in the guards so I'd be sure to stand out from the horse.
Afact he'd no doubt appreciate.
Oh, wrap up!
Uh-oh! Trouble.
Enter, Mr. Godiva.
Call the police!
Don't worry, we're prepared.
Mavis, hurry up, please!
Come on!
Excuse me.
I want to see my wife. You can see her in Soho Square in exactly 30 minutes.
Are you gonna move or do I have to shove that bush down your throat?
I wouldn't try.
Better move along, sir.
We don't want any trouble now, do we?
Thanks, lads.
Most convincing. Anytime.
How much for the flowers?
Two bob a bunch, sir.
Oh, bobs again! Here.
Keep the change.
Thanks, guv.
Oh, excuse me. Good day, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm sorry to barge in on you this way, but I'm very anxious to see my wife.
Your wife?
Yes, she just came in.
We've had quite a few in today, sir.
Well, this was only
Oh, that would be the dark-haired lady.
Yes, that's the one.
May I see her, please?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but the management does not allow visitors to see clients before they're properly dressed.
I just want to give her these flowers.
Look, I treated her abominably...
We mustn't blame ourselves, sir.
But I do. It was all my fault.
And before I had a chance to explain, she left a note and was gone, just like that.
Oh, that's life, sir, isn't it?
Here one moment, gone the next.
Look, I must see her before she leaves.
But she's not leaving until
Monday, sir.
Are you crazy?
They're putting her on a horse and parading her through
Soho Square in exactly 20 minutes.
Good gracious!
She'll never be ready by then!
A horse?
Yes, a horse.
Oh, is this some sort of, uh, religious thing?
Excuse me. Floral tributes for number six.
Number six? Oh!
These would be for your late lady.
Late?
Late.
Um, l...I'm terribly sorry. I...
I made a dreadful mistake.
I didn't...
Sorry.
Horse?
I love a parade, but this is ridiculous!
Come on. Get in.
You take the truck route.
Rendezvous north side of Soho Square.
Toni! Wait!
Toni!
Wait!
Here! What the ruddy...
Oh!
What d'ya think...
Let gQ!
Toni!
This way!
Oh, may we be of assistance?
Yes, she's hurt.
Needs a doctor.
There's a first-aid center just around the corner.
Thank you.
Wait!
It's much quicker straight through our place.
Thank you.
Just out through the back door and right through the alley and...
Do tell them we sent you.
They've been very kind to us.
Oh, you found your dear lady.
I'm so glad.
It was a car accident.
Oh, a pity. So young!
Such a lot of hair!
Binky, Mavis! Quickly.
You two look up there.
Have a good look!
They're around here somewhere.
Um, I wonder if I could, you know, use your...
Of course sir! That's what we're here for.
Just pop her down there, and I'll nip upstairs and get my tape measure.
Operator. Connect me, please, with a hospital.
Did a lady just run out of here?
Oh, no, sir. Once they're in, they're inclined to stay.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
This is an emergency!
It's my wife! What's that?
No, no, no!
I don't need obstetrics.
I need an... Operator!
Operator!
Yes, yes. Hello.
Yes, obstetrics.
Yes, I don't need you.
My wife doesn't need you either.
Now, listen. Listen carefully.
I need an ambulance.
There's been an automobile accident, and my wife is unconscious and she's lying in a mortuary...
- She's gone!
- Our sympathy, sir.
My wife! Where is she?
Oh, sir! You haven't mislaid her again!
Who's gonna pay for all of this? What's the idea?
We'll never get through. Then get the horse. I'll ride it from here!
Mavis, Binky. You help Toni get the horse out. I'll clear a path.
Excuse me. Come on. Stand back!
Clear a path, please.
Come on everybody.
May I get through, please?
This is Soho, J.I. Quaint place.
Full of quiet charm.
Excuse me.
Hurry up, Binky! For heaven's sake!
Do put a sock in it, Mavis!
Only a minor accident, J.I. The good old bobbies will clear it in a minute.
Oh, Toni!
He's gorgeous! Come on. Come on.
Up you go. Up you go!
Give her a hand.
One, two, three.
UPSY-daisy!
Everybody, would you back up, please? Thank you.
Would you mind backing up, please? We've got to clear a passage! It's very urgent!
Hi, there!
Oh!
Who's that?
Friend of mine.
British Secret Service.
Top level stuff.
This could be the royal family coming through.
You get around, Bramwell.
I like that. Thank you.
Back up, please. Get your cameras ready, men. This may be something exciting.
Queen or no Queen, we're going to be late!
Then we'd better walk.
It's only two blocks.
Right.
We're going to walk.
Pass it on.
Excuse us, please.
We better get back, J.I.
They're turning ugly.
Just saw a man with a bomb!
Nonsense! Come on.
No! Really, I mean it!
They're turning ugly!
Look at that girl.
What a figure!
Disgusting. Shameless.
Better get outta here.
Don't like the looks of that horse.
A trampler if I ever saw one.
Splendid!
Don't you ever think of anything else?
Sorry! Toni!
Toni!
Oh! It's him!
It's him. Let's go!
Don't I know that girl?
No, no, she's a blonde.
I mean, you wouldn't know her.
Phony blonde charging around on a mad horse.
Toni! Get outta here!
Toni, please!
Come along now, gentlemen.
Break it up.
The penalty for striking an officer of the law...
Toni, listen! Toni,
I want to talk...
That's Carter and his wife!
It is?
You rat! Get out of here!
Take your hands...
Oh!
What in the world is she doing here?
I thought her father was dying?
She's gone berserk with sorrow.
Take your hands off me!
Toni! I want to talk to you!
Oh! Let go! Let go!
How dare you!
Toni, please!
"In addition to the accused, whom I now know to be
"Harrison, Harrison, Jones,
Masters and Waring, et al.
"As I approached the accused and reasoned with them,
"asking them to cease and desist forthwith,
"whereupon Harrison aimed a blow at Jones and hit me on the nose.
"Jones aimed a blow at Harrison and hit me on the nose.
"Miss Masters aimed a kick at Harrison, missed him and caught me right in the..."
Perhaps I ought to write this down, Your Worship.
My sympathies, Constable.
Proceed.
"Whereupon Mrs. Harrison aimed a blow at Harrison, knocking off my helmet.
"As I bent down to retrieve it,
"I was put in an extremely unfortunate position as regards the horse,
"which then proceeded to..."
I do think I ought to write this one down, Your Worship.
I think we can dispense with that one altogether.
Will the defendants rise?
In the case of the defendants Jones,
Waring, Miss Masters and Mrs. Harrison, five pounds each.
Mr. Harrison, kindly remain behind.
The rest of you, please see the bailiff.
Don't worry, J.I. He'll come out of this smelling like a rose.
He better!
I understand a lawyer has been retained to speak for you.
Uh, Mr. Martindale.
Are you ready?
Your Worship. I would ask you to consider that a conviction would be a blot not only on Mr. Harrison's unblemished reputation, but also upon the name of the great company which employs him.
Mr. Harrison had no connection with the foolish demonstration planned for Soho Square.
He was on his way, peacefully, to attend an important conference, when he was suddenly shocked to his very roots at the sight of his own wife, indecently clad, on her way to take part in a demonstration designed solely to embarrass the great country of which he is an honorable citizen!
Can you, Your Worship, could anyone condemn a man for rushing forward in a desperate but dare I say noble attempt to stop this woman from committing an act of vulgar folly?
But I trust, I believe you will find Mr. Harrison not guilty.
And this is the truth,
Mr. Harrison?
No, sir. Not a word of it!
I beg your pardon?
None of it is true.
Mr. Harrison, if you feel there's something you ought to tell the court.
I appreciate the efforts of my company to whitewash my name, but they needn't have bothered.
My resignation is already in the mail.
Your Worship. My wife and I have a great many differences of opinion.
As a matter of fact, we disagree on most things.
For example, she believes passionately in the purposes of this committee.
I do not.
But my actions yesterday were in no way an attempt to try and stop her.
I was merely trying to reach her to tell her how ashamed I was of my behavior toward her and that I loved her very much and that being her husband is the only job I care anything about.
After what happened yesterday, you might find this hard to believe.
She does.
But it's the truth.
Thank you, Mr. Harrison.
I hope you get her back.
If that's what you want.
Case dismissed.
Thank you.
You know, that's the lowest trick of all. Sincerity.
Go on! I'll pay your bloody fine.
I'd think twice about accepting that resignation, J.I.
You're losing a great vice president.
And a lousy public relations officer.
Yes.
Well, Julius.
You've just fired your two best men.
I certainly did! A man without principle is a man without integrity, guts or moral fiber.
You certainly stood by your principles!
You bet I did!
When are you going to hire them back?
This afternoon.
Do let's get out of this dreadful law court!
I'm a criminal, darling!
Binky, dear, cheer up!
Oh!
Well, I've blown it. But, anyway,
I appreciate your cooperation.
Even getting yourself arrested!
Your security boys really do a thorough job.
Well, that's what we're here for.
By the way, I never did get your name.
Bond. James Bond.
No relation.
Carter!
Carter, wait!
Home, darling?
Uh, no.
The press will be there.
There'll be reporters and pictures.
Let's find some little hideaway all to ourselves, huh?
Lovely, but, I must get out of this and collect
Mavis's horse blanket.
I left it at Ryman's.
Driver!
Yes, sir?
Take us to... Soho.
We want to get rid of the lady's clothes, pick up a blanket and then find some little place where we won't be bothered by photographers, huh?
Right. Hey, Charley, do me a favor and phone the missus, will you?
Tell her I'll be a bit late tonight.
The passionate Persian is back in town.
A wedding in Germany
Fallingbostel, May 1969
Dear children, even though your stomachs are full, you can stand a little speech.
Thirty years ago, when your mother and I married, the sky was blue, but dark clouds were already looming on the horizon:
The clouds of World War Two.
All of us gathered here today hope with all our hearts that you be spared such suffering.
Clermont-Ferrand: 134,000 residents in the Puy-de-Dôme region.
The capital of Auvergne is 240 miles from Paris and 37 miles from Vichy, which was the capital of France from 1940 to 1944.
Gergovie, a nearby Gallic town, used to be the fortified town of Vercingétorix, conquered by Julius Caesar.
A father tells his children about a more recent defeat.
In 1939, I was 27 years old.
I was the father of a large family, so I hadn't been sent to the front.
The front was the Maginot Line.
I'd been sent to Montferrand, near Clermont, and my wife's dairywoman, Mrs. Michel, had criticized me for not going to the front.
So after the rout,
I told her that there was no point in me going to the front, since the front came to me.
Was there anything other than courage in the Resistance?
Of course. But the two emotions
I experienced the most frequently were sorrow and pity.
The Colonel was a French Action man, the Major was a moderate.
The Captain was all for the diocese, the Lieutenant couldn't stand the church.
THE SORROW AND THE PITY
Chronicle of a French city under the Occupation
All these men made excellent Frenchmen.
Excellent soldiers who march in time.
Thinking that the Republic is still the best thing going.
Now most of these strapping lads don't share the same political views.
But they all agree, no matter what their view...
Part 1: THE COLLAPSE
Two brothers, both local farmers, live a few miles from Clermont.
They have many memories of German occupation.
Is that your village?
That's where I was born.
I was born near that church there, and later I lived on the farm facing the school.
You can't help but love your country.
Did you think about it in Buchenwald?
Not much.
– You didn't?
– No.
– What did you think about?
– Surviving. That's it.
That's mainly what I thought about.
But I'm talking about me, about how I saw things.
I'm not talking about those who...
There were some people who cried.
When I saw them cry,
I knew that they would never make it.
No way.
You had to think about yourself first.
And think about others after.
This politician also has reasons to remember.
For me, it was an experience that I will never forget.
This experience may have had a few secondary effects, but I don't believe it has affected my attitude or behavior.
Has it not made you feel bitter towards certain French people?
No, I wouldn't say that.
It showed me that there are certain tendencies and habits, which, when they are fired, fed, or stimulated, crop up like weeds, and so we must always be on the defense.
We have to protect our youth from this type of propaganda.
We have to talk to them about it more than we talked about it a generation or two ago.
The manager of the Philips company also has reasons to remember.
As I was saying, his friends would ask me why I joined the Resistance.
Why? Because going into a restaurant and seeing Germans at a table, and being told there's only four steaks left for the Germans and none for us was a little frustrating, seeing as that steak came from our cows in Auvergne.
So it was our right to eat it before giving it away.
That's my first reason.
My second reason was that the Germans were forever imposing curfews.
It was, after all, a Nazi regime, a totalitarian regime, no matter how you look at it.
It was worth fighting for, it was even worth dying for, rather than to live as slaves. Hence, the Resistance.
Lasting peace is what we need.
There's nothing dumber than fighting.
That's what I think.
– Depends on what you're fighting for.
– Do you think they really knew?
– They didn't know?
– I doubt it.
There are a few fanatics who know why.
– Did you know why?
– Yes, I did.
– But you weren't a fanatic?
– No, but...
But when I went off to war in 1940...
I left in 1939, on September 2, and I was sent to Modane.
What could I have done?
I knew nothing. I was going to kill guys I'd never seen before, who had never harmed me.
Later, they did harm us when they arrived in France. They messed us up.
Even in moments of calm, the soldiers are ready to fight.
Faced with the enemy, they have the winning qualities of patience, courage, vigilance, determination, and confidence.
In right-thinking circles, in high society in Paris, they sympathized with our soldiers, whose troubles were unfortunately nothing compared to what came later.
And consequently, during this period, people sought to distract them, to entertain them, to relieve them from the boredom of the Maginot Line, where time passed at a snail's pace.
It must've been painfully boring.
So the right-thinking women of the Parisian bourgeoisie decided to form a committee to entertain our valiant soldiers, to provide them with a more pleasant view.
The idea was to plant rosebushes on the Maginot Line, to make it look prettier, to create a nicer atmosphere.
And there were people who donated money towards these rosebushes, so that our soldiers didn't have to look at the horrid, concrete walls, and to give them a flowery environment in which to live.
It's pathetic when you think about the awful things that came later.
The infantry is advancing at great intervals.
In Oisemont, the enemy has set fire to the tanks of an oil factory.
It took two weeks in Poland.
We felt it would be just as quick in France, as we were anxious to go home.
And, indeed, we took France in just one month.
And onwards it goes. Next stop: Paris.
Naturally, we attacked on several occasions, but the hardest time was in Oing, on the Belgian border.
The Belgian blockhaus weren't ready, but we had to take position in them.
The Germans arrived equipped with tanks.
All that we had were machine guns.
They proceeded to kill everyone inside, because it made such an easy target.
There were no battlements.
They hadn't even put up reinforced doors.
I'm telling you, we walked...
We withdrew, and we must have walked at least 20 miles, without running across any troops.
Not one single troop.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
First of all, I'd like to emphasize the fact that the German staff was not expecting to achieve such a quick, resounding success.
We soldiers, unlike Hitler, were convinced that we were facing the same adversary as in 1914-1918, a determined, brave adversary, prepared to fight to the bitter end.
Unfortunately, I must admit that Hitler was right in this case.
He was always saying how the French were incapable of repeating their performance in World War I, and he never missed an opportunity to add to this statement a few disagreeable and derisory remarks or comments on the general emotional and moral state of France.
GERMAN NEWS
Near Noyon, General Stummel, taking the vanguard with his troops, with his adjutant, took several prisoners.
It began with two.
Later, many others surrendered.
The prisoners come from every nation and every walk of life.
So-called defenders of the great nation.
In fact, a shame for the white race.
These are the Black brothers of the French.
In the words of Chamberlain,
“We, together with our allies, are the guardians of civilization.”
“Together we fight medieval barbarism.”
These are the guardians of civilization.
These are the barbarians.
This is the war of the Franco-English plutocrats.
They began this war rashly without taking any heed of the consequences, to fight for the English lords, not only until the last Frenchman, but until the last French house.
Mrs. Tausend, you stayed in Germany.
Did you read the papers?
Did you watch the German news?
Yes, we followed the events closely.
Naturally, we were a bit frightened.
But the news of victory made us happy.
These cars are stopped for a lack of gas.
The Jewish warmongers and Parisian plutocrats, with their suitcases full of gold and precious stones, have fled.
This shortage of gas put a crimp in their plans.
The streets were hopelessly blocked.
Yet these English-loving traitors and deserters continued their journey on foot.
These are the French people who have been mercilessly evacuated and dragged along in the flood of the routed French army.
Soon, these people will be able to go home.
The German people were spared such a trial, thanks to the Führer and his German soldiers.
During that time, there was an enormous upsurge of the people, who were completely panicked, terrified.
Fate willed that I should be given leave in the last few days of the month April.
Consequently, I was in Paris in early May when the Germans invaded.
On the roads, people were going mad, terrified by the bombings.
With them, they brought what they could:
Children, pets, precious objects...
Some rode on wagons, others on bicycles.
It was a mish-mash of everything and everyone. It was awful to see.
It was all the more awful in that the Germans, in an effort to block and ruin the roads for the soldiers didn't hesitate in bombing these columns of refugees.
As a result, and I can attest to this fact, that there were bodies strewn all over the place: Men, women, horses.
Car wrecks sprinkled the roads.
It was a scene from hell.
And yet this wave, this flood of people, continued to move south.
Our impressions?
We saw destroyed villages, burned lands...
It did have a certain effect on us.
– And the people on the roads?
– They were fleeing the bad guys.
What do you mean?
Weren't you the bad guys?
At first, we were seen as the enemy who was set to destroy the country.
Then they began to see that we just wanted to help.
And that reassured them.
The officers or the staff were clearly out of their depth.
Having the trains, the roads, and all telecommunications cut off led to a situation in which any plans the soldiers had made were suddenly completely ruined.
In addition, certain military circles shared the attitude of many civilians, and tackled the war unenthusiastically.
After all, they were living in...
I'm not saying they were traitors.
In any case, there were very few traitors.
But this attitude of preferring Hitler to Léon Blum was an attitude that had become very popular in bourgeois circles.
And this was a circle to which many of the soldiers belonged.
THE GREAT BATTLE OF FRANCE
On June 14, 1940, the Germans occupied Paris.
In Clermont, the papers went mad.
Le Moniteur took a stand, asking the people to stand up and fight, to resist, to remain free.
The owner of this anti-defeatist paper,
Pierre Laval, a deputy for Auvergne, was, at the same time, preparing for surrender.
The last government of the Third Republic slowly moved southwards.
Paul Reynaud wanted to keep fighting, but Philippe Pétain was already taking charge.
In Briare,
Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden met with their allies for the last time.
I've always felt that Reynaud wanted to continue, that he remained calm and firm.
Everyone was in a very difficult position then.
I also believe, and this is something he told both Churchill and me, that he wasn't very happy having Pétain as a part of his government.
– He'd foreseen the difficulties?
– Yes, already in Briare.
Now, I was a young soldier in World War I, and for me, Pétain was the hero of Verdun.
But his character had changed.
That's to be expected with age.
I'm sure he was opposed to the idea of your cities being destroyed, because he spoke of it at dinner, saying, “It's awful seeing our lovely cities destroyed.”
And I had to answer, “Yes, I understand.
“It's hard for an Englishman to say this, but there are worse things
“than the destruction of cities.”
But I don't think he was convinced.
We flew over France at a very low altitude.
– Hedgehopping?
– Yes.
In June, there's nothing quite like the Norman and Breton countryside.
And I remember, as if it only happened yesterday,
I remember thinking it was lovely, but would I ever see it again?
And it seemed rather unlikely that I would.
Then the political climate changed and became unbearable in Bordeaux.
Suddenly, treason was everywhere.
There was a will to surrender, and a desire to get along with the victors at any price.
Anglophobia, ever-present in France, resurfaced with new vigor.
And all this went hand in hand with a horrible kind of cynicism.
The military leaders, the ones who had messed up, weren't even mentioned.
Instead, people blamed absolutely everything on Léon Blum, the Front Populaire and so forth.
And so we consoled ourselves for the downfall of our nation by getting petty revenge in matters of internal affairs, a trend which, as you know, continued long afterwards.
On June 16, the government met in Bordeaux.
Paul Reynaud was defeated by the deputies who refused to leave France and Pétain became the head of government.
Adolf Hitler's elite S.S. Troops have invaded Vichy.
I felt terribly humiliated, as I had been sent on a mission on an English motorcycle and was heading to Paris, when I saw the Germans going the other way.
Now, being rather absent-minded,
I saw there were some people following these German troops, and assumed it was the English.
So they were going one way, and I was going the other.
I saw the swastikas on their helmets, and I thought I should go no further.
But no one asked me to stop.
Everyone was too busy going their own way.
If I didn't like it, tough.
The Resistance in Clermont was quickly crushed.
But the struggle, albeit subdued, continued.
Hitler's S.S. Division conquered Clermont-Ferrand.
German troops occupied the city for three days.
Zepp Dietrich, division commander, declared victory on Jaude Square, as his troops polished their boots in front of the locals, before heading off to new victories.
The Germans didn't return to Clermont until November 1942.
Our aim now is to take the arms depot in Etienne.
An entire infantry regiment has simply surrendered.
At first, I did the same as everyone.
I hadn't understood.
On the morning of June 24, the lieutenant declared that
Marshal Pétain had requested an armistice.
I knew what he meant by armistice, but I wasn't sure about “Marshal.”
I was never particularly in favor of Pétain's regime.
Nonetheless, like the other 40,000,000 Frenchmen who experienced that same moment, when I saw the rout, when I saw that the Germans were in Biarritz, and that France had been completely invaded,
I thought, like everyone else,
“Will anyone be able to end this massacre?”
People of France, as requested by the President of the Republic,
I shall henceforth be the leader of the French government.
Convinced of the affection of our admirable army,
whose heroism stands as testimony to our long military tradition
as they fight an enemy which outnumbers them,
convinced that our army's resistance
has fulfilled our duty towards our allies,
convinced of the support pledged by the former soldiers I led,
convinced of the French people's faith in me,
I give France the gift of myself,
to ease its troubles.
In these difficult times,
I think of the poor refugees,
who, in the depths of despair, trudge across our roads.
I extend my compassion and concern for them.
My heart is heavy as I tell you today that the fight must end.
Last night, I spoke with our adversary
and asked if they were prepared to help me, between soldiers,
after the fight, with honor intact,
to find a way to end the hostilities.
From the Führer headquarters a historical piece of news:
The prime minister of the new French government, Pétain has declared, in a broadcast to the French people, that France should lay down its arms.
Of course, I was happy to hear we'd won.
The defeat gave me the same feeling
I would get when I played rugby.
I don't like losing, especially when it's 60 to 0.
I hate drawn-out defeats.
This stone is a reminder of the humiliation of Germany on November 11, 1918.
Is it true that France had given England its word of honor that it wouldn't agree to a separate truce?
I think we... That was before
I was a member of government.
I think we had reached an agreement whereby neither party would cease fighting.
– Without the other party's consent.
– Right.
But we didn't discuss that at all when Churchill and I were there, because we accepted the position France had taken.
– In Briare, he said...
– That he'd accept an armistice?
No, he said we accepted the fact that you may not be able to go on.
Nothing was said about an armistice.
It's clear that between a ceasefire and an armistice, there's a big difference.
Exactly.
He simply said, “We understand that you cannot go on any longer.”
That was clear.
The question was quite simply,
“What are you going to do?”
I even sent Churchill a short letter after we returned from Briare, which has since been published, saying that we must make a clear distinction.
If the French can no longer fight, that's one thing.
But if they make it easy for the enemy, that's another.
La Madeleine. Early today in Paris, the Führer made an unexpected visit.
During his tour of Paris, he also visited this building.
Place de la Concorde.
The Arc de Triomphe.
Trocadéro.
A look at the Eiffel Tower.
On the Führer's left, Professor Speer.
One thing we should remember is that when France agreed to an armistice, even though we didn't want to lose, how many Frenchmen said,
“All's well that ends well.
So much the better.”
As for Marshal Pétain, he knew what he was doing in Vichy.
In every canton and every town, he formed what was called the French Legion.
– The Legion of Companions.
– It was meant for us veterans who'd fought in World War I.
Everyone, except me, went on Sundays.
I'm the only one who never set foot in there.
It's true.
They would attend the raising of the colors on the market place every Sunday, wearing their hammer and sickle. No, not hammer.
I don't mean the hammer and sickle.
What was it called again?
– The sword.
– Whatever.
They'd all been given a beret.
Can you imagine?
Of course, I never set foot there.
Not on your life.
But when I saw what happened,
I understood.
So suddenly, this old marshal suggests an armistice with French honor intact and so forth.
As a young Frenchman, do you feel the defeat was justified?
Does it not disgust you?
No, defeat was the inevitable consequence of French politics.
In fact, this was the theme propagated by the Vichy government.
If we were defeated, they claimed, it was because for so many years, we had to put up with party politics, which is the reason
France is in this situation today.
How did that phrase go?
“The parties which have harmed us so much...”
It was... No, that's not it.
– Something about lies.
– The lies that harmed us.
Right. “I hate the lies that have harmed us so much.”
At the same time, there was another appeal launched by de Gaulle, an appeal which apparently very few people in France heard.
I certainly didn't hear it.
But as a pilot, weren't you slightly tempted to...
I imagine that a certain number of people in the same unit as you chose to “continue the struggle,” as they said.
There weren't many who did.
Let's get it straight.
It's true that some people attempted to flee to North Africa.
Later, the situation stabilized.
Not so many fled.
Did it ever cross your mind to flee?
Of course.
But I didn't think about it for long.
My father quickly made me understand that Marshal Pétain guaranteed a new order, renewed honor, etc.
The victor of Verdun guaranteed
France's honor and the establishment of a new order.
This seemed not only desirable, but necessary, to many Frenchmen.
They respected and had faith in the Marshal.
In Clermont, the spirit of renewal filled
Pierre Laval's Le Moniteur.
Editorials sought those responsible for defeat and found them.
“Let's be French.
“Too much foreign influence has led to many problems.”
On June 26, 1940, in the magistrate's court,
René Mons was sentenced to three months in jail for defeatism.
Editorial.
We demand that those responsible be tried and an analysis of our problems ensue.
This quickly led to xenophobia,
Anglophobia and anti-Semitism.
Gaining French nationality became harder.
Vichy came out with the decree:
“The French elite must be restored.”
On that day, July 29, 1940,
Clermont butcher Antoine Labronne was tried and given a large fine for having sold rotting ham.
Did you ever speak about what the papers said back then?
– Never.
– Never?
We were totally cut off from the world, because there was one value that we all shared, and that was caution.
We didn't know what the butcher thought, or the milkman, or the engineer or the intellectual.
We had no idea.
Like everyone else, we stayed on our guard.
What do you think people's main concern was back then?
Food.
That took up most of your time?
Definitely.
Animals were illicitly butchered.
One needed a bit of meat to survive.
As you know, the French are very good at cheating.
One had to have a bit more bread than the usual ration, or a bit more tobacco by smiling nicely at the tobacconist.
A bit more of everything.
So every weekend, a regular parade of cyclists would go for supplies.
They had devised a system based on tickets, on ration cards.
Personally, I was a smoker, and it was awful not having cigarettes.
It was a horrible situation.
People would do anything, even steal.
I got so desperate that I even rolled artichoke leaves and smoked them.
The children who were born during that time, between 1942 and 1944, should have suffered from rickets, and I say this as a doctor.
In our family, it was ironic.
These young ladies have a brother, who is 27 years old, and was born in 1942.
He's six foot one!
We fed him so much to avoid rickets that he turned into a giant.
He's a great tennis player, an architect, and a giant to boot.
Are you what they call “a bourgeois” in a large provincial town?
If being bourgeois means eating properly, hunting in Sologne, having a hunting ground in Sanscoin and in Sérye, and a son-in-law who owns Lake Montciniére, then I'm a bourgeois.
When did you first begin to experience the consequences of the times, in other words, persecution?
How did you feel about that?
Did anything happen?
Not before 1942.
The only extraordinary event that occurred is that before the children were born, once again, in September 1942, the hunting season was re-opened.
What an event.
It was important to the hunters.
Game had been untouched for two years so there was an abundance of it.
It was a very satisfying experience for those who owned a gun.
In their little nests in the backyard, my little rabbits are so sweet.
Until recently, I hated hutches, and I despised and insulted our gentle little friends, now the center of our attention.
Just think, a rabbit!
Firstly, it will delight the cook.
And as its skin dries in the wind, the whole family rejoices.
Follow my example and give rabbit breeding a try.
As you can see, I love, you love, we all love rabbits in every form!
In reality, the French aren't normally very involved in politics.
Once in a blue moon, they decide to take action and storm the Bastille, or to fight religious wars for 50 years, or to initiate the French Revolution, or to set off to conquer Europe.
But, normally speaking, they're just as peaceable as anyone else.
One thing is for sure:
The French, in general, like a peaceful regime, a regime which has authority, but is preferably humane.
In any case, they feel the need to be protected.
They're quite paternalistic.
Does this explains Pétain's popularity?
Definitely. I might add that, as a sergeant in the French army,
I've seen a routed army.
And it's not a pretty sight.
There's no denying that, for some time,
Pétain was extremely popular.
He was viewed as one of the good old guys, perhaps a bit senile, but after all, he had given himself to France.
That was a clever way of putting it.
He gave the gift of himself.
So everyone thought that an old guy like him couldn't do any harm.
He could only help France.
At his age, what harm could he do?
These arguments, albeit feeble, were how people justified Pétain.
THE MARSHAL'S VISIT
I missed Mers-el-Kébir.
I only heard about what happened two weeks later.
I never understood Mers-el-Kébir.
Even now, having read many books on the subject of Mers-el-Kébir,
I still don't understand.
It was always a mystery to me.
Mers-el-Kébir was a mystery indeed.
Do you mean you don't understand why the English did what they did?
No, I never really understood the English.
After leaving Churchill,
I was a member in the House of Commons,
I went to the House of Commons, got my car, and drove myself through Hyde Park.
In the middle of the park,
I saw a group of French sailors, with their little red pompons on their kepis.
They were running and playing with an equal number of girls, or “young ladies” rather.
They were running and playing and screaming.
They couldn't understand a word of what the other was saying.
Then a horrible feeling swept over me.
It was sheer luck that I didn't crash the car, because suddenly I remembered
Churchill's ultimatum I'd just read, and I thought of those French boats in Mers-el-Kébir, where there were other sailors, also wearing kepis with little red pompons, and I wondered what was going to happen to them tomorrow.
These are the victims of the most base and loathsome attack ever.
Clearly, France's former ally only attacks those who cannot fight back.
On the morning of the attack,
Admiral Gensoul received the English ultimatum.
Admiral Somerville proceeded to send several delegations, in order to explain to Gensoul the options proposed by Churchill:
They could join the Free French, allow themselves to be disarmed, or head to a neutral port which was out of German reach.
Admiral Gensoul refused all three options, as he considered them dishonorable solutions.
What we didn't dare to risk happening was letting the boats fall into enemy hands.
We simply couldn't take the risk.
But wasn't there also a psychological risk?
Yes, a considerable risk.
It allowed the Germans to spread propaganda.
And Vichy, too.
Lord knows they used the opportunity.
I think we understood that, but at the time, we had very little choice in the matter.
There were 1,600 sailors killed by the British Navy.
The British Navy attempted to take over the French Navy.
That was clear to us at the time.
We thought that...
We believed the armistice would be respected by the Germans.
In France, we thought, as the Vichy government had told us, that the French Navy would never be given over to the Germans.
For us, that was a fact.
I was brought up to believe that promises were kept, and I just couldn't imagine that there could be political dealings that would eventually lead to the French Navy being given away.
There was no way.
So we viewed it as a brutal attack.
There was also an additional moral problem, in that, according to many testimonies, the sailors whose boats were shelled by the British believed at that moment they were going to cast off in order to join the British fleet.
That's terrible.
Had we felt there was any hope of that, we would never have attacked.
But there was no hope.
Everything we said about the Germans was proved in Bizerta, where the Germans proceeded to give the French admiral twenty minutes to surrender, to surrender boats and all, on pain of an immediate bombing attack, or of being taken prisoner.
Our predictions all came true.
We knew who we were dealing with.
It was then, shortly after these events, that the French, whose faith in the English had been greatly shaken, made contact with us for the first time, through General Huntziger at the Armistice Commission in Wiesbaden, to discuss the possibility of changing the armistice clauses to allow military collaboration.
And it was the discussion of such options, for which each side undoubtedly had its own personal motivations, that initiated the negotiations, which are now known as “collaboration.”
While the talks were beginning,
Hitler and Pétain agreed to meet in Montoire.
In our first meeting,
Laval told me he was a Germanophile.
And as he had known me for years, he asked me to put in a good word for him with Hitler. And I did.
I think Hitler felt Laval was sincere, at least in one aspect:
When he spoke of collaboration.
And that was the main issue at the second meeting.
In such cases, the defeated want to know what will become of them.
What will the peace treaty be like?
Whereas the victors I've often seen generally don't know what's next and cannot answer such questions.
That's how it went in Montoire.
Hitler didn't know how to answer Pétain's questions about boundaries or the fate of prisoners.
So it ended with everything up in the air.
Ah, Montoire... Now that was quite a story.
Where was this Montoire, anyhow?
Everyone was looking it up in the atlas to see where it was.
When we heard what had transpired, it was depressing.
Some even cried the next day.
– People were crying?
– Yes.
Soon afterwards, a new slogan became popular,
“Collaboration is:”
“Give me your watch,
I'll give you the time.”
That was the slogan.
That was collaboration.
He often said, also in my presence, that he hadn't yet decided whether England or France should pay for the war.
On the basis of his “race ideology,” or whatever you can call this point of view, many felt much more related to the English than to the French.
I am convinced that France, as Hitler saw it, could only play a minor role in a National Socialist Europe.
He had never been in France or anywhere else in Europe.
Whatever knowledge he had was derived from books, which had first been adapted to his point of view.
In his mind, he felt that a decline of the French people was unavoidable. And this idea was confirmed by the French defeat.
During his travels, Hitler sometimes shared his thoughts with others.
April 5, 1942. Suppertime.
The Führer says that if one plans on ignoring the terms of a contract, no use quibbling over details.
Hence, we must assure ourselves that the French are sincere.
No point in trying to pickpocket an experienced pickpocketer like the Führer himself.
In any case,
France's main task for the next 50 years is to repair the damage done at Versailles.
April 24, 1942. Suppertime.
The Führer says he is against marriages between the Wehrmacht and foreigners in occupied lands.
Such demands are generally based on sexual frustration, which is common in troops abroad.
He is struck by the contrast between the photos of the German men, and those of the women, who are very shabby looking.
The Führer feels that such marriages are doomed from the start, both in terms of individual happiness and racial purity.
He is more in favor of harmless passing fancies, which are inevitable in this type of situation.
The conditions created by
National Socialism within German structures at that time made it impossible for us to respect the clauses of the armistice.
We couldn't help what happened, any more than we could have helped all the other horrible things which continue to haunt any rational human being.
We couldn't stop Hitler and company from invading Alsace and Lorraine, making them a part of the Third Reich, and eventually incorporating their youth into the Wehrmacht.
This was all out of our hands.
We can reproach ourselves until kingdom come, but there was nothing we could do.
You say that after Russia, you were sent to Alsace, and then France.
Why? Was Alsace not France?
No. For us, it wasn't French territory.
The people were pro-German.
I even brought my whole family.
There were some people with bad intentions, some patriots who were ready to do anything.
But there weren't many.
So I felt like
I was in a country of German origin.
And now?
I've never gone back.
No, but what do you think of it now?
I think it's true.
I think it belongs to Germany.
Here a show is being put on for the S.S.
Bruno Fritz's amusing ice hockey report.
The German player is taken by surprise and falls down on... on the ice!
He stands up again. It feels too cold.
Thanks to Franco-German economic collaboration,
100,000 French workers now work in Germany.
Four trains leave the capital weekly and head for German industrial regions.
Today, at North Station, the war councilor Michel has come to shake the hand of worker number 110,000: Edouard Lefébvre.
Tell us, Mr. Lefébvre, were you unemployed?
– That's right.
– For how long?
It's been two years now.
– Are you married?
– With children.
This vast organization has already had good results:
Lower unemployment rates, and understanding between workers.
I'd worked for the Finance Minister and the State Secretary since 1923.
In 1940, Mr. Lansfried requested that I go to Paris, as head of the military-controlled finance division in occupied France.
He didn't want a National Socialist party member in this position.
Were you not a member of the party?
Yes, shortly before, I had joined the party, again at the request of Mr. Lansfried.
We tried to be as reasonable as possible, and as fair as possible, not only in our own interests, but in those of France as well.
This famous democracy, in the past 20 years, has proved itself incapable of eliminating such poverty.
The Third Reich, however, aims to provide its workers everywhere in Germany with healthy and beautiful hometowns.
This is a new settlement in a small industrial town, which naturally has a daycare center, a clinic, a center for mothers and children and an X-ray lab.
One gets the impression from such reports that German propaganda was quite open in its racial prejudice, and often implied that German discipline and structure were necessary qualities to clean up what was considered to be “the French mess.”
Yes, there is some truth in what you say.
In our offices in Paris, we also had a propaganda department.
But it received orders directly from Berlin.
And I would like to point out that, from the outset of my job...
It was the first ministerial-level visit from the French government, the Minister of Transport visited in September 1940.
He was accompanied by the owner of a racing stable, who wanted permission to begin horse racing again, as it was a very popular national pastime.
The races are ever-popular.
One thing is clear,
Paris has become Paris once again.
I listened to my collaborators and said, “Why not?”
And so the races started up again, and continued until 1944.
Thanks to us, the theaters were able to open their doors again.
We often went to the theater, alone or with friends.
The Germans also attended the races, which is how the different parties made contact quite spontaneously.
Personal relationships developed between the different sides, probably for various reasons.
I'm sure you're aware there has been a tendency in France since the war to deny that such contact ever existed.
Yes, but it did exist.
Germany was triumphant, and there wasn't a single front from which it failed to come home victorious.
There's no denying that the German army made quite an impression on the youth in France.
Seeing that army of young men, stripped to the waist...
After all, I'm the son of a soldier and I was a soldier myself.
A sense of responsibility, hierarchy and discipline mean a lot.
A well-disciplined army was important to people like us.
This was the first time we had seen such an ideal army.
The French army was nothing compared to this army who could put the fear of God into an entire people.
It sounds awful to say, but it's the truth of the matter.
We solemnly swear to unite and to place our forces, our faith, our ardor, at the service of the Marshal, at the service of France.
This campfire draws a three-day meeting to an end, during which the discipline and dedication of these young men were proved once again.
The French believe servicemen should be tough as nails, and at the end of the day, they always turn to servicemen, whether it be to restore order, to prevent a coup-d'état, or to organize a coup-d'état.
But the serviceman is omnipresent, with his cap, his pompon, his saber, no matter what his rank may be.
The French love their army.
Poem by Officer C. Languillon, published on the front page of
Le Moniteur on November 24, 1940.
“His name rings as a gunshot.
“Pétain ready for the challenge?
The soul is willing.
“But goodness is ever aloof.
“The great victor, even greater in defeat.
“Schemers, foreigners, buffoons and fools,
“have brought you to your knees, O France.
“The hero of Verdun, cleaning the slate,
“Is setting our house in order from top to bottom.
“A Herculean labor, a difficult recovery.
“From the ruins come muffled groans.
“Former profiteers writhe in the rubble.”
Pétain, in a series of speeches, drew conclusions from this defeat.
And he did so with skill.
He could woo his audience.
If one was to read the texts now,
I haven't read them in years, but I bet if you read them now, you would be quite surprised.
Yes, the texts relied heavily on the people's collective unconscious.
Absolutely right.
– He blamed the parliament.
– Yes, the parliamentary system...
Certain employers were suspect... foreign... cosmopolitan, not to mention dark-skinned.
And of course, he blamed the Communist Party.
The Communist Party was the cause of all evils.
All hotels were requisitioned, and the Park Hotel was occupied by Marshal Pétain and his staff.
This is where I met up with my friend,
Colonel Gorosse-Tardou, who lived with Pétain.
He was the chief of staff for his aviation department.
Consequently,
I was often at the Park Hotel.
It was always busy, with lots of people milling around.
Everyone kept their voices down and spied on their neighbors.
Personally, I wasn't used to their system, but when I spoke,
I followed everyone's example.
They were forever shushing one another.
– Everyone was very suspicious.
– Of the enemy or of one another?
A bit of both.
Are you a Republican?
Not really.
– Not really?
– No.
You're more of a Monarchist?
Yes, that's right.
French news. Late 1940.
Pilot-sergeant Gonthier de Basse, veteran of WWI, volunteer in '39, hurt in Dunkirk, has, of his own free will, agreed to make the following declaration.
Ever since my return from England aboard The Sphinx on October 5,
I've been surprised by the number of my compatriots who still believe the wounded in Narvik and Dunkirk were all well-treated by our ex-ally and this is why I've decided to share my memories with you.
When we arrived in England, we harbored no grudge against our English comrades.
But after the tragedy in June, when we were invited to come serve under a new flag, when they offered to pay us our dues in pounds sterling, we could only reply with disdain and indignation.
We French soldiers can only serve under our own colors.
Anything else would be treason.
Fellow Frenchmen, comrades, our duty is to stand side by side behind our leader, Marshal Pétain, to guarantee France a place of honor in a new Europe, and to allow the prisoners to return home immediately.
It is a difficult task.
Those who try to divide us are enemies.
United we stand, divided we fall.
The idea was to get out of the war, come what may, as quickly as possible.
There were 15,000 French sailors in Liverpool.
I went and spoke to them.
I tried to persuade them to continue the war.
But there was no way.
We were so low on people that we needed them to dig the trenches, and we offered them wages to do so.
They said no.
They said, “France is no longer in the war.
“We no longer have the right to dig trenches.”
You see... the kind of attitude they had.
Their desire to get out was almost spiteful.
As for what would become of England, they didn't give a care.
That's the kind of attitude they had.
They felt that it was inconceivable that the English succeed where the French army had been beaten.
On June 17, 1940, the steam liner Le Massilia headed from Bordeaux to Morocco.
Several parliamentarians were aboard.
This event caused much ink to flow.
I boarded Le Massilia without suspecting that it was a big trap.
Those who stayed behind in Bordeaux quickly understood that they could exploit the circumstances, and influence the public to think that the departure of the boat and the fact that a number of politicians were aboard, was a sign we were panicking, running away, abandoning them.
In other words, deserting.
The people aboard Le Massilia who actually wanted to fight were quickly judged to be cowards who were fleeing the fight.
It was paradoxical that some of us, including Viénot, Jean Zay, Wiltzer and I, were tried for desertion, when in fact their original plan had been to go fight.
And as far as I was concerned,
I was almost obliged to go, seeing as my unit had gone, and it was my duty to follow them.
Everyone wound up in Rabat.
There were tons of people.
Once there, I went to lunch at “Balima,” Rabat's best restaurant, where everyone met.
One of my cousins,
Du Jonchay, a pilot, was there, and naturally we discussed what had happened.
He showed me Pierre Mendès-France, who was sitting at a table with a lovely woman, who was his wife.
My cousin turned to me and said,
“Our State Secretary there is responsible for our defeat.”
There he sat, our little lieutenant, drinking champagne.
That champagne completely infuriated me.
I walked up to him, and told him this was no attitude to have, after being defeated, drinking champagne in public as if he was delighted about what had happened.
Then what?
I told him if I saw him again, I would kick him out.
And I gave him my card.
– It caused quite a stir.
– You were picking a fight.
No, I simply gave him my card to let him know who I was.
Not to hide my identity.
How did he react?
He got up, stood to attention, and said nothing.
I was a captain, he was a lieutenant.
I see.
There was surrender and treason.
But anti-Semitism had also begun to rear its ugly head.
Many who used to hide their feelings openly declared their anti-Semitism to the point that France began adopting certain German values, and sought to get closer to Hitler, in the hope of creating a Europe where
France and Germany would collaborate and obviously anti-Semitism became a common element between many Germans and Frenchmen.
And, of course, Jean Zay and I had the misfortune of being Jewish.
Actually, I was Jewish.
Jean Zay was only partly Jewish.
He had converted, as had his father, but he was of Jewish origin.
This didn't detract from the atrocious campaign against him, which, as you know, ended in his being killed.
Jean Zay was arrested.
His pregnant wife was in Casablanca.
She had a very tough time to find a hospital bed, or even someone willing to help her give birth.
There was such hatred.
When clinics or hospitals heard that she was Jean Zay's wife, they didn't have the courage to admit her.
You can't imagine how rampant sectarianism had become.
In any case, Mrs. Zay's pregnancy was certainly a very trying time.
She lived with my wife and they spent many long hours together during which they were abused and insulted.
My wife also had a very rough time of it.
Anyhow,
Madeleine Zay eventually gave birth to this baby, whom I had the opportunity to meet, as I was arrested shortly after the baby's birth.
And when I was transferred to Clermont-Ferrand, where I met up with Jean Zay,
I'd seen his daughter and he hadn't.
JEAN ZAY
To Appear In Court Tomorrow
The committing magistrate was
Colonel Leprêtre.
I don't want to name names, but this man's reputation lives on today.
The man was very intelligent, very bright, clever and cunning, but he had a very perverse side to him, in that he harbored great hate for the accused, especially if the accused was left-wing.
He got a certain morbid pleasure from seeing an important man accused.
Even outside of cross-examination, he would sometimes visit the prison, just to sit and chat with the prisoners.
He would go in their cells, and sit on their beds, pretending to speak with them simply.
He clearly got a great deal of pleasure out of holding the fates of such formerly important men in his hands.
There was something very sick, very odd about it.
A strange man.
So he would confess to certain things in moments of relaxation?
One day, he said to me,
“I know what you think of me.”
The man was bright enough to understand.
Very intelligent.
He said to me,
“I know what you think of me,
“but in an organized society, there are certain tasks,
“tasks which must be done, and which require people to do them.”
“Every society needs garbage men.”
He chose that word.
Were you able to emphasize the racial and political background and motives to the trial?
No, our main concern was to obtain satisfying results, and we knew that these judges wouldn't appreciate such arguments.
Even if we had said that his being Jewish should have nothing to do with the trial, we knew perfectly well that it would be a major issue.
The hearing was extremely tense.
It began at 9.00 a.m. With an introduction by Pierre Mendès-France, which the Colonel received with obvious contempt.
He had been given a table and a jug of water.
He began with the following introductory statement:
“Colonel and gentlemen,
I am Jewish, I am a Freemason,
“but I am not a deserter.
May the trial begin.”
The court was presided over by a rather frenzied man, called Colonel Perret, a colonel in charge of tanks, who harbored a particular hatred for General de Gaulle, because they had served in Saint Cyr together and were both competitive.
He hated anything to do with de Gaulle,
Gaullism or Gaullists.
Furthermore, he was a very frenzied character, who ran the hearings in an atrocious manner.
My sentence was nothing compared to the death sentences he gave out.
He was responsible for executions, which is considerably worse than the sentence he gave me.
I must say that those present at the hearing were extremely hostile.
The audience had been rigged, no two ways about it.
Women whose faces were filled with hate.
I won't name any names, but they were hateful people, people who were hoping for the cruelest of sentences, who were hoping I'd be killed immediately, who didn't think I should even be allowed to defend myself.
Some 300 or 400 entry cards had been delivered, but only six were for the defense.
The cards were quite a story.
As only a limited number existed, and they were in high demand, a new black market developed.
There were bistros in Clermont that hawked the cards.
Flatteringly enough, they were very expensive, twenty francs for the show.
It cost more than the movies.
There's no denying that public opinion was strongly influenced by the papers at that time, which felt that the politicians who were accused should automatically be declared guilty.
My colonel, my lieutenant-colonel and my general all took the stand and said, “He didn't desert.”
When the commissioner, whose name I won't give either, stood up and announced in a choked voice that he was sentenced to six years for desertion,
Mendès told him,
“Sir, I'm sure you'll be rewarded.
“You've served the master well.”
Former State Secretary
Sentenced to six Years in Jail for Desertion
I don't know if Rochat told you that a man came to see him the next day.
And this man told him,
“I'm a Pétain supporter,
“and I am appalled by what happened yesterday. It's scandalous.
“The Marshal must not be aware that such things are happening.
“The Marshal must be informed of such goings-on.
“I saw you stenograph the hearing.”
Which indeed he had.
“Could you get a copy for me to bring to the Marshal himself?”
Rochat gave him a copy which he took to the Marshal.
Naturally, nothing ever came of it.
And the man who took the copy was a certain Mr. Giscard d'Estaing.
It is these children, the pupils of French schools, in whom the Marshal sees hope for our country.
He has come to speak simply, as only he can, in a modest school in the town of Périgny.
You may sit down now.
You don't have to stand to listen.
Young pupils of our French schools, the reason I wanted to speak to you today on this day as you begin a new school year, is that it's important for you to know that I am counting on you to help me rebuild our country, France.
So work hard, stand firm, and do your best.
All rise.
I had to pass through Vichy to reach my posting in Billancourt in the first two weeks of August 1940.
Many people told me that Marshal Pétain was very tired, and was only lucid for two hours a day.
Imagine my surprise when I met this man, who, although elderly, stood bolt upright, with his look of steel, which many people have commented on, and with the greatest of ease, politely asked me to sit down and make myself comfortable, then said, “Mr. Lamirand, there's been much talk about you here.”
The secretary general of youth,
Mr. Georges Lamirand recently visited Lavalette camp, the main goal of which is to train the men of tomorrow.
He visited these young men who are united by a common ideal, and live life in continual contact with nature, work and simplicity, these values upon which we must rebuild our country.
We talked and I thought to myself,
“What bad luck.
“They say he's only lucid two hours a day, and I chance upon those two hours.”
The problems of youth are fascinating, but I had absolutely no idea that, in the position
Marshal Pétain wanted to grant me, there were so many fascinating subjects and problems to solve.
Repeat after me: Long live France!
Long live the Marshal!
Louis Renault finally agreed to give me leave, saying to Pétain,
“I'll lend him to you for a month.”
And Marshal Pétain, in his infinite cleverness,
“Fine, one month.
“But if you don't mind, let's make the job renewable.”
And he renewed it 30 months.
Mr. Lamirand is inaugurating an exhibition of drawings sent to Pétain by French schoolchildren.
The little ones wanted to answer the Marshal's call, they wanted to show the Marshal their towns, villages and homes, hence sharing a piece of their daily lives with him.
A school girl, perhaps the youngest in France, had the luck of being allowed to give Pétain her lovingly written letter in person.
It was about adding a new element to the famous triptych of the time:
Work, Family, Nation.
Honor your work, your family, and your nation.
A national revolution?
You said it.
Marshal Pétain has already told you several times what he meant by social revolution.
He feels that our social system is unfair.
There is too much poverty, too much injustice.
And that is what he wants to change.
He is bound and determined to bring happiness to France, and asks us all to join in a communal effort.
Dear friends, this is his social revolution.
That was when he started planning his escape.
He grew his beard, shaved it off, grew it out again, and one fine day, he left.
I must admit I'm not very athletic, but I prepared myself by working out for several months beforehand.
I was high up, so I had to jump off a high wall.
But I had to run the risk.
And once I had jumped,
I would be a free man again.
Just as I was about to jump...
There were trees planted along the avenue.
I heard the unexpected sound of voices.
I tried to see in the semi-darkness.
There was a couple sitting under a tree.
You can imagine what they were discussing.
He knew what he wanted, but she hadn't decided yet.
It seemed to last an eternity to me.
She ended up saying yes, but I had the impression she had put up a great deal of resistance.
Finally, they left. And so I jumped.
And let me assure you that I was even happier than he was.
I'd really like to meet him someday and let him know how much I experienced with the two of them that night.
How you admired his audacity.
Yes, and how her lack of audacity struck me as being so untimely.
Anyway, love, fate and escape eventually won the day.
Did you disguise yourself?
I was disguised, but not very well.
You see, many people back then who wanted to disguise themselves would let their beards grow.
So, bearded men automatically arose suspicion!
I let my moustache grow,
I gave myself a new hairstyle, parted straight down the middle.
I got a pair of glasses.
And of course,
I changed the way I dressed and so forth.
The next day,
I went for my daily visit with him, to see if he had escaped or not.
I arrived and saw all these people with decameters in hand, taking all sorts of measurements.
They were hysterical.
They asked me what I wanted.
I said I was there to see my client.
They asked if I knew
Pierre Mendès-France had left. I said no.
I burst out laughing, which made them angry.
They carried out a huge security check of all the roads and trains.
But my plan was to not contact anyone, to not count on anyone, to be cut off from everything and everyone.
I must say that life in France at that time is very difficult to imagine, and even more so to describe.
You had an old pair of shoes you hoped would last.
If they got a hole, there was no leather to fix them.
There were no plates, there were no matches, there was nothing.
It is very difficult, in hindsight, to describe what it was like living in a country where everyone was always searching for everything.
The new rage in Paris is silk stockings without the silk.
All you have to do, ladies, is dye your legs.
It's easy and practical. A great idea.
The ladies are trading in their garters for paintbrushes.
Worried about what will happen when you bathe?
No problem.
Paint-on stockings are waterproof.
On top of that,
Elizabeth Arden guarantees they won't run!
That's a Parisian habit which will disappear.
Where is France headed?
Where is Europe headed?
Some 3,000 people in Chaillot will hear
Mr. Alphonse de Chateaubriant discuss The French Drama.
At this very moment, a huge continental unit is slowly taking shape.
It will be one gigantic geographical piece in the puzzle, with one single political and economical doctrine, stretching to the very tip of Europe, the very tip of which is France.
Therein the importance of France becomes clear, as France becomes, in this new division, the outer edge, the last bastion on the Atlantic of this immense continent, faced with another large continent,
America, which is ready to take over the ancient order of things, the ancient riches and capitalist creeds, the ancient gold and the ancient man, in order to make it their last refuge, their last fortress, and their last army.
I sincerely hope that everything I have said tonight will give the word “collaboration” new meaning in your eyes.
It's not surprising that, at first, such poison won over many new converts.
Little by little, people began to realize it was propaganda, and to see that the government was practicing a policy, which they themselves called collaboration with the enemy.
Slowly but surely, people began to open their eyes, and change their minds.
But this propaganda still won over many new converts.
You know as well as I do that anti-Semitism and Anglophobia are never hard to stir up in France.
Even if reactions to such things are dormant or stifled, all it takes is one event, one incident, one international crisis or one Dreyfus affair, for feelings we thought long gone to suddenly re-emerge in full force, for beliefs we thought dead to be simply dormant.
Edouard Drumont was the first in France to examine the Jewish question.
The Institute of Jewish Questions celebrates his memory today.
Mr. Laville has agreed to say a few words.
Out of 100 Frenchmen of old stock, at least 90 are pure white, free of any other racial mixture.
This isn't true of the Jews.
The Jews are born of a mixture which dates back thousands of years, between Aryans, Mongols and Negroes.
Therefore, Jews have unique faces, bodies, attitudes and gestures.
It is reassuring to see that the public is interested in studying the characteristics presented in the morphological section of “Jews and France.”
In October '40, when I came home on leave,
I heard that a good friend of mine, a teacher, wasn't allowed to keep teaching that fall, because his mother was Jewish, making him half-Jewish.
I'd met Jews before, but I treated them the same as Catholics, Protestants, or people with no religion in particular.
It wasn't a revolution yet, but it did give me food for thought.
– Did you have any Jewish teachers?
– Let me see...
We did have one.
Yes, he was fired.
The same old story.
No one ever told us anything.
Listen, I think we should make a little nuance here.
I think that when you take cases like this teacher we mentioned,
I think that we tried, to the best of our ability, to get these people some work tutoring and so forth.
We did that for another colleague, too.
Like you say, it wasn't much, but we did have sympathy for them.
Did you really try?
Did every single teacher in Clermont give in their resignation?
No way. You've no idea what the mentality was like back then.
A collective resignation? Come on!
In 1940, Vichy came out with the Jewish decrees.
In the small ads of Le Moniteur, a local merchant announced that he was 100% pure French.
Sir, are you Marius?
Yes, I'm Marius.
You're weighed down with medals.
I fought in World War I.
– They're all medals from WW I?
– That's right.
You must be a very brave man.
I followed the others. I did my duty.
When France was demobilized, when France was defeated in the 2nd war, how did you react?
We certainly weren't very happy.
As veterans of World War I, the defeat affected us deeply.
Were there many Jewish stores?
Yes, there were.
So you must have seen a lot?
You could say that.
They all packed up their bags and left.
They went into exile.
And there weren't any arrests?
There were arrests everywhere.
And you saw them?
Yes, unfortunately.
Tell me, when what were called
“the Jewish decrees” came out, apparently you took out an ad.
That's correct.
It was an ad in Le Moniteur.
You're certainly well-informed.
You see, sir, we were four brothers.
It was the solution I found, as people thought we were Jews.
My name, Klein, sounds quite Jewish.
But I'm a Catholic.
And this was a real source of concern.
I had some problems because of that.
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
It was important that I tell people that I am really French.
In other words, you wanted your clients to know you weren't Jewish.
That is correct.
Why?
Because some said I was Jewish.
Jews were being arrested, and they said we were Jewish.
Do you see?
I couldn't very well allow myself to be labeled as a Jew since I'm a Catholic.
So that's why, as you said,
I took out an ad.
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
One was killed.
– The other three were imprisoned.
– But Jews fought in World War I, too.
That's true. I realize that.
I've never been a racist.
Jewish or Mahometan, all that mattered to me was that the man did his duty, in which case, he was as French as the rest of us.
You understand?
You weren't high on the priority list of those persecuted by Hitler's regime.
But did you know any Jews,
Communists, or Freemasons who were?
I met more Jews than I'll ever meet again.
I had two girls working at the pharmacy, who were considered to be evil just because they were Jewish.
One was the daughter of an amazing man, a Parisian polytechnician.
She was a pretty amazing girl herself.
The other was the daughter of Hirsch, a colleague in Strasbourg.
Nobody wanted anything to do with these girls.
He had warned every pharmacy in Clermont not to hire these girls.
– Who is “he?”
– The pharmacy inspector.
The movie industry gave them a chance to steal billions of francs.
Tannenzaft, better known as Nathan, who in the eyes of the world, was the ultimate symbol of French cinema, has cost the public nearly 700,000,000 francs.
Mr. Pierre Mendès-France, did you enjoy going to the movies back then?
I went to the movies because I enjoyed it, but I had yet another reason, as I had quickly discovered that movie houses provided a refuge which was both fun and comfortable, you could sit down in a movie theater at 3:00 in the afternoon, and stay there in the darkness for hours on end, without anyone ever seeing you.
It was a great hiding place.
In many pre-war French movies, there were Jewish actors or Jewish directors.
And in the credits of these movies, the Jewish names had been erased.
Today World News was able to film a part of the trial of the Jew Tannenzaft, Bernard Nathan.
Our presence clearly disturbed the accused who wanted his privacy.
He raises an objection, but is overruled by the court.
Go away. Leave me alone.
This is a tragedy, not a comedy!
The Germans were discreet about it, but they wanted to see their movies.
There were operettas.
There were the first movies in color.
Some, like La Ville Dorée, weren't propaganda, others were.
Films like Le Juif Suss were pure propaganda.
And the thing that I found most revolting was that they weren't only German productions, which would have been understandable since they had occupied us, but that they were made with the blessing of the French authorities, on behalf of French organizations, dubbed by French actors.
The events in this film are based on historical fact.
At first, movie-goers probably thought these movies were just like any other German movie.
But people very quickly began to realize that it was just typical propaganda, in the worst sense of the word.
This led to a kind of strike among viewers.
Even those who weren't especially interested in the Free French, who had gotten into the habit of seeing normal German movies, were extremely revolted and refused to have any part in it.
Gentlemen, this Jew's criminal record shows nothing of the suffering of our people during his tyranny.
This is why I give the floor to the person who has suffered most.
I ask for nothing.
You are the judges, not me.
Please, Sturm, you are the one with the most right to judge him.
It is not my decision to take.
Suffering is too subjective.
It would be unfair.
However, I see an ancient article of criminal law which applies:
“If ever a Jew commits a sin...
“If ever a Jew commits a sin of the flesh with a Christian woman,
“he shall be publicly hung without further ado.”
“If ever a Jew commits a sin of the flesh with a Christian,
“he shall be publicly hung without further ado,
“as punishment, and as an example for all others.”
Have mercy! I've done nothing wrong!
I've always acted in the name of my savior!
It's not my fault that your duke wanted to betray you!
I can fix everything, I swear. Everything!
Take all that I own. Take all my money.
But don't take my life!
I am innocent!
I'm just a poor Jew. Let me live.
I want to live!
I want to live! Live!
The State Council and I speak for all Wurtemburgers in decreeing that all Jews must leave Wurtemberg in the next three days.
This is valid across the entire country.
This decree has been taken in Stuttgart on February 4, 1738.
May our descendants remember this, for in doing so, they will spare themselves much pain and suffering, and will keep their blood pure of the influence of this accursed race.
THE END
There were only certain people who actually enjoyed Le Juif Suss, the anti-Semites who saw their beliefs confirmed in the movie.
The collaborators would also see it.
Then there were those who were taken by surprise.
I'd say that 80% of the people who came to see Le Juif Suss assumed it would be just like any other light-hearted movie.
The German films weren't particularly good.
However, they featured many French film stars, as Continental had made many French films before the war.
Tino Rossi and the like filmed at Continental.
As an artistic endeavor, several actors are off to Germany.
At East Station, we've spotted Albert Préjean.
Danielle Darrieux.
Suzy Delair.
Junie Astor.
Viviane Romance.
Dr. Karl Fröhlich, president of the German Cinema Corporation, has invited them on a 12-day studio tour of Vienna, Munich and Berlin.
Today Mr. Heydrich, general of the S.S. And head of security, was sent to Paris by Mr. Himmler, chief of the S.S. And the police, to officially install Mr. Oberg in his new post in occupied territory.
Mr. Heydrich is president of the International Criminal Police, a commission to which
France has always belonged.
Mr. Heydrich visited Mr. Bousquet, secretary general of the police, and Mr. Hiller, secretary general of administration.
He also had a chance to see Mr. Dartier de Pellepoix, in charge of Jewish Questions, as well as Mr. De Brinon.
What was Paris like back then?
There were two sides to Paris.
There were those struggling to survive, and there was high-society.
All we were missing was Régine.
There's no doubt about it.
Everyone's ashamed to say it today, but for some, life in Paris was great.
Maxim's and Le Boeuf sur le Toit did a booming business.
The movie industry was in full swing.
From what I've heard, actually, or so they say,
French films were so good then because a certain category of producers had fled to the States.
Many directors have gone on to do very well in their careers, but they forget what they said then.
Paris was a fun and crazy place.
Let me assure you that there were some wild and crazy times back then.
All right, boys. This way.
We'll go straight to the source to whet our whistles.
What happened to you in 1937?
You can't even begin to imagine.
– It's a long story.
– Be careful...
First give us a drink, then we'll see what's up.
I think we're going to earn our drink today.
– Is that red wine?
– Yes, it's as Red as I am.
So what happened in here?
This cellar has seen everything.
The Resistance in Auvergne began here.
The night the first weapons arrived, we met in this very cellar.
And we sang the Internationale.
We weren't Communists, but as Pétain sang the Marseillaise, we had to sing the Internationale.
You see, people attended the raising of the colors reluctantly.
– Yet they still came?
– They had no choice.
It is in times like those when you begin to realize what people are really like.
– How do you mean?
– They were scared stiff.
With only a few exceptions.
– Was it really a risk not to come?
– Risk or no risk, they still came.
– So they thought there was a risk?
– They thought so.
I was under the impression that there were quite a few students here who ardently supported General de Gaulle.
For example, there was the son of a colleague whose name escapes me, among others.
What about among the teachers?
I really can't say how many teachers supported him.
We were sympathetic to the young people's cause, but there wasn't the same enthusiasm... the same enthusiasm which was gaining momentum among the young people.
Why do you think that is?
It often seems to be the case in life.
Young people are, in general, more sincere and more dynamic.
They don't think things through.
I think it would be fair to say that they are less cautious.
They are more open and friendly.
What do you think?
– They're not as scared.
– True.
Some of my students got caught.
I can't really say who.
Not so many, just a few of them.
In fact, many of them now have streets named after them here.
There was Bacaud.
The street going to Fontviége is named after him.
– I taught this charming boy.
– He was in the Resistance?
These people, as Dionnet was saying earlier, had created a network.
We only found out about it later.
They continued to pretend they were just your average students.
But we only found out about this later.
Perhaps Dionnet, who was in the Resistance, knew.
What was it like for the others?
How did the others react when someone's desk was empty?
I don't know. I can't remember.
When a student's parents were arrested, and the son showed up at school the next day, how did they react?
– I can't remember.
– How can you forget?
Can you remember?
No, I can't.
No specific examples.
I see some examples on the wall.
Those are our former students...
Aren't those the students who died in World War I?
It says World War II.
I'm trying to remember, but I can't.
Clermont-Ferrand is giving
Marshal Pétain a warm welcome.
He has come to approve the constitution of the Peasants' Union, and the end of the winter crusade for National Aid.
The head of state will then receive the donations to National Aid brought by peasants from all over the region.
It is a symbolic ceremony for the French mutual aid campaign.
A great day for France as our hearts beat together in collective hope.
Hundreds of turtles die every day in this hot desert of sand.
The barrets nest inside the big skeletons.
The little ones look for some meat among the bones.
The natives of the Malay islands bury their dead in this immense underwater cemetery.
Their religion teaches that the sea washes the bodies and frees them from sin.
Only during the day are these waters empty and still.
At night, the sharks rush in to perpetrate their devastating action.
They only leave the bones, which the friends and families of the dead arrange, with macabre pity, among the bizarre coral branches. ln these waters, the sharks of the Malay coast learned how to feed on human flesh and become man eaters.
Catching man eaters is the only resource in Raiputh, a village on the Malay coast.
Fishermen who were disabled by the sharks' bites pile up in the sun dried fins on the beach.
They will sell them to rich Chinese communities, where they are thought to have a strong aphrodisiac power.
Every day in Raiputh, a fisherman doesn't come back, or returns in this condition.
But the village is poor and the
Chinese pay well for their vice.
So the sacrifice goes on.
The only alternative to despair and pain is revenge.
Today there has been another victim. ln these waters, a 1 2-year-old boy has been devoured by a shark.
Today the fishermen of Raiputh give up their prey.
They give it back to the sea with a poisoned sea-urchin stuck in its throat. lt will suffer at least for one week before it will die. ln the Roman cemetery of the Capuchins, death has been assigned a decorative task.
A few centuries ago, maybe the monks wanted to give this place a sense of immortality. ln spite of its gruesome results, this work shows a certain sense of beauty, which is always motivated by love.
Love that survives death, death that survives love.
MARlO AND lNES
Still in Rome, on the Tiberina island, the ''Red Sacks'' brotherhood keeps carrying out its mission.
The ''Red Sacks'' brotherhood started around the 1600's upon the initiative of some Romans who, during the plague, wanted to bury the abandoned bodies of the poor and the unknown.
Nowadays, after so many centuries, the ''Red Sacks'' still look after their mortal remains, the sole but eloquent evidence of the old compassion.
Protecting the bones from the ravages of the time is the task of some local families who gather here once a week on Fridays to work and to pray.
Just like these Germans from Hamburg, let's drown the memory of so many cemeteries in the beer. lnstead of focusing on the cult of death, in this happy German beer-house on Repabahm Strasse, our attention goes now to the cult of life.
Life as happiness for being alive, freedom of spirit, agility, physical health, sociability, peacefulness, oblivion.
But most of all, complete absence of any memory or thought of death.
Who said, ''Drink beer and you'll live to be 100''?
But the Japanese in Tokyo, after a very busy night, come straight in here to get back in shape.
This is a Tokyo Onsen, a real service station to wash and lube those Japanese who got drunk on the previous night.
The perfect functioning of the company depends on some hundred girls in shorts and bras, so that the patrons, besides so many tortures, can at least comfortably enjoy the landscape.
According to a gentle
Japanese custom, the patrons must be naked.
We covered him according to a gentle custom of ours.
Japan is maybe the cleanest country in the world.
The rituals of bathing and massage are as old as its civilization. ln Tokyo, a city with
10 million people,
6 million women tend every day to 4 million men, pampering, flattering, serving and rubbing them, in order to make their lives more pleasant, according to an old, admirable tradition.
So, Japanese men, with every inch of their bodies taken care of, without the smallest personal effort, can taste the heavenly relaxation that their god will only grant them in the afterlife.
Chinese men too, give themselves up to the hands of a woman on the day of their last makeup.
They entrust to her seductive arts their uncertain fate to come.
Buddha is a wayward god, very impressionable, and when he opens the gates of the flowering garden, he cares more for the looks than for the virtues of the dead.
This is the funeral of a rich Chinese in a temple of the city of Macao.
Friends are bringing food to his altar, so he can nourish himself during his long trip.
Then they bow before the mourning family. ln a corner, a woman burns his money, which, only this way, will be able to follow him and preserve for him, in heaven, what to every
Chinese is the utmost good of this life and the other: wealth.
The heirs attend in tears the sad ceremony.
Not only here in Singapore, but in all Malaysia, the Chinese represent over a third of the population.
Never tired to figure out a thousand ways of making money, they are nonetheless famous for their physical laziness.
They don't swim, run, jump, or play soccer.
As the Chinese don't waste their money, likewise, they don't waste their energies, which they prefer to use around the table or in bed.
Between snacks, the Chinese find the time to fill their houses with children, legitimate and illegitimate.
This guarantees a big bunch of birthdays to celebrate with abundant meals.
The Chinese celebrate everything by eating:
Religious and national holidays, business, a competitor's failure, an averted danger, births, and even death.
Here we're not allowed to photograph.
We had to force the situation to show you
Singapore's ''home of the dead''.
All the terminally ill end up dwelling here, in this tragic hotel for the dying.
The Chinese homes, full with children, have no place for them.
Down the streets, their relatives, relaxed and confident, wait for their funeral. lf you don't die soon, sing the Chinese, your good dinner gets cold. lf they see us eating, say the Chinese, they'll get hungry too.
Death is still late and the Chinese urge the gods with a dance.
To the cars, the house of the dead is America.
California kills three of them every 2 hours.
They get dumped in these cemeteries, but their remains will not be eternal.
Compressed to save space, thousands of Fords, Chevrolets,
Chryslers, Oldsmobiles,
Cadillacs, Lincolns, Buicks, no longer need any repair.
But they're not yet at the end of their destiny.
Soon they will be shipped to the great European car factories, where the modern mechanical reincarnation will bring them back to life as cars, with a new, more humble label: ''economy vehicle''.
Correction: not all of them will come back as cars. ln Paris, in one of the most respectable modern art stores, we recognized the remains of an old Ford, whose name was changed into a charming
''Esprit de la Carrosserie'',
''Spirit of Chassis''.
The price: half a million francs.
The Czech painter
Yves Klein is ready.
Music gave him the thrill.
These models, covering themselves with paint, are the human brushes that soon Klein will use to turn his creative fever into art.
You may have guessed, by now, that Klein's favorite color is blue.
Moreover, blue is his only form, his only color.
Blue like his pictures that sell like hot cakes in Paris.
Blue like the event that our camera is approaching, which most venerable critics consider as the utmost
Klein masterpiece, whose dominant color, as any connoisseur may guess, happens to be blue.
Dripping with blue, the human brushes leave their prints on the canvas, while Klein guides them from afar, with the energy of his creative genius.
The work, that we had the privilege to catch in all the phases of its creation, is on sale for only
4 million francs. ln search of tropical, impressive views, and the picturesque aspects of primitive life, three thousand American tourists arrive in Honolulu.
Yearning for romantic experiences and eager to face unexpected adventures, they will follow the program of the ''Hawaiian Travels
Organization'' that, for only $4,000, taxes included, organized for them 10 days of a ''very exciting holiday,'' as it is advertised in the brochure, a vacation across a ''tropical dance and paradise of love.''
The paradise of love and dance.
The first page of the Hawaiian Travels' long and detailed program says that the landing ceremony will take place in a charming
Hawaiian atmosphere and according to the romantic customs of this love island.
Therefore the company's management invites the gentle ladies not to be jealous of the innocent attention that the splendid
Hawaiian girls will direct to their husbands.
Soon after, the company's photographer, provides the tourists with their arrival souvenirs, which includes, according to the program, smiles and flowers leis that the splendid
Hawaiian girls lay on their guests with amazing generosity.
The speaker is now informing the tourist about the main customs of this tropical paradise.
He says:
''Ladies and gentlemen,
fate has been generous with you
by giving you the privilege
to visit this island
before it was too late.
The beautiful women
who are giving you
this charming performance
are the last specimen
of a race
that is disappearing.
lt's a pity you can't savor
a bit of their
very sweet language. ''
They sing:
''Welcome, welcome,
strong and handsome white man.
Welcome, welcome, seductive
and beautiful white woman.
You will teach me the secret
of your elegance wherefore
you can seduce your men.
l will teach you the secret
of my dance wherefore
l seduce mine.
Come, come to learn the Hula.
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is the Hula.
You think it's too difficult?
Of course,
ladies and gentlemen,
but nothing is impossible
as Abraham Lincoln used to say.
Look at that dancer.
She's the best in the island.
But, ladies and gentlemen,
when she was a child,
she was struck by polio
and do you know what
had the power to free
her poor crippled limbs?
The Hula,
ladies and gentlemen.
The Hula and her willpower. ''
They listened, clapped, had fun and got moved, exactly as it was written in the program.
And now that the program prescribes a Hula lesson, they go to learn Hula, nice and diligent.
This candid generation of once hard workers now believe in the Hula, in theirs and other people's happiness, while they enjoy a little murdering rest, with their first symptoms of arthritis.
They still believe in this tropical paradise that they have destroyed and where the only real, genuine native dance we can still attend, is this one.
After six hours of cold steel training,
Sergeant Rhuba Narcktitle is being made up as a woman.
The situation is pretty embarrassing, for a fierce warrior who, only a few years ago, during the war against the Malaysian communists, decapitated 36 partisans.
But today is a national holiday and the tradition wants him to celebrate it with a dance in a woman's costume.
The fierce Gurkhas live in the mountains of Nepal.
For one and half century, they have been mercenaries under the English empire.
According to the tradition, their celebration must be attended by all English officers, their commander-in-chief included.
Seeing them in this circumstance and dressed like women, nobody would believe they are the fiercest and most faithful soldiers in the world.
Still, during the last war, when they were captured by the Japanese, 300 of them preferred to be decapitated rather than betray their promise of loyalty to her British Majesty.
Today is the anniversary of that memorable day and the Gurkhas celebrate it with great solemnity.
This time too, the bull's head has fallen with one strike.
The honor of the battalion is saved.
The spirit of the fallen
Singapore soldiers is at peace.
The English officers watch with satisfaction.
The English colonel encircles the heads of the champions with a white strap, a symbol of strength, fidelity and bravery.
About a month later, in Portugal, a few bulls take their revenge goring and killing 4 people, and injuring 18.
We are at Vila Franca de Xira, where the people happily celebrate the traditional ''Forcada''.
Later on, in the arena, the nobles too give a proof of their courage.
On these mountains of the Garoka region in New Guinea, lies the border between history and prehistory.
Here we found the last cave man, still armed with a club.
He doesn't even know metal, he lives in the unreachable caves of the mountain with his women and children, he's as wild and suspicious as a beast.
We don't know how he'd react if he spotted our camera pointed at him.
Rather than by a camera, these images seem to be caught by a huge telescope pointed into time.
They could be the shadow, the photographic memory of the stone age.
This day, this moment, goes back 4 or 5 thousand years.
Nothing particular is happening.
Now as in the past, life goes on under the eternal guide of their instinct for work, leisure, children, food, human contact and an orderly social life.
50 miles north of there, a Catholic mission marks the extreme outpost of civilization.
Five missionaries have been killed in recent years before the sound of a bell could awake, through these old valleys, the instinct of faith.
Here, after hundreds of centuries spent in the dark, men discover, for the first time, that there's a doubt, a question they cannot answer, sense of anguish, unknown so far, which is not hunger or thirst or physical pain, but that hurts, nonetheless, like a wound. lt's the anguish that follows men from the beginning to the end of world.
But they still don't know it.
Only yesterday they discovered the world and themselves and today they need to believe, to hope that they'll be better in a better world.
But one fine day, the aboriginal comes down from the mountains and, as he approaches the coast, his experience runs across hundred of centuries in a few days.
Here, at the gates of
Port Moresby airport, where the aboriginal ends his journey through the time and where he cannot find a reason to all the things he learned, but saw too quickly, the ''Cargo Cult'' has burgeoned inside of him, that is, the cult of these cargo airplanes.
Along the great oceanic course between
Hong Kong and Australia, flown every day by tens of cargo airplanes that stop here in Moresby, the Cargo Cult has a temple almost everywhere.
Here is one, with the altar built at an altitude of 3,000 meters.
The small airplane is at one end of the track.
On the other end, the control tower.
The native of the Rozo and Mekeo tribes wait for some airplane, attracted by their bamboo decoy, to land on this track.
To them, airplanes come from heaven, sent by their ancestors, but the white men, those cunning thieves, take charge of them and lure them in the big Port Moresby trap.
Build your airport too, says the Cargo Cult doctrine, and wait with faith.
Sooner or later your ancestors will find out the treachery and will lead the airplanes to your track.
Then you'll be rich and happy.
They wait motionless, scanning the sky.
There is no other world beyond these mountains, so the big birds that fly up there can only come from heaven. ln heaven, there are only their dead and only their dead could build them.
The spirits of the dead do not know the whites, so all those wonderful things carried by the airplanes are sent to them by their dead ancestors.
They destroyed their villages, they abandoned their jobs, but here they are, still waiting with faith at the gates of heaven.

Hips: 93.
I had my first period with 14.

Even after this advertisement you don't want to be a real man, huh?
I'm still a man. I'm still alive.
Then come over here and proof it!
Don't disturb us!
Bastards!
My heart will be broken...
Stand up!
Let's find a real bed!
Come on! They are Yakuza!
They are dangerous!
Stop staring at me! Piss off!
How mean! Hands off my man!
You wanna be killed?
He is nuts!
Tell me! You don't prefer men, do you?
Stop following us!

You kill people with that?
Do you belong to the other gang?

- Of course!
Idiot!
Now they've seen it!
Let's take the girl and the maniac then!

I wanna pee!
I'll pee here if you don't let me go out!
Got it?
How long will we stay here?
Until tomorrow! You mustn't go until the sun rises!
Until your war with the rifles is over?
It's not a war! We're just killing each other!
I tell you: I'm going to pee. OK?
Just do it!
Bullshit!
No Bullshit!
Bullshit! Nobody here can kill!
Huh? What are you talking about?
- "Pee..."
- Stop it!
You're not the type for it!
You can't kill!
- Bastard!

I'm not wearing a panty!
I'm just going to pee!
"Pee..."

- "Pee...!"
What's going on?
I wanna pee!
Come!

- Thank you.
- My pleasure!
Nobody else wanna do it.
I'ts hurting me.

- Rifles?
You didn't come for me?
- Bye bye.
- They won't allow kids!!
I wanna steal a rifle!
And why here?
Idiot! I've seen the backup!
Why backup?
Idiot! Because the gang's too small!
Then why are they fighting?
Idiot!! It's their job!
They could fight for women!
Idiot! It's for power
- Don't you know Yakuza-Films?
- Nope!
If I help you, will you spend time with me?
Come on!
Woops! Sorry!
Pardon us!
Forget it! Why would you want to shoot a rabbit anyway?
It's not about animals!
Whatever! Now about me ...!
- How old are you?
Stop it! I'm going to find one!
Help me!
- Who are you?!
- Don't make such a face!
- I just went peeing...
- And the boy?
He wants to steal rifles!
- Which gang are you?!
- I'm just a student!
- Must be a lie!
- Look ... my student ID ...
Please! I want a rifle!
Something will happen tomorrow!
I wanna shoot somebody!
- You are nuts ...
- May I join you?
Bullshit! This is not a game!
What? Maybe there are no rifles?
You only got swords and daggers like in the old times?
What kind of Yakuza are you?
You've already lost!
Stop!
You are going to stay! With the girl!
Nobody leaves until tomorrow!
Wow! This one is real!
It's a Thompson, right?
- May I hold it?
- Forget it!
- I just wanna hold it!
- Idiot!
There must be more, right?
I prefer other pistols!
Where are they?
Water pistols!
- Did you come to unbind me?
- Thank you coming...
- Where will we ...?
- When?
- The attack?
- Our leaders are...
- Does the enemy know?
- How about the strategy?
Ils souhaiteraient que vous restiez group s# et attendiez dans cette pi ce.#
- Where are you from?
- Himeji.
And you?
- Matsuyama, in Shikoku.
- Hiroshima.
What?
For your drive!
Please accept it.
- Nothing for me?
- Here!
You calculate everything?
How stupid!
- Bullshit!
- Shut up!
Just go on, you'll regret it!
Gentlemen! See you tomorrow!
Woooh!
We have to spend the night here?
One... Two... Three...
Four... Five... Six...
Seven.
Seven men and one woman.
Miss!
Here comes no.1!
Can you untie me?
What are you up to?
I've got some money!
You'll get half of it!
- I don't care about money...
- Stop it!
- Nice body! How old are you?
- Untie me!
Why are you tied up?
- He's killing without a reason!
- Without a ...?
- He just kills, no matter whom...
- Don't interefere!
- We are having a conversation!
- So will you untie me?
- Sure...
- Stop it! It tickles!
Will you spend the night with me, if I untie you?
Yes!
You had a knife, right?
Give it to me!
Stop! You'll regret it!
Well? It's not dark yet but you are in the mood already?
That was not what I thought about!
Shut up!
I'm not such kind of guy!
Just forget about that liar!
You are the best after all!
What are you doing?
You really kill everyone?
Without a special reason?
Bullshit!
Heart broken and a headache on top of it...
Let's sleep until it becomes dark.
Good Night!
Tell me!
Are you a killer??
- Hey! I am first!
- There is a special order?
Looking for trouble?!
- Piss off!
- You really feel like killing!
Piss off!
Piss off!
Me! Now you want to kill me!
OK! I'll cut you down!
Stop!
Put the knife down! At once!
So much about killing...
- Just a toy.
- It must be real!
- A Mauser 712.
- A toy!
- Is it loaded?
- Yes. 6 bullets.
Wanna die?
Seem so.
Better die of sickness!
I don't want to.
You really want to be killed?
I think so.
- An accident would be better.
- Cars are no people.
- It's the same!
- No!
My murderer will look at me!
- I'll se myself in his eyes.
- "... in his eyes..."
- And?
- In this moment...
- ... I know who I am.
- "... who I am."
- But then you are dead!
- "... you are dead!"
No. In this moment...
- ... I know what I have to do.
- You know nothing! Shut up!
You mix something up!
Something is on your mind.
That's why the enemy wants to kill you when he shows up.
Maybe.
- But I want to meet him.
- Just by hanging around...
- ... you won't.
- I will!
I think I'll meet him very soon.
That's why I started my journey.
I just took off, one morning.
Yes!
You'll meet him!
I'll kill you tomorrow!
- Just now you didn't.
- I've always! Until now...
"Until now"?
You've killed before?
- Yes. Very often!
- Bullshit! I don't believe it!
I used my knife 15 or 16 times.
Half of the men have died.
Liar! Someone like you could never do that!
I've always carried a new knife right here!
People understand the true meaning of dead when having a weapon.
... when having a weapon.
Hold it!
The best is to put it in your mouth, when shooting yourself!
Know how to shoot?
First you have to release it...
- You always have it with you?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Since I have it, ...
... I know what kind of person I really am.
- Not like you ...
- Exactly!
Since I carry a knife...
... I want to kill people!
- But 15 or 16 times? Bullshit!
- Trust me!
After leaving the Marines...
... I became crazy for card games.
I came to Kamagasaki in 1960.
I had heard about a great casino.
But I found nothing.
I was so angry I bought a knife.
I stabbed a guy with it.
I interfered in other peoples' fights ...
... just to cut down both men.
And you think you know me?
Bullshit!
You're crazy!
Once I start ...
... I kill 100s of people with my rifle! That's it!
Just shoot at birds with your air-gun, boy!
You'll never know how good it feels stabbing someone.
Stop it!
I don't shoot people!
Who was that?
- I don't like him!
- Tie him up again!
All Japanese men should be tied up!
- I went to a funeral.
- There was a funeral.
Boss told me to attend the funeral.
Sorry, what's this?
- A TV.
- Show me!
Sure.
- Where are you going?
- Pee!
The enemy is ready.
Did the HQ send a message?
Yes, someone's at the air field.
The enemy is ready.
- Should we hand out the guns?
- Let's wait for the leaders.
They aren't coming!
Are the weapons ready?
You spied on us?!
Pig! Pervert! Bastard!
Hey!
I am going back! Don't worry!
Which gang are you?
Should I write "TV"?
- And the other one?
- "Companion".
Where am I?
- What does it mean?
- "Female".
This must be "male" then?
You are the "male".
So come on! Be a man!
It's going to start soon.
It's going to start!
It's going to start!
- There are 30 rifles!
- Where?!
101 samurai swords!
And on top of it 60 pistols!
The enemy is ready!
Police is getting ready too.
- The killing will start soon!
- Do you know at which time?
Bang! Bang! Everybody's shooting!
Friend and foe, you're going to die!
Flowers will bloom after your dead.
Your graves will be ...
... full of flowers!
Stupid cow! Stop it!
I am 18, but I am in full bloom!
I want to fight with a man!
It's going to start!
It's going to start!
- And now ...
- Stop it!
Swords are not good...
- We must ask for rifles.
- I'm coming too!
Go!
That's the third victim.
The third victim of the mysterious sniper!
Miss Sano was on her way home from tailor class.
The bullets hit her without warning.
Just like the incident that had happened 40 minutes before.
Nobody has seen the sniper.
Nobody knows, where he was hiding.
Meanwhile, office worker
T. Watanabe has told police ...
... that a foreigner with a rifle took away his car.
Police assumes that his foreigner must be the mysterious sniper.
His nationality is unknown.
The position of the car is unkown.
Should the foreigner be the sniper...
... he is able to move around with the car and act everywhere.
The police is telling the public not to leave the house.
Turn on TVs or radios for further information!
Like a miracle the friend of the first victims survived...
Is it far away to go to this guy?
When he comes with a car...
- ... one hour!
- Why is he doing that?
- No idea!
- A foreigner ...
No foreigner! A white man!
Three people in one hour!
He has a rifle with a sighting telescope!
Lucky guy! Why don't you let me have a rifle too?
There won't be any in a room like this!
Please! A rifle! I'll join you!
I am very sorry about this.
Are you feeling alright?
Work will start very soon.
- Will we get our weapons?
- Yes.
- Rifles and pistols of course!
- Yes.
We are just calculating how to distribute them.
Excuse me!
Not such a mood-killer-song!
Good Afternoon! Dear world!
That kills me!
Good afternoon!
Murder and suicide for love!
Good afternoon, dear Japan!
Good afternoon, in 1970!
Good afternoon! Good afternoon!
Idiot! Stupid!
Did it come from over there?
Sounded like an accident.
So they've got weapons already!
I want a rifle too! Please!
Have a look and get some!
But ... only me ...
Take him with you. That'll do.
Are you coming?
What do you need rifles for?
You are no true men after all!
Why do you need rifles?
You can't kill anyone!
- I can!
- Liar!
You did not even touch me!
You want to be a killer?
Very funny indeed?
You want me to show you? Where?
Here, in front of everyone!
Fine ...
Well? How about the rifles?
Later! I am first!
Shall I?
- You wanna die, right?
- Stop it!
He does not really want to be killed!
I want to!
Try it! With your pistol!
Aren't you scared?
You really wanna die?
Better say it, if you have any doubts!
I have nothing to say.
Fine ... can you see your face?
Not sure. It's not very clear.
You wanna fight?
Hey! What are you doing?!
Shut up!
Die!
Stoppage of gun!
It happens.
- What ...
- I can repair it.
Will you give it back?
- Yes.
- Really?
- It will take 30 minutes.
- I will wait.
There was this guy, who decieved his friends.
He always played the honest one.
But then it was decided, that he must die.
He stood up bravely in front of the pistol.
Nothing he could do about it.
It was decided.
But ...
... he insisted on not having decieved anybody.
I pulled the trigger, but stoppage of gun!
I hoped he would run away while I was reparing the gun.
We had been friends after all.
But he did not run away.
He waited two long hours, until the gun was repaired.
And then - Bang! - he was dead.
That's a long time ago. There were not so many guns then.
What do you say?
You!
You!
30 minutes, right?
Will you give me your 30 minutes?
- That's okay, right?
- Yes, now I can.
I have not been wearing underwear the whole time.
The police assumptions were right.
The foreigner is the mysterious sniper.
Officer Hideo Jun was attacked from a passing car... 
... while being on patrol on highway no.1. 
It was the car which had been stolen a short time before.
The sniper is fleeing towards the east.
His looks and motives stay unclear.
He is shooting while driving which complicates the whole situation.
The Police is trying to block ...
- What are you doing?!
- Repair it! Quick!
Let's go over there!
Just 20 minutes left!
- The foreigner is coming?
- He'll pass by.
I'll wait then.
I want to see him.
- I'll do it once the gun is ready.
- The foreigner will kill me!
- I can do it!
- Shut up! It's my job!
I'll have my knife soon, just wait and see ...
Bullshite! Awww, my body hurts.
Bye bye!
Nobody's here!
What's wrong?
They are gone! Without you!
Serves you right!
That's the end, I guess.
- Nobody's there?
- No.
Poverty and hunger ...
... are the reason for everything.
Come! Let's go!
- I should kill him!
- But it's all over!
- The pistol will be fine soon.
- Who cares? He's my man!
Please don't go!
There's enough time left.
What's going on?
Nobody is here!
- The fight is cancelled.
- But why?
One of our leaders was caught on the airfield.
- The cops?
- Yes. A crackdown!
They'll be here soon.
So I want to ask you ...
Out of my way!
- Shall we fight he police?
- No! Calm down!
- With the rifles? "Call down"?
- You want us to be arrested?
Out of my way!
I would take responsibility.
But only me? That would stink.
So I ask for your cooperation.
When the verdict was spoken...
What about the others?
They just ran away.
- And now we are the substitutes?
- Exactly.
When you are arrested, the others will earn some time.
Is that a joke?!
We came to fight!
Not for going to jail!
Relax!
There's lots of time!
But let me tell you:
Not a word to the police!
You don't know anything anyway...
- How dare you?!
- Shut up!
Wanna die?
Or stand the bad food for some days and go home?
Well?
Out of my way!
The big rock will break!
- I'll go for the bad food.
- Miss!
You should go home!
Will you join me?
Me as a young man ...
... committed many crimes.
Oh ...
Povert and hunger ...
... are the reasons for everything.
Poverty and hunger ...
... are the reason for everything.
Out of my way!
I hit you in pieces!
Big rock.
Out of my way!
I can't return to freedom yet.
Stop singing!
When the verdict was spoken ...
... the girl cried out loud.
Five years of penitientiary.
That was too much!
Out of my way! I hit you in pieces!
Big rock!
Out of my way! Out of my way!
I can't return to freedom yet.
I can't return to freedom yet.
Can't find a man in this darkness.
What can I do but sleep?
Oh, I did not go peeing since last evening.
It's me!
It's morning already!
- What's going on?
- Are the cops coming?
Nobody. Everything's quiet.
You know why I came back?
The TV's sound is working again.
The foreigenr is probably hiding inside of the city.
Somewhere here in the city.
9 1/2 hours after the first incident ...
... and 5 hours after the attack on a police officer on the high way:
He did not show up at the road barriers, ...
... so he must be in the city.
Damned! He's in the city?
Probably.
Just forget it!
It's working?
There are lots of toys in the box!
A rifle!
- For me too.
- I'll have two swords.
Two more rifles. Who takes them?
- What for?
- For killing of course.
Killing whom?
Now we have weapons.
But at whom shall we aim?
Nobody here to give orders.
So the fight is over?
- You won't do anything?
- Nothing we can do.
- No enemy!
- So we'll just go home?
That's why I am asking!
What shall we do?
Use your heads!
Don't you have any enemies?
Someone you really want to kill?
I'll go! Who cares whom I kill?
You don't think I can do it?
What a fine gang we are!
A white sniper and gang wars.
- Life is hard for the cops.
- Is nobody coming with me?
- Me!
- Where to?
- Doesn't matter!
- Me too.
87 persons were arrested and 23 pistols were found, ...
... also 20 sowrds and 3 carabiners.
The investigations will be continued.
It's like Dallas!
We are like a Japanese Dallas!
The white sniper still hides within the city.
At the same time armed gangs are roaming through the streets.
About 200 gangsters!
All dangeous elements!
It's just like Dallas!
Repair the picture until sunrise!
Hey ... Dallas?
Kennedy was killed there, right?
Sleep with me!
The night will be over soon ...
Dallas ...
In Dallas and still alive.
What about you, toy-man?
TV-Mann? How about it?
- I'll go!
- Me too. Everyone is okay for me!
Stop! Where are you going?
Go home!
It's dangerous!
What? Back already?
I got two.
It was boring!
Really?
I got three. But nothing to be happy about.
Repaired!
Look who's there!
Arrested! Serves him right!
Leave us here to the police!
- Let's go!
- The news!
The American summer with the race riots ...
"Long and hot American Summer".
How can we call this
Japanese summer?
No blackmen riots but a white man is the cause of trouble.
Just look at the many victims!
Despite of the police order to stay at home ...
... the area was full of people heading for the factory.
After ten hours of silence the sniper shoot many bullets again.
Nobody knows about his motives.
Our team is tryint to catch a glance of him and report.
We don't know when we will be shot at.
But it's our duty as journalists.
That's him! We found him!
That's him?
I'll go and face his rifle-
I'll fight with him!
- He just shot!
- How many will I get?
Arm yourself! Rifles or sowrds! What ever!
- What are you doing!
- I'm leaving! It's over!
The other one too!
And you? Will you come?
How?
We have a car!
- What kind of?
- A small one.
For 5 person.
2 people too mich.
We are not going. Right?
You won't get it.
- But ...
- Shut up!
Leave me alone!
I had enough!
Then go!
Just five people!
The foreigner or the police?
Who's our enemy?
- Good bye!
- Bye bye, idiot!
Just die!
What was that about?
TV-man?
What was that?
Who fired?
He would have attacked the foreigner!!
So there is one man less.
- Can I come too?
- No women!
Why?
I wanna sleep with the foreigner.
Poverty and hunger ...
... are the reason for everything.
The situation remains complicated.
A car is approaching!
The car has passed by the barriers build by the police!
The car is approaching the sniper!
What's going on here?
You can see the car now.
There are 5 persons in the car!
They are Japanese!
They have rifles!
We cannot say what these people are up to!
Will he shoot?
No idea.
I'm sure he'll be alarmed though.
I'll shoot at the police then!
Then he knows we are his friends.
- Why not?
- It's too early!
Mr foreigner!
We want to join you!
He won't understand that!
What? That's dangerous!
Such an idiot!
I'll shoot!
Don't!
What is he up to?
No police! No police!
Friend! Friend!
Did he understand?
He did not shoot.
Fine! I'll go too!
No police! Friend!
Friend! Darling!
Leave! It's dangerous!
Leave! Leave at once!
Leave!
It's dangerous! Leave!
Leave at once!
Friend! Friend!
Darling! Friend!
My friend?
Exactly! Friend!
Friend!
Let's shake hands!
- Alrigh! He's understood us
- Understood what?
That we are on his side!
- What are you doing?
- You!
- What are you doing?
- They are getting on my nerves.
- Leave!
- Shut up!
What is your plan?!
Who are you?!
Idiot!
Darling! Let's be friends!
You must be hungry! Here!
Don't worry! It's not poisened.
Who is that?!
Can't you seee it?
- A foreigner.
- But what kind of?
And why is he doing this?
Why? Why?
Why? Why?
I'm twenty years old.
Oh, 20? I am 18.
20? I know how you feel.
- You understand him? Why?
- I just do.
What do you want?
I'll fight with him.
Me too!
Yes? Me: Eighteen!
- Me, eighteen.
- Eighteen?
You, twenty.
Me, eighteen.
Yes.
Me, seventeen.
Me, fifty-one!
Why did you come with us?
I know.
Huh? You know?
You want to kill the foreigner.
Right!
No!
- Let's get out of here!
- Tear gas!
Weapons down! Come out!
If you shoot again, ...
... we'll shoot back!
Weapons down and come out!
Drop the gun! And come out!
If you shoot again, we'll use our guns!
Drop the gun and surrender!
Just leave him!
Leave him! He's dead!
Hey, hurry up!
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
What are you doing?
C'mon! Let's go!
Drop your guns! Come out!
You are surrounded!
Drop your guns and surrender!
If you don't obey, ...
... we'll use our guns!
Drop the gun and come out!
We have you surrounded!
Come out!
With your hands up! If you don't ...
- Shit! Arrogant asshole!
- That's dangerous!
That's why I am shooting!
Drop your guns and come out!
You can't resist!
Drop your guns and surrender!
Drop the gun and come out!
It's useless to resist!
You don't have a chance!
Drop the gun! And surrender!
Will we do it? Bang! Bang!
What? You don't want to?
Then piss off!
I'll do it myself.
Hey, TV-man! How about you?
He said: People only understand death when they have a weapon.
- Shoot me.
- Why me?
I'm nt sure ...
But I want you to.
Uff!
Time for decision!
I've been waiting for this!
Hey!
What's going on?
I shot the white guy!
I killed him!
What was that?!
You ...?
You!
"My murderer will look at me."
"I will se myself in his eyes."
"Then I will know who I am."
"I will know what I have to do."
"My murderer ..."
- What's your name?
- Nejiko.
"A woman with a loose screw (Neji)."
And you?
I don't have a name.
The man who will vaporize.
And now?
Nejiko!
Wonderful!
A love-double-suicide.
Not a voluntary one!

A Hideo Gosha Movie
TOHO presents a FUJI TELEVISION
& TOKYO EIGA production
The Tokugawa shogunate governed Japan between the 17th and the end of the 19th century.
Its economy was based on
Sado Isle's goldmines.
It was the shogun's gold.
Through the years, the mines gave from
60 to 90 tons of metal.
Refined and transformed into bars the gold was carried aboard the shogun's vessels with 800 bars per trip.
The ships took the west road via Shimonoseki.
Navigating was dangerous especially between Sado's isles and Noto's peninsula, where the sea was hostile and sowed with reefs.
Inhabited by water demons, those seas were called
"the cemetery of ships".

1831, ECHIZEN PROVINCE
TERRITORY OF THE SABAI
Takichi dear !
Where are you ?
Okumi !
Yaichi !
Father !
Father !
No one's here ?
Father !
They disappeared !
Taken by the gods !
One night in October 1831, a village of fishermen in the stronghold of the Sabai totally disappeared.
No trace of the thirty inhabitants was ever found.
People said they were
"taken by the gods".
The mystery was unsolved.
THREE YEARS LATER IN 1834
EDO (Tokyo)
Come, Come !
It's time for the fencing show.
Now, we can start.
Wait a bit.
Keep calm.
It's an exceptional blade.
But some business first.
Take a look at this miraculous ointment.
It's the real one, not some fake.
A secret formula...
Stop.
You'll sell later.
Where is the fighter ?
- Wait a moment !
- Go !
Attention !
The weapon master !
- We attack ?
- Wait.
Wait !
Continue.
Don't stop.
I want to compare my art against yours.
Fleeing ?
It's not him !
Insolent !
Thanks.
You look rich.
Have you found a trail ?
Let me have a part too.
I am Fujimaki Samon.
I love money above all.
Where is Wakisaka Magobei ?
Wakisaka Magobei ?
Are you in a hurry ?
You know Magobei ?
He paid my drinks once or twice.
I invited myself at his table.
Why do you want to kill him ?
Explain.
Mind your own business !
Where is Magobei ?
Talk, or else...
No chance. He left the circus.
I'm replacing him.
Look at this.
An Echizen sword, of the utmost quality.
You really want to sell it ?
Such a beautiful sword, and such great art.
Except your respect, that is all you've got.
I don't want it anymore.
What will you do without a sword ?
A samurai doesn't become a farmer.
Selling your sword is to quit your vocation, right ?
What honor is there to be a samurai ?
Master !
It isn't nothing !
You made up your mind ?
I'll take it to the nail.
Wait for me. Don't drink too much.
Wait !
Don't follow me !
Are you looking for me ?
Wakisaka Magobei.
Die without asking question.
You know my name ?
You leave me no choice.
Takeuchi !
Why do you want to kill me ?
It's been three years I quitted the Sabai clan.
What do they want from me ?
Talk !
I don't understand.
Answer or I kill you.
Wait !
It's the chamberlain...
The chamberlain ?
Tatewaki ?
What does he want ?
Talk !
The fishermen...
He's going to start again.
But before doing so, he ordered me to eliminate you.
He's going to do the
"taken by the gods" act?
Wait !
Wait, Kunai !
Why kill those fishermen ?
They're innocents.
Innocents ?
They stole gold from one of the Shogun's ship that drowned yesterday.
They deserved it.
What ?
They gave us all the gold they retrieved.
We hid the gold in the chests of a wedding procession.
It is far by now.
Kunai Koriki !
Complain to the chamberlain !
I have my orders from chamberlain
Rokugo Tatewaki.
Rokugo Tatewaki ?
These are his orders ?
Bravo !
You're now an accomplice.
23 chests of 20 gold bars each hidden by fishermen.
The rest drowned.
A wedding, good idea !
For safety, we used this wedding kimono we found in the village.
Take out the bride !
Kill them all !
Assassins !
Tatewaki ! I want to talk to you !
I obliged the fishermen to give the gold they saved to our clan.
And you, Tatewaki, you promised me to give them a reward.
In fact, you wanted to kill them from the start, right ?
The clan's finances are disastrous.
I need this gold !
The harvest are catastrophic,
I don't want to raise the taxes.
I don't even want to pay the annual tribute to the shogunate.
The debts, the farmer's revolts...
The shogunate is waiting only for this to crush us.
This gold will give us some respite.
Magobei, try to understand !
I understand your situation.
But you're wrong !
Our jobs as vassal is to maintain the prestige of the Sabai.
Am I wrong ?
Am I wrong to be loyal ?
You're wrong !
He is wrong to think the presence of the Sabai justifies such cruelty.
Is this the price of loyalty ?
No !
He's wrong !
I quit the clan.
Magobei.
Those fishermen, I had to kill them.
If gold wasn't vital for us,
I would've acted otherwise.
Imagined if they've exposed everything.
Our clan would've been lost.
I sacrificed some weaklings for our clan and its 600 vassals to survive.
It was the way of the samurais.
I had enough of these ways.
If I stay in the clan,
I'll have to battle you one day.
You, the brother of my wife and my friend.
I leave the clan.
It's the only solution.
I quit everything and I leave.
But before I do, give me a favor.
Swear to me to never do it again.
Think it over.
Why kill each other ?
Promise me to say nothing, whatever the case and I'll go quietly.
Where are you going ?
Home.
What ?
At the Sabai.
To do what ?
For 20 or 30 fishermen ?
Close your eyes one more time and everything will be fine.
The shogunate won't know anything.
I closed my eyes three years earlier.
I was wrong.
CASTLE OF THE SABAI
I tried everything to recover our finances.
Concentrate our efforts on the development of rice plantations.
We'll dig plantations along the coastline.
The exhumed sand will serve as compost for the new fields.
The output will be at least
10000 bushels of rice.
My Lord !
The confiscated lands of the shogunate represents 10000 bushels.
- Here is the source of our problems.
- Measure your words.
It's nothing. Continue.
If we continue indebting ourselves,
We'll be running to our death.
We have no choice.
The clearing costs a fortune !
How are you going to finance it ?
Tatewaki.
What is your project ?
For the financing, let me worry about it.
Lady Shino.
You're a worker.
For who do you weave ?
For Magobei, your husband ?
You'll never give up ?
Our lord has accepted our clearing project.
We need to find some funds, whatever it takes.
- Who's here ?
- Vassal Koriki.
A letter from Edo.
What is it ?
Wakiza Magobei is coming back.
Magobei ?
He's gone several days ago.
He must already be at the Nakasendo.
It seems you wanted Magobei killed.
Is that true ? yes.
Kunai...
Why have you acted without my permission ?
I know Magobei very well.
He'll never betray us, whatever the case.
Magobei is like that.
I'm sorry.
But...
I don't have the same trust as you on men.
Three years ago,
You promised Magobei to never do it again.
If we succeed in stealing the gold one more time, the shogunate will double its vigilance.
What's more, if
Magobei knows that we're doing it again...
I never told you anything and I took the responsibility of eliminating Magobei.
Thanks to you,
I have an honorable rank, me who was nothing.
For you, chamberlain, and for the 600 vassals of clan Sabai,
I am ready to have my hands bloodied.
Ready ?
Anything goes !
4 and 6, even !
I won again.
Sorry guys !
You have one of these lucks !
How do you do it ?
It's only luck.
So ?
Care for one more ?
What does it mean ?
You think I'm cheating ?
Who do you take me for ?
Those numbers, only God knows them !
I'm the best of all Japan.
I want apologies !
Fast !
Bastards !
We apologized !
We refunded you.
Let us go.
- Please !
- Sore losers !
Look at those twerps !
You dogs !
It's normal to cheat at the dices.
Suckers !
Shut up, dirty bitch !
We're going to pay ourselves, all right guys ?
Wait !
Try me !
I am Ohira,
"taken by the Gods" !
Taken by the Gods ?
What is that ?
Listen up. One howly night,
Spirits with crow heads took everyone from my village.
But they didn't touched me.
What do you think ?
She's completely crazy.
Hey guys.
Let's show her we're not crows.
Who're you ?
- Leave.
- Thanks !
Little bitch !
Pervert !
What is it, brother ?
Shino...
I'm picking some flowers
In the moonlight
I look at the starry sky
Shino.
Magobei is coming back.
Back home ?
I have to kill Magobei.
So, it's for this passage rival bands are killing each other ?
Who'd want a place like this ?
A real mess !
The villagers have fled.
It's now deserted.
Perfect.
If Magobei took the road to Nakasendo, he has to pass through this passage.
Let's wait for him here.
He can't escape us.
A squad will be enough.
Someone's coming.
A woman.
Let her through.
Hey, beauty !
You all right ?
Hang on to me.
This village is deserted. Why ?
Because of the rival bands that kill each other for this passage, everyone's fled.
Come have fun.
Mister samurai.
Thank you for the other day.
My friend wants to see you.
She wants to thank you.
Mister !
Where are you taking me ?
Wait !
I said she's waiting.
Come, please.
Come, or she'll punish me.
It's here.
I'm done for.
Those jerks caught me cheating.
It's the end of Oriha,
"taken by the gods".
Because you drink too much.
You're shaking.
Get out, if I disgust you.
Don't follow me like a dog.
- Ohira !
- Shut up !
Rokuzo !
Leave us. Go down.
Go down I said !
If you don't obey me...
Okay, I'm going down.
I understood.
Close the door !
Mister...
Drink in peace.
You'll stay with me today?
I want to thank you.
My body is yours.
Entirely.
You're Oriha, taken by the gods ?
Where do you come from ?
From the land of the Sabai, the coastal village of Kurosaki.
Three years ago, where were you ?
Three years ago ?
At this time,
I was another person.
I was just finishing my training with a weaver and got back home to Kurosaki.
I was to be married with Takichi.
I worked hard for five years because I wanted a wedding kimono.
I was saving on the food.
I was sending money to my father.
After five years, I finally had my kimono !
Not some kind of kid kimono, but a superb wedding kimono !
I was in such a hurry to show it to my father and fiancee, that I sent it back before returning home.
But my kimono vanished !
Takichi too, my father also...
The village was empty !
I lost the will to live on.
Now look what I have become.
Not so fast !
You know something.
True ?
How come ?
Tell me what you know.
Where are they ?
Where have the villagers gone ?
Do you know ?
Tell me quickly !
We meet again !
You know each other ?
That's what I thought...
You asked me to interrogate him on the fishermen !
Do it yourself !
You are making me crazy !
Tell me what you know !
Stop !
Let go of me !
Leave me !
I was counting on her to make you talk.
- Let me go !
- No !
- Calm yourself !
- Stop touching me.
Don't get moody.
Let's drink.
What are you looking for ?
If I give the wrong answer, will you kill me ?
Am I right ?
Looks like you know something.
Don't act innocent.
Get me up to date.
What are you talking about ?
You know very well.
The Sabai wants to kill you.
I'm certain that you've belonged to their clan.
Three years go, in the land of the Sabai, under the reign of I don't know which
Matsudaira chief, a village of fishermen disappeared.
"Taken by the gods", it seems.
It was at the same time that you left the Sabai.
That's not all.
At that same time, a shogun's vessel full of gold drowned near the Sabai's territory.
Isn't that amazing?
In my opinion, there's something between these three events.
Suppose...
The Sabai robs the Shogun's gold, and kills all the fishermen to keep them from talking.
It makes sense.
Let's find some evidence.
We'll blackmail the Sabai.
We'll be rich !
You thought about it, no ?
Put me in.
Magobei !
You're wrong.
Samon !
Oriha !
We're going to have fun.
Let's see if you can kill me !
We'll make you sweat !
Oriha !
You're next.
Mister !
Leave this place !
Shino !
You're after the wrong person.
Wait !
Who are you ?
As you see, my nose guides me where there is money.
Hire me as a killer.
I prayed everyday for your return.
I was sure you'd be back.
Each time I weaved a dress,
I told myself you'd be back when it would be done.
Like a child,
I waited three years for you.
Shino.
You're thinner.
You too.
You know...
Don't say anything.
Shut up.
For God's sake, don't go back to the Sabai.
If you go back...
I left the Sabai to be with you.
We'll have enough to live on for some time.
This money is a gift from
Tatewaki, your brother ?
I see.
He sent you with this money so we'd go elsewhere ?
- Honey...
- No way !
I have to return to the Sabai.
The Sabai will kill you !
I know.
Honey...
Take me far away.
I'll weave, I'll sow...
I'll do everything to not be a burden to you.
Keep me on your sides.
The girl I helped earlier, you saw her ?
Three years ago, her fiancee got murdered.
Her life was destroyed.
His brother, Tatewaki, is on the verge of doing it again.
Wait !
Listen to me !
My brother is in a delicate situation.
You know the Samurai's duty.
That's why you left the clan three years ago.
Close your eyes another time.
My brother doesn't want to kill you.
He's letting us go.
His last act of friendship.
He doesn't want to kill me ?
But I'm already dead.
Ever since I closed my eyes on that slaughter.
By letting them,
I lost my dignity.
I forgot that I owed my duty as a samurai to all those helpless people.
This I understood by living the dirty streets of Edo these last three years.
What good is a sword without honor ?
I let myself drift away.
I was ready to sell my sword.
That's when I learned that
Tatewaki will start again.
My anger towards Tatewaki guided me on the right way.
I have a duty to finish.
It concerns only me.
I'll find my honor back.
That's why
I've decided to return to the Sabai.
To rescue those innocent fishermen.
And, for me too, to live again.
Try to understand.
My love !
Sabai Castle
We were waiting for you.
For the peace of our clan, die !
Not so fast, Kunai !
I want to see Tatewaki.
I have to talk to him.
Out of question !
Bastard !
Traitor !
Wait !
Listen up.
Try to understand me.
I'm going to kill you, Magobei.
Wait !
It's a trick.
He's going to kill us one after the other.
Then what ?
Don't worry, he can't flee.
We have time on our hands.
We have to help our rescuer.
Yes, but how ?
Are you mocking me ?
Harukoma's band controls the passage of the village.
What ?
Relax !
I'm telling you it's true !
Shoten's band is in the village !
Magobei !
Get out of there !
Out, Magobei !
I'll kill him in a duel, if you want.
All right.
Show us your skills.
Get away !
Leave him Magobei.
Do you hear ?
Magobei, show yourself !
It's time. Get out !
What is it ?
Get off !
Magobei !
I'm sorry.
A brawl between bandits annoyed us.
Magobei escaped us.
Your sister is returning this to you.
She says she doesn't need it anymore.
I saw her on the passage and took her back to the castle.
She doesn't need it anymore ?
Kunai.
Any news from Sado ?
A vessel loaded with a ton of gold,
30 chests with 30 bars each, has sailed and should be in coastal view tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night ?
And the next vessel ?
According to the mine chief, there won't be any before next autumn.
Good.
Let's go.
I never met a chamberlain.
Your swords.
Enter !
Leave us.
But...
Leave us !
Some tea ?
It's not poisoned.
Errant Samurai from my father's time,
I do not know good manners.
Since your father's time ?
I envy you.
But I have a nose for money !
So its smell brought you here ?
- You're a funny man.
- Oh yeah.
But my nose betrayed me.
The Sabai are cheap.
They don't pay much.
Bad luck !
I'm sorry.
What would you think of a well paid work ?
Thank you ! You're a true chamberlain !
Give me a big mission.
All right.
Tomorrow night, you'll light a big fire on a headland.
It's made of herbs, it heals very well.
My father taught me that.
When I scratched myself, he always put me some.
Oriha.
Looks like you're not the same.
That's normal.
When I was without hope,
I returned here, alone, thinking that my father, my fiancee, and all the villagers would maybe reappear.
When I left to be an apprentice, the villagers escorted me to the headland.
I was 13 years old.
It was the last time I saw them.
Oriha...
I am...
You were here ?
I was sure that you'd be with her.
Chamberlain !
So ?
You were right.
Go, Kunai !
I was asked to light a huge fire at the Samegafuchi village.
To do what ?
It means that tonight, a shogun's vessel will pass over there.
This is Samegafuchi.
There is the sea.
Capes on each side like arms.
In the middle,
Samegafuchi Bay, a sea full of reefs.
The greatest cape is called "Man", the other is called "Woman".
At the bay's entrance, a huge rock.
On "Man", a fire burns to guide the vessels taking the western route.
The Shogun's vessel will pass near the lit cape like that to avoid the rock.
But how will Tatewaki proceed to attack the vessel ?
5 or 6 fishing boats won't suffice !
But if we move the fire from "Man" to "Woman"...
Where are the fishermen going ?
All the fishermen knows this ancestral ruse.
I see.
Oriha. Give me a favor.
Go to Samegafuchi on boat.
You know the place well.
But I lost the habit.
She'll never make it !
It'll take too long by road.
Oriha, listen !
The Samegafuchi village will finish like yours !
Oriha...
I am...
I am...
Rokuzo, here !
Stay here, understood !
We are cornered.
We'll have to ally ourselves.
Sorry, Samon.
I refuse the aid of a Shogun's spy.
Huh ?
I knew you'd understand.
I don't need to hide anymore.
I do a dirty work.
Don't kill them !
I want them alive !
Understood ?
Chamberlain !
We stopped them.
Magobei is neutralized.
Listen all !
One : When the villagers will bring the wood back, take them to the beach.
Three oarsmen by boat !
Imprison their family and keep a watch.
Forget no one !
Two :
Take out the fire on "Man" !
Three :
Light a fire on "Woman".
Four :
Bring the boards on sea when the ship will sink.
Two clansmen by boat.
For the villagers, wait for my orders.
Let no one escape !
Kunai is replacing me.
As you know, it's essential for the clan's survival.
It's the way of the samurai !
I put my trust in you.
Understood ?
Damn spy !
My three years old promise,
I didn't kept it.
Listen, Magobei.
I'll break it again if necessary.
As much as needed.
This world has forced the samurai to dirty their hands for survival.
Magobei, you're a coward.
You fled for fear of soiling yourself.
You're right.
I'm a coward.
Coward for not killing you on this beach three years ago.
Don't meddle in my affairs.
Take Shino with you and leave the country peacefully.
Please.
For the Shogun, the Sabai clan is an unimportant stronghold.
I cannot back down.
Tatewaki !
Same thing for me.
I have to kill you to save the fishermen.
I'm wasting my time with you.
So the crow won't eat you, die in the snow !
I would have loved battling you.
Wait !
Something's fishy.
Go see.
I kept you the best seat on the cape "Woman".
You're too sweet.
I'm not accusing you.
You did your job as a spy.
You'll see a nice show.
Before you die, you'll get to see what the shogunate forces us to do.
Good.
Gather the fishermen on the beach.
And inform Kunai.
I'll be watching.
Wait for my signal.
And light a big fire. Understood ?
Hurry up !
It's him !
The fire on "Man" is extinguished.
Fire "Woman" is ready !
Chamberlain.
We only need to wait for the ship.
Hey, the bald !
I'm freezing to death !
Hurry up lighting the fire !
Here !
I see the vessel's light !
It's coming !
Light the fire.
Light the fire !
Light the fire !
No panic !
Chamberlain !
Send the boats.
Chamberlain, look !
I'll have it !
Wait !
Wait !
Villagers, leave your boats !
If you go to the sea, you will all die !
Go away !
Flee !
Quickly ! Flee !
Flee while you can !
Or, you will all vanish !
You'll be slaughtered !
Go away !
Shit ! What do we do ?
I don't know.
Rokuzo.
Take this barrel.
For what ?
Light the fire on "Man".
There !
Burn, burn !
Go extinguish the fire on "Man" !
Quickly !
Put out the fire on "Man" !
Quickly !
Captain !
There's two fire !
What do we do ?
Oriha !
Rokuzo !
It's the right fire ! It's burning high !
Hissez la voile !
Hoist the sail !
Shino.
Sorry to mistreat you.
Tell Magobei that I want a one-on-one talk.
Shino.
My brother is waiting for you on the mountain.
- Take the logs.
- Logs ?
Light a fire.
I can't hold my sword.
My fingers are frozen.
And the Sabai clan ?
What will it become ?
Magobei.
Magobei.
I'm not coming back to Edo.
I'm quitting the spy job.
I feel better.
While you are killing yourselves in the cold, what is the shogunate doing ?
It's getting fatter in the heat.
It's a party !
A party ?
No, a funeral.
A funeral, for us, samurais.
Here lies Rokugo Takewaki.

{2775}{2846} - Cheering with such a ride! | - Get off quickly!
{2850}{2971} - Dad! Let's take a shortcut, take a shortcut! | - True, closest there!
{2975}{3046} KaŸmierz! Greet your trouser legs, | because there is a wetland.
{3050}{3096} - go, go! I will keep up. | - Neat, so as not to damage the clothes!
{3100}{3146} - Don't be afraid! | - Maybe it's a run!
{3150}{3196} But we got caught in this cab | by this taxi.
{3200}{3288} Oh where? Late, late ...
{3675}{3787} - Oh, I think it's him ... | - Kaźmierz, legs!
{3850}{3926} Come on, let's go!
{4200}{4259} Jaœko!
{4400}{4496} Where is Mania? | Did he know what? He met, and?
{4500}{4596} A little decline. | ​​And now, Witia, come on!
{4600}{4721} He was born a year after your emigration. And that's my grandson.
{4725}{4796} - Also Pawlak. | - Pawlak!
{4800}{4934} Yes, yes, it's a crook. | And this is Pawe³ek. Already baptized here.
{4950}{4971} A student.
{4975}{5021} I was his godfather.
{5025}{5121} Thank you, Uncle, for agreeing to be | my godfather to my Ania.
{5125}{5196} Well, children! Come over, come over to my uncle, say hello!
{5200}{5295} And this is Ania's mother? And? | And where is she from?
{5300}{5359} Whose?
{5400}{5446} Neighbor.
{5450}{5521} - So what Mania? Will I receive a guest? | - I will. - Let's go!
{5525}{5571} And you boys take all the cases, | take me there,
{5575}{5671} - Let nothing die. | - The taxi breaks down ... - Oh, come on!
{5675}{5834} The American car broke down, got on the road, couldn't get there.
{5925}{5996} There's a taxi. | See, when he arrived?
{6000}{6071} And you landed? | Can you sit down and?
{6075}{6146} - And how far is it? | - No, no, not far. A few steps.
{6150}{6196} - Then we can go. | - Oh, maybe your legs will hurt.
{6200}{6271} Let's see | what you changed our Kružewniki to.
{6275}{6321} Mania! Put all the children in the car,
{6325}{6422} and we will go with Jasiek.
{6475}{6546} Who do you look like, huh?
{6550}{6571} To whom? To Pawlaków!
{6575}{6646} Listen to Jas, what I have to say to you.
{6650}{6746} - Wait, Master! Probably hungry. | - Mania! ... on occasion ...
{6750}{6846} - Let him say hungry? | - I have a taste for pumpkin with dumplings.
{6850}{6896} On milk ...
{6900}{6946} Oh Kaźmierz! Pumpkin is gone.
{6950}{7021} Pawe³ek, jump to Kokeszków! | Maybe they have one pumpkin left.
{7025}{7071} Chase on one leg!
{7075}{7171} l see. | Far from here to our Krużywniki.
{7175}{7221} And you know who? Who's that? | That's your godfather.
{7225}{7271} And what is she such a big girl?
{7275}{7321} Eight months | she waited for christening and uncle.
{7325}{7371} - Ania, right? | - Yes.
{7375}{7446} You are Ania and I'm John.
{7450}{7556} John, John, John ... | In Polish, Jasiek.
{7575}{7646} Listen to Jasiek and give forgiveness,
{7650}{7746} because you have no John for us, just Jasiek.
{7750}{7905} I have a lot to tell you. | I will start with these most important words ...
{7925}{8039} Oh, be afraid of God, Jasiek! | Finally you are ...
{8075}{8142} ... KaŸmierz
{8150}{8246} Did you swear to the dad | that you would come back to yours?
{8250}{8271} Please, sit down!
{8275}{8321} Gra¿ynka, come on ...
{8325}{8396} Oh, and he returned home after the world wandering.
{8400}{8496} A brick house, basement, not covered with straw ...
{8500}{8571} like our cottage in Kru¿ewniki.
{8575}{8646} A tile of reason ...
{8650}{8721} ... and fire regulations.
{8725}{8796} - Oh, my discoveries!
{8800}{8871} - He did it here in the war. | - Nice there ...
{8875}{8946} And here I live ... and I will die here.
{8950}{9046} Jasiek, see? | So much is left.
{9050}{9096} Pozna³? It's still tatdy.
{9100}{9210} - Do you have a wife? | - And where do I get them?
{9225}{9316} Listen to me, what I will say.
{9325}{9396} I'm sixty one. | ​​I'm 60 years old.
{9400}{9496} I came to say goodbye to you.
{9500}{9636} Oh, Jas, what are you to say goodbye? | You will stretch for another hundred years!
{9700}{9746} I want the earth from you.
{9750}{9846} But the one from Kru¿ewniki who | brought her in a bag.
{9850}{9921} That they may sprinkle my grave in Detroit.
{9925}{10021} Jasko, live here and die here, | because we here.
{10025}{10121} And this land and this house | as well as yours and mine.
{10125}{10246} I feel a pity for our land in Kružewnice.
{10250}{10346} And you know this land? | What do you know about it?
{10350}{10396} Through those lands ...
{10400}{10471} you were the one who had to apply for the code and run to America.
{10475}{10546} Well, not through the land, | and he escaped through Kargule.
{10550}{10571} - Oh Jas, when was that? | - What when was it?
{10575}{10671} - I will never forget Kargul. | - Well, he wasn't so bad.
{10675}{10842} Jaśko, and you remember how our father | a jargon cow found in our field, and?
{10975}{11115} Let my harm come out of you! | Let you die, you!
{11375}{11467} Pawlak, come to the fence!
{11475}{11569} - What is this for me? | - Come on!
{11600}{11677} Because I come too.
{11900}{11967} Have you seen?
{12050}{12121} Oh, Jaśko! | You have already suffered from everything.
{12125}{12246} After all, he wasn't the chestnut, but | our father, his stallion went crazy.
{12250}{12296} Even God turned his face away from him.
{12300}{12392} Oh, not God, not God.
{12775}{12834} Jaœko!
{12850}{12916} Three fingers.
{13025}{13096} Thank you, Lord, | that he showed Kargula with my hand.
{13100}{13171} l swear on everything that has power over me,
{13175}{13221} that I won't blind my way home
{13225}{13346} and come back to earth, lest our bones look for the world.
{13350}{13471} - And the whole Kargul tribe and the field ... | - And the whole Kargul tribe and the field ...
{13475}{13546} Let go, good Lord, all the Egyptian plagues.
{13550}{13596} Just make no mistake about us, Pawlaks ...
{13600}{13646} Just make no mistake about us, Pawlaków ...
{13650}{13746} - Kargul neighbors ... | - Do not experience kargul neighbors.
{13750}{13796} Because we stick to each other ...
{13800}{13896} and we defend our land in law.
{13900}{13996} Because you created it and assigned it to us.
{14000}{14096} Now this is our land. We here | with our neighbor started Poland again.
{14100}{14196} - And he from our side? | - Yes. Here are all your friends.
{14200}{14296} - And she's here. | - Like me.
{14300}{14371} Listen to Jasiek about Noah's Ark,
{14375}{14446} what flowed on rails | through this whole flood.
{14450}{14546} It jerked, whistled and rolled.
{14550}{14646} l day you go, you stand two days.
{14650}{14746} A week has seven days, | a month four weeks.
{14750}{14859} And on the train wagon | forty-eight.
{15425}{15496} Oh, man!
{15500}{15565} Where? Well?
{15575}{15679} E there man. | Must have a local here.
{15900}{15996} Dad, will we get off before | he arrives?
{16000}{16046} Oh, costly fool!
{16050}{16171} Let him get off before grain | for the mare runs out.
{16175}{16296} Where does the holy water come from, | so that paganism would not be in the nation?
{16300}{16421} - Kaźmierz, eat it yourself! | - It must have strength, work is waiting.
{16425}{16496} How are we with my Kacper raiding now,
{16500}{16571} like here and other skies.
{16575}{16621} Here is a paradise for us.
{16625}{16696} Because Kargul, this chain, won't be in charge.
{16700}{16813} Though one war is won for us.
{17500}{17580} Dad, ours are! Our!
{17625}{17696} - Ours? | - Oh.
{17775}{17846} - This is just ordinary cattle. | - Oh, I'm telling you, dad.
{17850}{17921} Oh, Witia, you are crazy with everything, no.
{17925}{17971} - See those pied ones? | - A cow like a cow.
{17975}{18021} It's a familiar cow, daddy.
{18025}{18096} This is not the case all around the world | only in Kružewniki.
{18100}{18196} It's Muska, Kargul. | Kargulas are here!
{18200}{18296} Bandit! I mean, we've found our place.
{18300}{18346} What is he coming? | Call Wicia!
{18350}{18431} - Stand up! | - Unhook!
{18875}{18921} What did they hang their noses so?
{18925}{18996} How they live here, | and live here as well.
{19000}{19071} Swoi? Kargul is the worst enemy of all.
{19075}{19218} Enemy? And the enemy! But his, mine, ours. | Bred in his own blood.
{19225}{19321} - Where else could it be, and? | - Oh, Mania, don't be nervous!
{19325}{19421} We had to look for a new enemy, | how did an old man come by, and?
{19425}{19554} - That wouldn't be God's job. | - Yes, yes, yes ...
{19975}{20021} Wot and they went.
{20025}{20096} - Come on grandma, come on to you first. | - God, you're mine ...
{20100}{20146} You know, it's all yours.
{20150}{20221} Do you take etot home | kagda in the oreuthine hut?
{20225}{20296} I need me no more.
{20300}{20371} I want mine.
{20600}{20696} Mother will give this land! | Mother! We're home.
{20700}{20800} What is this house? | Not even a stove.
{20850}{20945} Bake you cook, and where to sleep?
{20975}{21046} Haven't seen Kargul?
{21050}{21121} Dad, where are we?
{21125}{21221} - Oh globe, can you see? | - Earth gray ...
{21225}{21366} Well, smotri, smotri, old man. | L will rock where spirit can be here.
{21425}{21554} I am a reliable person. | I use more expensive money.
{21675}{21771} - Oh, we're running out of penny. | - I'll do better dad!
{21775}{21888} What are you? Go to the roof, hang up ensigns!
{22100}{22159} Okay?
{22175}{22271} Above, even higher. | Until the end.
{22275}{22371} - What do you see there? | - As if we were on a ship.
{22375}{22446} Stupid? | Where is the sea here?
{22450}{22571} And no one can be seen around and silence like in the desert.
{22575}{22671} Oh daddy, where did we go? | Or maybe it's Poland no more?
{22675}{22740} What? E there!
{22800}{22878} l I have to give birth here?
{23050}{23142} Kargul, come to the fence.
{23150}{23212} What for?
{23225}{23322} Come over ... | as I approach.
{23425}{23500} He came up and what?
{23550}{23596} Now take off your hat ...
{23600}{23678} ... and I took it off.
{23725}{23796} What is this for me?
{23800}{23921} The fact that our wanderings of peoples is over.
{23925}{24021} l needed war to get peace.
{24025}{24096} Now cry!
{24100}{24221} Bar, don't be shy, cry! | L
{24225}{24322} They're all crying anyway. | Stick!
{24525}{24546} And what are you not crying?
{24550}{24668} And this is the last time to come? | Look at the will.
{24700}{24769} Fortunately.
{24850}{24971} - Did you hug Kargul? | - It's no different, Jasiek.
{24975}{25096} - With the same as me then ... | - With the one who now bows to you.
{25100}{25222} lmpossible! | Was that your tattoos oath that he listened to?
{25300}{25375} Oh, let me hold you.
{25525}{25646} KaŸmierz! You what, he said? | Do you want to bruise your older brother?
{25650}{25671} The Godfather?
{25675}{25796} Let go I'm talking, because here somebody's head will fall down. | No paso won!
{25800}{25871} And what are you mixed up, | how two brothers are greeting each other, and?
{25875}{25921} He didn't get much from Jasiek, | I can add.
{25925}{26029} I have been waiting for forty years.
{26075}{26121} - This is ours. | - Your there!
{26125}{26246} It's not why I got my brother back | to lose you for the second time.
{26250}{26321} You Pawlak don't start again, because you have already started once.
{26325}{26396} - I started. | - And I'll finish.
{26400}{26496} And who told you to take a shack for copper?
{26500}{26621} And to you, what kind of bid did you have with three fingers | to cut off our land in Kru¿ewniki, and?
{26625}{26696} You Kaźmierz | cling better to your baby.
{26700}{26771} Oh people, hold me, | because I will kill like a dog.
{26775}{26891} Listen to Jas! | You, Jas! Wait a minute!
{27000}{27046} Oh dumb you, dumb!
{27050}{27121} He was supposed to sit down | until the greeting was over.
{27125}{27237} And we got stuck and the card is being dealt.
{28100}{28175} Wait, Jasiek!
{28200}{28321} I don't want anything from you | just this land of pouches.
{28325}{28421} With you it is pure cauldron. | You feel nothing in Polish.
{28425}{28496} Listen to Jas, what I have to say to you.
{28500}{28619} And if you understand, | then you will say your word ...
{28625}{28721} Kru¿ewnickie, real, from Muæka.
{28725}{28833} God bless you, Angela. | To us, though.
{30200}{30296} - What are you looking at? | - I watch your legs get tangled up.
{30300}{30321} Oh, the teacher missed.
{30325}{30396} That you would know that I would teach you. I just don't want to.
{30400}{30446} - It'll work. I know myself better. | - I saw it.
{30450}{30530} Will you marry her?
{31050}{31175} - Society in the well you're looking for? | - Yes. To dance.
{31300}{31371} Be careful, | because they will hear and come for you ...
{31375}{31396} Who?
{31400}{31463} drowned.
{31500}{31621} They say girls | shouldn't go to the well.
{31625}{31710} They'll like each other and the end.
{31775}{31881} Up close, you've got | three years more.
{31950}{31996} You too.
{32000}{32063} KaŸmierz!
{32075}{32146} Witia, didn't you see your father?
{32150}{32229} No. In the field, sure.
{32275}{32321} You know, Wladek.
{32325}{32446} So much of the world has gone around | so that we can find ourselves again.
{32450}{32471} But that was what you saw.
{32475}{32546} Hey Kaźmirz! I have never had a sincere anger with you.
{32550}{32646} And Jaśko was young when | he crossed my ribs on the ribs.
{32650}{32721} - Stupid there ... | - He stupid our nation out of poverty and reason ...
{32725}{32796} - But it's over now. | - The end.
{32800}{32889} - Between there is not. | - There is not.
{33000}{33071} Everything around you is here. | Take whatever you want.
{33075}{33146} No one will measure the soil with you with a spoon.
{33150}{33221} The landlord, yours is soon giving birth.
{33225}{33346} There is enough milk from Muæka | for us and for you. I have to give it.
{33350}{33396} Wladek, you host without a horse,
{33400}{33446} and my mare survived | from Kru¿ewnik.
{33450}{33521} Until you earn some extra money, I will help!
{33525}{33606} - The landlord! | - The bar!
{34000}{34083} Hey, you! Wait, eh!
{34150}{34258} Let my harm | come out of your side!
{34300}{34383} She went her way, you ...
{34950}{35046} Your brother Jasiek already killed me once.
{35050}{35121} And now you're murdering | are you?
{35125}{35196} I'll take it and I'll take it. | Because you, Kargul, don't care about holiness.
{35200}{35271} And what is this feast, | you scapegoat?
{35275}{35321} Dad, be careful!
{35325}{35371} Copper is a holy thing.
{35375}{35465} - Mines, Dad! | - Dad, faces!
{35550}{35646} - Drive now. | - Then go first.
{35650}{35746} - Your field, show the way! | - Let the guests go first.
{35750}{35835} He thinks I'm afraid I'll be?
{35900}{36002} Remember, | copper is a holy thing.
{36025}{36121} l learn it, or I'll teach you the scythe again.
{36125}{36220} And where do you see here?
{36225}{36296} From here to heaven it's all yours.
{36300}{36371} You want, take.
{36375}{36496} Nobody will measure the earth with your fingers, as we did in Kru¿ewniki.
{36500}{36621} I took what suits me. I won't let it go.
{36625}{36720} Oh, times! | Fools ahead.
{36725}{36819} What? | Wait, I have a scythe!
{36825}{36921} Now your | ram's gargoyle head will order.
{36925}{36971} Stupid orders.
{36975}{37042} You to whom?
{37050}{37118} And to you!
{37175}{37252} You goose goose, you!
{37325}{37393} Stop it!
{37575}{37621} Let your leg not stand on us again.
{37625}{37696} And yours on ours.
{37700}{37796} This is what he swore to his dad. | L will keep it forever.
{37800}{37857} Amen.
{37925}{37996} Hello, come here ...
{38000}{38085} ... oh, look yours.
{38250}{38296} You must move the earth.
{38300}{38396} But how, when she passed out | like good porridge with greaves.
{38400}{38496} Yes, the land without people goes wild.
{38575}{38676} Hello, | give me a baniak with gasoline.
{38925}{38987} Run!
{39150}{39209} SiedŸ!
{39800}{39873} German, German!
{40225}{40296} - Get on! | - Hurry up, Hurry up!
{40300}{40371} - But where? | - To the Pawlak's basement.
{40375}{40421} Just as they are going to kill us, | together.
{40425}{40521} So, five days a man lived | and it started again.
{40525}{40596} Well, now, now ...
{40600}{40663} Come on!
{40750}{40846} Do you see Witia, how | the mulehead Kargul saved us from death?
{40850}{40921} ... fifteen, sixteen, | seventeen ... Count you, Witia.
{40925}{41017} Our schools are too small, daddy.
{41650}{41727} Hello, come to the barn!
{41900}{41968} Dad, here!
{42000}{42075} Mom, into the basement!
{42150}{42221} - They encircle us from all sides. | - Yes, but who?
{42225}{42246} Occupation again.
{42250}{42396} Occupation, occupation. Certainly | at Easter they shoot from a canifloride.
{42400}{42496} It was me | who cleaned our field of mines, Fr.
{42500}{42563} So what?
{43200}{43271} - Can we shoot? | - Why?
{43275}{43389} Raise your hands, | then you'll ask.
{43425}{43496} We have to defend ourselves, don't we? | After all, we Poles?
{43500}{43546} - And who are you? | - Jo Antoni Wieczorek.
{43550}{43596} Jo of Nastyrda. | Jo is born here.
{43600}{43671} - A local. | - And who do you want to defend against, and?
{43675}{43771} No Germany. I tell you, I am Wieczorek. Schulmeister.
{43775}{43821} And ... watch from school.
{43825}{43929} The army, daddy, the army! | The army is coming!
{43950}{43996} - The army is coming! | - What army?
{44000}{44071} - Ours. | - Polish?
{44075}{44146} - And who are they going to? | - Daddy.
{44150}{44221} What time?
{44225}{44321} Our faces heard and think | that Wehrwolf burns with fire and sword.
{44325}{44446} You Kaźmierz started the third war, although the second one was barely over.
{44450}{44496} Ruthenian amazed, | they will end once.
{44500}{44546} Yes, but how many times can you defame?
{44550}{44684} And what are you so worried about? | It was time to get used to it.
{45650}{45746} What did you look at her like a baby bishop?
{45750}{45871} - Oh daddy, but we made those faces. | - You don't bother me.
{45875}{45946} You have to have a good look first if you don't want to forget.
{45950}{46021} - And what do you remember about it? | - And maybe we'll die miserably here.
{46025}{46145} You should have | my words to die.
{46150}{46221} She is a kargul daughter | and you are to hate this whole tribe.
{46225}{46350} I am also looking like this, I hate myself.
{46475}{46593} Oh, Mania, Mania, what can you do to us? Give up!
{46600}{46696} - That's what he came up with. But how? | - And how do you know me?
{46700}{46771} I have never done this in my life. | I have no practice.
{46775}{46846} - Mama where? | - They said the army was going.
{46850}{46976} - You have to go the hen to catch. | - Here you go and wave!
{47225}{47346} Hey, you don't have a doctor | on your hand? Well needed ...
{47350}{47396} Well needed ...
{47400}{47498} - To the wounded? | - No, to the woman.
{47700}{47771} Prr ... Baska ...
{47775}{47856} People, is anyone there?
{48050}{48133} People, open up!
{48375}{48460} Crush, crush, speak ...
{48500}{48621} That you ... devil you ... ... here, die, get lost ...
{48625}{48693} Baśka, well ...
{48900}{48974} Oh, pharmacy, I think?
{49325}{49415} - So what? | - Hands up!
{49425}{49496} - Oh, he thought he was German. | - Hands up because I'm shooting.
{49500}{49596} - What are you stupid? | - Harness to my car, come on!
{49600}{49671} I take my horse, | but I save my life.
{49675}{49764} We have to help each other, no?
{49775}{49821} Where are you from?
{49825}{49871} - Behind Bug. | - Well, luck.
{49875}{49946} - Happiness? Only for whom? | - Ho, ho ... father,
{49950}{49996} Varsovian, I wouldn't keep it under the barrel.
{50000}{50096} - And we from behind Bug are worse, and? | - Oh, we have more under occupation.
{50100}{50121} - And we passed. | - I was in the camp.
{50125}{50171} - For smuggling! | - Yes, but grenades.
{50175}{50327} - And I didn't give any quotas. | - And I once gave a German a face, oh!
{50400}{50496} And we've passed two pacifications.
{50525}{50596} Yeah, and I got out of work.
{50600}{50731} To rob me of the rest. Shoot! Shoot I say!
{50800}{50896} No, father, no ... | You are not my enemy,
{50900}{50946} Just your horse friend. | I need you.
{50950}{51021} - Yes? Then give your hands up! | - No, not full.
{51025}{51114} Not packed? It is full.
{51175}{51271} - You, from behind Bug, have passed theirs too. | - Okay, okay.
{51275}{51346} The army took my horse, | and a specialist must be brought to the settlement.
{51350}{51396} Professional? | Who's he?
{51400}{51471} They told me to bring the miller | to start the mill for the commune.
{51475}{51521} And they gave me a vet. | I am fascinated, what's wrong?
{51525}{51596} - If he sober up, he'll be useful too. | - A veterinarian?
{51600}{51671} Oh man, | you are too
{51675}{51746} I have been looking for a wise hand since dawn, so that she will help me give birth.
{51750}{51846} A woman is distant from me. | Oh, take a bubble with moonshine!
{51850}{51946} You'll get a war horse for it. | Know the Zabuużaków, come on!
{51950}{52095} And now clean up my cab. | Well, we have to help each other, no?
{52375}{52471} - Dad! Daddy, he is! | - He is, he is, he is.
{52475}{52546} Oh, not you! | He's the boy.
{52550}{52621} Ch³opiec? Oh, can't him wait?
{52625}{52671} For what I am | a serious professional.
{52675}{52771} And it was bad with my mother. | Kargul has done everything.
{52775}{52846} She adopted the child.
{52850}{52921} We now have the same strength | as Kargul.
{52925}{52996} Take it, put it out, put it in the pigsty!
{53000}{53046} - Doctor? | - No, trophic, he brought it to Marynia.
{53050}{53121} - He'll be ours together. | - I brought him.
{53125}{53246} - But on my cab. | - Oh ... He's a vet, Fr.
{53250}{53324} I am Kokeszko.
{53475}{53630} And much of the girl's wish is to be a wife of a miller, I am declaring myself.
{53675}{53721} I will keep my word.
{53725}{53821} - You, listen! You're not a veterinarian? | - A miller.
{53825}{53921} I gave you 10 liters of moonshine for you.
{53925}{54042} - Never buy while drunk. | - And what about drinking?
{54075}{54146} What a difference.
{54150}{54196} Where?
{54200}{54280} Shhh ... Your own ...
{54350}{54446} - Mania, where did the bubbles fail? | - Where he put, he stands there.
{54450}{54521} - The priest will come soon. | - In the hallways, look in the wardrobe.
{54525}{54646} - Oh, you see where she crawled. | - Oh, Wieczorekowa, you can't see anything ...
{54650}{54796} Eh, he'll come, he'll come. He knows that, without baptism, it doesn't matter.
{54800}{54888} Cry, cry, bless you.
{55375}{55460} Vitya? Come here!
{55525}{55610} - Closer! | - I came over.
{55625}{55671} Chuchnij!
{55675}{55734} Oh yeah.
{55775}{55796} What are you lurking there, and?
{55800}{55871} Dad, | we'd take that self-play from ...
{55875}{55946} - From Kargul? | - First baptisms here with no music.
{55950}{56021} You will salt your son | and the organ,
{56025}{56163} and for me it is all holiday | must be enough. Close the barrel!
{56275}{56296} What time?
{56300}{56421} - Gelobt sei Jesus Christus. | - Praise be!
{56425}{56571} The German sniffed and it screams. | He got into his grandfather, into his grandfather.
{56600}{56685} Maybe the priest will allow, and?
{56700}{56771} - Where is yours? | - He won't come. Her teeth are swelling.
{56775}{56871} - He can't speak. | - The keeper, what to do to us?
{56875}{56971} - There's no baptism, no baptisms. | - Mr. Pawlak!
{56975}{57115} He'll be godmother, he'll be christening. | The head is working, you'll see.
{57175}{57265} - He went for Jadźko. | - What?
{57325}{57371} Kargul's daughter | my godfather?
{57375}{57446} Oh Kaźmierz! | Before God, all equals.
{57450}{57546} - Better like none. | ​​- What should I do now?
{57550}{57621} - Oh no weirdo! | - And maybe such a spiritual person,
{57625}{57696} God, let it go, send it away?
{57700}{57771} Please priest ...
{57775}{57846} And she is godfather. | What, evil?
{57850}{57946} Yes, here in Gniezno, they would prefer | to Wieczorekowa.
{57950}{58046} To avoid frightening my child.
{58050}{58138} Don't be nervous, Master!
{58200}{58271} Paul, was begehrst | Du von der Kirche Gottes?
{58275}{58357} - Faiths ... | - Faiths ...
{58925}{58971} - Jadźka, go home! | - Mr. Kargul ... - What about you?
{58975}{59046} There was no wedding yet, | and me and Miss Jadźka, father and mother.
{59050}{59121} - So what? -No, an engagement to announce | mine with Miss Jadźka.
{59125}{59222} - What? | - Dad, let's go home!
{59625}{59703} - Jadźka! | - Where ?!
{59800}{59871} Mr. trophy.
{59875}{59921} Your father bought you, this is from Kargula.
{59925}{60003} - Jadźka! | - Where ?!
{60075}{60213} Democracy has come, | and you defend freedom, right?
{60250}{60296} Yes.
{60300}{60361} JadŸka!
{61575}{61696} When the war began, I took my oath, and I wouldn't marry.
{61700}{61796} Do you understand Miss Jadzia? | Will I die and leave the widow woman?
{61800}{61896} - Never! I don't like having debts. | - So what?
{61900}{62012} How, so what? | After the war.
{62025}{62071} Do you know what, Mr. Kokeszko?
{62075}{62146} It is better to continue to become an | honest man.
{62150}{62221} But the two of you, Miss Jadziu. | A two is God's number.
{62225}{62321} This is how people believe us at Gniezno.
{62325}{62418} Witia, where is the division?
{62525}{62571} Our grandmother | will sleep like a queen now.
{62575}{62671} Oh, now you can believe | that at home.
{62675}{62771} Just let this electricity not be, I would be calm.
{62775}{62821} - Oh, mother, well ... | - What, mother, mother.
{62825}{62871} And this is a weed weed, here!
{62875}{62946} Dad bought him for his spirit | for society,
{62950}{62996} and he picked him up | for a private son-in-law.
{63000}{63096} E, would they give it to someone else? | He's not from behind Bug.
{63100}{63171} Although he is from Gniezno, | but in pants.
{63175}{63303} And Kargul wants more trousers | in the family.
{63325}{63371} User?
{63375}{63421} They've thrown it out, and it'll be useful to us.
{63425}{63496} you? Who are you
{63500}{63596} It is known that for two families | one stove is not enough.
{63600}{63696} - What two? | - Wicie, get your work done!
{63700}{63796} - You start a new life with loot, and?
{63800}{63871} - You stupid, you ...
{63875}{63946} Look, peasants!
{63950}{64016} Do you recognize?
{64025}{64071} egg.
{64075}{64121} - Dust. | - I found it on the road.
{64125}{64171} What is this? | He never saw the egg, and?
{64175}{64221} Man, I haven't seen him for a long time, | because I ate chickens.
{64225}{64296} - Take it then! | - Yes, yes, yes. Wey!
{64300}{64346} - Thank you. | - You're welcome.
{64350}{64396} And why are you Kaźmierz | disposing of my egg, and?
{64400}{64446} And how do you know | that it wasn't my hen that endured it?
{64450}{64521} Where from? | And because he wouldn't take your hand.
{64525}{64596} Yes, yes! | Oh, neither am I yours!
{64600}{64721} - You'll get five for me for this one. | ​​- You can make it down the wall yourself!
{64725}{64821} My brother Jasiek took the god's whip in you.
{64825}{64896} You don't remind me of the scythe, | because I now have a rifle.
{64900}{65000} - I have. | - Ah, you cones, you!
{65025}{65087} Konusie?
{65100}{65161} Wait!
{65175}{65273} Now a sickle is enough for you.
{65375}{65433} Here!
{65825}{65871} Were you crazy, man?
{65875}{65979} Where can I get such pots now?
{66100}{66177} New shirts!
{66450}{66575} - Boy! Man! | - Is the night fattening bad?
{66625}{66768} Guys, mills are plundering us. There is a need for strength. Come on come on!
{66775}{66846} Take the kargula!
{66850}{66921} - With a rifle! | - Pawlak is coming?
{66925}{66996} - Two Pawlaks! | - Should I be alone?
{67000}{67109} - Where's Kokeszko? | - Sooner, sooner!
{67375}{67457} Sooner, just quietly.
{67525}{67595} Go first!
{67600}{67646} You can order your woman. | He found the fool.
{67650}{67790} - Times have changed. Go first yourself! | - Hush, because they will hear.
{67975}{68021} Come on, come on!
{68025}{68096} - You agreed. | - Let go!
{68100}{68196} We have to help each other, don't we? | Widow is waiting.
{68200}{68246} Merchandise for merchandise. | Show her first!
{68250}{68321} You can count on my taste.
{68325}{68371} I don't buy a pig in a sack.
{68375}{68471} Mrs. Marysia, this is just ...
{68475}{68545} Hands up!
{68575}{68634} above-!
{68675}{68746} - Where are you from? | - We are from the neighboring commune. From Łysakowice ...
{68750}{68796} - And you? | - Looters!
{68800}{68846} Have we come to plunder?
{68850}{68946} He brought us here. | - You horsehead, you ...
{68950}{68996} - I bought him from you once. | - Oh, the vet.
{69000}{69046} And now I bargain the miller, and he let us.
{69050}{69096} I have a weak character.
{69100}{69171} And they brought me a widow for temptation,
{69175}{69221} that they need a millionaire.
{69225}{69296} But I'll stay with your Jadźka all my life.
{69300}{69371} I would rather die | being alone.
{69375}{69446} It's too late now. | All to the wall!
{69450}{69546} - Me too, your son-in-law? | - Stand up talking!
{69550}{69621} And what are you | catching my son?
{69625}{69671} And what's yours? | Who got him?
{69675}{69753} Boys, stop! Stop!
{69875}{69946} And what do you do, they are fooled? | They have already fled long ago.
{69950}{70032} Where? Hey you stand
{70050}{70096} - Well, we defended the mill. | - You rag,
{70100}{70121} you brought them to us.
{70125}{70221} Mistrzuniu! Tell me what you like.
{70225}{70321} Because widow now a dime a dozen, | and I must win for a miller village.
{70325}{70384} Well ...?
{70525}{70593} Jesus Maria!
{70675}{70746} - Well? | - It's okay.
{70750}{70825} - Is he lying? | - He escaped.
{71050}{71121} God has heard us. | Kargula also has mice.
{71125}{71146} Even more than ours.
{71150}{71246} That his sowing was blight, | and fair. But to us?
{71250}{71371} Kargul doesn't have a mouse in his head. | He made the pass and the UNRRY horse got it.
{71375}{71429} What?
{71450}{71496} Tomorrow is going ...
{71500}{71621} Oh, so bad! | He chased our Jas to America,
{71625}{71696} and now there's no shame | to take a horse from them?
{71700}{71746} He's got a puke!
{71750}{71821} The landlord, | without a cat, there is no life for us.
{71825}{71921} Vitya! You have to go to the fair tomorrow and me without horse ...
{71925}{71996} Pah! ... don't come back without a cat!
{72000}{72071} Here and there is the end | at the very beginning.
{72075}{72171} How could you, good Lord, make a mistake?
{72175}{72296} Saint Joseph, Saint Anthony, all saints in natural colors.
{72300}{72389} Hand work. Who? Who?
{72700}{72771} - Wait a minute! | - With a wave?
{72775}{72846} Ten women's dresses | and patent leather.
{72850}{72960} - I need a cat. | - A cat? Maybe a tiger?
{73325}{73430} Cats, cats | from central Poland, cats!
{73500}{73570} Lord, Lord!
{73600}{73677} Show me those cats!
{73775}{73796} poniemieckie.
{73800}{73907} Something sir! | I'm taking them from central Poland.
{73975}{73996} óowny?
{74000}{74121} In half a day, fifty mice will do the job. | Do you have a home far?
{74125}{74196} I have a bicycle. | You don't have cats.
{74200}{74246} A cat must cost.
{74250}{74371} Lord, I give you two sacks of wheat. | For one hundred and five hundred.
{74375}{74434} Okay.
{74500}{74580} Well, I take it and bike.
{74650}{74721} What, you bike?
{74725}{74846} A German bicycle, | and a cat from the city of Łódź comes from.
{74850}{74943} - All right, take it! | - You see!
{75225}{75321} This UNRRA knows that the wild west is here | and he sends wild horses.
{75325}{75371} You don't have to do such a job |
{75375}{75496} If you break him in the nape of your neck once, | you can plow it with ice and river.
{75500}{75590} - Sure, don't you? | - Dad!
{75975}{76071} Let the rope go, | Kargul! Let the rope go ...
{76075}{76121} Why such a madman?
{76125}{76221} After all, this calm | is better than St. Paul's mare.
{76225}{76321} And what are you giving me advice? | Give him when he is so smart!
{76325}{76441} And dam. That you would know that I will give. Way.
{76475}{76521} - Hey, what's the matter with you? | - Citizen Kokeszko,
{76525}{76621} leave the rope alone! Okay? | You need a horse with a head.
{76625}{76705} Eee, stupid madman ...
{76975}{77076} I think he had a merry-go-round before the war!
{77325}{77421} Cymbale, you! You ofermo! Dog couple!
{77425}{77496} - Shoot him! | - No, maybe he's still alive ...
{77500}{77561} Stallion!
{77850}{77943} - Stop, Witia! | - I'll catch him.
{79425}{79498} Oh motherfucker ...
{80125}{80221} - People, he'll kill him! | - He'll pay.
{80225}{80293} The neck is turning.
{80350}{80421} Oh Kaźmierz, | Witia is coming up!
{80425}{80510} Can't it be? On cat
{80525}{80613} Hello, I bow.
{80750}{80796} Mr. Pawlak, Mr. Pawlak!
{80800}{80896} If it wasn't for Witia, we'd have the worst | shaft from all over UNRRY.
{80900}{80963} Go wrong!
{80975}{81071} You rode your bike, | and you return on someone else's horse, and?
{81075}{81146} But it's a colt | just for our filly.
{81150}{81252} Mares, stallions! | I'll give you a damn!
{82075}{82146} - You are praying again, are you? Paint! | - You can't look at a horse?
{82150}{82221} What is this? | Pawlaki are to be worse than Karguli?
{82225}{82296} Everything on the other side of the fence | is your enemy!
{82300}{82401} - Cat tynia? | - Tywie. Cat? Kitty Kitty.
{82600}{82693} Give me the cat away because I'll slaughter like a dog!
{82700}{82821} And do I keep your cat on a string? He came and it is.
{82825}{82871} Yes, because you got twenty milk plates in his plates!
{82875}{82971} I am allowed. | My milk and my plates.
{82975}{83106} Hello, hold me, | because I can't tear this thief away!
{83125}{83195} Give me a brush!
{83400}{83471} - And what are you surprised? | - Well, there is no rhyme.
{83475}{83580} Hi! | Something Pawlak scribbled around, huh?
{83625}{83700} Oh, are you like that?
{83725}{83796} Are you against the regained territories | and for the senate?
{83800}{83871} Are you crazy about me, man?
{83875}{83946} I am not for the Senate, but against Kargul.
{83950}{84021} - Is that your Polish sign? | - Pawlak's sign.
{84025}{84146} peasants! We set up here like bees, like ants.
{84150}{84196} What are you? Are you doing a diversion? How is a German?
{84200}{84246} The cat is mine!
{84250}{84371} Oh! It is because of your cat that there should be no unity in the nation, right?
{84375}{84471} Okay ... | I need this cat.
{84475}{84496} So³tysie!
{84500}{84571} Do not do this to me, that it would be against people's democracy,
{84575}{84621} because I don't have time for this. | The land is fallow.
{84625}{84671} You say so Pawlak ...
{84675}{84746} You talk like you have | a list for that cat.
{84750}{84846} And when I get this cat | from Kargul, what?
{84850}{84871} And I won't give this cat back.
{84875}{84946} - What? Won't you give me away? | - Let the authority judge.
{84950}{85046} Oh, it's a monument, I mean ... | This cat came from central Poland.
{85050}{85121} I myself paid two quintals of wheat for him. I will not mention the bicycle anymore.
{85125}{85196} Okay, okay. | Let the cat choose its own.
{85200}{85296} - He prefers milk. | - You have two cows and I have a rifle.
{85300}{85421} Take it easy, citizens! | Take it easy, citizens! Pioneers!
{85425}{85521} I will give you a fair exit. Listen to the citizens!
{85525}{85621} Kargul will give you a quintal of wheat | and a bicycle wheel.
{85625}{85646} But I ...
{85650}{85746} Wait! But the cat will be at Kargul's three days and three days at your place ...
{85750}{85846} And on Sundays and holidays | my mice will go and the end.
{85850}{85921} Hey you son! | Maybe he could catch his mice the same way ?!
{85925}{86021} - The cat is mine, do you understand? | - I decided ...
{86025}{86180} - Hello, show me a Frenchman! | - Look! l everything so bitten!
{86200}{86271} Oh, a pomegranate ... | What day is it today?
{86275}{86296} - Friday. | - Friday.
{86300}{86401} Hey, call a cat, he's doing with us today.
{86550}{86687} Oh Kaźmierz, the cat was taken prisoner ... | He was grazed on a string ...
{86700}{86852} Kargul will not break my contract and force the cat to collaborate!
{87200}{87246} - War again? | - But for the cat.
{87250}{87396} - There isn't even a cat fur left. | - Put the zipper in because it flew out.
{87400}{87471} This is the fourth war in my life. | Including two worldly.
{87475}{87571} l goes better ... | Kargul started a scythe war with us,
{87575}{87664} and I'll end up with dust.
{88275}{88379} Witia, | what are you not so fed up with?
{88400}{88536} A hundred times he said you were to hate | this kargul tribe.
{88600}{88719} Well ... and n
{88725}{88796} - She's not for you. | - But dad ...
{88800}{88921} If I look at it, it's good, | and I am dreaming at night,
{88925}{89025} I hate her so much that fear.
{89100}{89197} Well, come on! | From there.
{89275}{89348} Pawlak! Pawlak!
{89375}{89496} You see? And you say, just put | your head in, then you will translate it all.
{89500}{89574} Alem denied it.
{89625}{89721} Wicket! The wicket would be useful, | Pawlak. Shame.
{89725}{89810} Here, sign the record.
{89825}{89946} Kokeszko needs | two witnesses that he is a bachelor,
{89950}{90021} that he falls into marriage | and that he can stand on the rug, o ...
{90025}{90096} Glory to God, because | I can't take care of this Jadźka anymore!
{90100}{90121} - Dad, Kargul! | - Where?
{90125}{90196} Here, he also signed.
{90200}{90321} What are you crazy about, Pawlak? | Sign it, I'll be human!
{90325}{90396} Remember, because of you | the girl will not be a mother,
{90400}{90471} and the village will lose a millionaire. | You are such a citizen?
{90475}{90546} You don't teach me citizenship! | I lost your cat because of your policy.
{90550}{90596} - What's up, cat ... | - And cat.
{90600}{90671} - l two quintals of wheat. | - I won't mention the bicycle.
{90675}{90771} - But you found the treasure, right? | - The treasure?
{90775}{90921} And the treasure, yes ... They found the treasure | and silence as after the death of the organist.
{90925}{90996} Oh, he talked to you. | And you can see that there is no uselessness.
{91000}{91096} And there were no such kerosene. And so | in one day and with us and with them he will thwart.
{91100}{91196} Hello, take the blow and hit, | because you'll be beaten yourself!
{91200}{91346} Yeah! Find a conveyor belt, put your hands in your pocket and a beer.
{91350}{91396} And the job, brother, will fly ...
{91400}{91446} - That's the belt. | - Where?
{91450}{91545} - At Karguli. | - At Karguli.
{91550}{91596} So how? Will you start the engine?
{91600}{91721} E, they came up with these Duratian machines, because they had no strength in their hands.
{91725}{91837} As you prefer. Pawlak, you'll sign the note.
{91900}{91946} - I don't have time, he once said. | - A novel from the poviat.
{91950}{91996} You go to court, brother.
{92000}{92071} - You, what's wrong or something? | - Yes. Monday,
{92075}{92146} ten o'clock, | room number five '' D ''.
{92150}{92196} - '' D ''? | - About the cat.
{92200}{92321} - The cat was mine and died from my hand. | - And Kargul gave you a quintal of wheat,
{92325}{92396} - That I won't mention the bicycle wheel anymore? | - Eh ... there!
{92400}{92496} That's what he is accusing you of. | It'll be all over the county
{92500}{92617} first affair. | In my bunch!
{92625}{92696} Food, set up dinner, | lead the cows!
{92700}{92746} Sooner!
{92750}{92796} Straight from court | for rings I'll jump ...
{92800}{92893} With a red eye it will be ...
{92975}{93046} Napoi³? Whip, come on!
{93050}{93146} And you don't freak me out there. | Threshing to the bottom.
{93150}{93196} - Here, take it! | - Oh mother!
{93200}{93321} Well, the court is a court, and justice must be on our side.
{93325}{93396} Take more!
{93400}{93550} - Look after the kid! | - Go with God, go with God!
{94150}{94271} Do you see how it goes? It's fast. | Not like a flail.
{94300}{94438} No. But you'll blow, | as my father finds out, where did you get the belt from.
{94500}{94631} - Eh ... I'm not afraid of the old man. | - I'm not mine either.
{94650}{94721} In your barn, you also | need to thresh the grain.
{94725}{94771} But when?
{94775}{94871} How is it when? | How do you appeal.
{94875}{94950} Hail, help you?
{95000}{95080} No, I can handle it.
{95250}{95362} - If you want, I'll help you. | - You don't have to.
{95375}{95449} Well, I'll help you.
{95600}{95748} You see Mania, a bad boy. | He did more, as I told him.
{95800}{95896} Przewia³. With the devil he threw, forgive God's sin or what?
{95900}{95977} - Jadźka! | - Witia!
{96275}{96345} It's just a pomorek ...
{96375}{96455} Kargul, come here!
{96700}{96807} - Uh, you raised a son. | - And you daughter.
{97075}{97197} If I give you, then you | Russian month will remember, you!
{97250}{97271} Leave!
{97275}{97415} is difficult. You have to break with patriotism and give her away for Kokeszka.
{97475}{97571} What are you getting mad, man? That's a favor for this damned Kaźmierz.
{97575}{97596} It is not enough | that he won the first case in court.
{97600}{97671} - Well, I'll go around his hand once. | - And when is the wedding?
{97675}{97738} - Come on!
{97875}{97946} Mom, but why wander around the world, | like a stallion behind a fence like a dream ...
{97950}{98046} - Oh no weirdo, no weirdo. | - Behind the fence your enemy, not the stallion.
{98050}{98121} And here is the father and he gives you the order.
{98125}{98196} Kobyła is to be admitted, | otherwise I will cut my mouth.
{98200}{98246} If you want me to come back with a filly, | I need a rifle.
{98250}{98321} You speak wisely. | Mania, give me the rifle!
{98325}{98446} W³aŸ! I will disarm myself, and I won't regret you.
{98450}{98564} - Just watch out for the castle, because it's flying out. | - I know.
{98575}{98671} The rifle gave it, and how would Kargule start the war?
{98675}{98721} You are not afraid.
{98725}{98856} I still have two | grenades in Christmas clothing.
{99300}{99396} - What are you? | - Give me the horse, thief!
{99400}{99471} - Was he stupid? | - And where did he hide the stallion?
{99475}{99546} They stole? These, these!
{99550}{99621} If I throw you a grenade, | right away
{99625}{99696} You will sing well, | as soon as I lead you away.
{99700}{99771} l will be ashamed, | because without the trousers popped out.
{99775}{99821} Talk where the horse is!
{99825}{99846} - What am I, a fairy? | - But a horse thief!
{99850}{99964} She heard it? | They stole our neighbor's stallion.
{99975}{100082} And that was pretty, American. | Too bad.
{100100}{100224} Wladek, Jadźka is also not there! | Somewhere she disappeared, well ...
{100250}{100369} Oh! And our Wicia | has not returned for the fifth day ...
{100400}{100473} Give me clothes!
{101625}{101684} Vitya!
{102175}{102246} - Witia, | - Well?
{102300}{102385} - what will happen now?
{102525}{102596} - What is that supposed to be? | - So what? It's already daytime.
{102600}{102706} - So what? | - Daddy will hit again.
{102725}{102821} - He beat you? | - No, but he'll beat me now.
{102825}{102944} Don't cry! | From today nobody will beat you anymore.
{102975}{103046} You will stay with me.
{103050}{103140} How am I coming home now?
{103150}{103263} - And where did you hear him, and? | - Here somewhere.
{103400}{103521} Leave the horse! You have nothing to show at home. We will go on our own.
{103525}{103571} Where is my shirt? | Maybe they donate to me.
{103575}{103646} They donate or not, and you won't be bad with me.
{103650}{103771} There are few empty houses standing ... | I'll take it and it's over.
{103775}{103846} - Too bad for the horse. | - But not your son's.
{103850}{103896} - This is where your daughter is! | - I have three bullets.
{103900}{103971} What do you want | to replace my son's father?
{103975}{104112} - Let go ... - Wait, you bastard ... | The end has come ...
{104150}{104221} Hello, come on!
{104225}{104346} - Take the shirt! Fathers are coming. | - Will you marry me?
{104350}{104459} Quickly over the rocks. | What? Oh, she found the time.
{104475}{104564} - Hello! | - Jadźka! JadŸka!
{104625}{104696} Where is he?
{104700}{104793} Hello, stay! Stand me, stand me!
{104825}{104939} Wait, you'll come home, you'll remember!
{104950}{105071} - you have got a colt, and? | - And you a stallion.
{105075}{105171} Why don't I bring you a doctor?
{105175}{105271} I don't need a doctor, just an obedient son.
{105275}{105396} Listen to the landlord, what will I say. | You should foal the filly.
{105400}{105544} Hello richly married. And tame Paweł from his childhood with his rifle.
{105550}{105659} As long as Kargul is alive. | Remember, Kaźmierz!
{105675}{105740} Oh mother ...
{105900}{105966} Mom, mama!
{106025}{106158} You are not afraid! Kargul, my mother's end has come.
{106200}{106271} For each of us will come. | This is not wise.
{106275}{106371} I am not asking you here for a philosopher, but a translator.
{106375}{106421} To help my mother | in my last service.
{106425}{106446} The priest only speaks German.
{106450}{106521} She is more likely to expect the devil than me.
{106525}{106621} Don't choose her now. And we will have the opportunity to count again.
{106625}{106696} I prefer to tell you how to listen to you.
{106700}{106746} - Leave it! | - And the hell they know you,
{106750}{106796} how will you pay me for this favor?
{106800}{106930} One funeral is enough for this week. | Come on, come on!
{107225}{107271} - The landlord ...
{107275}{107346} Wann wer daine letz Beichte?
{107350}{107421} Last time in confession, when was she?
{107425}{107521} Er hat gasagt that zwei months ...
{107525}{107596} no Moneten ... fruher ...
{107600}{107696} And doesn't he cheat? | Ten words on one word.
{107700}{107796} And how do I know? | Maybe their speech is so long.
{107800}{107921} Oh, let my mother get purgatory through this German confession.
{107925}{108028} May God please have mercy and allow me.
{108575}{108671} Resting forever | give her, Lord.
{108675}{108787} And eternal light, let it shine.
{109000}{109069} I have a widow ...
{109125}{109221} The first funeral here, | and you about mortality.
{109225}{109363} For the soul of holy memory | Eleonora, let us say: '' Our Father ...
{111625}{111721} - Where's Jadźka? | - Don't ask for anything!
{111725}{111871} We will not return to you as long as your anger is in a pile.
{112700}{112788} Kargul, come to the fence!
{112875}{112921} And what for?
{112925}{113015} Come here, because I come too.
{113025}{113115} Now, do what I do.
{113150}{113253} I took it off. | I just don't know why.
{113275}{113396} On the occasion | that the end is upon our stupidity.
{113400}{113490} Well, I could do that, Kaźmierz.
{113525}{113596} Cry Stupid! Don't be ashamed!
{113600}{113671} Because, like a real boy, he cries, it must be a holiday.
{113675}{113749} Oh must, must ...
{113850}{113912} You see?
{114250}{114321} Christ Lord! People! | Something must have happened here.
{114325}{114346} The police!
{114350}{114435} The police! And then ...
{114500}{114596} - And what are you here? | - I thought I'd be needed here and ...
{114600}{114671} Kargul sent you here to let his brother lose him again.
{114675}{114771} Come with God, Bajdor! Jasiek, listen to me! And then ... Jasiek!
{114775}{114871} You left your father's oath, | leave me too.
{114875}{115033} What do you want to make me a godfather | for kargul children? Never!
{115600}{115680} Hey! Hi! Cholera...
{116625}{116702} quiet! Come on!
{118100}{118243} And yes
{119225}{119305} Jasiek, you have earth!
{119425}{119471} Earth.
{119475}{119544} Good land?
{119875}{119946} Good Lord ...
{119950}{120021} You don't need better.
{120025}{120132} Jasiek, fear God! | You are finally here.

Don't worry. They ran towards town.
So how about some fun now... with me?

Over there!
Stop! You trapped me!
Forgive me! They paid me!
Stop!
Gennosuke, prepare to die!
Stop!
Gennosuke! Where's your samurai pride?
Stop!
Have you no shame, you coward?
To hell with name and pride!
I'll run and never stop!
Gennosuke Yuuki, samurai of the Enshu Kakegawa clan, killed Counselor Kenmotsu Yamaoka and fled to his home province.
Kenmotsu's only daughter, Misa, along with her fiancé, Daizaburo Torio, immediately set off in pursuit.
Gundayu Katori, master swordsman of the clan, and four of his best men were sent along to assist them.
The year was 1 857.
That horse.
Looks like Gennosuke's.
Is that your horse?
Master!
Master, some samurai are here!
We didn't steal that horse, sir.
We found it tied to our fence this morning. Finders keepers, right?
Do you run this stable?
Toragoro Litomi at your service.
They call me Packhorse Tora.
You seem to have some pull here.
That's for sure! He runs both the horses and the gambling!
Shut up!
If you have time to gab, go get feed for the horses!
I want to ask a favor, man to man.
Lend us your men to find the owner of that horse.
Sir, they're very busy.
We'll pay ten ryo for your help.
Ten ryo!
Master Katori.
Should we really ask these thugs for help?
The classic texts say vendettas differ from ordinary combat.
One can accept anybody's help if need be.
I agree.
Whatever it takes to catch that monster!
Sir, I accept your offer. Please, come inside.
Thank you.
Gennosuke said, "To hell with name and pride.
I'll run and never stop."
How could it be? He used to be so brave.
You're still far better than I am.
If only I could win one in three, or at least one in five.
Our ambitions are different.
We differ less in ability than in tenacity.
Tenacity?
You will soon become the clan counselor's son-in-law, but I'm a nobody in the clan.
The sword is my only road out of obscurity.
This isn't a time of war. You can't rise by your sword alone.
Times have changed since Commodore
Perry's fleet arrived.
No matter how much the leadership resists, they must reform.
I will rise.
I'll become a full-fledged retainer.
- Even!
- Odd!
Even!
Last round! There aren't enough odds!
Any takers for odd? Come on.
Hold on.
Sir, how much is this worth?
I don't care. Appraise it as you wish.
Two bu?
Two bu on odd.
Evens and odds are balanced.
Any more bets? I hear none. Game!
Odd!
Thank you very much.
Hey!
Let's play again.
This game is under the table.
If my boss finds out, I'll lose a finger.
Who gives a damn about your finger?
Play again or give us half the money!
Go to hell!
Secret games are a bad idea.
You're prey to bandits like us!
- Son of a bitch!
- Go to hell!
Stop.
Leave it! It's not worth a fight!
I'll rip this two-bit loser apart!
Fool! We can't afford trouble before getting to the mountain.
- Those were prospectors, right?
- What of it?
There must be gold on that mountain.
Obviously, if they're prospectors.
Anyway, I'll take my two bu and go now.
- Is this the only entrance?
- Yeah.
- Is there a back door?
- No.
- What's in back?
- A small room where I sleep.
I'll take that.
I'd like to rest for a while.
Bring some food and sake.
And one more thing.
Don't tell anyone I'm here.
There's only one door, in the front, and no back door.
The ronin is staying in this room.
It has one window, which opens onto this alley.
- How high is the ceiling?
- Eight feet, I think.
How wide is the alley?
Wide enough for three men.
We must fight him in the alley.
Bring your men.
But what about the other five ryo?
After the fight.
Do well and you'll get an extra ryo.
Yes, sir.
The ceiling is low.
Use your short swords.
I brought some more sake.
It's cold in the rainy season.
Old man, why are you trembling?
Is the rainy season that cold?
Gennosuke, prepare to die!
Stay away from me!
Stop!
Gennosuke, at least die like a samurai!
How can I? This is butchery!
Stop!
He's wounded! Five ryo to whoever catches him!
No sign of him?
He can't have escaped. Keep looking.
Wait a minute!
Have you seen a wounded ronin?
Yeah, he ran like crazy in that direction.
I'm so annoyed. We almost had him.
We'd have had him if you hadn't hesitated.
You two used to be friends.
It seems you don't want to kill him after all.
At that moment, he was like a cornered beast.
He shouted out,
"This is butchery!"
Daizaburo, have you forgotten that he killed my father?
I will never forget that day.
Take back your petition.
You three ringleaders are confined to quarters until further notice.
What?
Underlings like you claim you want reform, but you're really after power.
Underlings are still samurai of the clan.
In other clans, rank doesn't matter when...
Silence! Other clans are not my concern.
As long as I'm counselor, I won't stand for it.
Return to your quarters!
We refuse!
Next you'll order us to commit harakiri.
We won't wait around to lose our lives.
We'll take yours instead.
What?
That was our original plan anyway.
Help!
Father!
When I recall that day,
I see Gennosuke as just a beast to be drawn and quartered.
Butchery is what he deserves.
But he's a samurai. He must die like one.
Daizaburo, don't forget that when we're married, you'll inherit a fortune of 3,500 koku.
How can you fail to share my hatred for our enemy?
I find that most vexing.
Master Katori, any word where Gennosuke went?
"Packhorse" has his men searching, combing every nook and cranny.
He won't escape that easily.
Hardly anyone ever comes here.
Take a nap if you like.
There's a bounty on my head. Don't you want it?
A measly bounty like that? Who cares?
I'm aiming for a mountain of riches!
A mountain?
Take a look at this.
Gold dust?
I was bathing a horse in the river when a prospector's body floated by.
He had this pouch on him.
There's been gold in Koshu for a long time, so it's no surprise he found gold up there.
So you'll prospect on the mountain?
A man can't spend his entire life scrubbing horses in a dump like this.
But Mount Shirane belongs to the shogunate.
The penalty for poaching there is decapitation.
A man can't do great things if he's afraid.
How about it? Let's team up and strike it rich together.
Me?
The thing is, the man carrying this pouch was sliced open from shoulder to waist.
There are clearly some very dangerous people upriver after that gold.
So you're hiding me because you need a bodyguard.
If you put it that way -
Just leave it all to me.
Let's sneak away when things quiet down.
If you'll be running for the rest of your life, you'll need some coin to keep you going.
Running for the rest of my life?
Any luck?
Nah.
Nothing?
But we'll find some soon, right?
There's no gold around here.
Let's go further up.
Quick, hide!
We've got some nasty company.
Those patrols come by once every three months at most.
We'll be safe once they pass.
Maybe we should keep them in sight.
We don't want to bump into them unexpectedly.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, let's go.
Whose hut is that?
- That's a logger's rest lodge.
- Is it in use now?
No, logging here ended last year.
- But somebody's there.
- No, that's imposs...
Stumbling already? It's still early.
Wait. Somebody's coming.
What are you doing here?
You're panning for gold, aren't you?
You can be executed for that!
- I know.
- What?
You dare resist?
Officers have been killed. That means trouble.
- Should we hightail it out of here?
- No.
They'll have to come from Kofu.
It'll take them 10 to 15 days.
How much can we pan in two weeks?
Who cares about that?
I want the gold he's got in that hut.
You mean you want to steal it?
He's only human. He'll let his guard down sometime.
We can't leave this place empty-handed.
You're right.
All right, let's cook up a plan.
Dear, shouldn't we leave soon?
That officer won't make it back alive.
But if he does, they'll come for us.
Won't it arouse suspicion if he doesn't return?
They might send a search party... but I'll kill them too, if need be.
So we're staying?
Yes, until ordered otherwise.
But if the shogunate finds out, our clan is finished.
Not if we keep our mouths shut.
You and I will be executed, and that will be the end of that.
Are you afraid?
No. I'm ready for anything.
The clan will never abandon us.
Cheer up. I'll go take care of the bodies.
Hurry!
Bring him in.
Lay him down gently.
Take off these wet clothes.
That's an officer, isn't it?
He came floating down the river.
He coughed up the water, so he'll probably survive.
Take off his clothes and take him in the other room.
Careful!
Boss, there are officers up there after all.
- Was that one wounded?
- No.
He couldn't have just fallen into the river. There must be a reason.
How can we go up with officials there?
Afraid of the law now? What happened to your fighting spirit?
Well, I'll be.
You seem to want that gold more than I do!
My future depends on it.
We're leaving early in the morning. Get ready.
I'm going to take a bath.
Now I guess he's in charge.
Set him down carefully.
Will he make it?
He's breathing again. We have to warm him up.
Shall I help?
You're a guest. We couldn't ask that of you.
They say the best thing to warm a man is a woman's skin.
It must be providence that I happened to be here.
Leave him to me. You all can wait outside.
If you say so, ma'am.
Let's go, everyone.
Where am I?
How odd. He took a sudden turn for the worse.
He's dead.
Why the towel?
His face was dirty. I wiped it clean.
Really?
How kind of you.
You'll pretend you saw nothing, won't you?
Let me show my thanks.
You can thank me by dropping the hairpin first.
It's tough carrying a body downhill.
Bad luck for your men.
They won't be carrying it.
They'll go by raft to Litomi.
By raft? How long will that take?
Only half a day to go down.
But walking back makes the round-trip two days.
Half a day before they find out. We'll have to hurry.
- What's that?
- Nothing.
We leave early in the morning.
Please prepare lots of rice balls.
You're really going upriver?
I'm telling you the truth.
You'll be killed if you go.
I know.
A deadly warrior will be waiting.
How did you know?
Let me ask you:
What's your connection to him?
I can't tell you that, even if you kill me.
Then I won't ask.
But I'll tell you this much:
I will have that gold, even if I have to kill him to get it.
Wait!
Don't go. I can't let you go to your death.
There are already people trying to kill me as we speak.
Never in my life have I been able to get what I wanted.
Once I tried, and I was chased out of my clan.
Now there's nowhere under heaven for me to rest.
But this time...
I will get what I want.
I will take it with these hands!
Dear... the dayflowers are blossoming.
See how beautiful they are?
You were so fond of flowers back home.
As long as we're here, I have no time for human concerns.
Don't forget our mission.
How could I possibly forget?
That's why I wanted some consolation.
This gold will save our clan.
Isn't that consolation enough?
I understand that.
That's why I came with you.
You've helped me collect three times as much gold as I would have alone.
The counselor is very pleased.
When this work is finished, you'll receive a stipend of 200 koku.
For generations, men of my family have been impoverished squires.
At last I will become a retainer.
That alone is worth it.
How many have you killed so far?
Any who dared approach.
Nobody has returned alive.
What? It's a couple!
We're ready to face punishment if caught.
I protect my gold from wolves like you... with this.
This wolf has very sharp teeth.
We'll meet again.
Boss, who on earth are they?
Does it matter?
He poaches government gold and kills anyone who draws near.
That's all you need to know.
I won't steal a man's hard-earned gold.
My original plan was to pan by myself.
Let's make some tools and work together.
I don't have that kind of time.
I'm a cornered and wounded beast.
I can't afford to live by my conscience.
My opponent is a strong warrior, it's true.
But it's up to me whether I defeat him and take his gold, or am defeated by him and left to die a dog's death in the hills.
All right.
If you insist, there's nothing I can say.
I'm risking my life in this battle too.
When I get my share, first I'll build a stable.
Then I'll build a house as big as a palace!
I'll line up my 100 horses and have my men scrub them like crazy!
Jurota!
Taka!
Don't move or she's dead!
Face it! There's nothing you can do!
If you want to save her, hand over the gold.
Scum!
Don't make us laugh! You're the one poaching gold.
You can always get more gold, but your wife has just one life.
Hurry up and bring us the gold!
Hurry up.
I won't give it to you!
I won't.
What?
I won't give you the gold.
Jurota!
- What a bastard!
- Very well.
If the gold is that important to you, we'll just treat ourselves to your wife!
That's okay with you, right?
Hear that, Minokichi?
His gold is more important than his wife!
She's all yours. Do whatever you want!
Jurota, kill me!
Just kill me!
Wait!
What are you doing here?
This is atrocious, no matter how much money's at stake!
To hell with you! We'll kill her if you come closer.
Idiot! I'm not her husband.
Think those threats will work with me?
Arrogant son of a bitch!
Come on.
Worthless wretch, is your gold that important?
More important than your wife's life?
This mountain is a dwelling for beasts.
I'll turn into a wolf too before long... and take my share of that almighty gold.
Taka.
Welcome. Will you be staying the night?
No, we're looking for somebody.
The men carrying the dead officer told us there was a tall ronin staying here, traveling with a small-time thug.
Those two left early yesterday morning.
They left?
Where did they go?
From the way they were dressed,
I'd guess up the mountain.
Up the mountain?
People sometimes go to poach gold, even though they risk execution.
How long will you be staying?
Misa!
The paths are very steep. Why not rest first?
Nonsense! If you're tired, you can rest.
Master Katori, let's go.
Boss, there's a lot of gold in this sand.
What's the point of dredging the river?
Boss... you really think you're becoming a beast?
When you saved that woman last night,
I knew you could never be a beast.
Women and gold are two different things.
I made it clear to her I'd be back for the gold.
A real beast wouldn't give warning.
Those three prospectors last night - now they were beasts.
I don't think you could be like them.
Could you?
Well...
I can do anything I set out to do, but unfortunately I don't have the fangs.
I've been thinking if you're not going to take that couple's gold,
I'll just stay here and pan.
I'll take that gold, all right.
Forget about this stupid panning.
Taka!
What are you doing?
You're my wife.
When a man risks his life for his work, his wife must do the same.
Can't you do that?
Am I still your wife after what happened last night?
Don't talk back to me. Get to work.
Worthless wretch, is your gold that important?
More important than your wife's life?
Are you afraid of me?
No.
Do whatever you want.
Why are you here?
I want to become a beast like you.
I can't stand living for a mission anymore.
It's easier to be a beast, roaming the hills.
Living for a mission?
Are you and your husband here on somebody's orders?
He's a retainer in a clan.
That means that gold will belong to the clan.
Yes.
And what will you get for your sacrifice?
My husband will be promoted to full samurai, with a 200-koku stipend.
What's his rank now?
He's a squire without a stipend.
I see.
It's all becoming clear.
I too had to suffer the lonely frustration of being a nobody.
I understand only too well how he feels.
I too might have accepted such a task.
Actually, I did.
Indeed, I did something far more stupid.
It's raining hard. Let's rest here for a while.
Don't go to any trouble.
Seems you need an umbrella even inside.
I hear you've been studying hard in this leaky room.
Times are changing rapidly.
It's reassuring that we have progressive samurai like you in the clan.
So you approve of our plans for reform?
Things seem to be leaning in that direction.
Yokoi of the Higo clan and Yoshida of the Tosa clan were both promoted to high position despite humble beginnings, and their reforms have been very successful.
But Counselor Yamaoka dislikes our reform plan.
He can't dislike it forever.
We mustn't allow him to.
Idle, high-ranking samurai can't carry out the reforms.
It must fall to foot soldiers like yourselves.
Look at Sanai Hashimoto of Echizen.
He was barely 20 years old, making a stipend of only 25 koku, and yet he skillfully reformed a clan worth over 320,000 koku.
We took the vice-counselor's hint:
If we toppled Counselor Yamaoka, our reform plan would be accepted.
And so you killed the counselor?
Yes. We were badly paid minions.
We believed it was the only way to rise.
And then?
The result was a cruel disappointment.
Counselor!
I, Gennosuke Yuuki, have slain Counselor Yamaoka.
I know.
Now is the time for bold reforms!
You fool!
Who will accept your plan after you killed the counselor?
But...
Did I ever tell you to kill him?
And did I ever say you would be promoted if you did?
Not in so many words, but it was implied.
Tell that to the tribunal.
Tribunal?
Your coconspirators have been killed.
Only you remain.
So I'm being shut out.
You will become the next counselor... the clan will be reformed... and leadership handed over to new people... but I won't be one of them!
Traitor on the loose!
Find him!
They won't find you here. Now go.
Come. Let me take you back.
I'm a fugitive, and you're the wife of a samurai about to complete his mission.
You cannot choose the life of a beast.
You have nothing to fear.
You've done nothing wrong.
I won't force you to go back to him, but if you want to take the path of the beast, you must tell him so first.
Taka... prepare to meet your death.
You're going to...
Kill you.
You would have let me die for gold.
Why kill me now?
Do you have any last words?
Taka!
Boss, to what do I owe the pleasure of your company?
- I knew you'd come around!
- You object?
No, not at all. You're welcome to help if you want.
Come up here.
If you won't...
I'll come down.
Are you going?
The forward thrust was your specialty in the dojo, but this time it cost you your life.
Misa's not here yet.
I'll cut you down but let her finish you off.
Prepare yourself!
That was close!
Why did you save me?
That wasn't my plan. I just came to warn you.
Warn me?
Men from my clan will arrive by sundown.
To retrieve the gold?
Yes, and to wipe out everyone on this mountain.
Wipe them out?
Do they know we're here?
The woman at the inn told them.
That's right.
Once they arrive, I can't help you escape.
Understood.
Besides, my pursuers have arrived. I can't stay here.
I'm leaving the mountain.
Perhaps one day we'll meet again.
My name is Jurota Yamane.
For obvious reasons I can't tell you my clan.
I am Gennosuke Yuuki, a ronin from Enshu.
- Why don't you rest?
- I don't need your pity.
Don't make special allowances because I'm a woman.
You can't take another step.
I'll wait here.
Please look for Master Katori.
I can't leave you alone.
I'll be all right.
I no longer fear anything.
Go now! Look for him!
Stay right here. Understand?
Boss, just listen to me.
It would be a waste to leave now.
Unfortunately, my pursuers are drawing near.
But the strongest one is dead.
What's there to worry about?
The one who worries me most is still out there.
What about you? Coming with me or not?
I'm not leaving here empty-handed.
If you insist.
But life is worth more than gold.
Gennosuke!
Daizaburo! Master Katori is dead!
Then I'll kill you myself!
Draw!
Why do you insist on throwing your life away?
It's a matter of pride. Now fight!
Gennosuke, why did you save me?
Never mind that. Go help her.
Misa.
I doubt she'll be so eager to kill you now.
No, nothing's changed.
Look at her.
The true daughter of a samurai.
She's been violated, yet she still remembers her appearance.
I'm leaving the mountain.
Look after those two.
Counselor!
There are three prospectors in the hills, five targets in all.
They must all die. Spread the net wide.
- We'll split into three groups.
- What about Osen?
She'll meet us at the hut as planned.
Good.
Wait!
If you go now, you'll be killed.
So that road is ambushed.
You know about them?
If you hurry, you can escape through that cedar grove.
Why are you helping me?
I don't know what's going to happen to me.
Weren't you working for the clan?
Too many people have seen my face.
Everybody involved is going to be killed... including that couple.
What? Yamane and his wife?
I'm trembling with fear. Please take me with you.
Please wait for me!
Wait! Please wait!
Osen, you betrayed us!
Stop!
Counselor, we lost the ronin!
In that case, sound the signal!
Wait a second. Are you still set on killing Master Yuuki?
Isn't this a good opportunity to call off the vendetta?
Not as long as he's alive. That's the samurai way.
But she can't even go home after what happened!
So what are you going to do?
Go back without her after taking your revenge?
Come on! What is there to think about?
You're her fiancé, for God's sake!
Or maybe you think she's damaged goods?
Shut up!
We'll decide everything once the vendetta's been fulfilled.
This "vendetta" is starting to sound like an excuse.
Just listen to me!
Prepare yourself!
There's something I must do.
I beg you, just wait until I've done it!
- You knew you would run into us?
- Yes.
What do you need to do?
Come with me.
You'll see.
Yamane!
Why did you come back? They've already...
Arrived?
I see.
Has he taken them to the gold? Where is it?
We have to stop him.
Once they have the gold, they'll kill you both to cover up the theft!
That can't be.
The clan would kill us?
That's how clans work. I'm proof of that.
Hurry! Your husband's in danger.
You've served well through many years of hardship.
I thank you on behalf of the entire clan.
Now burn down the hut and return home.
I'll go ahead and prepare your welcome.
Hand over that gold! Let's have no trouble!
Counselor, leave this to me.
Those men are ronin hired by your counselor to kill you.
You and your wife are witnesses.
He plans to kill you to cover it up.
If you kill anyone, kill him!
Jurota!
- Counselor, why?
- Kill him!
Jurota!
Yamane, drop your sword and let him go... or your wife dies!
Let the counselor go!
Let him go or your wife dies!
This is how you reward them?
Kill him!
Give me that gold!
Wait! We're not connected at all. Why kill me?
No, we are connected... because I'll see you in hell!
Daizaburo... our battle is all that remains.
What? Had a change of heart?
I'm not returning to the clan.
Misa says she can't go back either.
We can live anywhere but in the shadow of Kakegawa Castle.
But I'm the man who killed her father.
No matter where you live, her hatred for me won't change.
Misa is over there.

yesterday afternoon.
What time did you leave home?
It must have been 4:00 or 4:30.
I went to look for work.
- Where did you go?
- To look for work.
I haven't worked in ages,
and my family can't make ends meet.
I had an appointment at 5:00
with two priests
who had a letter
of recommendation for me.
They were waiting for me
when I got there.
You bastard!
Even miracles don't take that long!
Come on, let's go.
Well, are you coming?
I feel really mean today.
I could make all of Rome's lovers cry.
You're all talk.
I want to see you in action.
Come on, Chief. Get a move on!
Go get that purse.
Move it!
Hurry up!
- Where are they?
Over there. Go on.
I'll take care of him if necessary.
I'll punch him and knock him down.
What the hell!
Two pears!
She could have brought some spaghetti, the bitch!
It's every man for himself!
Hey, Chief!
You doing a rain dance?
You look like Robinson Crusoe.
Get in here!
Come and join civilization.
That lying almanac could have warned us!
Go ahead and laugh, idiot.
Who's gonna come make love here now?
Nino, are you going senile?
Eon't you know love knows no limits?
My little rain-soaked love
It stopped already.
It was just a passing cloud.
Let's go, Canti'.
Come on, Chief, let's go.
Mushrooms are popping up.
Come on.
So you wanted to swipe my radio, you dirty scumbag!
First I'll break your neck, then I'll take you to the police.
I didn't see you guys.
I thought someone forgot the radio.
I didn't see you.
I thought someone had thrown it out, or maybe lost it.
How was I supposed to know?
I didn't see you!
But I saw you, you little thief.
I'm taking you to the police.
Not the police.
Eon't do that to me, mister.
I swear I won't do it again.
I'm a starving orphan.
Miss, tell him to let me go.
Tell him to let me go.
You can't do this to me.
I'm just a kid!
You can't ruin me!
I'm just a kid!
Kill this thief, Giova'.
He interrupted our lovemaking.
Thief!
Just to save your mother the grief, get out of here. Beat it.
That dirty bitch!
You stink worse than a sheep!
Eirty peasant.
Eirty, smelly peasant!
Hey, Canti', what's this?
Almost the year 2000 and still getting pushed around?
I thought you were gonna kick his ass!
You're a good-for-nothing.
You should be ashamed.
Laugh it up, bastards!
I'll get even, you'll see!
I'll show you who Canticchia is!
Hey, you bastards!
Show yourselves!
Hand over the purse!
You can't hide from me!
What do they think?
That I was born yesterday?
Nino!
Sindaco!
Show yourselves!
Those rotten -
Blugippe! Succhia!
Where'd he come from?
Those dirty bastards!
It was three against one, damn them!
The three of them were partners.
The oldest brother, the priest's friend,
took to me right away.
So did the other two.
- So you found a job.
- And a good one at that.
A really busy place,
open even at night.
How'd you end up in the Parco Paolino
coming from the Viale Marconi?
I walked all the way.
I didn't have money for the bus.
I crossed a bridge
and came to the park.
Tell me everything you saw there:
Who was there, what they were doing,
and what you did.
Me? Nothing.
I just walked through,
like everyone does. I was tired.
I didn't see much.
- Be more exact. Take your time.
I want every detail,
no matter how insignificant.
I think I saw a woman.
But she was far away.
I didn't really pay attention to her.
I saw some guys too.
Didn't you see a soldier?
He had to be there.
A soldier?
Why a soldier?
I didn't see him.
I've got other things on my mind.
I didn't see any soldier.
Officer, I really want to work.
You've got to believe me.
I swear on my mother's grave.
Well, Bustelli, long time no see.
Just as well.
One less scare for me, and one less worry for you.
Why this renewed interest in my affairs?
Eon't you know I've quit stealing?
Don't worry.
We know all about it.
I'm sure you don't mind seeing me
after two years.
I don't have a beef with anyone.
I paid my debts, and now
I don't owe anybody anything.
Especially the police.
We know you don't steal anymore.
You've come up in the world.
You've got a woman now.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
She's a good girl.
Good for you.
You've had
a hard time of it until now.
In court 17 times,
and over three years in prison.
Now at 30 you've settled down.
That's old age for you.
It gets us all in the end.
This time you're in big trouble.
You're implicated
in the murder of a prostitute.
Officer, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I'll be the judge of that.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
Where did you go? Who did you see?
I got together with my girlfriend.
We met at the race track.
We have to sneak around,
because her parents are against it.
You must really be in love.
You're always early.
There's no shame in being in love.
Give me a piece of candy and I'll give you a kiss.
- Your new car is really nice.
- You like it?
Sorry I can't take you for a ride.
Too much to do.
I thought we were going for a ride.
What do you have to do?
See Esperia?
- Yes. Eon't be upset.
You know I'm breaking up with her.
I got all dressed up.
I thought we'd go someplace.
Should I just go home?
Eon't go home.
- What else can I do?
- Wait an hour or so.
- Where?
- The newsstand at San Paolo.
Here.
Buy a magazine to read while you wait for me.
Be good and I'll take you somewhere nice later.
- Eon't be long.
- San Paolo in an hour and a half.
Enough, you hear?
I've had enough!
- I'm fed up.
- Give me a break.
I'm tired, and it's all his fault, that leech!
I slaved away my whole life so I'd have a crust of bread in my old age.
You brought him here, and you can get rid of him!
You don't know Eonna Anita!
You'd like to have it all, but the money is mine too, and I'll give it to whom I please!
Is this welcome party all for me?
- So you're back.
- Very kind of you.
You're finally here.
Take your stuff and get out.
Haven't you done enough?
You made her sell the apartment and ate up the five million from the store, and now you've bought a new car with the money this idiot gave you!
Enough!
Eon't worry, Eonna Anita.
I know it's time for me to go.
- You do, do you?
- I'm fed up with living here.
Fed up, eh?
Why don't you get out, you bastard!
You know... when one pope dies, another takes his place.
Where do you think you're going?
Eon't even think about it.
Let him go!
If you don't like it, you can clear out, you old hag!
That's a good one!
You'll die covered with lice.
They'll feast on your rotten bones!
You deserve it, after all you put my poor father through!
I swear I'll kill you!
I'm not afraid of you!
I brought you into this world, and I'll take you out of it!
I don't care if you are my mother!
Come on if you dare!
You take me for that woman you blinded with the hot coals?
- They're at it again.
- Always the same thing.
Is there no respect anymore even between mother and daughter?
Put that thing down!
You think because I'm old you can walk all over me!
All you think about is squeezing money out of people, sucking 'em dry!
I don't want to end up like you!
Money-grubber!
That bastard ruined you and dragged us all down in the mud!
We gave you everything.
We fed you. You lived like a lord!
Money, nice clothes!
Come here!
Come see what this filthy beggar's got in here!
Look here!
Look at the clothes he bought with the sweat of our brow!
With our blood!
I should burn them!
Get out!
You're through living like a lord!
Get out and go back to your old rags!
You should thank God for holding me back.
Two more words and I'd have killed her.
Let's go see Maria first.
She still owes me for two weeks.
I'll show her if she doesn't pay up.
Then we'll go to Soraya's.
She owes us her usual fee.
And Clara still owes us 30,000.
We've got to hurry.
I've got things to do.
I don't care!
You're staying right here with me.
What, are you keeping tabs on me?
I've got friends to see.
Eo your friends feed you?
Forget it. You'll do as I say.
Esperia, you want me to kill you?
My mother and father and little brother are inside.
Please, don't let them know
I work the streets.
We don't care.
Just pay up, and make it quick.
- Can't you come tomorrow?
- Eon't start that again.
Come on, get the money.
We're in a hurry.
- Okay, but just keep quiet.
- Fine.
Please, make yourselves at home.
Bastard!
Here, Esperia.
Now I'm only two weeks behind.
From the factory to the consumer.
Fresh from the seller.
Here, take this.
Eamn your old mother, the hag!
Soraya!
Califfo, get over here!
Califfo, I'm so glad you bought yourself that car.
I want everyone to envy you.
Who is it?
It's Esperia. Open up.
Go away. I don't have a penny.
Soraya, don't be such a baby.
Come on, open up.
I said leave. I don't have a penny.
I'm sleeping.
You want me to break the door down? Open up!
I said I don't have it.
Can't you get it through your head?
There's no use yelling.
I'll show you yelling!
I'll break this door down! Open up!
I told you, I don't have any money.
What's the point of yelling like that?
Afraid this useless ninny won't make it one day without his allowance?
You tired of living or what?
This useless ninny is my business, you hear?
Now you can put your money in the ninny's hand.
All of it, down to the last penny!
I swear on my mother's grave!
I don't even have money to put food on the table.
You've got to believe me!
I'm used to your whining, and I'm not falling for it.
Take something else.
Want my radio? My blankets?
Take something?
This house if full of junk!
What could you possibly give me?
The fleas are eating you alive!
Take the radio. It works.
- What's this little orphan's name?
- Angelo.
No, not the dog!
Leave him out of this!
What would you do with the poor creature?
He was born right here.
When you pay up, you'll get him back.
Eon't worry - we won't eat him.
Hurry up and get us our money.
Let's go, Esperia.
The sooner you give us our money, the sooner you get the dog back.
You happy now?
Now you belong to a gentleman.
Esperia, save me some time and go on home.
Home to that witch?
Come on. You can take care of your business some other time.
What?
Stop wasting my time.
I've got lots to do. Go on home.
What?
Eo you think I pay you for your good looks?
You'll take me where I say and do as I say, or else!
Listen, I do as I please.
If you don't like it, find yourself another slave.
Either you take me where I want to go, or you can forget where I live, and this time it's for good!
I'm not going back there!
Eon't worry - you won't see me again!
Fine!
You're not worth it anyway!
Then we're agreed -
I won't wait around for you!
See you around!
What are you doing, you bastard?
We have nothing more to discuss.
We're through.
Nothing more to discuss?
I'll make you throw up all the sweets you ate at my expense, you rotten -
Okay.
You took your girlfriend home,
then walked back through the park.
It's like I told you.
I saw some people,
but I wasn't paying attention.
There was a woman in the distance,
and some guys.
But I don't remember them.
I wouldn't recognize them.
So you didn't do or see
or hear anything.
Not a thing.
All I did yesterday
was take a nice, long walk.
Eamn her!
Now what am I gonna do?
Relax.
Have a seat.
Are you going to sit down?
- Okay, Officer.
- What's your name?
- Cosentino, Teodoro.
- Parents?
Giuseppe and Beppina Gigliotti.
Feroleto Antico, province of Catanzaro.
September 15, 1940.
What regiment are you in
at Cecchignola?
Thirteenth artillery, fourth company.
Were you in the Parco Paolino
last night?
Me? No, Officer.
What do you mean, no?
Three or four people saw you there.
Okay, I was there, but I was just passing through.
That's what I asked.
Try to pay attention.
You can't forget anything here.
Several witnesses
saw you in the park.
They all say you were sitting
on a bench by yourself.
What motive
could you have for lying?
I was just passing through.
I hardly even remember it.
Okay, then where
were you before that?
Where were you coming from?
Rome.
I had been to the movies.
I was walking back, and the sun was still out.
I amused myself by watching the cars and all the people getting off the streetcars.
There were so many children and pretty girls.
Let us praise the God of Abraham
You created the mighty
among the moon and stars
Strong men
And beautiful women
Let us praise the God of Abraham
Hey, come on over here!
When I got to the park
it was already dark.
I was dead tired,
so I rested on a bench.
I understand, Cosentino.
Now try to remember-
who was in the park?
No one. Just me.
God, I was sleepy.
And when you're sleepy, what do you do?
You lie down.
And when you lie down, what happens?
You fall asleep.
Okay.
Listen, Cosentino,
I know exactly what happened.
I know you slept on that bench
for an hour and a half.
When you woke up,
who else was in the park?
What did you see?
- I didn't see anything in the park.
I ran into a man outside the park.
I remember him
because he was wearing clogs,
and he was running.
He had blond hair.
He had something under his jacket.
Some kind of package.
What a mug!
What?
I didn't like the way he looked.
He gave me a dirty look.
Could you recognize him now?
Sure I could.
He gave me the creeps.
This is all useless information.
We don't care about that.
You're the one who was seen
running through the Parco Paolino.
There aren't many low-lifes
who go around in clogs.
Besides, the soldier recognized you
from the lineup.
So were you there or not?
Sure I was.
Any law against that?
Now we're getting somewhere.
Where were you coming from?
Why were you in such a hurry?
You were coming
from down by the river,
where that woman was killed.
I don't know.
I'm always roaming around.
How can I remember everywhere I've been?
Let me refresh your memory.
You were running, and you had
something hidden under your jacket.
Some kind of package.
What was it?
A present for my girlfriend.
What kind of present?
A cat. A kitten.
Okay, let's say it was a cat.
But where were you coming from?
I can't remember.
It's been a few days.
You don't remember.
That soldier was right.
You are a strange one.
Okay, let's see if you get
your memory back.
Think it over.
You have all the time in the world.
For your own sake.
Now I remember clearly.
I'll tell you everything.
I always go wandering at night.
I get off work at the club at 6:30.
I have nothing to do, so I just wander around.
I just walk around.
The EUR building,
the amusement park,
the pyramid,
and around Monteverde.
The other night
I found myself at the Parco Paolino.
A kid walked by, all by himself.
But he didn't hang around.
He followed the path and left.
In the distance I saw a man.
He was hiding behind a bush.
I don't know what he was doing.
I didn't get a good look at him.
I think it was a young man,
with bleached-blond hair.
I came to the edge of the park.
A soldier was asleep
on a park bench, all alone.
There was another man further along,
minding his own business.
Then I saw two kids I know.
Sometimes they come to play pinball
at the club where I work.
Yeah, I saw them.
I know their faces well.
They were talking.
I think that man
was waiting for them.
The two boys started talking to him.
Then the three of them left together.
They walked by the woman.
What do you want from me?
I don't know anything about her!
I saw those three hanging around her.
She must have gone with them.
You have to believe me!
So you got a good look at them.
You'd be able to recognize them.
Sure, they're regulars at the club.
And I know where they live.
Where?
Via Portuense, in the new developments.
What are their names?
The light-haired one is Francolicchio, and the dark-haired one is Pipito.
How can you say we did it?
Yes, we saw that woman, but we didn't talk to her.
We didn't even get a good look at her.
I wouldn't lie, if I were you.
How can you say
you didn't go near her?
We didn't.
You and your friend were seen
hanging around that woman.
What woman?
What were you doing?
Francolicchio and I had to scrape together 2,000 lire.
- What for?
- We needed it for a meal.
You're confusing me.
What's this about a meal?
Start over.
I have to understand.
Francolicchio and I meet up with two girls every day at 4:00 at Villa Sciarra.
They work nearby.
When they get off, they have a bite at Villa Sciarra.
What?
Eon't you know she who eats alone chokes on her food?
You look really hungry.
I bet you didn't even say grace first.
So what?
I'll say it for them.
We brought something for you too, since you're always starving.
Who, us?
Here's some jam.
And a roll for each of you.
Hand over the jam.
- Put some jam on mine.
- Go on, spread it on.
You're making a real mess!
It won't come off.
You're such good girls.
Even my mother isn't this good to me.
This jam is delicious.
Another sandwich like this and I'll marry you.
I'm thirsty.
Wanna get a drink at the water fountain?
They're so big.
Will they survive?
Sure, until someone decides to eat them.
Milli, you like this place?
A friend of mine's getting married Sunday.
Lucky her!
When are you getting married?
Me, get married?
Why? Eon't you want to?
Sure, but not now.
When? When you're 80?
You think it's so easy getting married?
What's the big deal?
You go to church and you get married.
Hey, would you two marry me?
Why don't we all get married?
If I got married, my wife would have to make me two pounds of potatoes with meat sauce every day.
Man, are those potatoes good!
That's nothing. It's easy to make potatoes in meat sauce.
I'd have her make gnocchi.
No main dish - just gnocchi.
Let me tell you how love is born
In case you don't know
I'll kiss you softly
and lightly brush your lips
I'll stand so close to you
My shoe!
Eomenica!
Mariella!
Come on up, but be quiet on the stairs!
Good afternoon.
Well, aren't you coming in?
Eon't just stand there.
The door.
I've been waiting for ages.
Since 2:30.
I was about to leave.
Who are these boys?
Friends of ours.
Francolicchio and Pipito.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
What are you doing?
I want you to hear a good record.
Eon't insist, Milli. I can't.
Come on, please.
No, really, I can't.
Come on, please.
Okay. It's in my room.
Eid you see how good-Iooking she is?
What a looker!
How old is she?
- Twenty.
- Can't be. She's 17, like me.
- You're 16.
- Well, I'm almost 17.
Listen to this record.
It's really good.
Of course it's good.
That's my song.
Let me tell you how love is born
In case you don't know
I'll kiss you softly
and lightly brush your lips
I'll stand so close to you
That's how, without a sound
love is born
In case you don't know
Never
Never again
Just like a butterfly
Are you engaged?
Us, engaged?
What are you waiting for?
Go on, dance.
I'll put on some good dance music.
Wanna dance?
I don't know how.
Eance with him.
Wanna dance?
Come on, dance with me.
Are you shy or what?
We just don't know how.
Forget about them.
Let's you and me dance.
Too bad.
If I'd known you were bringing friends,
I would have fixed something.
We could do it tomorrow.
We could be here at 4:00, when we get off work.
4:00 is perfect.
My mother goes out at 3:00 and doesn't come back until 8:00.
We'll have loads of time.
What are we gonna make?
- Gnocchi.
- And potatoes with meat sauce.
Sure, gnocchi and potatoes.
But you have to bring the food.
My mother doesn't leave me any money.
Of course we'll bring it.
You guys bring the food, and we'll cook.
I'll write down the ingredients for you.
Okay.
Four pounds of potatoes... six ounces tomato paste...
Four pounds of potatoes, six ounces of tomato paste, six ounces of ground beef and a bottle of wine.
We'll need at least 2,000 lire.
- So what?
- So it's a big deal.
- We'll get it somehow.
- Where? How?
We just have to find it.
Soldiers are lucky.
All they do is sleep.
You should show some respect.
Eon't you know who he is?
Who is he?
Eummy.
He's the Unknown Soldier!
I'm gonna stuff myself tomorrow.
My belly will be out to here.
Would you have a comb?
Eamn, I left mine at home.
Here, I have one.
- Would you like an American cigarette?
- Thanks.
How come you're not with your girlfriends?
We just walked them home.
Good for you.
So now you're alone.
That's right, all alone.
Eon't you ever talk, blondie?
Cat got your tongue?
What should I say?
Your friend is shy.
Want to take a little walk with me?
Let's go, Pipito.
We've got things to do.
Wait, Francoli'.
We won't do anything with him.
We'll take his lighter.
Eid you see it? It's gold.
He keeps it in his raincoat.
Leave me alone.
Come on, don't worry.
We won't do anything with him.
How else are we gonna get the money?
We'll look like jerks tomorrow.
Come on!
- What's your name, wild boy?
- Francolicchio.
What did you say?
Francolicchio.
What a cute name.
Where do people come up with them?
Is that a real name?
What about you, you little animal?
I've got a name, you know.
It's Pipito.
Look who I've ended up with!
- Come on.
- Aren't you coming?
- It's sandy. I'll slip.
- Come on. We'll give you a hand.
- What, are you doing a striptease?
- I don't want to get dirty.
Come on.
Hold my coat and wait here.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
I didn't do anything!
Of course not.
If you were innocent,
why did you run away?
It's all because of that lighter.
Then what happened?
Go on. What happened?
What happened?
You know as well as I do.
Pass the ball over here.
What do you want?
Over here!
What do you want?
The cops are here to arrest you.
They're at your house.
What are you talking about?
They want to throw you in jail.
Eid they go to my house too?
Francolicchio, run!
My God!
I can't go any further.
Come on.
We can't let 'em catch us.
They're not gonna catch me.
I won't let 'em.
Francoli', come back!
I'm scared!
What are you doing?
Francoli', don't run away.
Stay away from the middle!
What am I gonna do?
I can't swim!
I'm scared!
Where am I gonna go, Francoli'?
Eon't go off without me!
I can't swim!
I can't swim!
Eon't run away, you coward!
Coward!
You have to help us.
Perhaps you've left out
some crucial detail.
Try to remember.
I don't even know
what she looked like.
It was dark.
I couldn't see a thing.
Besides, she was far away.
Then I went home.
It was chilly.
Eamn, it's cold!
Where are you going in those clogs?
Aren't you cold?
My clogs?
I always wear them.
I work in my clogs.
It's become a habit.
- Nice habit.
Where are you from?
- I'm from Friuli.
That's what I thought.
What are you doing in the park?
- I don't know where to go.
I don't know anyone.
Now you've met someone important - me!
I had a friend from Friuli.
She was a really good girl.
Wait here. I'll go first.
I had a friend from Friuli.
A really good girl.
And she was shrewd.
Girls from the north get more respect.
Everyone respected and admired her.
But I know why that is with you northerners.
Why?
You talk so well.
It's that beautiful accent.
I can't get enough of it.
Say something for me.
What do you want me to say?
I don't talk much.
You're not shy, are you?
Me, shy? I'm no kid.
She wrote me last Christmas.
She's quit working the streets, and she's gonna open a bar.
But she didn't include a return address, so I couldn't write back.
Maybe she thinks I'm dead.
You out of work?
- No, I've got a job.
Who dresses you like this?
You're a strange one, you know.
Hey, you got the money?
- Of course I've got it!
Calm down.
I'm short of breath.
I can't climb those steps for nothing.
I always meet the most desperate guys.
First they act like big shots.
But when it's time to pull out the 1,000 lire...
Climbing up and down these steps leaves me short of breath.
And since they know I'm a soft touch, all the low-lifes come to me.
The other night one of them started crying on me.
You've got me all wrong.
I don't cry with hookers.
Let's go down this way.
Come on.
Come on over here.
Eon't be afraid.
I come here all the time.
Set your purse down.
You're not gonna hold on to it, are you?
Why should I set it down?
Eoes it bother you?
Let go!
Let go of my purse!
Help!
Help!
Stop yelling!
Be quiet. Eon't yell.
What do you want from me?
I didn't do anything!
Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
Natalino!
She was a whore!
She was a whore!
What did I do?
What did I do wrong?
And the Grim Reaper of Giulia Street
raises her scythe once again...
Mitsuki, don't cry.
He's our only son.
He's just a boy.
Remember, Mitsuki, you haven't lost a son, you've won a daugther.
My only daugter, and I hope the boy will be a good husband to her.
I'm sure he will.
Dry your tears.
And when will the lovely
Soon-a be married?
I don't know, but I'm in no particular hurry, thank you.
I hear rumors about you and Il-woo.
That would be like falling in love with a computer, almost.
Excuse me.
I must be going.
Oh, must you?
We were expecting you for lunch.
Another time.
Il-woo, I'm afraid I've been rater nasty to you.
You couldn't be.
I do have a lot of research still to do, tought.
Te familiar apology of te dedicated scienthist.
But you have to draw te line somewere, you know.
Your father was equally dedicated, but he died of overwork.
Neverteless, I must go.
Excuse me.
He's going to be as famous as is father was.
Why do scienthists act as tough the only important work in the world is what they're up to?
All he ever talks to me about... is is stupid work.
And I must say I don't get alf of it.
I think he makes it up on is own.
But he doesn't know I'm not always impressed by scienthists anyway.
I think that boy's going to go crazy, and very soon.
Soona, don't be unkind.
Il-woo's very talented.
One of these days you're going to see
Il-woo at te head of his profession.
He's a wonderfully gifted lad.
Why must you always stand up for him like that?
Your father's decided to like Il-woo, just in case
- He becomes one of the family later.
- Oh, mother.
- Shall we go eat?
- Yes, let's.
Good idea.
I wonder why little Ico didn't come?
Oh, well, you know how children are.
He's forgetful, all right.
All boys are.
But he wanted to show us that little surprise he had for us.
He will.
What is it?
I don't know.
My skin, it's hitching so.
Hum?
What the...
Well, this is one hell of a way to start a honeymoon.
- What got into you two?
- I don't know.
This light started to shine on us and we just started to hitch all over.
- You started to hitch?
- From over there.
- I think I know what's going on.
- Well, what?
- Come on out.
- Who are you talking to?
Come out of there, Ico!
- Well, I'll be...
- Ico, What a surprise.
What have you got behind your back, young man?
- It's nothing.
- Here, give that to me.
- What is it?
- Just a toy.
Hey, you two are going to be late.
You'd better hurry.
You're right. Let's go.
Bye.
Monster.
Have fun.
Come on, Ico.
- Where'd you get that, as if I didn't know?
- In your lab, as if you didn't know.
Didn't your mother ever teach you not to shoplift?
Sure, but it was my surprise wedding gift.
Well, quite a surprise.
Don't you realize they almost scratched temselves to death?
Yeah, but you gotta admit it was kinda funny.
Yes, Ico, I guess it was.
My boy, that ligth ray is experimental.
That's What I thougt it was, Il-woo, so I experimented.
Now you can put in your notebook that it works perfectly on newlyweds.
Thank you, Einstein, but I was serious.
You mustn't play around.
We've found out that the ligth ray causes severe hitcing.
But there can be side effects.
Understand?
We've been investigating it.
I'll bet you never realized you could harm your sister and her new husband.
So, from now on, just leave things where you find them, all right?
All right.
All right.
Over there.
- There.
- Now, come here.
Look, you can play with these instead.
Hey, those are terrific.
I must've dozed.
Boy, I'm really tired tonigth.
You can sleep afterwards.
You're not going to be a nagging wife, now, are you, my dear?
I bore you already.
Looks like our marriage is doomed.
No, that happens wenever I get married.
I get tense.
You were smiling.
And, really, I don't know ow you can be tense and smile all at one time.
It's easy at weddings.
Especially when marrying the world's loveliest girl.
Let's not talk politics now.
Now, sweeheart...
If that subject doesn't interest you, this might.
That's just my father at the control center.
I'm sure he thinks he's very funny.
- Yes, sir?
- This is headquarters, son.
Do you need me, sir?
That's right, and immediately,
I'm afraid.
Reconnaissance job, my boy.
A rocket is being readied.
What is it all about, sir?
There seems to be... some kind of nuclear test somewere in te Middle East.
We want a monitor on it.
We'll need you here within an hour.
Very well, sir.
Please get someone else, can't you?
He's supposed to be here tonight.
I'm sorry, dear. It's a pity.
He's te only one who can handle it.
It'll last two days.
We'll get him a two-week vacation when he returns, all right?
I guess so.
There's apparently no choice.
Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two,
one, zero l'am now over the target area.
Good. fire retro-stabilizers and commence reconnaissance.
Would you come here, sir?
I can't get trough to te capsule.
Something's gone wrong with the radio.
Capsule, capsule, come in, capsule.
Hello?
Come in, please.
Control tower, come in, please come in.
- Come in, capsule. Capsule...
- Oh, please, can't you do anything?
We're doing all we can, dear.
Capsule, capsule...
Here is the latest news bulletin
reports from korea's rocket control center indicate
that after a perfect takeoff and a flawless entry into orbit,
our rocket number 7-x,
at present on a routine reconnaissance flight,
has developed some radio trouble
this, however, is not causing too much worry
and the experts are in hopes of clearing it ap momentarily
Capsule, capsule, capsule, come in.
Come in, please. Capsule, come in.
Capsule, come in.
What do you think is the matter with him?
Where is he?
If it's only someting wrong with is radio, don't worry too much.
He'll have little difficulty landing the craft.
Te only problem will be that we won't know where.
He migth even land in the ocean.
We'll do all we can.
Control tower, do you read me?
Over
Control tower, come in, please.
Reading you loud and clear, capsule.
Go ahead, capsule.
Capsule, we read you.
Where've you been all this time?
Listen.
I'm so glad he got through.
Prepare rocket for landing.
Use manual de-orbiting.
Position yourself with the rear stabilizers.
Time retro-rockets for landing zone two.
Roger, re-entry at landing zone two.
Very unusual, an earthquake in that area.
An earthquake?
I thought they were just in Japan.
Not true, Ico.
In any case, we do have a large earth movement here.
Sir, there's someting a bit unusual going on here.
Would you take a look, please?
Sir, we have triangalated...
the epicenter of the earthquake.
The epicenter is shifting.
It's moving rapidly in a straight line.
How?
And if we extend this line in the direction of movement,
it points directly to the heart of Korea. we have no choice but to call an alert.
Get me H-Two.
Capsule, come in!
This is capsule.
Land your craft immediately.
Change perspective for zone 10.
Oh, look! There!
He's coming down.
He made it. It's all right.
Let's go.
A perfect landing.
- That's te best one yet, I think.
- Yes, it was.
We'd better get over there.
B Post, B Post, this is 6-M.
This is 6-M.
The capsule is on te ground.
The landing was successful.
Welcome. Welcome.
- Good landing.
- Congratulations.
Oh, darling.
I'm here, too.
I think you were just wonderful.
Te eartquake's moving, sir.
I thought so.
In what direction?
- To te norteast.
- Well, now what?
It looks like everyone is agreed on one important point, gentlemen, and that is that this earthquake, or earth movement, is defying every natural law that man knows.
It seems to me you're exaggerating. this is nothing more than a tremor.
I don't agree with you.
We ave an earth movement.
We don't know how it started, and we don't know how to stop it.
I hope, gentlemen, you will allow me a word.
I admit that my point of view is strictly military.
Consequently,
I believe in having cards on the table.
The moment for teorizing, I think, is over now.
We're positive of one thing only.
There's an earthquake heading towards the center of our country.
That's why we're here.
And when this heartquake gets here, it's going to bring disaster.
That is, unless we can get ourselves ready for it.
Well, there you have it, as clear as day.
Now, What are we going to do about it?
A clear statement.
However, I greatly fear that science cannot help.
We're as mystified as everybody.
But we cannot just sit and wait.
Now, we must start in preparing.
At least we have a few hours' time to try to minimize te danger, and the damage that we know are bound to occur soon.
We must declare a state of emergency and martial law.
I'm sure you're right, General.
So we'll begin all preparations and be ready for trouble, but I think it better that we call no alert until we're sure te earthquake will it.
- This came trough just now, sir.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, the United Nations as just announced that they will help us.
An expert team of scientists as been ordered to come to Korea.
They sould be here within a few hours.
It's Hwangae.
According to the board, the heartquake is now hitting close to te Hwangae province.
There's no time for speaches.
Well, it's beginning to look like you were right, General.
I autorize you to impose martial law immediately.
This is an emergency announcement.
this is an emergency announcement.
An earthqaake is imminent in this area.
Stop whatever you are doing and return home.
Martial law has been declared.
Return to your homes at once.
I repeat, return to your homes at once.
listen to your radio for further instructions.
- An earthqake will be hitting this area.
- An earthquake.
We'd better go.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency announcement.
An earthqaake is expected in this area.
Do not panic repeat, do not panic.
Mother, I'm so scared.
I know. Just don't forget your father.
He'll find something.
- There. Do you see it?
- Another degree. More.
Down one, and across...
About five.
Hurry! Hurry up!
What could that thing have been?
What does it want?
Where'll it it next?
It migth stop before it gets any closer.
That would be very pleasant, but don't count on it.
You know, this earthquake reminds me of someting I heard a long time ago.
When I was a child, my grandparents used to tell me fables about a monster.
He was connected with earthquakes.
- Yongary?
- That's te one.
Sir, we found this man three miles from the earthquake center.
Look, please...
- What's that?
- It's Yongary.
The mysterious moving earthquake...
has been identified as being caused by a gigantic reptile
this monster, Yongary, has already been responsible
for several deaths and great damages
all citizens are advised to stay in their homes
our armed forces are making
all necessary preparations to deal with the monster
This is Patrol Six.
Come in.
You see anything over there?
Not yet.
At ease, men.
- Anything to report?
- No, sir.
Headquarters. Headquarters.
This is Car Two. Do you read me?
There's a strange disturbance here at Inwang.
I don't understand what's going on.
An explosion at high altitude.
The mountain is going to blow up!
It looks like Yongary wasn't a myth after all.
So, General, I suggest you get a few tanks over tere.
Yongary's coming out!
So, we must now alter all our plans and evacuate.
I want to see every single living human out of this town by sun up tomorrow morning.
And furthermore,
I want several brigades out on te streets.
They're going to aid the people.
And the rest of the army on tank maneuvers.
Good. I think we have three tank divisions available.
The monster yongary has been reported in the Inwang area.
All citizens are ordered to evacuate the city.
Number 13!
Battalion, withdraw tanks!
Il-woo, where are you going?
Il-woo, What are you going to do?
I'm going to see that monster.
- You can't.
- Oh, no.
The warning's out.
You've got to stay away from there.
You know it could be terribly dangerous.
Now we've got to get out.
- Come on, Il-woo!
- No, just a minute.
Nobody knows what to do this time.
Neither the generals, nor the so-called politicians.
If I can help,
I've got to see him first.
Well, in my opinion, you're just committing suicide.
Anyway, you were never a hero before, so what makes you think you have to be one this time?
She's right.
Please don't go, Il-woo.
Don't you worry.
I have to go. I'll be all right.
I'll go, too.
- Ico!
- Ico, no, come back! Please!
Ico, where do you think you're going?
I'll bring them back.
You wait here.
Ico. Il-woo.
Repent! All you sinners, repent!
The Lord say's repent!
The Lord say's repent!
Seek ye repentance and ye sall be saved!
Repent, you sinners!
- Pass te beer.
- This is good.
Try some soy sauce.
Down the hatch.
Haven't you heard?
The monster's heading this way.
We'd better all run to te hills now!
And what are we supposed to do if the monster comes to the hills?
Head back to town?
- Go get yourself a cab.
- I don't want to meet that monster.
And I'm sure he won't die of a broken heart if he doesn't get to meet me.
Goodbye, everybody.
- Why, you miserable...
- You know someting, Ito?
What this place needs is a couple of waiters who know how to draw beer.
Ico! Il-woo!
Ico, get back here!
Il-woo, Iook!
He's pretty big, he?
Come back!
You could get killed here! Hurry!
Ico, get up.
- Come on, Soona!
- Come on, come on!
Please, Il-woo.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
Where's Ico?
- I don't know.
- Where as he gone?
- What do you think?
- We've got to find him.
Gentlemen, the reports all agree on one point, the monster's power.
Not even tanks, it seems, can make a dent in him.
Very well, General.
Now, let me ask you What's next, if I may.
It's hopeless unless we start with the missiles.
Please, General. I've been thinking a lot about those missiles.
You know, they migth do more damage than Yongary.
And I'm very much afraid of one thing.
If those missiles go, they could destroy... one of te truly great landmarks of old Korea.
Gentlemen, as far as I am concerned, the time as come when we must discuss Korea's future and forget about Korea's past.
If he goes north, he'll hit the Pavilion of the Moon.
It seems to me that one ancient landmark is a lot less important than millions of lives.
Come in, Tower, this is Helicopter One.
We are flying above Yongary this minute.
All of his movements are slow at this time.
He as turned completely around and appears to be headed back the way he came.
All right, let's move.
What was it?
Why sould a monster drink oil?
I've got it.
Hum?
What's that?
Gentlemen, we've been observing Yongary.
He just drank a wole storage tank of oil.
He just drank What?
Mother, please.
Uncle Il-woo!
It's him, it's Ico.
- Hey!
- Ico.
- Ico, we thougt you were dead.
- Ico, where have you been, Ico?
Hey, Uncle Il-woo.
- Where were you?
- Watching Yongary.
- Really?
- Yes, and how about this?
- He eats oil and gasoline.
- You mean it?
Yes. I was standing near te main valve.
I shut it off so that he wouldn't be able to get any more to drink.
Boy, was he mad. He started screaming and pawing up te ground.
And guess What?
There was this one tank there.
His tail touced it and it blew up.
That's when he changed.
He started dancing around, itching and scratching.
Why do you think e did that, Uncle Il-woo?
- What kind of tank?
- I don't know.
Wait. There was a terrible smell and lots of ice.
What? A smell? And ice, too?
Uh-uh.
Show me where, Ico.
Il-woo, wait a minute.
You can't go anywere like that.
You're hurt.
I'm not just going to sit around.
- I'd better go with him.
- Soona, please...
Ico, no!
You have to stay here.
- Sorry, Il-woo needs my help.
- Oh, no, Ico. Ico...
Hello. I'm Professor Il-woo Nami.
I've got to get a closer look at Yongary.
Will you please let me in?
You got here a bit too late, sir.
They're going to hit Yongary any minute.
They'll be using guided missiles.
You'd better go.
They're going to it Yongary any minute.
They'll be using guided missiles.
You'd better go.
Missiles? Really?
They'll be no use.
Well, let's hope they are.
Anyway, I have my orders.
Then I guess we'd better go to headquarters.
I'm sorry. Father?
Soona, you know you souldn't...
Il-woo, What's wrong with you?
It's noting to worry about.
I believe you're planning on missiles as a way of attacking te monster.
- We have no choice.
- I wish you wouldn't.
Why?
It was Ico, here.
His reports on the monster gave me te first clue about it.
- Ico?
- Boy, you should have seen it.
Drank three big tanks of oil.
Gentlemen, there's a definite pattern here.
He consumes eat energy material.
He drinks gasoline and fuel oils.
Now, if eat nourises him, exploding missiles will do nothing more than add energy in larger amounts.
Tey will not destroy him.
All this on a child's story.
It is just a little ridiculous, you'll admit.
So, we've had our little joke.
Now we've got to move.
We've drawn plans.
We had better prepare all the missiles and set the launching in a short time.
- I say ten minutes.
- No, please.
Those missiles are really going to be dangerous.
Why not lure the monster away from te center of town?
You've got to get him in another area.
I mean, if you must go ahead and fire those missiles...
Sounds like a good idea.
Can it be done?
There's only one problem, tought.
How to move te monster away?
Use temptation.
Well, open the fuel tanks.
I mean, the ones at the Namsan depot.
You know,
I really can't take all this seriously.
Now, hold on, wait a minute. this as possibilities.
I say we open te depot.
If this scheme can save one human life, it's whort it.
He's right.
- I'll be in touch with you later.
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.
- Good idea.
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.
Well, Il-woo, do you need anything?
Well, yes, as a matter of fact.
A helicopter.
I can get you one.
Why do you need it?
Watch this.
When Yongary was at the refinery, he had a bad reaction from a chemical.
A chemical?
Uh-uh.
And if I'm not completely wrong, well, I think we can get him by using it.
Well, what's it made of?
A precipitate of ammonia.
- What?
- Ammonia?
Uh-uh.
All right.
Let's get it all open now.
Open all fuel vents.
I don't believe it's working.
- What's wrong, then? Not enough?
- Who knows?
- Get a helicopter.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Six. Right.
Get me a helicopter.
Right. Here you are, sir.
Thank you. To Crew Three.
I see te monster won't move.
Climb two hundred feet up.
You're flying too close.
Acknowledge, please.
- I wonder where Ico is.
- I don't know.
Helicopter crew three reporting.
The monster seems to be reacting to some stimulas, which we cannot see.
He is starting to move, and his horn seems to be turning red.
Hey, it's working!
The monster is moving toward the refinery.
He is now at the refinery.
Time for the missiles.
Yes, sir.
Prepare the missiles.
Prepare the missiles.
- He seems to have slowed down.
- Yes.
This could be only temporary.
I think the solution, the ammonia, needs more work.
The missiles worked, I knew they would.
It happened, see? It's wonderful.
The monster is no longer a menace to our people.
- I knew they'd do the trick.
- Yes.
Let me see...
This migth work.
That's it. It's beautiful!
Hu?
I should have had more faith. this is the answer.
I just knew I was on the right track with that ammonia.
All we need now is a furter refinement of this precipitate.
That'll put him out of business and it's about time.
Il-woo, congratulations.
I'm sorry.
Il-woo, you know, I'm so proud of you.
You must be a genius.
What's wrong with you?
Hey. He's dancing!
Go, Yongary, go!
Hey, What's that?
- Come here.
- Hey, leave me alone.
What do you think you're doing?
Leave me alone, will you?
- Get your big mitts off me, will you?
- Come on.
- Get that kid out of here.
- Come on, let me go!
- Stop kicking, you little brat!
- Control Tower. Control Tower.
- It looks like he's still standing.
- What? Yongary's not dead?
Do you hear me?
- He's still alive, sir.
- That is correct. That is correct.
Area Eight, will you confirm please?
Thank you, Area Eight. Over and out.
- The missiles.
- Yes, sir, immediately.
Platoon.
Get moving!
- It's Yongary! He's alive!
- What?
Look, look! Yongary! Yongary!
Come on! Yongary!
Come on, all of you! Hurry!
Stop crawling! Come on! Yea!
Nothing seems to work.
We'd better head back.
- It's working, look!
- It's working!
Il-woo, you were right.
How wonderful.
He was.
- Oh, my!
- You see?
Stop, please.
No, don't do it anymore.
What is it?
Does he have to be killed?
Does he really?
Please, Uncle Il-woo.
I mean, you should have seen him last nigth. He was dancing.
Uncle Il-woo, we just couldn't have let him stay alive like he was, could we?
Ico, I know how you feel and I'm sure we all do.
Anyway, we have no choice about this.
Il-woo, in a way, you know,
I'm sorry, too.
I wonder if he really meant to hurt us.
Well, who's to say?
You know, we'd better be going.
Yes. We're finished here now. this is one time I don't mind going on record.
Hey, look.
Sir, do you have a statement for the press?
After all, it was your office that was responsible for defeating Yongary.
Well, no, I wouldn't say that.
I really think the first credit goes to Dr. Il-woo.
It was his analysis that gave us the key we needed.
There he is.
You'd better talk to him.
Sir, a moment please.
Do you have a statement for the press, sir?
We'd Iike to know how you did it.
How did you find te monster's weakness?
First of all, I'd Iike to thank the Minister very much.
For the rest of it, I'm gratified that science was able to be of help, but truthfully, that's only part.
Te very first clue was found by Ico, here.
I didn't do anything.
Ico, Ico, tell me how old you are?
About eigth.
Well, acting as scientific advisor to a whole nation is quite a job for an eight-year-old. without your work, we migth all ave been destroyed.
How do you feel about that?
Well, then, perhaps a word from your sister. Miss?
I'm no good at words.
Your brother's pretty special, isn't he, Miss?
Only special about getting himself in trouble.
Apart from that I'd say he's just an ordinary brat of a brother.
I think little brothers are supposed to act like brats, but, anyway, my sister's nice.
What would you like to be wen you grow up, Ico?
I want to be a great scientist, a biologist.
What would you like most in the world?
What wishes?
Let's see.
Well, one wish is about my sister and Uncle Il-woo.
I wish that the two of them would hurry up and get married.
Tey're just standing around doing nothing.
You miserable brat.
- Anything else, Ico?
- Yes, someting about Yongary.
I saw him play and dance.
I think all of you should realize it wasn't is fault.
You call im a monster just because of the things he did.
He was just looking for food and we had to kill him because he got in our way.
He migth have destroyed te entire Earth if we hadn't stopped him.
Of course I know.
I know that we had to kill him, honest.
But my other wish would be that he could be here now.
You're a fine young man.
We're all very proud of you.
Hey, let's get started, can we?
Well, now, then, about tat first wish of Ico's...
I must say we've been waiting for this.
Il-woo, What a wonderful idea.
- I think you should.
- Do you?
And What about Soona?
That sounds like a proposal.
You should take it.
Stop that.
I'd hate to disappoint Ico in all his wishes.
All right, I accept, in front of witnesses, too.
Hey, Soona, just think.
In a month or two, you may ave a little brat like me.
A month? Oh, you.
A lot of corrections: Kilo

I feel sorry for his wife, but this is the only way to make him mine.
I'm sorry, Mother. Tamiko"
A double suicide brought on by the woman?
Lucky man to have a woman who loved him that much.
I agree.
What kind of work did he do?
Chief.
"Police Detective Koichi Takeshita"
Hey, watch it!
Damn you! That hurts!
Be careful!
Any special girl you want?
What are you doing?
Bring the best.
Very well, sir!
Waiter, ice!
He's quite a playboy.
A very good customer.
He's already spent 70,000.
Who is it?
Somebody beat up Ken.
You guys take care of it.
He says it was a total stranger.
- Where's Ken?
- Outside.
Forget this stranger.
Just pay him off.
Maybe this guy is from the Sanko mob.
They're no match for us.
Just forget it.
Get Ken in here.
Is that the man?
That's him!
The total is 72,500 yen.
- Any policemen around?
- Why do you ask?
Well, I've got no money.
Don't give us that bullshit!
Wait.
Let's settle this peacefully in the office.
Stop.
He isn't packing.
This room is soundproof.
One false move and they'll blow you away, so watch your step.
You're new.
Where are you from?
I hear you've been messing around on our turf.
You got some grudge against Nomoto Enterprises?
Spit it out or you'll get hurt.
I just felt like doing it.
If it had been this lady here,
I would've been gentler.
- Smart-ass!
- Shut your face!
Good thing it's soundproof.
Turn around.
- What for?
- Do as I say.
You stay here.
Get up.
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.
How much?
One million yen up front.
You got it.
And 200,000 yen a month.
Then...
Did you think I was a hit man?
I just wanted a job.
Thanks for hiring me.
Good.
I'll introduce you to the boss.
You aren't the boss?
You keep wanting more!
But our area is a slum!
You can't ask for so much.
- That's enough!
NOMOTO RESIDENCE
You a killer?
I bet you're fast with guns.
I dislike such unreliable weapons.
I like to feel the results with my own hand.
These are the best.
Put that away.
I don't like being shot in the back.
Take your hand off the gun.
Let's get rid of them together.
You've got a few things to learn.
So do you.
I'm Minami.
We'll get along fine.
We will. I'm Joji Mizuno.
Call me Jo for short.
Don't touch that!
He's never been able to hold a gun in his left hand.
I wanna meet the boss.
I'm Nomoto.
You guys should act more respectable.
You still act like yakuza off the street.
Minami,
I told you to wear a tie, didn't I?
You won't believe this, but alcohol and women are my weaknesses.
Where are you staying?
The Hibiya Hotel.
The Hibiya?
That's classy.
Can you afford it?
No, I'm broke.
So you're going to bilk them then?
You've got guts.
I'll pick up the tab for you.
Take care of him, Minami.
He looks useful.
Is he really at the Hibiya?
Forget it.
He won't be on your list.
Here he is.
- Oh, yeah?
From Abashiri, the prison town.
Just a moment, sir.
That's a hell of a suitcase!
- Nomoto runs this place too?
- Yeah.
Jo, what's in there?
Wanna report to your boss, huh?
The tools of my trade.
I take better care of them than I do of myself.
Pretty impressive!
Come on.
I'll show you around.
Then on to your first job.
Let's see what you're capable of.
This is for you.
Hello. Good to see you.
- He's the new hand.
- Got a name?
Jo Mizuno, I think.
A bit of a maverick, but I hear he's good.
A shakedown!
- What?
- Where?
The realtors' office.
Some guy's blackmailing them.
What?
The deed.
Make out a check.
How the hell can I pay three million yen?
Just write it out.
You can't threaten me.
You can't do anything to me.
Get out!
Okay, I'll write the check!
Hold it right there.
You almost pulled it off, but you got a little overconfident.
To hell with your plan!
Hold it!
Hold it!
I said hold it.
Jo, let's finish up this job.
I've changed my mind.
I've decided I want the three million in cash.
Please! Just a little, please!
No. Drugs are expensive.
I can't give you any.
Don't say that.
I promise I'll work harder.
Shut up!
It hurts so bad.
Give me some quick, please!
You want it that much?
Here.
Give it to me.
Wait!
The dope!
Damn you!
You're inhuman!
If you want it, get your ass out there and make me some money.
Don't be playing around with your boyfriend.
Well?
Do you understand?
How did the job go?
Boss!
That was the first time
I've pulled that trick.
Here's the three million.
It was like Jo said.
There was a guy on the balcony.
From now on we're partners.
I won't work without him.
Jo, I checked you out.
You're clean.
You're now on the payroll.
Here's your front money.
I'm gonna hang out with you today.
Sorry. Not today.
I have a memorial service to attend.
An old friend of mine.
A memorial service?
Wow, thank you.
Oh, it's nothing.
Seeing these photos makes you feel like Takeshita's still alive.
He used to love to sing when he got drunk, didn't he?
Hello?
Excuse me.
Mrs. Takeshita?
My name is Mizuno.
My condolences.
Thank you.
A long time ago, your husband was very kind to me.
Is that right?
Please, come inside.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Please stay and eat.
Thanks, but I must go.
Would you mind telling me a story about my husband?
Hello. Takeshita speaking.
A yellow sweater?
I'm sorry, but we're all out of yellow wool.
How about red?
TAKESHITA KNITTING SCHOOL
HOW ABOUT A DATE AT THE CLUB AOI?
Look at this.
You're sure she didn't work at your club?
- Yes.
- Thanks.
Go out the back way.
A man's been following us.
DOUBLE SUICIDE
Come here.
I need to talk to you.
But I'm naked.
Me too.
I already took a shower.
That was careless, rushing into the bathroom like that.
What if I were a killer?
I'm only joking. Come here.
What are you after?
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.
What brings you here?
I just want to get to know you, silly.
You're so strong.
I want you to kill a woman.
Find her and then kill her.
- Who?
First let's make love.
Tell me who.
You won't have much luck in marriage.
Three wives, it says.
I thought I'd marry you, but I'd better not.
Cut the jokes.
It's no joke.
I'm here to talk to you.
Kill the boss's sixth mistress.
Just kill her.
Isn't this fun?
I'm gonna build a tomb for her.
You know the suicide case involving the detective?
That girl was one of our call girls.
The paper said she was a clerk.
Yes, that was a cover.
Most of our girls have covers.
And?
The boss' sixth mistress runs the show.
Nobody's ever seen her, and Nomoto keeps quiet about her.
But they can't fool me.
A woman's intuition, huh?
Find her.
Will you kill her?
First tell me why.
Is it jealousy? Money?
Everything.
She's the only one I can't control.
I see.
And what's in it for me?
Half of what I get.
And if I say no?
I'll say you dragged me here and raped me.
He's insanely jealous, so that'll be the end of you.
Not a bad deal.
But what happens if I find her more attractive, or if she pays me more?
LOVELY YOUNG LADIES
THE MURASAKI CLUB
No girls right now?
Tonight's fine, then.
Send one to the Hibiya at 8:00.
What's this? Why so upset?
Nothing.
Better safe than sorry.
What's on your mind?
Our boss wants to see you to thank you.
Okay, but not right now.
What?
Not like this, anyway.
I don't like people telling me what to do.
He's got a big mouth!
Gonna kill me here?
The cops are nearby, and this area's full of apartments.
From this range, it'd be hard not to blow your face off.
Go ahead.
The cops are nearby, and this area's full of apartments.
That's my line, fool.
Now drop the gun.
Let's go.
- What?
You said your boss wanted to see me, right?
Shut up!
So you don't care if you've gotta close up shop?
Pay us a little more and you'll be safe, Pachinko man.
I hear you're leaning towards
Nomoto Enterprises, right?
Answer me!
Watch it or they'll do you in.
Good work. Thanks.
So they finally brought you.
You got it wrong.
I came on my own.
Come on.
Don't be a sore loser.
Tell him.
He's got a gun.
A gun?
Give 'em the details.
It's a shotgun.
It can blow your face off.
Blow my face off?
Sounds like fun. Show me.
Hold it!
We don't want our guest hurt.
Show him out first.
Do it!
Come on!
Take it easy.
I don't know what Nomoto pays you, but I'll double it.
Why do all you big shots say the same stupid lines?
Fine. Everyone out.
We're gonna talk.
Out!
Now, how much?
- Gimme your gun.
- Don't! You'll put the boss in danger.
Shut up! I can't just stand by.
No, don't!
Watch this.
I'll get him in the back.
One million up front and 200,000 a month.
I'll give you one and a half million, and 300,000.
Join us.
No.
That's our top salary.
But I want Nomoto's, too.
You can't do that.
Nomoto is buying guns to crush your mob.
What?
I'll spy on them for you.
Nomoto was originally one of your men, right?
You should attack first and wipe him out, but don't let me pressure you.
- It's a deal.
- Thanks.
Hold it!
You overheard us?
I heard nothing, and I'll never talk.
Leave him. He won't rat.
Besides, we're all partners now.
I'll let it go for today.
All right. Let's go.
- What?
You're my shield.
We're enemies on the outside.
I've got to stay on guard.
Don't!
I went to your apartment... and saw you being taken away.
But I knew you'd come out on top.
I did, thanks to this.
I see.
The hammer's broken.
Those idiots would be so pissed off if they knew.
Minami.
Do we run call girls?
Call girls?
This'll cost a fortune to fix.
Onodera kept asking if we ran call girls. Do we?
Have some of this. It's great.
Don't you know anything?
All I'm interested in is guns.
Nothing else.
That's why they make fun of you.
Even Onodera knows a woman runs the business.
A woman?
Alcohol and women are bad for me.
You're like that broken shotgun.
A useless piece of crap!
Go to sleep!
As useless as a broken shotgun?
How dare you call me an idiot!
You're the idiot!
He wasn't talking about a woman.
He meant Hideo.
The boss's brother. He's gay.
The one you met at his house.
Don't forget
I know everything about our gang!
I'm sorry.
Tell me about Hideo.
Sure.
His mother was a whore after the war.
Specialized in black men.
But never mention that to him.
A drunk woman once called him
"a son of a whore."
He carved her face up with a razor.
I saw it.
Her face looked like a venetian blind.
Venetian blind?
Hideo with the razor blade.
Murasaki Club here.
Send me one.
- And your name?
- Yoshida.
Where are you?
In Shibuya.
Call us back in 30 minutes from the pay phone at Namikibashi to discuss the place, okay?
Do you have a car?
Please arrange it for me.
Keep this quiet.
Looks like there's nothing wrong with him.
Yeah, he looks like he can pay.
Get me 416-1920, please.
Hello? It's me.
Do we have a girl for 3:00 p.m.?
Send her to Shibuya Public Hall.
Thanks.
Are you Hideo with the razor blade?
You know who I am, don't you?
- No.
- Really?
Who were you calling?
Where did you call?
None of your business.
You're going to take me there.
Where?
The place you just called.
I already know.
Hello? Put me through to the same number as before.
Just do it!
Hello. Nomoto Enterprises?
What's your number?
416-1920. Nomoto?
I've got some business to see to.
I heard your mother was a whore.
Don't make me carve up your face.
Don't!
Tell me who your partner is.
I don't know.
You wanna look like a venetian blind too?
Stop! I'll talk.
Who is it?
What're you doing?
Talk. Why did you do it?
Start talking, or more than your face will look different!
I'll never talk, no matter what.
Who sent you?
Talk.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again.
Forgive me.
You fool!
If you don't suspect me, just let me go.
Just shut up and watch!
Go on! Get out!
Stop it!
Hey, don't.
What's that?
He always gets like that beating up women. It excites him.
He's a sadist.
There's a deal.
Be at the house by 2:00.
A deal?
- Drugs.
- Where?
Just be there at 2:00.
Hello? What?
The boss isn't here!
What?
Good morning. It's for you.
Now talk.
I told you to come alone.
I'm carrying money.
I need protection.
All right.
Nomoto's got a drug deal planned for ten million.
Really?
Where?
Wait till the deal is done.
Then strike and take the money.
Just the money.
Forget Nomoto's drugs.
Why's that?
They'll think Nomoto did it.
They'll never sell to him again.
Drugs are the backbone of the mob.
Without them -
I see. And Nomoto's finished.
Thanks.
But why would you tell us this?
You got a grudge against them?
No, I just want the money.
On this one,
I'll take four of the ten million.
With two million in advance.
Two million?
Make it snappy.
Where's it happening?
Otherwise we forget the whole thing.
Hey!
Two million.
Two million's cheap for a chance to finish off Nomoto.
I should be at Nomoto's at 2:00?
Yeah, just follow behind me in the car.
One blast of the horn means it's the Nomoto car.
Two means the other car has the money.
Laying low these days, Takechi?
Hello, Officer.
Mizuno!
Why did you attend
Takeshita's memorial service?
It's like you were insulting him.
Have you joined up with Nomoto now?
I hear you have.
Takeshita didn't talk much about you, but he took what you did pretty hard.
He'd be even more shocked at this.
Don't give me that sentimental crap.
You've changed since you went to Kobe.
Embezzlement? It's a setup.
No, I looked into it.
You did it, just as the letter says.
No, I just borrowed the money for investigation.
Why didn't you clear it first?
I had no proof.
It was a hunch.
The boss wouldn't have understood.
Please understand.
I know the Sakura mob wrote that letter.
I wonder how they knew.
Anyway, this shows they've panicked.
Can you keep quiet about this for me?
You sure about this?
Well?
I'd stake my life on it.
Okay.
I'll forget about this letter.
I don't care what happens to it.
Thanks.
Just don't go too far, or you risk your life.
Thanks. I'm grateful.
That night I tortured one of the Sakura mob.
I went so far that he couldn't talk anymore.
That was all.
I was arrested for assault and embezzlement and went to prison.
I was framed by the mob.
Takeshita almost lost his job.
That Takeshita.
In spite of the trouble I caused him... he took care of my wife while I was in jail.
She had TB, and he got her into the hospital and even sent her money every month on his pittance of a salary.
But in the end, she died.
He was quite a guy.
Mizuno.
I had no chance to pay him back.
When he was killed, I figured this was my chance to repay him.
So I'm after his murderer.
- That was a suicide.
You think Takeshita would cheat on his wife?
He was so awkward with women.
There's proof.
What proof?
It was a trap.
He was framed like me, and murdered.
You think the murderer is with Nomoto?
You know Yosuke Ishiyama?
You do, right?
This is him in Kobe. Look familiar?
A drug tycoon.
When he moved to Tokyo,
Takeshita was transferred here too.
Ishiyama is real smart.
Takeshita searched for proof.
I met a guy in prison who Takeshita once arrested.
A Nomoto mobster.
He'll be here soon.
Got an appointment or something?
I'm gonna get Takeshita's killer.
Idiot! That's not your job.
Leave that to the cops.
We'll look into it.
No way.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
I'll kill the killers.
But -
Stop right here.
Don't stop. Take us to police HQ.
Stop!
Stop!
Don't worry. I'll be in touch.
Take him home.
I'm arresting you for illegal possession of a firearm.
Gonna use handcuffs?
Don't be an idiot!
Don't take it out on the car, you jerk!
Damn it! He tricked us!
Who told you about this?
I'm too ashamed to say.
He looks like he's in a hurry.
He mustn't see us.
Hide, you idiot!
What is it?
I think I've seen him somewhere before.
Seen who?
I must've been imagining it.
Long time no see.
How about some mah-jongg tonight?
- Sounds great.
Business first.
Perfect.
The deal is done.
We're changing cars.
Sorry.
I think I know you.
Or do I?
- What's up?
- Nothing.
I think we've met before.
I can't remember everyone I meet.
One blast of the horn.
Get the Nomoto car.
Give us the money.
Hand it over!
We'll get you for this.
Shut up!
Hurry up!
We have just one thing to say to you:
You pay us again.
Mr. Ishiyama, you've got it wrong.
I swear we didn't do it.
The only ones who knew the details were you and us.
But -
If you don't pay again, then fine.
That'll be the end of our dealings.
Wait a minute.
Please don't jump to conclusions.
Boss.
What is it, Shibata?
That guy driving the car!
He's a cop!
I'm sure I saw him in Kobe!
Who was it?
It was Jo.
That's four million for me.
Not a bad deal.
Let's do business again sometime.
I'd be happy too, but are you sure it's okay?
Not all of Nomoto's men are fools.
I know.
Just to join me for lunch.
That's all.
Have her wait at the Hibiya.
A red flower on her handbag?
Got it.
Here it is.
You wanted me to see these people?
No, I'll send them away.
He tells me to work and work, but look at the guy he sends me to!
Go tell Hideo he should be more selective!
Anything else?
Tell him he's an idiot too!
Minami, let's get it over with.
I can't shoot Jo!
Where's the loot?
What loot?
The money your men took from Mr. Shibata.
What are you talking about?
You're with the Kobe police.
I met you three years ago.
Look!
You idiot!
Why didn't you just ask me if you wanted to know about that?
That picture means nothing.
So you're a cop, huh?
I was.
Listen. Three years ago,
I was arrested for assault and embezzlement.
Don't forget I did time too!
Check it out.
It was in the police gazette three years ago.
Damn!
You cut my finger for that!
Get someone to check it out!
"Detective Mizuno arrested for assault and embezzlement."
I'll get you back for this, boss!
You idiot!
Don't talk to him like that!
Hold it.
You have reason to be angry.
I'm sorry.
Let's settle this.
How much do you want for your finger?
Let me have one of yours.
Can you prove it wasn't you?
Now you ask?
Any ideas who it was?
I saw a Sanko guy there.
The Sanko mob?
Yeah, by the bridge.
I'm sure he's involved.
I bet he sent the signal.
You sure you're not mistaken?
Don't ask if you won't listen.
Why don't you get the guy?
What's his name?
Just some punk.
But I remember his face.
Bye.
So it was you and your buddies, huh?
- I don't know who -
- Bullshit!
Talk! It was you guys, wasn't it?
Minami, throw this bum in the river!
Okay.
All right! We did it.
Now you tell us.
So, they did do it.
One last question.
I'll just ask you once:
Did you set it up?
No!
I did as Takechi told me!
Takechi?
How did he know?
I don't know.
Don't give me this bullshit!
Whatever you might think,
I'm a Sanko man!
I never lie!
You'll be dishonored if you drown me in the river.
Kill me with a gun.
Shoot me straight in the heart.
Lock him in the basement.
Boss, this looks like a challenge from the Sanko mob.
Damn them!
Onodera plotted all this.
We'll go on the offensive, damn it!
Hold it.
We can get them anytime.
First we find out from Takechi who the informant was.
It's my honor on the line.
Let me handle this.
You guys work with Jo.
No, let me do this.
Come on, Jo.
Who is it?
Sorry to bother you.
Is Takechi in?
He's not back yet.
Tell us the truth.
When's he expected back?
She's beautiful.
Don't get any funny ideas, Minami.
All we've got to do is wait.
You, outside.
Thirty-minute shifts.
Minami, your shift.
It's your turn.
I wanna stay with her.
For you, I'm drinking for the first time in my life.
What if he puts up a fight?
Our orders are not to kill him.
"Run. Nomoto's trap. Jo."
That's enough.
What if Nomoto finds out?
You don't have to tell him.
I've fallen for her.
Don't look at me like that.
We just have to get Takechi, right?
Jo, change places.
No. Why should Minami have all the fun?
I don't like it.
If you want to keep a lookout, go ahead.
I never thought you'd fall for a woman.
I thought touching a statue's ass was all you could handle.
The key!
By the door.
Your husband's gonna die anyway.
Let him have some fun with you.
You all right, Minami?
Ishizaki and Takechi shot each other. Got that?
Leave me here.
I wanna be with her.
It's a murder!
Stop!
Jo.
You can't make it with me.
Leave me here.
Don't be stupid.
You go. I'll stay here.
I don't want the police to get hold of you.
Stay here. I'll take a look.
She was so nice.
TAKESHITA KNITTING SCHOOL
You?
I'm sorry, but he's wounded.
May we come in?
Doesn't he need a doctor?
No, I'll see to him.
I'll take the slug out myself.
Mrs. Takeshita, your deceased husband and I were detectives together.
But I got fired over a certain incident.
I didn't believe the story about what happened to him.
I checked it out myself.
I found out he didn't kill himself.
He was murdered.
- Really?
- It's true.
You know he couldn't have done it, don't you?
Not with a call girl.
She worked for Nomoto.
The note was a fake.
She didn't know she'd be killed too.
Who did it?
I don't know yet.
Someone in Nomoto's mob.
I joined them to find out.
I'm getting close.
If the cops come in now,
I'll never find out.
Will you help me?
Just look the other way for a while.
I understand.
Thanks. I'll get started now.
Nomoto here.
Jo? What's up?
Takechi surprised us.
Sanko knows what we're up to.
Just think if they find out about Takechi getting hit.
They're probably already planning revenge.
Where are you?
Right now?
The Takeshita Knitting School.
Please send help as soon as possible.
Hurry, or Minami will die.
Oh, it's you. What's up?
What? Takechi's dead?
Nomoto did it? Damn him!
They're preparing to attack.
I'll bet they're the ones who started this.
Be careful.
"Forewarned is forearmed," as the saying goes.
You can count on me.
Mrs. Takeshita, will you do us another favor?
Someone's coming for him.
Will you go with them?
No!
You've seen his face.
If they see you alive,
Nomoto will suspect me.
Don't worry.
Trust me. I'll protect you.
Thanks for coming. I didn't expect you'd come in person, boss.
How's Minami?
Still unconscious.
Better take this woman with you.
She'll just get in the way of our attack.
- Then you're going to -
- I won't kill her.
I'll leave Hideo to watch her.
Nothing to worry about.
Boss!
Okay? Keep a good eye on her.
Something's fishy about Sanko.
They may be getting ready to attack.
Inui will keep us informed.
Are you all right, sir?
You ran right into this -
Look!
You bastard!
We caught a Nomoto punk!
Don't bother about him.
The more they think we're making a big deal of this... the more of them we can lure in.
We'll get 'em all together in one place and then let them have this.
Kaboom!
That'll be the end of them.
Let's go!
If we're successful, you can have their turf.
Thanks. We'll be on our way.
Jo, come here for a sec.
You're not going.
With Minami and Ishizaki dead,
I'll be needed.
You'd only watch anyway, right?
Freeze!
What is it this time?
Thanks a lot for all your lies.
What's that?
Don't play dumb!
We know everything.
We know you joined us to avenge your pal.
And you're in with Sanko on their plan to wipe us out!
Who told you that crap?
Don't play dumb.
Who was it?
Damn! We're too late!
They're coming!
The more, the better!
This is our chance, guys!
Wait!
Leave it to me.
I'll go first, and then you follow.
Good. If you do it, you can have their turf.
Come with me if you want to!
Don't let them die in vain. Go!
Go! Next!
Attack!
Crush him and you get all his turf!
Go! Will nobody go?
Damn that Nomoto!
Damn that Nomoto!
Now talk!
Did you kill Detective Takeshita?
- No.
Talk or I'll blow those fingers off!
- No!
- Then who was it?
I don't know.
I'll ask again.
Who killed him and why?
Really, I don't know!
- Talk!
- I don't know!
Would you tell if you were me?
What's Takeshita's wife to you?
You wanna lose them all?
- Don't you know?
She's my sixth mistress.
You promised not to shoot!
A promise to you is nothing.
I want to kill you, but I've promised to keep you alive.
So it's just three fingers today!
One day you'll lose all your limbs!
Remember that!
You shouldn't let someone live who has a grudge against you.
You've got a lot to learn.
A wrong number?
They thought this was a clinic.
Are you hungry?
Your brother is missing three fingers now.
Wanna lose your nose?
Who killed Takeshita?
Say it again.
Who killed Takeshita? Say the name!
You killed Takeshita, didn't you?
No! How could I?
He knew your secret.
That's crazy! Can you prove it?
Nomoto sang like a bird!
I shot off three of his fingers.
No mercy for you either.
You admit it?
Nomoto did it. I had to help.
He threatened me.
Was Nomoto there?
Yes.
The motive?
He found out about our call girl ring.
What were you to Nomoto?
His lover.
Why'd you marry Takeshita?
Nomoto ordered me to.
He wanted me to spy on the police.
How did you snare him?
He fell for me.
I was his first love.
How did you kill him?
Chloroform and an overdose of sleeping pills.
Then we took him to the hotel.
- What about the woman?
- Nomoto killed her.
Are you sure?
I didn't want to kill him.
I had to! He made me do it!
He's a sadist.
Killing means nothing to him.
If I refused, he would have killed me too!
Don't look at me like that!
It's been hell for me, too.
I looked for a way to escape from Nomoto.
But I couldn't.
I'm sorry I killed him.
I really did love him.
It's not a lie.
At first, the marriage was only part of a clever plan.
But then I truly fell in love.
I wanted us both to get away from Nomoto.
Honestly, I did.
I thought if I told him all about the call girls and drugs, he'd put a stop to it all.
I would have done it, if we weren't up against Nomoto.
But it would never work.
He'd never spare an informer, even to the ends of the earth.
There's no way to save yourself.
I loved Takeshita, but I was terrified of Nomoto.
Is that unforgivable?
He threatened me!
I was a victim too!
Mr. Mizuno, please!
I have a feeling you'll help me.
You were a victim.
I know he was a sadist.
I wonder what kind of childhood he and his brother had.
Their mother was -
Yes, she was a street whore.
Even at 40 years old.
Put me through to Detective Hirokawa.
Hirokawa?
Yeah, it's finally all over.
Mizuno, where are you?
Hello? Hello?
What's wrong, Mizuno?
Who killed Takeshita?
Say the name!
Kumiko Takeshita.
How do you know that?
She called me.
My brother and I moved the body.
Was Nomoto there during the act?
No.
All he did was help move the body?
Yes.
He didn't like the fact she'd married Takeshita.
She came up with the plan all by herself.
And the girl who was killed?
Kumiko killed her too.
And the phone number
An unlisted number.
THE END
Well?
Carletto.
A glass of water, please.
- Want to dance?
- No, I don't feel like it.
- Why not?
- I don't feel like it.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
You're in a bad mood tonight.
Look, if I don't take it, there are ten others who will.
What do you think it will change?
You get such crazy ideas.
About a year and a half in Sicily.
We have to build a new department, and we need specialized workers.
Sorry, sir, but at the moment he's not specialized.
We'll promote him.
For once a poor guy like me gets the chance to get ahead... and all she can do is whine.
Come on, let's dance.
Are you married?
Good. Fewer complications.
You know how it is with transfers.
How old is he?
Seventy.
They're treated well.
They can't complain.
The only problem is loneliness.
They feel abandoned... and if they don't get used to it, after a while, they just waste away.
Is he a relative?
No, he's...
Your dad?
Yes.
Well, if you have no other choice,
I guess you'll have to accept it.
What is it?
- Are you Tommasini, the engineer?
- Yes, I am.
Hello, I'm Mr. Lo Giudice.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Mr. Malpiani sends his regrets that he couldn't come.
Thank you, miss.
- Is the car here?
- Yes.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
- Yes, thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Of course.
- Have you been with us long?
- Three or four months.
- Where did you get your degree?
- In Rome.
With whom?
Professor Tesorieri.
Ah, yes.
What department are you in?
- Sulphuric.
- Really?
How do you like it?
Well, actually,
I've only been there four months, but I like it.
I don't think I can make an accurate judgment yet.
I've only been there since graduation.
It hasn't been long.
What a knucklehead!
Did you see how he came out?
He's in the middle of rush-hour traffic and he acts like he's in the country.
He rushes out like a bullet.
Some people are so rude.
That animal belongs in the wild, not in the middle of traffic.
Just this morning a cyclist cut me off.
I almost ran into a wall.
You gotta have nerves of steel.
These days you got cars coming at you from every which way.
It's unbelievable.
Look there.
See those lights over there?
Those are our plants.
Maybe later we can call Moranzi.
I don't think we'll find him.
He does his own thing.
- Have you had dinner?
- Yes.
- Then thank you, and good night.
- Good night.
- Are you staying here too?
- No, I live in town with my family.
- Good evening. How are you?
- Fine, thanks. Welcome back.
- Any calls?
- No calls.
I need a room for Mr. Cabrini.
He'll be staying for three or four days.
- Very well.
- Thank you.
Tommasini, how are you?
- Get settled, and I'll see you later.
- All right.
And now...
Mr. Cabrini can only stay four days at the most.
I have a reservation for that room.
Yes, just a few days, until we find him a place to stay.
Will I have my usual room?
- Of course.
The spaghetti is ready.
- And the chicken.
- All right.
What would you like?
The kitchen's closing.
- What do you have?
- Do you know what time it is?
We're supposed to close at 9:30.
- I didn't know.
- Spaghetti or soup?
- It doesn't matter.
- Do you have coupons?
- No, I just got here.
- You'll have to pay me later, then.
Very well. Thank you.
Coming in this late?
You're working too much, sir.
It may surprise you, but waiting tables is exhausting work.
Can you imagine serving a hundred meals, just the two of us?
Not to mention lunch.
Ninety, a hundred.
I've done 150 on occasion.
Then, when I get home,
I have to start all over again.
My wife's not there, so I have to manage on my own.
Our little boy is in the hospital, so she's staying with my mother.
Two months and they still don't know what's wrong with him.
The local doctor always said it was an ear infection.
Then we took him to a specialist, and he said it wasn't.
Is he in pain?
How can we be sure?
He's only a few months old.
He cries and spits up everything he eats.
I'm sorry.
- Spaghetti is up.
- Excuse me.
Of course.
Good evening.
Please don't get up.
Mr. Tommasini asked me to tell you that in the morning you're to report to the plant and ask for Bertinotti.
All right. Thank you.
Number 17, please.
Thanks. Good night.
- Wake-up call at 7:45.
- Okay.
- I'm calling Milan.
- All right.
Number 30.
39. Thanks.
Number 24.
Excuse me, I have to be at the plant tomorrow morning by 8:00.
There's a bus at 7:30.
It'll get you there by 8:00.
I'm going out.
Good night.
If I don't take it, there are ten others who will.
They're going to promote me to specialized worker.
What are you afraid of?
You think I'm just going to disappear?
Good night.
Who is it?
- Hello?
- Your wake-up call.
Oh, thank you. Sorry.
Excuse me. I'm supposed to report to Mr. Bertinotti.
Second floor.
- Mr. Bertinotti, please.
- He'll be right here. Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Paging Mr. Padellaro.
Salvatore Clementelli is needed urgently at PS3.
Please come in.
Mr. Bertinotti is busy at the moment.
Meanwhile, here are your ID cards.
Excuse me just a moment.
Come with me.
Can we come in?
Excuse me.
I told you, only your daughter can come in.
If all the employees brought their families to work...
They won't wear their protective eye gear.
They've been working like this for too many years.
They have a different work ethic, and it goes back generations.
Just think: At first, when it rained, they wouldn't come to work.
- You're kidding.
- Everything stops here when it rains.
They don't have an industrial mentality, and there's nothing you can do.
We need to start all over.
With the new generation, who knows?
Hello.
Last night, on Via Enrico Toti, or on Via Garibaldi, or at the Splendido Theater, a wallet containing 5000 lire and other important papers was lost.
Whoever finds it is welcome to keep the 5000 lire but is requested to return the papers to their owner.
Children, how many times do I have to tell you?
When you come into church, you mustn't talk or run or laugh or spit!
You must pray.
Keep still, children.
Go back to your seats.
What can I do for you?
- I'm looking for a room.
- Come in.
Come in, please.
When do you need it?
- As soon as possible.
I'm staying at the plant's hostel, but I don't know how long I can stay.
Everything's full right now.
There's that bed in the corner.
It might be available in a few days.
Come and I'll show you another room.
This is available right now, but it's a single.
It goes for between
10,000 and 12,000 a month.
This one even has a nice terrace with a view of the street.
You can get some fresh air.
- How much is it?
When the plant opened it was different, but now it's hardly worth it.
They've wised up and hiked up all the prices.
Things cost the same as in Milan now, and some things even more.
Before I got transferred, I'd have a little left at the end of the month. Not now.
All things considered, it's not really such a good deal to come work down here anymore.
Maybe if your family comes with you.
A lot of them bring their wives, but it's a heck of a life.
They can't handle it.
The people down here aren't bad.
They've always been hungry, so it's only natural that when they see a little cash going around, they want some.
You know there are school teachers working in construction?
With the first money they set aside, they start building a house.
They don't care if they have to abandon it halfway through.
They're happy just having four bricks one on top of the other.
They eat bread and lemons and save their money to pay off debts.
They plant oranges and tangerines, but mostly lemons and tangerines, because they're fast growers.
In a few years, as soon as the orchard starts making some money, they leave the plant and go to live on their plot of land.
It's not that they're lazy.
They do their work.
They're just a little crazy.
The sun's real hot, and they never have a chance to blow off steam.
Want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.
- Take one.
- No, I just had one.
I was one of the first to come down here.
You should have seen it.
It was full of Algerians back then.
They'd bring their lunch wrapped up in a rag.
Now they all carry briefcases and look like executives.
They've moved up in the world.
It's amazing.
Wait till you see them.
It's amazing.
Wait till you see them.
It only lasts a week, but they party enough to last all year.
You should see the getups the women put on.
They don't even talk, so no one will recognize them.
What are you honking about?
Just get off your mule?
You won't catch me driving around here.
Who lets them drive? They'd be better off driving bumper cars.
Hey, idiot! Watch your step.
I'm not wearing clogs, you know.
Keep together or we'll lose each other.
If we get separated, meet up later at the car.
Coming through.
Stay back, knucklehead.
Hey, guys, you gotta watch out.
Look what I found.
She looks like a beached whale.
Leave some for me.
I hope she isn't a man.
With this getup, who's to say?
He's been drinking again.
May I come in?
These are the papers, ma'am.
If he really can't take it -
- All right.
- I've signed them.
It's no use.
He'lljust have to stop.
If an old man can't even have a glass of wine, what's left to live for?
- Where are you from?
- Catania. How about you?
I'm from up north.
Poor thing, so far from home.
I'll give you a kiss, just to console you.
- No, that's not allowed.
- It won't be any fun then.
You'll see. It'll be wonderful.
I'm not paying.
Have fun paying up!
Oh, go to bed!
You're a real piece of work.
Not you, sir. I meant the horse.
Who's there?
Quick, run!
Hey!
I saw you!
Where did you go?
Show your face, if you've got guts.
Come on.
Are you done making a racket out here?
Aren't you tired of fooling around?
- They're the ones playing around.
Sure, it's their fault.
Go to bed. It's late.
Just a minute.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Very kind of you.
Blessed mother.
Here are the keys.
One for the apartment and one for the front door.
Good. By the way,
I couldn't open the bathroom door.
It's a little tricky.
Come and I'll show you how it works.
When you open it, you have to hit it hard.
Then give it a push, see?
Please have a seat.
Someone will be right with you.
Just a minute, sir.
This letter came for you two days ago.
I always put the mail here.
You should always check.
Sometimes I forget.
You've been shopping, I see.
Mom, the door.!
Excuse me.
Who told you that?
It was Marco, wasn't it?
That dirty, rotten-
What are you so angry about?
I'm the one who should be angry.
You mean you're not angry?
I'm insulted and disappointed.
I'm going to ask you a question, and I want a straight answer.
Evening.
Do you still want to marry me?
Now?
How would we manage it?
I didn't ask you when.
I just want to know if you still want to marry me.
There's no water.
Why not?
They turn it off on Sundays.
- Would you like a little of mine?
- No, thank you.
- It's nice and cold.
- Thanks all the same. Don't bother.
It's no bother. Come on.
Come on.
I'll pour it for you.
Good thing I kept a little aside.
That was smart, huh?
It's so hot.
Shall I pour a little on your back?
Nice and cold, eh?
You like that?
Thank you. That's enough.
In your letter you wrote only of my father... and said nothing about yourself.
How are you?
Are you keeping your spirits up?
Why haven't you written?
I sent my postcard two weeks ago, and still no answer from you.
My address is the same as before, at the pensione.
The last address I sent you.
My regards to everyone, and a kiss for you.
Dear Giovanni,
I received your postcard and your letter.
I hesitated to write back.
I wasn't sure you wanted me to.
When I received your letter,
I got scared.
I wanted to open it right away, but I couldn't work up the courage.
I felt excited and happy running up the stairs.
But then suddenly that happiness frightened me.
I was afraid. I don't know why.
A thousand thoughts raced through my mind, most of them disturbing.
I even thought this might be your last letter.
I admit I was afraid.
I had lost faith, and hope as well.
Now I'm sorry I thought ill of you.
I went to see your father.
He's fine, and he sends you his love.
In the evenings he sits in front of Mrs. Seminari's open door.
They keep it open because of the heat, and this way he can watch TV.
At least it keeps him from going to the bar.
In other words, the reacting gas, that is, the ethylene, mixed with air and an inhibiting agent, passes through an exchange chamber, where the mixture is heated and then sent to a reactor.
My dear Liliana, the heat here has become unbearable: up to 140°in the sun and 113°in the shade.
Only the classroom at the plant is bearable, because it's air-conditioned.
I bet it's hot up there too.
Do you still go dancing at night?
I've stopped going.
There are no dance halls here.
But that's not the only reason.
I was used to dancing with you.
I'm not comfortable with other girls.
On Sundays I don't know what to do.
I just wander around aimlessly.
Besides, without my motorcycle,
I can't really go anywhere.
Write me when you get the chance, because it's nice to get home at night and have the lady at the pensione tell me I have mail.
Regards to my father and everyone else.
And a kiss for you.
Dear Giovanni, it's been so many days since you left.
Over two months.
I don't go dancing anymore.
I don't want to go to the Speranza and see all our friends.
I don't want them asking about you... with those insinuating smiles - you know how people are.
I'd be embarrassed.
We have so many memories from that place.
You could say that's where we met, when I used to accompany my older sister there.
I was 15 or 16, remember?
You were just back from the military.
I've never told you this, but the first time you asked me to dance,
I said no because I didn't know how.
I had my girlfriends teach me at home, and every night after that,
I hoped you would ask me again.
How many memories since then, good and bad.
Ever since you left,
I cherish even the bad ones.
At times all those memories made me want to cry.
But I didn't want to cry.
I wanted to be strong.
So I would try to feel resignation, just in case you decided not to come back.
I tried to forget you, to erase you from my thoughts.
But now, thank goodness, everything has changed.
Those sad thoughts seem so far away.
What beautiful letters you write, dear Liliana.
You're so good at expressing yourself.
I'm not as good, and I often can't say everything I feel.
But I'm sure you understand me just the same, because the feelings you express are the same ones I feel.
You speak for us both.
You know, Giovanni... perhaps your trip was good for us both.
I think the distance helped us understand a lot of things.
We've been sweethearts for so long.
So many years.
More than sweethearts - you know what I mean - but we've never really spoken... the way two lovers should.
We each kept our thoughts to ourselves and were content just being together.
But perhaps our being together was becoming a mere habit.
Perhaps we didn't realize we were each still alone.
We're much closer now.
I realized it when I thought back on all our time together.
I feel as if we're starting all over again.
It's like reliving the same feelings, but as if we're somehow different, somehow better.
Hi.
It's me, Giovanni.
No, nothing. No reason.
I felt like calling you.
How are you?
No, nothing.
I just thought I'd call you.
It's Sunday and it's half the rate.
How are you?
It's cooled off a bit, but a storm is gathering.
What are you doing?
I have to go to work now.
My bus leaves in 15 minutes.
I don't feel like working today.
I'd rather stay home.
They could do without me for one day.
- Three minutes.
- Thank you.
Maybe I'll call again next Sunday.
But write me anyway, okay? Bye.
THE END
I have in my hand evidence from
Charlie Adamo in California.
Gennarino Esposito has kept
From our California election campaign fund.
How do you vote?
Graminia?
Guilty.
Portenci?
Guilty.
Bernadias?
Guilty.
Decatalo?
Guilty.
Demarco?
Though it hurts me, guilty.
You can call the coast.
Charlie, it's me.
Yes, it's done... thanks to you.
It was necessary, of course.
Wait a minute.
Charlie... we've had another death in the family.
Bye, father.
Run along, now. Bye.
The Royal Hotel -
Where the richest casino in Las Vegas
Has an unexpected visitor -
Charlie Adamo,
The newly elected boss of west coast operations.
Adamo, ambitious to add to his personal fortune,
Disregards orders from the top and moves swiftly
To stake his claim in this forbidden territory.
Wait here.
Hey, Abe, you better get out there.
There's a guy throwing up all over the crap table.
Let me sleep, huh?
Hey, Abe, get out there.
Your joint's burnin' up.
Adamo?
How are you?
You're lookin' good.
You know I love you, you son of a gun.
I love you.
W- What are you doing here,
Charlie?
What am I doin' here?
Looking for help.
That's what I’m doin'.
And you're asleep.
What's the matter with you?
A man's got to sleep.
What can I do for you,
Charlie?
Hey, look at that sun.
You know, you got terrific weather here in Vegas.
What's up, Charlie?
Oh, nothing.
Everything's fine.
I got no gig.
Except Mazzanga's breath.
Sat next to him on the plane coming down - Murder.
So everything's okay, huh?
I'm on top.
It's nice.
You know - From mulberry street to the top.
Who knows?
Maybe I got lucky.
Hey... but I’m up there.
Yeah, I heard.
You're in charge of the whole west coast now.
So what's your worry?
You know what, Abe?
We're not gettin' any younger.
What's on your mind,
Charlie?
What I’m talkin' about is an investment.
I'd like to put some money here in Vegas - Something nice.
You know what they say.
They say Vegas money grows fat, and that's right, isn't it?
I got Joni to think of.
Why didn't you say so?
I'll find you a good spot.
Give me a couple of days to scout it out a little.
I'll find you a place.
I found a place, Abe.
I'm standing in it.
I want to buy a piece of the action here.
Look, Charlie,
I’m only a manager.
How much is it gonna cost me?
Not even half a percent.
The owners won't sell.
Well, you tell the owners that I made a reasonable proposition
And I want a reasonable answer.
Otherwise, something unpleasant could happen to the casino,
And maybe also to them.
And, Abe... maybe to you.
Look, Charlie...
I’ll find you another -
A good place.
But the royal... forget it, huh?
Adamo, not forgetting the royal,
Has another plan ready -
A plan that calls for a specialist.
Hope I never see you again.
You're a lucky guy.
Full pardon after 12 years don't happen every day.
Here you go, Hank.
Sign right here, buddy.
Hope I don't see you again.
Well, so long, fella.
Good luck.
I guess you know already.
Rosemary's out.
I got her phone number.
It was worth it, eh?
What?
The fresh air.
That air cost 25,000 bucks.
You like it?
Say, how's it feel to be outside again after 12 years, dad?
Must be a change, huh?
Don't call me dad.
I've only seen you twice in my life.
All right?
Okay, Hank. Okay.
I'm Cudo.
Hi, Hank.
Hello.
Good to see you.
I'm Barclay, Mr. McCain.
Hey, McCain, you want a drink?
Hank...
I want to show you something.
I thought you'd like to wear something decent for a change.
I hope I guessed right on the measurements.
How do they look?
That door leads to the bathroom.
If you need something, just call me.
$25,000 is a lot of money.
What do you want?
I need you for a job.
Yeah?
But we'll have plenty of time to talk about it tomorrow.
Enjoy yourself today, Hank.
Here's your dog, buddy.
Looks like you haven't seen one of these in years.
Hey, you.
What's yours?
Go on in.
Show's on now.
Come on. Let's go.
Rosemary Scott?
This number's the one she gave to me.
No trace, huh?
Never mind.
Hey, I got it.
Baby, you got to hear this.
Why don't we flip for you, huh?
Oh, really.
Come on, Irene.
Huh?
Wait.
Excuse me.
What's with her?
Has she got hang-Ups or something?
How'd you meet her?
She works for a photographer I know.
Excuse me.
Hey, that seat's taken.
Scotch and soda.
Sport...
I said that seat's taken.
What's the matter?
You that lonesome?
Aw, come on.
Can't you see he's drunk?
Come on.
...or deaf.
...or else looking for trouble.
Hey, Irene!
We're over here.
Man, this chick is nowhere.
Look, we all like our little fun and games,
So let's settle it right now.
Hey, Irene, about before... no big tricks.
Who's it gonna be, baby?
Bob or me?
Do you know this guy?
No.
Do you have something going with him?
You know a guy once followed me from union square
To north beach?
You know what he wanted?
To sell me retirement properties.
That's not what this guy's after -
Not by a long shot.
Do you have a big turn-On for him?
Ugh!
Stay there.
Man: maybe you're right.
I think maybe we better leave.
All right, sweetheart.
Let's get out of here.
Got a car?
Over there.
I've been in prison...
12 years -
Armed robbery.
I, uh...
I’m looking for someone.
I need someone.
I don't believe you.
Yeah?
Where do you want to go?
Where do you live?
Hey...
Irene... all right, go inside.
Go on.
There's two million cash here, pop.
Who's behind you guys?
What do you mean,
"who's behind us"?
We've worked on this deal for two years.
We aren't with anybody-
Just us and you.
Don't get sentimental on me.
All right.
What's the story?
You know this place?
Vegas - The royal.
The safe on weekends is worth millions.
The royal, huh?
It's a new place.
Who owns it?
It's privately owned.
We thought of everything.
No problems.
Whose idea was this?
This your idea?
No. We all worked on it.
I thought out the details.
We need you, pop.
We need somebody with your kind of experience
To pull it off.
It'll be hard work.
It's up to you.
What do you say? plus expenses.
I decide that.
Plus an advance.
Is that right?
That's right.
Jack, can I talk to you alone for a few minutes?
Excuse us.
All right. Sit down.
Go on. Sit.
Cigarette?
Something wrong?
Who are those two slobs out there?
Cudo and Barclay.
They're good.
They're bums!
They're punks, they're fags, they're fringe nothings.
Now, whose idea was this?
It was mine.
It's good.
Thank you.
What do you do?
Sell women?
Sell marijuana?
What do you do?
Where'd you get the $25,000?
I wouldn't give you 25 cents.
What do you do?
You go out and you hustle yourself all over the street.
Small-Time.
No dignity!
You don't beg.
That's why, Hank.
I need this chance.
I get tired of being small change.
You're gonna be small change all your life.
All right, kid.
I like the plan.
I'll do it - My way.
And I don't want those two Hollywood fags
Standing in my way, either.
And I, uh,
I want an advance.
I need the money.
It's all ready.
Go get it.
Hey... don't worry.
Your daddy's here.
Well?
Everything's okay.
Now, this'll do for now.
I'll need more.
I'll call you.
So long, boys.
Fabulous.
12 years in prison and I still get a kick out of these lights.
They're beautiful.
They're not beautiful.
They're cheap.
It's an attraction... for sad, fat businessmen begging for more money... for hustlers, for thieves, for pimps.
I love it.
Hank...
I love you.
What's that? The royal?
Yeah.
It's a new place.
I love new places.
Come on. Let's see it!
Seven!
You're kidding.
Uh, one minute...
Irene?
Yes?
What?
Here. You do it.
How do you want it?
How do we want it?
In fives.
Fives -
Take it in fives.
In fives.
Right.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
I'm just thinking of all this dough.
Man: last six.
Hey, a game match.
Lady, both numbers.
All right, folks.
Place your bets.
Ball is rolling.
No more bets.
Thanks.
Any time.
Good! That's $500.
Woman:
I need some chips, honey.
There.
You all right?
Yes.
He's a real millionaire!
I'm gonna take this place for $2 million.
Understand? Do you?
All right.
Let's go. Come on.
Happy birthday, sir.
What the hell are you doing here?
Happy birthday,
Mr. Adamo.
What do you want?
I tried your office.
I had to talk to you.
He went for it.
My old man -
He went for it.
He wanted to know if I was covering for anyone else.
That's all.
Well, he's not stupid.
Now, don't worry about me,
Mr. Adamo.
I'm on top of this all the way.
How old are you?
Just do the right thing,
And I’ll take care of you pretty good.
You don't talk to me.
From now on, you talk to duke.
We don't know each other.
You understand?
Mm-Hmm.
Now get out of here.
Okay.
Your roll.
Here we go.
Gettin' hot and heavy.
Lady's hot.
Come on!
Man: new shooter coming out.
It's seven for the lady.
Who's betting next?
Come on, folks.
Don't be shy.
The lady's lucky.
Is all that mine?
Another one? All right.
Here we go!
And you?
What did you tell Adamo?
What could I say?
I certainly couldn't tell him you three are the real owners
Of the royal.
Oh, go on.
What did he say to you when you turned him down?
He made threats.
Maybe it's a mistake to keep Adamo
In the dark about the royal.
You know, uncle, we -
You just operate the royal so no one finds out who owns it.
It's best, huh?
Hmm.
Ah, gràzie.
Thanks, Abe.
We all appreciate very much your loyal behavior.
Bràvo.
Now enjoy a night in New York.
Pete, take Mr. Stilberman back downtown
And show him around the best places.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye.
Francesco: so long, Abe.
Francesco...
Carlo... now I want your advice.
Hey, Charlie!
What are you waitin' for?
What am I waiting for?
I'm waiting for a priest!
Come on, Charlie!
Hey, Charlie...
Charlie!
Hold it, hold it, hold it. One second.
Can I see you?
I'll be with you -
One minute.
Yeah, sure.
Pretty good, isn't he?
I think he's a lunatic.
Hmm.
What are you doing here?
I just heard you're gonna have company... arriving from New York.
Don Francesco.
Ah, come on, Charlie.
I just don't have the time.
Wait just a minute, will you?
When?
This evening.
Why?
Didn't say.
Charlie, I got a 3:00 appointment.
Relax a second.
Forget that, will you?
Do it later.
No, I’m gonna do it now.
Do you have any idea why?
No, I don't have any idea.
The only thing I know is that
I don't like it.
He don't call, nothing.
He just comes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Things here on the west coast couldn't be better.
Must be a routine check.
What the hell is he coming here for without warning?
Come on, Charlie.
You gonna talk or box?
I want some fun, so come on.
* soon... *
You said they would be on time, didn't you?
I told you this would happen.
They're always late.
You know that.
Who the hell do they think they are?
Next time, you'll listen to me,
And we'll leave the house an hour later.
Uh-Huh.
You need a haircut.
Charlie, I’m serious.
So am I.
Shut up.
*... soon *
* hurry up and come and give me *
* the love that I’ve waited for *
Frank.
How are you, Charlie?
Breaking even.
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
Margaret.
Nice to see you.
Welcome to Frisco.
* hurry up, I got a feeling your love is... *
Hello, Joni.
Hello, Margaret.
Hello.
How lovely to see you.
What an elegant tuxedo.
Really?
Do you like it?
What do you call this, a pair of pajamas?
Your wife has good taste in men, Charlie.
She's got good taste in money, too.
She likes it green.
Well, green is a good color.
The best.
Nice to see you again,
Mrs. Adamo.
Joni.
Okay. Joni.
*... soon *
* I know you're bound to come *
* come soon *
* soon *
So, how's things in New York, frank?
Hmm?
Smooth as oil... in New York.
*... soon *
* caress me... *
Charlie, why don't we take them somewhere more amusing,
Like the bocce bowl?
It's fun at the bocce bowl.
I'm sure you're tired and want to go home.
Charlie and I have to talk about business.
Boring business.
See you in an hour,
Charlie... in your office.
*... soon *
* soon *
When I was a boy,
I remember my father used to sing "o sole mio,"
And I used to accompany him like this.
Delicious.
Well, now to business, hmm?
Abe Stilberman.
He manages the royal in Vegas.
I'm sure you remember him.
Well, the other day, he came to
New York just to tell us
Someone had gone to him with a deal
Concerning his place.
What do you know about it,
Charlie?
Well, what did he tell you, exactly?
That you threatened him like an Al Capone.
And he got the best of you.
I never threatened him.
Hmm.
Listen, when we gave you the six western states,
You were told to lay off
Vegas and Reno,
Not to go there without asking us.
Right? Hmm?
Right.
So... what gave you the idea
You could stick your nose into
Abe’s place?
The Royal's ours, and by "ours,"
I mean Don Salvatore's, mine, and a few others.
Do you think we want an ape like you for a partner?
When I took over the west coast, it was full of apes,
And the operation was in the toilet.
Now, I straightened it out.
Me, nobody else.
Now I’m taking heat.
Why?! For what?!
How the hell do I run this district if I’m in the dark?!
What's the matter?!
I can't make an investment?!
I'm not allowed to make a dollar?!
I ain't got that right?!
When someone talks to us about rights,
He ends up like
Gennarino Esposito.
You know?
And with me, you don't raise your voice.
Frank, Frank, listen,
I thought the royal belongs to the competition.
I don't know that you're involved.
I always pushed you.
But this time, it's up to the disciplinary council.
Listen, Frank, I’m sorry, but I thought it was -
You shouldn't think!
Stay away from Vegas,
Charlie.
I don't want to have to tell you again.
Will you love her and comfort her,
Honor and keep her in sickness and in health?
Do me a favor, will you?
Screw off.
Yeah. Take care.
Well, Hank and Irene,
You have consented to gather in holy wedlock
And have witnessed this before others.
Amen.
Kiss her.
347, please.
There's a man over there waiting for you.
Thank you.
I've been looking for you every place in this town.
I'm Johnny Rocco.
Your son jack and his friends
Were the ones who sent me here.
You'd better call them,
Mr. McCain.
I don't know why exactly,
But something went wrong with the plan.
There is a little change.
You'd better call them,
Mr. McCain.
Well, what is it?
He rented a car and left with a girl.
Where'd they go?
Rocco didn't know.
What do you mean, he didn't know?
How can he not know?
What the hell are we paying him for, huh?
Huh?!
Easy, Charlie.
Easy.
You think something's happened?
Don't worry.
He got the order.
He tells me his old man's okay.
Tells me there's nothing to worry about.
But he'll be on his way here,
Mr. Adamo,
Right where you want him.
Watch him.
Keep him here.
No women, no liquor.
You understand?
Listen, Charlie, you can trust Hank.
He's okay.
You've taken care of everything.
Uh!
Charlie!
Crazy.
You better cool it.
You know, Rosemary's out.
She got a joint called the
Anchor on Main Street.
What's on your mind?
Thinking about going back into action?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're not throwing in with that son of yours?
What's wrong with my son?
Years ago, we'd as soon as starve
Than throw in with the likes of him.
You know, you're ignorant.
You're really ignorant.
Who does he work for?
Charlie Adamo.
Who else?
Adamo runs the whole west coast now.
I want a machine gun.
What?
You heard me.
Nothing?
No. It's 9:00 and that nut hasn't phoned yet.
Your gun's better off in my pocket.
Hmm?
His dad put on a good act.
I'll say that for him.
I don't think he was acting.
What if the call doesn't come in?
Why shouldn't it?
Well, all I know is if Mr. Adamo tells me to... kkkrrrreeee!
I gotta do it.
And, you know, it's a pity at your age
Not to be able to make it anymore.
You know, Jack, sometimes people bleed to death.
Go to hell!
You make me sick!
You just better pray... he calls.
Tell me where you're going?
No.
Okay.
Hello?
Hank?!
Hank, where the hell are you?
You gotta come back here,
Hank.
Hank, help me.
I don't care about your problems.
I'm gonna give it to you once.
I'm gonna give it to you slow.
The address is Daly city.
It's near freedom crossing.
It's a big construction company called Acme.
You can't miss it.
Now, you be there alone.
You be there by 10:30 sharp.
Otherwise, I won't be there.
Okay, sonny?
Bye-Bye.
Hank!
Hank?
Where are you?
I'm here, baby booby.
Let's hear about
Charlie Adamo, Jack.
What orders did he give you?
He gave you $25,000, didn't he?
Listen, Hank... there's no time to explain.
The royal job is off.
You and I have to -
The orders that he gives you, sonny boy,
Don't concern me.
You're a wonderful kid,
Jack... just wonderful.
Wonderful boy.
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
Forget the royal.
It's no longer our job.
Hank... believe me.
You're a stupid slob, jack.
Watch yourself.
Cudo and Barclay are waiting outside for you to come out.
I couldn't shake them.
Now, why should that be my problem?
It's not my problem.
It's your problem -
Waiting outside for both of us.
No. Not me.
But they said only you.
Why should they want me, too?
Hank... what do we do?
Scream.
Scream!
Aaaaah!
Hank?
H- Hank... everything all right?
Huh?
I said, "everything all right?," dumbo.
Yes, fine.
Hard to get, but I made it.
All right. Get your little tail out of here.
Bums.
Everybody around here does as he goddamn pleases!
Well, I had it!
I had it up to here!
Everybody's got something to say!
Talk, talk, talk!
But nobody tells me who owns the royal.
I didn't know.
You know that.
I'm in trouble right with you, Charlie.
I'm so close to the top,
I can smell it.
Come in.
Mr. Demarco's here to see you.
I thought he went back to New York this morning.
Hey, frank, how are you?
Hi, Charlie.
You should've called me.
I'd have sent a car.
Don't worry.
It's such a pleasure for me to walk in California.
How are you, Mazzanga?
Fine, Don Francesco.
May I?
Please.
I don't know why.
This city must make me feel young.
I got up real early this morning.
You know what I thought,
Charlie?
Why don't we all hop over to Las Vegas?
All right, Charlie?
It'll be a good idea to make peace with Abe.
You too, Mazzanga.
I know you like the place,
So here's your chance to see it again.
Oh,
I know what you like.
Thank you.
Are you avoiding us?
No, Joni.
You're blinding tonight.
How are you?
Just fine.
And you?
I feel marvelous.
I spent a very amusing afternoon going around Las Vegas.
I also won $2,000... shooting craps.
Fantastic.
Best of luck to you,
Don Francesco.
And to you.
Abe?
Excuse us.
Charlie... find a phone and call the kid's house.
Now, what's wrong?
You two still sulking over what happened?
I don't like fighting in the family.
It's not good... for you... for me... for everybody.
Shake hands.
Be friends.
Forget about it.
I'll flip you for the cost of the party,
And if I lose,
I'll throw in the price of the statue.
The insurance company paid for it already.
If you want to pay twice, okay.
Hey, you're a bandit.
Hey, frank, this guy's a regular bandit.
Come here, you bum, you.
I love you, too,
Charlie.
Here you are, sir.
I would like a little bit more of that.
The shrimp salad?
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.
Frank... yeah?
What - What's happening?
Why?
This sudden trip to Vegas?
Charlie's worried.
There's something going on.
Nothing.
Everything's been settled.
Has it?
Sure.
Wait... what's wrong?
I can't stand the west any longer.
You've absolutely got to get us to New York.
And what else?
Have Charlie transferred.
Joni, this isn't the time to talk about it.
Not now.
I've got to be... near you.
All right.
I'll do my best.
Man: all right, ladies, step over here.
Ladies, right over here.
Hi.
Man: okay, okay, we're all together now.
Please try not to get lost.
Gosh, darn it, every time I’m ready to leave here,
My pockets are clean and my shoes are dirty.
Yeah, me too.
Well, at least you're a winner.
Not a big one.
Man: what time is the show at the palace?
Man #2: at midnight, sir.
Woman: we'll be late.
It's just around the corner.
Have a good time, folks.
Thank you.
Hey.
Sir?
Will you take that to room 808?
They just went out, sir.
Well, take it up anyway, please.
Certainly.
Nasty business in your area,
Charlie.
Find out, so we know what's behind it.
Man: two on 17, but that's not all.
I left the table to come back up here,
And 17 came up the third time in a row.
Marvelous.
This is the fourth call
I’ve put through.
No answer.
Look at this.
Get me on a plane to Frisco.
Get the next plane.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.
Give me a hand here.
An explosion in a filling station.
Location - North Vegas freeway.
Man: attention, second brigade.
3- Alarm fire at Sierra
Lumberyard -
Second and Boulder, south
Las Vegas.
What the hell is it?
Find out what that is.
Man: there's nothing to worry about.
Charlie... do something.
What am I gonna do?
Where's frank?
Downstairs with Abe.
Does he know anything?
No, but he will if we don't turn up, but don't worry.
How could he know about
McCain?
Even if he finds out, we had nothing to do with it.
How much?
Enough.
Too much.
How much did we have in there?
The police -
Call the police!
I'll take care of it.
You take care of the place.
Yes, sir.
Understand?
Yes, sir.
Go on.
There are 18 people badly injured,
And another 20 or so not so bad.
That's all I could count so far.
Sheriff.
Yes, sir?
Well, a lot of noise, a lot of damage, but -
A lot of folks got hurt,
Mr. Demarco.
Yes, that's the most painful part of it, of course.
So, please... tell the people that our insurance company
Will pay them generously.
Let's not let the press
Overdo an episode of limited importance.
Can't have the prestige -
Come on -
The prestige of the royal compromised.
Would you be so kind as to take care of it yourself, would you?
Sure.
I'm very grateful.
Have a cigar.
Come on, sit down.
I also hope to be able to find whoever's responsible
As soon as possible.
Responsible for what?
But, Mr. Demarco, what about all the -
Who do you want to hold responsible
For an unforeseen breakdown of the air-conditioning plant?
Come on, sit down.
The fires that broke out at opposite ends of Las Vegas?
Why, coincidence, sheriff.
Coincidence.
Not even worth talking about.
Do you want to know something?
Within two or three months,
The royal will reopen more beautiful than before.
And, uh, this unpleasant...
...accident, will be completely forgotten.
Completely forgotten.
Believe me.
Excuse me, huh?
Irene: where are we going?
Hank: better lie low awhile.
Regan's a friend.
He'll put us up.
California, then?
First we go to Arizona, then we go to California.
All right, then, Duke... tell me the way it really was -
Point by point.
Don't leave anything out.
McCain was granted a pardon, they said.
Hmm.
Bène, Franco.
Si, it's so clear now.
Well, for the moment,
I want you in command of the west coast
Till I find another who's qualified.
Every one of us here in
Nuova York
Is available if you need us,
Franco.
Okay.
Bye.
Don Salvatore?
Peter, telephone to Mr. Bonadias and to Graminia
And also to Ortensi.
I want them all to come here at once.
And you are being assigned a special job in San Francisco.
Very good.
Man on radio: and in New York, the stock market closed
With the Dow Jones averages up three points.
A bomb scare panicked guests
At the royal hotel & casino in Las Vegas last night
Injuring several of its patrons.
The air-Conditioning plant
Erupted in a series of explosions
Fortunately causing only slight damage.
No appreciable loss was suffered by the casino.
Dallas - A tornado cut through -
Charlie Adamo.
Duke Mazzanga.
That's right, the weather's improved,
And the races will run on schedule.
No entries scratched so far.
Here's the lineup... hello? Yeah?
She's beautiful in the third at Saratoga.
$100 across the board.
Okay.
Yeah?
Body snatcher and gun rabbit, huh?
No, sonny boy's been scratched -
Been disabled, they say.
Countess Peggy?
Countess Peggy.
The pictures will be here in two hours
With lots of the girl -
All recent.
A few of McCain taken
12 years ago.
Okay.
Okay, yeah.
We have both names here in
Chicago.
We'll have some photos by 3:00.
Okay.
With $2 million at stake,
The organization network of operatives and contacts
Mounts a nationwide, round-The-Clock vigil
To block every means of escape.
They're boarding right now, sir.
We've got an 802 at Fifth and Main.
Ryan, report to Pershing Square
Station.
I thought you were on nights.
Well, I was,
And then they pulled me off night duty altogether,
Without a reason or anything.
Well, I don't ask questions.
Damned if I want to be transferred
To Watts or someplace.
You wait here.
Come on.
Come on.
Here.
Come on.
Rest.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Hey.
Hank, please!
Come on!
Good. Thanks.
They left the car in west Los Angeles.
That makes it easier.
Don't be smart, hmm?
Peggy, get me Los Angeles.
Watch yourself, Peter.
Yeah, don't worry about me.
Take it easy.
I can't anymore.
I can't anymore.
Sure, you can.
Come on.
Woman: I am loaded,
I want you to know.
Scott: that reminds me.
Well, you better not try that one again.
You gave the guy the business, huh?
McCain?
McCain?
I thought you'd turn up.
Hank, let him go.
Who is he?
He's nobody.
He just helps me around.
Get out.
It's okay, Steve.
I'll see you tomorrow.
It's a lot of work, you know, just staying alive.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not.
Okay.
Okay!
You're the only person in this world I can trust.
Come here.
You, come here.
Oh, Hank.
Hank, am I glad to see you.
Rosie, what a behind.
Mmm.
Oh, Hank, Hank, Hank.
Here we are like a couple of kids.
So what?
Right, so what?
Aah.
Boy, you really look morbid.
Oh, yeah? You don't look so hot yourself.
You're all grayed up.
So what? I got my personality to pull me through.
Oh, yeah, you're a real card.
Right. Time's short, right?
Yeah, life's short.
Yeah.
Look, you just tell me what I can do.
I got a couple of friends
I can trust.
Just - Just - Just tell me what to do.
Nothing!
Chuck Regan - He's got me a couple of passports.
Passports?!
Are you kidding?
They're watching everything that moves.
I don't know.
Mexico - What about Mexico?
No.
I might be able to find somebody that can get you there.
I'm not alone.
We're married.
Ah, she's a kid.
I got her on the beach with the $2 million.
With the what?
With the $2 million!
What beach?
On the -
On the whatchamacallit -
The, uh, Golden Sands.
Okay.
I'll get this set up.
I'll go get her.
It's been 12 years, Hank.
What the hell's left for us anyway?
Still, I never thought
I could do without you
While it lasted.
What a trip, huh?
Irene!
Irene!
Irene!
Irene, it's Rosemary!
Hank sent me for you!
Let's go.
Hurry!
Get down.
Okay.
Let's go.
Okay, it's all right.
He's got a cabin cruiser -
Long beach.
It's gonna cost you a hell of a lot,
But it's the best I can do.
You better stay here tonight.
All right.
You're coming?
You go ahead.
How'd you get tied up with a kid like that?
I don't like to be an
I- told-you-so,
But, uh, you should have come home.
No.
Hank: hey, Rosie.
Isn't it late for you to be coming home, Mrs. Scott?
Come in.
Please.
Sit down there, Rosemary.
Let's have a little talk.
Do you know who I am?
No...
...but I know what you are... and I know what you want.
Perfect. So we avoid wasting time.
Where's McCain?
You don't really think
I’m gonna tell you that?
I'm sure of it.
I can be very convincing.
Not with me.
Why? Are you so different from everybody else?
Yeah, I am.
Oh, yeah, I remember hearing all that crap about you two.
The machine-gun lovers -
Hank McCain...
...and Rosemary Scott.
That's right.
Hank McCain and I... are different from you.
Well, now... you just tell me where McCain is... and I’ll have the pleasure of making his acquaintance... and I’ll be able to find out how we're different.
Okay, Rosemary?
You might as well get it through your pretty head.
I'm not gonna tell you one damn thing.
Hmm.
I think you better...
...or you'll never want to look in a mirror again.
Well, before starting this beauty treatment,
Will you allow me to have one cigarette?
Sure, go ahead.
Do I have to go alone?
Better not be seen together.
All right, go ahead.
Is it too breezy for you?
No, it's fine, thank you.
Chingada.
Hey, you're crazy.
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go now.
Let's get out of here!
Move that car.
All right, Irene, come on.
Just tell him it's the money we want.
All you do is convince him to give it up.
Ugh!
No!
Hey-Ey-Ey!
All right, you bastards!
* No one knew better than McCain *
* that a man who thinks he's free *
* knocks his head against the wall *
* No man knew better than McCain *
* just how bitter it would be *
* to be beaten after all *
* No one knew better than McCain *
* they're the ones who fix the game *
* they're the ones with loaded dice *
* No one knew better than McCain *
* but they got him all the same *
* and they made him pay the price *
