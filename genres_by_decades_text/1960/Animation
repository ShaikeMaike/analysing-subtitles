Dr. Grant, Dr. Pierce...
- ... can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
Paul. Greg. Brad.
Now this is a tough assignment.
But if this mission is successful, you will be the first men to land on Mars.
This project has been the most costly yet devised by man.
However, the safety of the crew and passengers still takes top priority.
Now is that clearly understood?
Captain Paul Travers?
Yes, sir.
- Space Captain Greg Martin?
- Yes, sir.
- Space Navigator Brad Newman?
- Yes, sir.
- Dr. Grant?
- Yes, sir.
- Dr. Pierce?
- Yes, sir.
OK. Away you go, and good luck.
Thank you, sir.
All right, this is it.

Air-sea rescue is on its way. 
Flight deck to escape unit. Ready, Greg?
- OK, Paul. All in position.
- OK, Greg. 
Coming back now.
Stand by.
Here we go!
(chatter)
- Gentlemen.
- (men fall silent)
You've now had time to study the fine report...
...that has been produced by our aviation investigators.
We at the Martian Exploration Center thank those concerned...
...for their untiring efforts in this direction.
Although the report runs to 862 pages and meticulously describes...
...every happening that led up to the crash 24 months ago...
...the conclusion is all too simple: Sabotage.
Now, before we progress, I would ask you for a vote of confidence...
...in the findings of this very fine report.
Thank you, gentlemen, for your unanimous support.
24 months have now elapsed since the tragic crash of the Zero X.
In eight weeks, Earth will again be in a suitable position in relation to Mars...
...to make the second attempt.
Can I take it that I have your approval for this, too?
I think our security arrangements are inadequate...
...and suggest we ask International Rescue to be present at the next launching.
Are you suggesting we are incapable of handling our own security arrangements?
I have 862 pages here, sir, which say just that.
(uproar)
Well, Father?
Takeoff is scheduled for tomorrow.
- You'll have to make a decision soon.
- Even if it's no!
This is a tough one. I know how you boys feel. I guess you're rarin' to go.
But as you know, we have a strict rule here:
...no International Rescue craft is launched unless someone is in grave danger.
- Right?
- Right.
- Guess so, Dad.
- That's the way it's always been.
- Guess you're right, Dad.
- Yeah.
However... rules were made to be broken.
Now, this is what we do.
- Scott.
- Yes, sir?
Launch Thunderbird 1, go to Glenn Field and stand by...
...for the takeoff of Zero X.
- Yes, sir!
Virgil, launch Thunderbird 2 and follow Scott to Glenn Field.
When Zero X takes off, escort it on the first part of its journey.
- Yes, sir.
- Father, can I...?
Yes. Launch Thunderbird 3 and orbit the Earth...
...until Zero X has established its course to Mars.
- Gee! Thanks, Dad.
- What about me, Father?
It's unlikely that you'll be needed, but be ready, in case.
- Yes, sir.
- OK, boys.
Thunderbirds are go!
Thunderbird 1... ready to go.
OK, Scott, clear to go. Good luck.
Thanks, Father.
Well, you made your decision, Mr. Tracy.
Yes. I only hope it was the right one.
Now that the boys are going to be at the launching of Zero X...
...the safety of the crew is assured, but...
But what about the saboteurs?
Do you think they will strike again?
Say... what's the time, Tin Tin?
The time? Uh... just about eleven o'clock, Mr. Tracy.
That makes it about 4pm in England - tea time.
I don't understand, Mr. Tracy.
Well, those saboteurs you were talking about. If they do strike again...
...I know just the person to take care of them.
Will that be all, m'lady?
Thank you, Parker. That will be all.
Very good, m'lady.
(bleeping)
International Rescue, England.
Lady Penelope speaking.
(Mr. Tracy) Hi, Penny. 
Well, I've made my decision. 
We're gonna oversee the Zero X launch. 
Thunderbirds 1, 2 and 3 are on their way.
Go to the States immediately and ensure that there's no sabotage attempt this time.
FAB, Jeff. I'll fly over with FAB 1 right away.
Now, I'll need to move around there freely on this type of assignment.
Can you pull a few strings to see that I get the necessary passes?
Will do, Penny. There's a big press conference tomorrow evening.
- You'll represent a British magazine.
- FAB, Jeff. 
You rang, m'lady?
Yes, Parker. Get out the Rolls-Royce.
I'll call the airport - we're taking off for America with FAB 1 immediately.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
You are clear to land.
Mobile Control from Thunderbird 2. FAB.
Well... I guess we're all set.
By morning, Thunderbird 3 will be in position to observe the launch path...
...and we've got all our gear here.
- Thanks.
I guess that's all we can do for the moment.
See you at the press conference tonight.
No, thanks. As far as we're concerned, the only good publicity is no publicity.
And in conclusion, as I always say, the only bad publicity is no publicity.
So have a good conference, but please be brief.
Our astronauts can only spare you half an hour...
...as they have a very busy schedule ahead of them tomorrow.
- Captain Travers?
- Yes, ma'am?
I'm Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, representing The Universal Mirror. 
First question: Tell me, what do you find most frightening?
The ordeal of this press conference or your flight tomorrow in Zero X?
(chuckles) Without question, this press conference, ma'am.
Thank you, Captain Travers.
Now, I'm sending a messenger over with a small St Christopher...
...specially struck for the occasion by The Universal Mirror. 
I would like to tell my readers that you'll be wearing it during the flight.
- It'll be a pleasure, Lady Penelope.
- That's very kind of you.
Well, it looks as if my time is up.
Best of luck for tomorrow.
- (line buzzes)
- Captain Paul Travers.
Package from Lady Penelope,
Universal Mirror, sir.
Right.
There'll be three crew and two scientists. Right...
Right again.
Yep, at 1400 hours tomorrow.
That's right. Six weeks and two days.
I'm afraid I can't answer that question.
I'm afraid you'll have to refer that question to the PRO.
Why, sure. We'll do anything to help the press.
I've got a feeling that the takeoff tomorrow is gonna be just fine.
60 minutes to liftoff.
Commence Zero X pre-flight assembly.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
- Are you ready, Virgil?
- Standing by, Scott.
Mobile Control calling Thunderbird 3.
OK, Scott, in orbit.
I should see Zero X as it leaves the Earth's atmosphere.
- Unless liftoff time is altered. 
- FAB, Alan.
Now, m'lady?
Now, Parker.
(bleeping)
(long bleep)
Channel 1, m'lady.
(bleeping)
Good. That's all right.
(bleeping)
(long bleep)
Channel 2, m'lady.
Clear launch apron. 
Zero X moving into position. 
(bleeping)
Channel 5, m'lady.
Thank you, Parker.
- Trouble, Parker.
- I thought it was too good to be true.
Lady Penelope calling Scott at Mobile Control.
- What's the trouble, Lady Penelope?
- Number 5 negative.
OK. Penelope, here's what we do. 
The countdown must continue... 
... or we miss the rendezvous
with Thunderbird 3 in space. 
I'll attend to number 5.
Meanwhile, locate Dr. Grant. 
FAB.
This is Assembly Control. 
Radio-controlled lifting body 2
about to take up its position. 
Everybody OK?
Yeah. Yeah... fine.
Everything's just fine.
And how about you, Dr. Grant?
Are you OK?
Keep quite still, Doctor.
There's something wrong with your...
...face!
- (Dr. Pierce) He's got a gun!
Allow yourself ten seconds before coming through this door after me.
Otherwise, you might get your head blown off.
I think I've located number 5, m'lady.
That's him, Parker.
Well done. Number 5 was a phony,
but he's got away. Take care of him. 
Right, Scott. Leave it to me.
But before I go, you'll find the real Dr. Grant on a bearing of 1 7 4...
...and a range of 1,204 yards from my present position.
FAB.
I can see the gentleman in question ahead, m'lady.
He's just leaving the control tower in a motor car.
Right, Parker... away we go.
(car horn)
(horn blares)
Now, you'll find the real Dr. Grant somewhere in this building here.
Right.
Airport police. This is Assembly Control.
Search the missile store, block F, immediately...
...and locate Dr. Grant's whereabouts.
Providing he's OK, bring him over to Central Control immediately.
Roger, Control. 
- Say, how do you know all this?
- A pretty little bird told me.
- He's got a good start on us, m'lady.
- Yes, I can see him down below.
My guess is he's making for that motorboat by the jetty.
- How're you feeling, Dr. Grant?
- Just fine.
He just held me at gunpoint, tied me up, and locked me in the missile store.
Guess it's another sabotage attempt.
What beats me is how you knew where I was.
All you need to know is that the launch is taking place as per schedule.
OK, sir.
So much for the good-luck charm given to me by Lady Penelope.
- Safety belts on, m'lady?
- Safety belts on, Parker.
Lowering hydrofoils now, m'lady.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it!
Takeoff lighting.
It looks as if an accomplice is waiting to pick him up in that helicopter, m'lady.
It's an army 'elicopter, m'lady, and no doubt it's 'eavily armed.
Well, let's hope they attack, Parker.
Then we may have an opportunity to shoot it down.
Mobile Control to Thunderbird 2.
Launching underway.
- You'd better lift off yourself.
- Thunderbird 2. FAB.
- Stand by to take evasive action, Parker.
- Yes, m'lady.
Now, m'lady?
Now, Parker.
Just a little bit over to the right, old son.
Thank you very much.
I don't think there's much point in looking for survivors, Parker.
No, m'lady.
(planes approaching)
Look, m'lady!
- Look!
- What a magnificent sight!

- OK. Thanks, Alan. Return to base.
- FAB.
International Rescue calling Zero X.
Congratulations on a superb liftoff.
Our services were not required... 
... although a sabotage attempt
was made just before liftoff. 
But we took care of it.
The rest is up to you.
International Rescue from Zero X.
Dr. Grant has just told us about it.
The only thing we really want to say is thanks.
And may I add my thanks and congratulations, too.
You did pretty well yourself.
Mobile Control from FAB 1. Are we clear?
Hi, there, Penelope. All clear. 
I'm on my own. Well, how'd it go?
- FAB.
- Well done, Penelope. 
Well, it's been a hectic time for all of us.
How about us all getting together tonight over a drink?
I hear there's a fab nightclub called the Swinging Star near my hotel.
FAB.
Hi there, Penelope. I just happened to be
monitoring your frequency and I, uh... 
Well? What do you say, Virgil?
Are you game?
I sure am!
You're going where?
Ah, the, uh... to the Swinging Star, Father.
It's some kind of nightclub.
That means you won't be back till morning.
(humming)
Sure, I understand - you need a break.
But this is a tough job we're doing here.
Mr. Tracy, all work and no play makes Scott a dull boy.
Hm... OK then, Scott. Have a good time.
Gee thanks, Dad. Glenn Field will be able to reach us by radio at any time.
Don't forget, Dad, we'll be at the Swinging Star.
Right, Scott.
- The Swinging Star?
- Yeah, it's some sort of a nightclub.
- They're all going out to celebrate.
- A nightclub?
And I'm stuck back here at base. Just my luck!
Say, Tin Tin... why don't we go off to the mainland tonight - just the two of us?
That would be lovely, Alan.
I'll wear my new dress.
What goes on around here?
Have you all gone crazy?
This is International Rescue, remember?
We can't leave the base unmanned.
- Sorry, Tin Tin.
- That's all right, Mr. Tracy. I understand.
Well, I don't!
- I'm going to bed.
- But won't you have some coffee?
No, thanks. It keeps me awake.
(moaning)
(Scott) We're all going
to the Swinging Star. 
(Mr. Tracy) No, Alan. 
Have you gone crazy?
We can't leave the base half-manned. 
Penelope, you're 30 seconds late.
The Swinging Star... Sounds great!
- (car horn peeps)
- Why, here she is!
Why, hello there, Penny.
- Have I kept you waiting?
- Of course not. You're dead on time.
Where to, m'lady?
Why... the Swinging Star, of course.
- Now, m'lady?
- Now, Parker.
Why, we're flying!
That's right.
Turn right just past planet Mars...
...and you should see the Swinging Star straight ahead of you, Parker.
Right, m'lady.
There it is, m'lady. Straight ahead.
- Gee! It's fabulous!
- I thought you'd like it.
No parking problem here, m'lady.
(# electric guitar instrumental)
Wow! What a terrific group.
Yes. They always play at the Swinging Star.
You see, they're way-out. 
Say, Penelope... how... how did you enjoy your night here with Scott and Virgil?
Oh, we didn't come to this Swinging Star.
- Oh, really?
- No. This is reserved especially for you.
Oh... uh...
Gee! Have some more champagne.
(snoring)
(compere) Now, ladies and gentlemen, we present the biggest star in the universe:
...none other than Cliff Richard Junior!
# Sometimes I feel you are cheating me
# Then you kiss me and my mind is free
# But then I think I should let you know
# That I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# I saw you in someone else's car
# You told me that he won't go too far
# That may be so
# But you let him know
# That I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# You tell me that I'm the man for you
# But you do things you should never do
# So now, hear this warning once again
# Yes, I got friends
# So, baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
# If you don't stop making me lose face
# I will have you put up there in space
# So just do what I'm a-telling you
# Cos I got friends
# Baby, listen to me
# A shooting star will shoot you
# And Mars will go to war
# The man in the moon will jump on you
# If you don't love me no more
- What an evening!
- It isn't over yet, Alan. The night is young.
- Come on, let's dance.
- Yeah, let's dance.
(bleeping)
Alan Tracy, International Rescue.
Oh, Alan, sorry to disturb you,
but this is an emergency. 
Look, Father, can't Scott and Virgil handle this? I'm kind of tied up right now.
I'm afraid Scott and Virgil are away
enjoying themselves, as usual. 
You are the only one I can rely on, Alan. 
I quite understand, Dad.
I'll be down right away.
FAB.
- Penelope, we've got to go.
- Oh, Alan! Must we?
Penelope, I'm afraid we must. Duty calls.
But is there no way you can get out of this?
Look, Penelope, Dad needs me.
He's depending on me.
I've just got to go.
Mind the gap, m'lady, when you step into the car.
Thank you, Parker. We don't want to fall back to Earth, do we?
Mind the gap, Alan.
Mind the gap, Alan.
Mind the gap, Alan.
I can't possibly make it!
What's the matter, Alan?
What's the matter, Alan?
Don't tell me - you're afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- A brave astronaut like you, afraid?
I am not afraid!
(Penelope's laughter echoes)
(thud)
Alan?
Alan, are you OK?
Alan! Alan, where are you?
Gee!
Sorry, Dad.
I... I guess I fell out of bed.
I've had a word with Brains. He says this modification is possible. Right, Brains?
- Check.
- What the heck are you talking about?
Oh, come on, you two!
The water's lovely and warm.
Thunderbird 4 at your service.
Catch!
Can't a guy get any peace around here?
Wish John was here to enjoy the fun.
But someone's got to man the space satellite.
(Paul) Zero X to Earth. We have just
touched down successfully on Mars. 
All systems are go. Will radio a full report
to you in 30 minutes' ground elapse time. 
(bleeping)
Go ahead, John.
Father, I was just listening to
the Zero X transmission to Earth. 
They've safely landed on Mars. Thought
you'd all be interested to hear the news. 
Thanks, John. Keep in touch.
FAB.
Listen, everyone! Just heard from John.
After six weeks in space,
Zero X has safely landed on Mars.
- Well, Dr. Grant? What do you think?
- We need to get as many samples...
...back to Earth as possible, so we can look into the possibility of life on Mars.
Sure, but what's your initial reaction?
The atmosphere would be breathable, but too thin to sustain life as we know it.
The early Martian photographs are going to prove right:
...there's no water up here.
- You can tell this from your instruments?
80 per cent instruments,
20 per cent intuition.
I agree with all Dr. Grant has just said.
But I've always been fascinated by that phrase "Life as we know it".
I have a feeling that we may encounter life as we don't know it.
These strange formations seem to be all over the planet's surface.
Don't ask me why... but they worry me.
Ray, don't let your imagination run riot.
Yeah, Tony, I know it would be all too easy to happen up here...
...but can you account for the strange rock formations?
A considerable study will have to be made before we know the answer.
But, um, my first impression is that...
...when the crust of the planet was very thin, it was struck by meteorites.
As they punctured the shell, so the hot rock exuded onto the planet's surface...
...like toothpaste out of a tube.
- A good theory, Tony.
Now explain to me how the exuding rock wrapped itself into a coil.
Ray, you've got a point.
This is one of the many things we have to investigate.
We're behind schedule. Can we move on?
Sure. Sorry.
Ray, I don't like the look of these peculiar formations either...
...though I'm sure they're just rock.
There's no sign of movement.
We'd better take a sample back to Earth.
I must say, I think that would be a wise precaution, Tony.
Can you break one up for us, Paul?
I'll go out and collect some pieces.
Sure.
OK, Paul, not too big a charge now -
I want to get a sizeable piece.
OK, Ray.
- And, Paul.
- Yeah?
As soon as you fire, I recommend you stand by at the ready.
Stand by at the ready? What for?
I don't really know.
I've just got a feeling, that's all.
Right... I'll go and get my gear.
- Greg, get the airlock ready.
- OK, sir.
Dr. Pierce! Come back in here, quickly!
Zero X from MEV. We're under attack from a form of life we do not understand.
Require immediate rendezvous with main body.
I'm just coming round on third orbit.
Will be in position in four minutes.
We'll take evasive action until you're in position.
- Give us liftoff clearance when it's OK.
- Will do. 
But we must lift off immediately. We don't know what damage they can do to us.
Doctor, we can't lift off until the main ship's in the correct rendezvous position.
Otherwise, we'll be stranded in space.
Greg, there's a whole line of them ahead.
We'd better return their fire. We can't take too much of this punishment.
OK, skipper. So far, all systems are go.
Zero X from MEV.
How are we doing, Brad?
Approaching orbital position.
Starting countdown.
Rendezvous liftoff: Minus 100...
- ... 34... 33... 32... 
- Skip the countdown. We're lifting off.
- Paul, you may not have enough fuel!
- We've no choice. We're coming up.
Greg, lift off.
- Leaving atmosphere.
- Right.
MEV from Zero X. I have you on screen.
You're approaching Zero X orbital path.
Five seconds to retro firing.
Four... three...
... two... one. Retros!
Thanks, Brad.
Guess we'll make it OK now.
All systems here appear to be at green.
OK, Paul, stay where you are - conserve your fuel. I'm coming up right behind you.
At least the Martian excursion vehicle has joined up with the main body of Zero X.
These, uh, so-called rock snakes,
Father - what do you make of them?
Well, clearly, there's life on Mars.
But I guess it's not life as we know it.
You, uh... you think they'll get back OK?
According to the reports John monitored in the space station...
...the damage to the MEV has not impaired their efficiency.
As a matter of fact, I, um...
...I had a word with the controller at Glenn Field this morning.
He said their re-entry into Earth's atmosphere will be straightforward.
They've done it a hundred times before on test flights.
What's the scheduled date for the re-entry, Dad?
Well, their flight takes them six weeks...
...so they should be arriving on the morning of September 2.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Pierce, are you ready for re-entry?
- OK, Greg, we're ready.
- Roger. 
OK, skipper, all set.
Central Control, this is Zero X.
Computer reports fire retros 30 seconds.
Ground stations, verify countdown.
You have our green light. Five seconds...
...four... three...
...two... one. Retros.
(female operator) Central Control
from Goldstone. Retro firing A-OK.
Zero X re-entry attitude correct. 
(male operator) Woomera to Central
Control. Verifying Goldstone's report. 
Zero X from Central Control.
You are in correct re-entry attitude and
are about to enter Earth's atmosphere. 
Roger, Central Control.
Retros.
Zero X from Central Control.
Lifting bodies now at 50,000 feet.
Radio control over to you in five seconds...
... four... three... 
... two... one. 
Over. 
OK, Paul, we've got the lifting bodies under our own radio control now.
Rendezvous with lifting bodies at 120,000 feet: 20 seconds.
Reduce speed to Mach 2.
Rendezvous about to take place.
Right, hold her steady, skipper.
I'm bringing in lift body 2.
Roger.
Keep her steady, skipper.
(flat beep)
Radio-control failure. I can't hold her!
What's happened?
Central Control, this is Zero X.
Emergency!
We have lost lift body 2 in a collision caused by a fault in our radio-control unit.
I'll send up another lift body immediately.
That won't help - the locking gear was damaged in the collision.
(Paul) Check on all systems shows
fuel systems go. All control systems go. 
Remote-control radio circuits
are dead. Escape unit is... 
Central Control from Zero X.
Escape-unit circuits are dead!
OK, John, I get the picture.
- Continue to monitor their frequency.
- FAB.
Right. Now, we've got to move fast.
Zero X is coming in on one wing.
It's impossible to get another wing attached.
She's unable to maintain height and will crash in about 30 minutes.
The most recent check shows that they have an escape-unit failure.
Unless we get the crew out before they hit the ground, they are all doomed men.
Scott, you know what to do. Take Brains with you for technical advice.
Yes, sir.
Virgil, take pod 4, with the air-to-air rescue equipment...
...and rendezvous with Zero X.
- Alan!
- Yes, sir.
I want you to board the Zero X and fix that hatch.
- Father?
- Yes, Gordon, you'll be needed too.
Yes, sir!
Tin Tin, I'll want your help.
Thunderbirds are go!
Maximum speed, Scott.
We're gonna need all the time we've got.
Mm-hm.
Zero X from Central Control. 
What is your rate of descent now,
and what is your air speed?
Rate of descent: Stabilized at 3,000 feet a minute. Air speed: Mach 1.2.
We can't slow the rate of descent -
the motors are flat out. Over. 
Zero X, roger. Stand by.
Emergency Control, this is Central Control.
Contact Washington immediately.
Zero X crash position established as Craigsville - population 4,800.
Impact time: 35 minutes.
So you'll need to move!
International Rescue, Zero X Central
Control here. This is an emergency!
This is International Rescue,
Thunderbird 1.
Anticipated your call. We're on our way.
ETA Glenn Field: Ten minutes.
Will you give Thunderbird 2 a course
to steer for a rendezvous with Zero X?
- They're on this frequency. 
- Roger.
Thunderbird 2 from Central Control.
I'm passing a steer to you.
Zero X's present position
is international fix system 2-4-0-4... 
- ... on a heading of 143 magnetic. 
- Roger, Central Control.
I've tried everything in the book, but the escape unit system is dead.
If only International Rescue had been with us this time.
Zero X, this is Central Control. 
Change to channel 4.
International Rescue are on their way. 
They require to make contact. 
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir. Changing to channel 4.
I'll be glad when Scott's got his Mobile Control operating.
We'll need his assistance in locating the Zero X.
We must be getting pretty close by now.
I'll get my rescue gear on.
- Gordon, get up to the astrodome.
- OK, Virgil.
Zero X, this is International Rescue
Mobile Control. Can you hear me? Over. 
International Rescue, this is Zero X.
We hear you, loud and clear.
Zero X and Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
Transmit ten seconds of unmodulated carrier wave on this frequency.
One at a time, please.
- Zero X.
- Zero X. Roger. 
- Thunderbird 2.
- Roger, Thunderbird 2.
Thunderbird 2 from Mobile Control.
Steer 0-0-2. Fly at 45,000 feet.
With your present air speed, you should sight Zero X in about four minutes.
Roger. Will do.
- What do you intend to do?
- We hope to put a man aboard Zero X.
If we succeed, we may be able to fix the escape unit. Excuse me.
- Zero X, this is Mobile Control.
- Mobile Control, this is Zero X.
Here are your instructions. Follow them precisely if the rescue is to succeed.
Go ahead.
There are approximately 15 minutes left before your aircraft crashes.
For the next ten minutes, lose as little height as possible.
Keep your aircraft steady. 
Watch the trim. 
In ten minutes, switch to automatic pilot
and go into the escape unit. 
And then... pray.
Till then, take further instructions from Thunderbird 2.
Mobile Control, this is Zero X.
Your instructions will be complied with.
Thanks.
- What are they gonna do?
- We may learn more from Thunderbird 2.
Scott! I can see it.
Alan, Gordon, stand by.
Zero X dead ahead.
FAB, Virgil.
Zero X, this is Thunderbird 2.
We're coming in below you.
Reduce speed to low safe cruising and lower nose landing gear.
We're gonna put a man aboard
to fix the escape unit. 
- So that's what they're going to try to do.
- It's suicide!
- Release air brakes, Greg.
- Right.
Lower nose wheel, Greg.
Thunderbird 2, this is Zero X.
Lowering nose wheel.
Are you sure you want to try this?
It sounds mighty dangerous to me.
It is mighty dangerous, and we do
want to try it. Now hold her steady. 
- Gordon, flight control over to you.
- OK, Virgil.
Left, left. One degree.
Right, right. Two degrees.
Right, Virgil.
- Stand by to hold position.
- OK, Gordon. 
Now!
Good shooting, Gordon.
Zero X, this is Thunderbird 2, air-to-air rescue compartment.
Keep it dead steady. Man coming aboard.
- (Paul) Roger, Thunderbird 2.
- OK.
How are you doing, Thunderbird 2?
Fine. Just keep steady, that's all.
Slow right down... and... stop!
- Give me a time check, Gordon.
- You've got four and one half minutes. 
Mobile Control from Alan.
OK, Brains. 
On the right of the master cylinder...
...that supplies power to the hydraulic system of the nose wheel...
...you will find a yellow wiring harness.
Follow this through to a red junction box marked "EUC".
Got it.
Doctors Grant and Pierce, hold tight.
I'm removing you to escape unit.
OK, Paul.
OK, Paul.
OK... cover removed.
Place transistorized-radio-induction unit on the side of the junction box.
- OK, Brains.
- Right, Alan. 
Now, all you have to do... 
... is remove the screws that are
anchoring the yellow and green lines... 
... and reconnect them on one block... 
...so we get a direct link, green to yellow, all the way down the bank.
OK, Brains. Time check, please.
- Two and one quarter minutes. 
- Right.
Brad, Greg, I'm sending you both back to the escape unit.
Right, sir. Switching to automatic pilot.
No, don't switch to the automatic pilot.
I'm staying here.
I'll come back when we're at zero feet.
That guy's risking his life.
It's the least I can do.
- I'll stay with you.
- Me, too.
No! There won't be time for us all to get into the escape unit at the last moment.
I'm sending you two back now.
And that's an order!
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, Paul.
Zero X from Thunderbird 2.
Are you all in escape unit?
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X.
All in escape unit except me.
I can do better than the automatic pilot in holding this craft steady.
I'll go back into the escape unit when it's fixed, or when we're at zero feet.
It'll help. Thanks.
He won't be able to make it in time, surely?
- They're all running out of time.
- How are you doing, Alan?
OK.
- How much time have I got?
- One minute. 
Gordon! Alan isn't through yet, and we're dangerously near the ground.
Play out more cable.
I'm coming alongside Zero X.
OK, Virgil. 
Glenn Field, this is Washington. 
Evacuation of Craigsville is complete. 
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X.
Is he through yet?
No, not yet. 
I'll overrun my engines to give us a few more seconds.
Zero X from Thunderbird 2.
Into escape hatch immediately!
Alan from Virgil. Jump at end of five-second countdown.
Five... 
... four... 
... three... two... 
... one. 
Now!
Now, Scott! Now!
Are you OK, Alan?
OK, Virg. Did they make it?
This is Thunderbird 2 calling
Zero X escape unit. Are you OK?
Thunderbird 2 from Zero X escape unit. 
Yes, we are OK. Paul only just made it. 
He's badly shaken up,
but he's gonna be all right. 
- Did you hear that, Alan?
- I heard.
- Did you hear that, Central Control?
- We heard. Well done!
Virgil from Gordon.
We can't retrieve Alan.
Due to his hurried departure, the cables are fouling the side of Thunderbird 2.
- We'd better drop him to the ground.
- FAB, Gordon. 
Say, Virgil, I think that's FAB 1 below!
Thunderbird 2 from FAB 1.
Virgil, we're down below.
Why not drop Alan down here?
Yeah, Penelope, I can see you!
Say, how did you get here?
As soon as we heard the forecast crash position, we made our way here.
OK, I'm down. Cable released.
Gee, it sure was swell of you to come here and pick me up, Penelope.
After that brilliant performance, I think that's the least you deserve. Now jump in.
I assume, madam, that the first call will be Glenn Field...
...and then on to your hotel.
Is that correct?
That, Parker, is quite correct.
Gee! You mean you're going to take me to the Swinging Star?
- Just the two of us?
- Just the two of us.
It's like a dream... come true.
Gee... this must be the most memorable day of my life.
You know, Penelope, I'm always treated like a kid back at the base.
You know, being the youngest and all.
But tonight, being alone with you,
I feel like a real grown man.
But you are, Alan. You are.
Particularly with that snazzy moustache you're wearing.
- It adds years to you, Alan.
- Well, uh...
We have to wear a disguise sometimes when we're out in public...
...in case we're recognized.
Do you really think it suits me?
Excuse me, Alan. I think the gentleman on the next table wants something.
Hm?
Would you mind passing that ashtray?
- Disguise. Pretty good, eh?
- Why, Dad! What are you doing here?
Just thought I'd come and congratulate you on your great performance today.
- Me too, Alan. A great job.
- Scott!
Thanks to you, Alan, another International Rescue success.
Virg! Who else is here?
And I think it was a splendid effort,
I really do. Even though I can't see you.
Thanks, Brains. And I guess the little lady with you must be Tin Tin.
Yes, Alan. Congratulations on your performance today -
...and tonight.
And there was I, thinking we were all alone!
Remember, Alan...
...one of the most comforting feelings a man can have in this world of ours...
...is never to be alone.
To Alan, the hero of the day!
To Alan!

SkyFury
A legend is sung
Of when England was young
And knights were brave and bold
The good king had died
And no one could decide
Who was rightful heir to the throne
It seemed that the land
Would be torn by war
Or saved by a miracle alone
And that miracle appeared
In London town
The sword
In the stone
And below the hilt in letters of gold... were written these words:
"Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil... is rightwise king born of England."
Though many tried for the sword with all their strength... none could move the sword nor stir it.
So the miracle had not worked.
And England was still without a king.
And in time, the marvellous sword was forgotten.
This was a dark age... without law and without order.
Men lived in fear of one another... for the strong preyed upon the weak.
A dark age indeed!
Age of inconvenience.
No plumbing... no electricity... no nothing!
Oh, hang it all!
Hang it all!
Oh, now what?
Now what?
Leave, leave off!
Leave off!
Oh, you, you, you fiendish chain you!
Everything complicated.
One big medieval mess.
Now, uh, let me see.
He should be here in,
I'd say half an hour.
Who? Who? I'd like to know who.
I told you, Archimedes.
I am not sure.
All I know is that someone will be coming. Someone very important.
Oh, pig feathers!
Fate will direct him to me so that I, in turn... may guide him to his rightful place in the world.
Huh! And-And you say he will arrive in half an hour?
Ha! Well, we'll just see.
And you will, Archimedes.
You will.
Ow!
He'll be, uh, a boy.
Small boy.
Eleven, 12 years old.
And a scrawny little fellow.
Oh, no, no.
That can't be the one.
Surely not. Why, that big lad must be close onto 20.
Ah. There he is.
The scrawny little fellow about 12.
He's a regular little grasshopper.
Look at him go.
And where-- where would you guess he is at this very moment?
I am not guessing,
Archimedes!
I know where he is!
Less than a mile from here just beyond the forest.
And right on schedule, if-if all goes well.
- Quiet, Wart.
- I'm tryin' to be.
And nobody asked you to come along in the first place.
- I'm not even movin'.
- Shut up.
Aha! Here we go.
Oh, what a set-up.
Right smack through the old gizzard.
Whoa. What? Oh!
Why, you clumsy, little fool!
Oh, Kay, please, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it. Please.
If I ever--
If I ever get my hands on, on you, I'll, I'll ring... your scrawny little neck, so help me, I will.
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.
Don't tell me you're going in there.
Why, it's swarming with wolves.
I'm not afraid.
Well, go ahead.
It's your skin, not mine.
Go on, go on.
There it is.
Oh, there it is.
Whoa! What-- Oh!
Well.
So, you, you did drop in for tea after all.
Oh, you are a bit late, you know.
- Oh, l, I am?
- Yes.
Now, my name is Merlin.
Come, come, who are you, my lad?
Oh, my name's Arthur, but everyone calls me Wart.
Oh.
Oh, what a perfect stuffed owl.
Stuff--
I, l, I beg your pardon!
He's alive and he talks.
And certainly a great deal better than you do.
Oh, come, Archimedes.
Come, come now.
I, I want you to meet the Wart.
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.
Boy? Boy?
Well, I see no boy.
- Oh, I'm sorry that l--
- That's all right.
He's much too sensitive.
Sensitive? Huh?
Who? What? What?
- Oh, well.
- How did you know that I was--
Oh, th-that you would be dropping in?
Well, I happen to be a wizard. A soothsayer.
A prognosticator. I have the power to see into the future.
Centuries into the future!
I, I've even been there, lad.
And I've seen all these things.
They're, they're only plans and small models, of course, you know.
Now, this for instance is a steam locomotive.
There she goes.
Pretty good, eh?
Now, that won't be invented for hundreds of years!
Oh. You mean you can see everything before it happens?
Yes, everything.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Everything, Merlin?
Uh-- No, no, not everything.
I, uh, I admit I didn't know whom to expect for tea.
But as you can see...
I've figured the exact place.
You're very clever, sir.
Yes. Well, never mind the, the, the sir.
Just, uh, plain Merlin will do.
Now, would, would you care for sugar?
Oh, yes I would, please.
All right. Sugar. Sugar?
No, no, manners, manners, manners!
Guests first, you know that!
All right.
Say when, lad.
When!
- Have you had any schooling?
- Oh, yes!
I'm training to be a squire. I'm learning the rules of combat and swordsmanship and... and jousting and horsemanship.
Oh, yes, yes, very good.
That's, that's--
No, no, no, l--
I mean a, a, a real education.
Mathematics. History.
Biology. Natural science.
English. Latin. French.
No. When! When!
Blast it all! When!
Impudent piece of crockery.
Boy, now, you can't--
You can't grow up without a decent education, you know.
Oh, I suppose not, sir--
Merlin.
So, I am going to be your tutor.
But I've got to get back to the castle.
They'll want me in the kitchen.
Oh, well.
Then very well.
We'll pack and be on our way.
You-- You watch now.
You'll like this.
Higitus figitus zumba ka zing.
I want your attention, everything.
We're packing to leave.
Come on. Let's go.
No, no, not you. Books are always first, you know.

Now, stop, stop, stop, stop!
See here, sugar bowl. You're getting rough.
That poor old tea set is cracked enough.
Now. Now, all right.
Let's start again.
Ah, let's start-- Eh--
Oh. Where was l, boy?
- Uh, hock-hockety pockety?
- Oh, yes, yes, that's right.
Hockety pockety wockety wack

Be with you in just a minute, son. Packing's almost done.
You, you, you bungling blockhead!
Hey, easy there.
No, no, go ahead.

This is the best part now.

- Ha, ha!
- What a way to pack.
Well-- Well, now, just a minute, boy.
How else would you get all this stuff into one suitcase, I'd like to know?
- Oh, but I think it's wonderful!
- Oh.
Yes, it is rather.
Now, well... don't, don't you get any foolish ideas that magic will solve all your problems.
- Because it won't!
- But, sir, I don't have any problems.
Oh, bah, everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.
Oh, blast it all!
There, now. You see what I mean?
See, that's the trouble with the world today.
Everybody butting their heads against a brick wall. All muscle and no mentality.
Do you want to be all muscle and no brain?
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't? Well, how do you move about?
Oh, I suppose l,
I do have a little.
Aha. There, you see. Well, that's enough. Now, develop your brain.
Knowledge, wisdom. There's the real power. Higher learning.
That's the thing.
So, first thing tomorrow morning, we'll start a full schedule.
Eight hours a day. We'll have six hours for schoolroom and two for study period.
But l-- I don't have the time.
I have page duties.
Uh, page duties? Ha!
Ah, well, we'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.
Well, yes, sir.
I, I suppose so.
How do you ever expect to amount to anything without an education, I'd like to know?
Even in these bungling, backward, medieval times... you have got to know where you're going, don't you?
Ye-- Yes, sir.
Yes, of course. So, you must plan for the future, boy.
You've got to find a direction.
And you've--
Now, by the by, what direction is this castle of yours?
I think it's north.
The other way.
Oh, oh.
All right, then we better get a move on. Come on, come on, lad. Pick up the pace. Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Yo-ho, the devil take it!
No, the devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense than to go barging off in that infernal forest alone.
You had no business letting him go.
Look, Dad, I'm not the Wart's keeper.
Well, blast it all, I am.
After all, l, I took him in, adopted the lad, you might say.
Being his foster father, well, I'm responsible.
Whoop.
Tiger! Talbot! Off with you.
Now, look here, Wart.
What's the big idea of gallivanting off in the woods... and worrying the living daylights out of everybody?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Well, sorry's not enough.
That's four demerits.
Four hours extra kitchen duty.
Eh, report to the cook!
- But, sir, I'd like you to meet--
- Go on, hop it, boy, hop, hop, hop it!
Well, yes, you've got to keep a tight schedule to run a big place like this.
Need strict rules.
Especially for small boys.
And I most certainly agree.
Who are you and--
Oh. I mean, uh, you?
Uh, my name is Merlin.
Uh, this is Archimedes.
A highly educated owl.
Educated owl?
Say, that's a good one.
Say. Hey, I know.
You've got him under a spell,
Marvin. You're a magician.
The name is Merlin.
And I happen to be the world's most powerful wizard.
Come off it, man.
Gadzooks!
All right.
I shall demonstrate.
Higitus figitus migitus moe... wind and snow swirl and blow!
What the devil are you up to?
And that is what I call a "wizard blizzard."
Hey, Kay, would you look at this?
An indoor blizzard.
And in the month of July.
So what?
All right, Marvin. Turn her off.
I'm convinced.
Alakazam!
I, uh-- I hope you don't go in for any of that black magic.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Never touch the stuff. No.
My magic is used mainly for educational purposes.
In fact, that is why
I am here.
I have come to educate the Wart.
Oh, no you don't.
I'm running this place. And if you think you're gonna fiddle with my schedule... you'd better pack up your bag of tricks and be gone.
Wha-- Well, by Jove.
Hey, he's gone.
Hm-mmm. Good riddance.
I'm gone, but then,
I'm not gone.
So, if I do leave... you could never be sure that I am gone, can you?
Well, uh--
Well, I must say, you-- you got me there, Marvin.
Yes. Well, you win. You're welcome to stay if you like.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Very generous, I must say.
Well, uh, all we can offer is room and board.
Hard times, you know, Marvin.
We'll put you up in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.
It's a bit drafty in the winter... but in this blazing hot weather, it's the best room in the house.
Oh, yes.
Very lovely indeed.
So just make yourself at home, Marvin.
Marvin, Marvin,
Marvin, Marvin.
Best room in the house!
Guest room!
Unwelcome-guest room!
But if he thinks that he can get rid of me, I've got news for that old walrus.
- I'm sticking it out.
- And I say we go back to the woods.
No, not on your life.
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.
Well, you may be right.
A skinny kid like that would make a cracking good chimney sweep.
Something tells me that you're all wet, Archimedes.
- Who goes there?
- Pelinore!
It's Pelinore, dash it all!
I've got big news from London.
Big news!
Come on, man.
Drop the bridge.
Oh, big news, eh?
They can't wait for the London Times. First edition won't be out for at least, uh...
1200 years.
Archimedes, would you mind sailing down there and, and--
Not interested!
Oh, come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get.
No! No, no, no!
Archimedes! I'll turn you into a human.
- Hmph! You wouldn't dare!
- I will. So help me, I will.
Well, all right, all right.
All right!
All right.
It works every time.
Just like magic.
Pelinore!
Pelinore.
Greetings, old boy. And what's all the noise about London, hmm?
Big news. Really big news.
Sit down, man, and let's hear all about it.
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.
Oh, that's not news, dash it all. They always do.
Yeah, but, Ector-- Ector, here's where all the excitement comes in.
To the winner of this tournament goes the crown.
You mean-- You mean he'll be King of all England?
King of all England.
- Kay, lad, did you hear that?
- Pretty fair prize, I'd say.
Yes, and you can win it, boy, if you knuckle down to your training.
And we'll have you knighted by Christmas and off to London. What do you say?
Sure. Why not? Why not?
Wart, lad, how'd you like to go to London?
- Oh, Sir Ector, you mean it?
- If you stick to your duties, you can be Kay's squire.
Oh, I will, sir.
I will.
I don't want the Wart for my squire.
Here's to London!
And to here's to Kay.
And here's to the banner of the Castle of the Forest Suavage.
- Cheers!
- Cheers, cheers. - Cheers.
Charge!
Weight forward!
Lean into him!
Steady, boy. Steady!
Steady with the lance!
Grip her tight!
Hit him clean!
No, no, no!
Heads up!
Ar-Ar-Archimedes. Archimedes, wh-where, where, where are we?
In a tumble-down old tower... in the most miserable old castle in all Christendom, that's where.
C-Castle? Castle?
Don't you even remember the boy?
Uh, the boy?
Can't you remember one blasted thing?
- Oh, now, just a moment. I--
- Tight grip on the lance.
- Oh.
- Loosen the saddle, knees in tight.
Weight forward and stay on target.
You keep losing your grip.
It's not a mere matter of muscle, sir.
Jousting is, uh, uh, a fine skill.
It-- It's a highly developed science.
Science, indeed.
One dummy trying to knock off another dummy with a bit of a stick.
And the Wart's just as hot for it as the rest of them.
He certainly is. That boy's got real spark. Lots of spirit.
Throws himself heart and soul into everything he does.
That's really worth something if it can only be turned in the right direction.
Ha-ha.
Fat chance of that.
Oh, I plan to cheat, of course.
Use magic. Every last trick in the trade if I have to.
I'd give anything to go riding about on a great white charger... slaying dragons and griffins and man-eating giants.
Well, won't you?
Oh. No. You see.
I'm an orphan, and a knight must be of proper birth.
I only hope I'm worthy to be Kay's squire.
That's a big job too, you know.
Oh, indeed, yes, yes.
I would say almost impossible. Yes.
Well, now then. When I said that I could swim like a fish...
I really meant as a fish.
You mean you can turn yourself into a fish?
After all, I happen to be a wizard.
- Could you turn me into a fish?
- Well, do you have any imagination?
Can you imagine yourself as a fish?
Oh, that's easy.
I've done that lots of times.
Oh. Well, good. Then I think that my magic can do the rest.
Archimedes, what, what is that fish formula?
- Who? Who? What? What? What?
- You know, that, that, that Latin business.
Hmm? Fish? Latin?
Oh, uh.
Aquarius aquaticus aqualitus.
And-And now if you don't mind...
I say good day to the both of you if you please.
When he stays out all night... he's always grumpy the next morning.
- Then he must stay out every night.
- Yes.
Oh. Oh, yes. Oh, I say, that's very good, boy. Very.
Who? What? What?
All right, boy. All set.
Here we go.
Aquarius aquaticus aqualitus quum.
Aqua digi tarium.
Merlin, am I a fish?
Am I a fish?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, you are a fish... but if you don't stop that flippity-flopping around... and get in the water, you won't last long.
Now, now, stay right here in the tules and I'll-- I'll be with you in a minute.
Oh.
So you thought you could take right off like a shot, did you?
Well, I am a fish, aren't l?
You merely look like a fish.
That doesn't mean that you can swim like one. You, you don't have the instinct.
So, you'll have to use your, your brain for a change.
You are living between two planes now.
Somewhere between the ceiling and the floor.
Now, there, there's lots of ups and downs...
Like-like, uh, like a helicopter.
- Helicopter?
- Yes--
Oh. No, never mind.
Every flick of a fin creates movement.
So, first we'll start with a caudal fin.
No, no, boy.
Your tail. Tail.
Now, now, that gives you the forward thrust now.
Come on, let's get a rhythm.
Right, left.
Right, left. One, two.
Left and right
Like day and night
That's what makes the world go 'round
In and out
Thin and stout
That's what makes the world go 'round
For every up there is a down
- For every square
- There is a round?
Yes.
For every high
- There is a low?
- Uh-huh.
- And for every to
-- - There is a-- - Fro. - Fro.
Yes, fro.
To and fro, Stop and go
That's what makes the world go 'round
In and out
Thin and stout
- Merlin! Merlin!
- Oh!
- I swallowed a bug!
- Oh. What's wrong with that?
After all, ah, boy, you are a fish. I-instinct, you know.
- But you said I had no instinct.
- Yes, of--
Oh. Oh, I did. Well, th-that's neither here nor there.
But the main thing is you must--
Set your sights upon the heights
Don't be a mediocrity
- Mediocrity?
- That's right.
Don't just wait and trust to fate
And say that's how it's meant to be
It's up to you how far you go
If you don't try you'll never know
And so, my lad as I've explained
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Let's, let's swim through that tall grass again. It tickles.
Oh. Oh,
I beg your pardon.
Me too.
For every to there is a fro
For every stop there is a go
And that's what makes the world go 'round
Oh, let go, let go, let go!
Oh, you big, bug-eyed bully, you!
Who, me?
Oh, here, here, here, here, here, now, boy.
There's no sense in going around insulting bullfrogs.
A fish has plenty of other problems without that.
The water world has its forests and its jungles too.
So it has its tigers and its wolves. And that, eh, ah--
That's what makes the world go 'round
You see, my boy it's nature's way
Upon the weak the strong ones prey
The human life it's also true
The strong will try to conquer you
And that is what you must expect
Unless you use your intellect
Brains and brawn
Weak and strong
- Help, Merlin! Help! Help!
- That's what makes the wor--
Jehoshaphat!
Oh!
- Quick, Merlin, the magic!
- No, no.
You're on your own, lad.
Now's your chance to prove my point.
Wha-What point?
He's the brawn and you're the brain.
Oh, now, don't, don't, don't panic!
You use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.
Smart move, lad!
That's using the old intellect.
- Bravo, boy! Great strategy!
- Is the lesson about over?
D-D-Did you get the point?
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.
Okay, lad, I'll fix the big brute. Higgeldy piggeldy--
No, no. Hocus pocus--
Now, what in blaze-- Eh--
Merlin!
Now what? Oh, it's, it's that, that boy!
- Wh-Wh-What in b-blazes!
- Help! Help! Help!
Ouch!
Help!
Archimedes!
Help!
What in thunder is a monster like that doing in the moat?
By George, l-l-l-- I'll, I'll--
I'll turn him into a minnow.
- Merlin!
- Oh! Oh, there you are, boy.
Snick snack snorum!
How in the world did you ever get out of that mess?
That, that big fish almost swallowed me and, and Archimedes, he, he saved me.
Well, by George.
Oh, what do you know about that?
I did nothing of the sort!
I intended to eat him.
Young perch is my favourite dish.
You know that!
Oh.
- Do you believe that, Wart?
- Well, l--
Wart. Wart!
I've gotta go. Thank you,
Merlin. It was so much fun.
- And, Archimedes, l, l--
- Pinfeathers, boy!
Wart! Where are you, Wart?
Coming!
I'm coming.
Now, Archimedes.
Why would you half-drown yourself for a tidbit of fish?
And after such a big breakfast?
Pinfeathers and gully fluff!
We were doing fine until we got in deep water.
Then along comes this huge pike with big jaws and sharp, jagged teeth.
Oh, turn him off, Dad.
He was a monster!
The biggest fish I ever saw.
- And, boy, that's the biggest fish story I ever heard.
- But it's true, sir.
That's three demerits for being late and three more for the fish story.
Now, hop into the kitchen!
I told you the Wart was loony.
Yes, well, he's either out of his head or, uh.... there's something mighty fishy going on around here.
For every high there is a low
For every to there is a fro
To and fro
Stop and go
That's what makes the world go round
- Oh, it's you, Merlin, sir.
- Uh, yes, my lad.
Now, have you ever considered being a squirrel?
Well, no, I don't suppose.
Well, now, there is a tiny creature... with enormous problems.
How he has survived throughout the ages... is one of nature's big mysteries.
His life is hazardous.
Downright dangerous.
Uh, would you like to try it?
- Oh, no, I'd better not.
- Oh-ho.
It's, uh, too dangerous for you, eh?
Oh, no, it's not that.
It's just that I've got six demerits. All this work to do.
What a mess!
What a medieval muddle.
We'll have to modernize it.
Start an assembly-line system.
All right now. One and a-two and a-three and a-four!
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Skitun de bitun de batun de dum
- But I'm supposed to do it.
- No one will know the difference, son.
Who cares as long as the work gets done?
Rubbedy scrubbedy
Sweepety flow
Come on, son.
Let's go, let's go.
Wart. Wart!
Wart. Now, take it easy.
Take it easy, boy.
What? Oh, no, boy!
No, no!
- Wart!
- Whoa. Oh!
Now, what did I tell you?
Always look before you leap.
Well, I made it, didn't I?
Yes, yes, you made it. You made it, but you, you can't always trust to luck, boy.
Now, first thing... you start with the short jumps.
Gauge the distance carefully.
And-- Oh!
Now, there, you see?
Even, even, even then you can miss.
So, don't take gravity too lightly or it'll catch up with you.
- What's gravity?
- Gravity is what causes you to fall.
Oh, like a stumble or, or a trip?
Yes, it's like a stumble or a
-- No, no, no, no, no. It's the force that pulls you downward.
The, the phenomenon that any two material particles or bodies... if free to move, will be accelerated toward each other.
- Merlin, how will we get by?
- Hmm?
Oh. Oh, well, l, I suppose we better go back to a side track.
Go on, go on.
You got lots of room.
Well, l-- I, l, I guess she can't be sidetracked.
That's a girl squirrel, that, and a redhead at that.
- She sure acts funny.
- Well, she likes you.
Why?
Yes, well, well, well, that's nature again.
But I'm afraid there's no time to explain.
Here, here, now.
You better leave me out of it.
Yeah, me too.
Merlin! Merlin!
You're on your own, lad. I'm afraid magic can't solve this problem.
Look, I'm, I'm not a boy.
I mean--
I'm not a squirrel.
I'm a boy.
A human boy.
Not a real sq--
Oh, leave me alone!
Merlin, what'll I do?
She won't leave me--
Well, I'm, I'm afraid you're stuck, lad.
Well, when a girl squirrel chooses a mate, it's for life.
- But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.
- But she doesn't know that.
She only knows one simple fact.
That you're a him and she's a her.
- That's a natural phenomenon.
- Phenomenon-menum?
Well, it's the, the, uh--
It's a state of being
A frame of mind
It's a most befuddling thing
And to every being of every kind it is discombooberating
You're wasting time resisting
You'll find the more you do
The more she'll keep insisting
Her him has got to be you
Now leave me alone!
I mean it!
It's a rough game
Anyone knows
Go away!
There are no rules
Anything goes
There's no logical explanation
For this discombooberation
It's a most bemuddling
Most befuddling thing
Oh! Who? Who? What-- What--
Now, go on. Shoo!
Get a tree of your own.
Skedaddle!
You-- You-- You-- You--
Oh, you squirrelly squirrels!
She's gaining on you, Wart.
There's no sensible explanation
For this discombooberation
It's a most hodge-podgical
Most illogical
Most confusiling
Most bamboozling
Most bemuddling
Most be-befu-fuddling
Thing
Really, now, Miss, uh--
Madam. I, uh--
You, you, you've made a mistake.
Now, now, now, please.
Please, you--
Oh! Madam! Madam!
Now, look here.
I am not a boy.
I, I mean, I'm--
I'm not a squirrel. I'm a b--
No, that's not what-- No!
No. I'm, I'm,
I'm a stupid old--
No!
I'm an old man.
An old human.
Understand?
Oh, hang it all.
Now, go away.
Shoo, shoo.
Impossible. Impossible!
Ooh, confound it!
Confound it all!
Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.
Oh, you've got trouble?
Look at my-- Look back there!
One side, lad.
Whoa, what--
Help, Merlin!
Help!
Oh, no!
By George!
I've had enough of this nonsense!
Alakazam!
There. You see? I'm an ugly, horrible, grouchy old man!
- Merlin!
- Oh.
- So, here we are.
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.
Snick snack snorum.
There. Now you see?
I'm not a squirrel. I'm a boy.
I tried to tell you.
I'm a boy.
A human boy.
Oh, if you could only understand.
Ah, you know, lad... that love business is a powerful thing.
Greater than gravity?
Well, yes, boy, in its way, I'd, uh--
Yes, I'd say it's the greatest force on Earth.
Oh, Ector!
Ector! Sir Ector! The kitchen!
- Hold it, son! Hold it.
- Black magic all over the place!
Kay! Hold on, I say!
Stop!
Oh. Now, what's all the commotion, hmm?
Oh, the kitchen, it's under an evil spell!
- Huh?
- It's bewitched.
Oh, I bet it's that old goat Marvin.
Come on, son.
I-l knew he'd give us trouble.
Gadzooks!
Black magic of the worst kind!
Come on, Kay!
To the attack!
Wha-- Oh!
Hold it!
Heaven preserve us!
Kay!
- Now, what have we here?
- Jumpin' hoptoads!
Alakazam!
So there you are, you old goat.
Well, what's the idea of flinging your evil spells all over the place?
Oh, oh, lend me a hand, boy.
Well, what have you got to say for yourself, hmm?
You call washing dishes and sweeping floors a work of evil?
I'll decide what's right and wrong around here.
Besides, that's the Wart's job.
One of his duties.
Uh, and look here, boy.
If you want to make that trip to London, you'd better tow the mark.
You old goat! lf I ever catch you in my kitchen again, I'll--
Madam, you won't.
Oh, dear. He's gone.
Well, by Jove.
We ought to run the old geezer right out of the castle.
Oh, no, no, no, no, Kay. No.
He might cast an evil spell on the lot of us.
Turn us all to stone.
No. There's no telling what the old devil might do.
He's not an old devil!
He-- He's good!
And, and his magic is good too.
If, if you'd just leave him alone!
Now, look here, Wart.
That's three more demerits.
- Box his ears, Dad.
- Just because you can't understand something...
- it, it doesn't mean it's wrong.
- Ten more demerits!
You make all the rules and, and nobody else can say anything.
You said a plenty, boy! All that popping off just cooked your goose.
Kay, from now on, young Hobbs is your squire.
Did you hear that, Wart?
Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire.
- Ye
-- Ye-- Yes, sir. - Now that'll teach you to pop off, you little pipsqueak.
Oh, I'm sorry, lad.
I'm sorry.
I spoiled everything.
I know that trip to London means a great deal to you.
Oh, it's, it's not your fault.
I shouldn't have popped off.
Now I'm really done for.
No, no, you're in a great spot, boy.
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.
- I'd like to know how.
- Use your head.
An education, lad.
What good will that do?
Get it first. Then who knows?
Are you willing to try?
Well, what have
I got to lose?
That's the spirit!
We'll start tomorrow!
We'll show 'em.
Won't we, boy?
We sure will.
Now, first of all, lad... we've got to get all these medieval ideas out of your head.
Clear the way for new ideas.
Knowledge of man's fabulous discoveries... in the centuries ahead.
- Now that'll be a great advantage, boy.
- Advantage, indeed!
If the boy goes about saying the world is round, they'll take him for a lunatic.
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.
And it also goes around.
- You mean it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no.
It's round now. Man will discover this in centuries to come.
And he will also find that the world is merely... a tiny speck in the universe.
- Universe?
- Oh, you're only confusing the boy.
Before you're through, he'll be so mixed up, he'll, he'll be wearing his shoes on his head.
Man has always learned from the past. After all, you can't learn history in reverse.
It's, it's, it's confusing enough, for heaven sakes.
All right! All right.
Have it your way, Archimedes.
You're in charge.
You're the headmaster now.
So from now on, he's your pupil.
So, from now on, boy... you do as I say.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
Now to start off, I want you to read these books.
- All of them?
- That, my boy, is a mountain of knowledge.
- But l, but I can't read.
- What, what? What? Then I don't suppose you know how to write?
- No, sir.
- What do you know?
- Well, l--
- Well, never mind. Never mind.
We'll start at the bottom.
The ABC's.
First the A, and now the B.
Loop and around and there's the C.
Merlin. Look.
I can write.
Oh. Yes, yes.
That's very good, boy. Very--
Henscratch, that's all.
Henscratch. Now, come on.
D, E, F, and now the G.
You see, it's as simple as--
No, no, no! No, boy!
Now, use your head. Use your head, will you?
How do you ever expect to learn anything?
Archimedes!
Have you seen that, uh... flying machine model?
I have nothing to do with your futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.
- What's that thing up there?
- Hmm? Oh, yes, of course.
- Here we are.
- You mean man will fly in one of those someday?
If man were meant to fly, he'd have been born with wings.
I am about to prove otherwise, Archimedes... if you care to watch.
Here she goes.
No, no, no, no, no--
Man'll fly all right.
Just like a rock.
It would have worked if, if, if, if it weren't for... this infernal beard!
I never, never in my whole--
Man will fly someday,
I tell you.
I have been there.
I have seen it.
Oh, I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying-- that I was a bird and that I could go sailing all over the sky high above everything.
Prestadigitonium.
It's my favourite dream.
Oh, but then I suppose everybody dreams about flying.
I'm a bird! I'm a bird!
I'm a bird!
Hold it, boy.
Not so fast. Not so fast.
First, l-- I'd better explain the mechanics of a bird's wing.
Now, these large feathers... are called the primaries.
- And, uh--
- And, uh, since when... do you know all about bird's wings?
I have made an extensive study of birds in flight. And l--
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.
All right, Mr Know-lt-All, he's your pupil.
- Ouch!
- Now, boy... flying is not merely some crude mechanical process.
It is a delicate art.
Purely aesthetic.
Poetry of motion.
And the best way to learn it is to do it.
Now, since we're pretty far up, we'll start with a glide.
Spread your wings way out, way out. That's it. That's it.
Now, fan your tail.
Tippity-toe, tippity-toe, and off we go.
Now, tuck your feet under, like me. That's it. That's the idea!
- Whoa! What? Oh!
- And don't fight the air currents.
Use them.
Well, say, boy!
That's pretty good.
Well, boy, you're a natural!
Are you sure this is the first time that you've--
Wart! Wart!
Hawk! Hawk!
Look out, boy!
Heads up! Wart!
Archimedes! Help!
Wart! Wart!
Whoa! What? Oh!
Sounds like someone's sick.
How lov--
Oh, bat gizzards.
It's nothing but... a scrawny little sparrow with a beak full of soot.
Oh, I-I'm not really a sparrow.
I'm a boy.
- A boy?
- Merlin changed me with his magic.
He's the world's most powerful wizard.
Merlin. Ho-ho!
Merlin, the world's most powerful bungler.
Why, boy, I've got more magic in one little finger.
Now, don't tell me you've never heard of the marvellous Madam Mim?
Well, no, I don't guess so.
Madam Mim? Oh! Good heavens, good heavens, good heavens!
My boy, I'm the greatest.
I'm truly marvellous!
With only a touch
I have the power
Zim zab rim bim
To whither a flower
I find delight in the gruesome and grim
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Thank you, my boy.
But that's nothing, nothing for me.
No! 'Cause I'm the magnificent... marvellous, mad Madam Mim.
You know what?
I can even change size.
I can be huge!
Ooh! Fill the whole house.
I can be teeny
Small as a mouse
Black sorcery is my dish of tea
Uh, it comes easy to me.
'Cause I'm the magnificent... marvellous, mad Madam Mim.
Marvellous, boy!
Marvellous, I'm marvellous!
Say, lad, did you know that
I can make myself uglier yet?
Well, that would be some trick.
Er, um, ah, I mean, uh--
Want to bet? Boo!
You see? I win, I win!
Aren't I hideous, boy?
Perfectly revolting?
- Well, uh, yes, ma'am.
- But you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Watch this.
I can be beautiful lovely and fair
Silvery voice long purple hair
But it's only skin deep for zim zaberim zim
I'm an ugly, old creep!
The magnificent, marvellous... mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim.
Now what do you think, boy?
Who's the greatest?
Well, uh, Merlin's magic is always, um, well, useful... uh, for something good.
- And he must see something good in you.
- Oh, I suppose so.
Yes, and in my book, that's bad!
So, my boy, I'm afraid
I'll have to destroy you.
De-Destroy me?
Yeah, I-I'll give you a sporting chance.
I'm mad about games, you know.
Yeah, well come on, get going, boy.
You gotta keep on your toes in this game.
I win, I win!
Oh, the game's over.
Why, you little devil, you! I'll wring your scrawny little neck!
Mim! Mim! Wha-Wha-What--
Eh, what was you up to?
Uh! Me-Me-- Oh, Merlin!
Well, you're just in time.
- We were playing a little game.
- She was gonna destroy me.
And just what are you gonna do about it?
Want to fight?
Want to have a wizard's duel?
- As you wish, madam.
- Well, come on, step outside.
After you, madam.
They're havin' a wizard's duel.
What's that mean?
Oh, it's a battle of wits.
The players change themselves... to different things and, and attempt to, uh, to destroy one another.
De-Des-De-Destroy?
But just watch, boy, just watch.
You'll get the idea.
Now, first of all, if you don't mind, I'll make the rules.
Rules indeed!
Why, she only wants rules so she can break 'em!
I'll take care of you later, featherbrain.
Now, rule one, no mineral or vegetable.
Only animal. Rule two, no make-believe things...
Like, uh, oh, pink dragons and stuff.
Now, rule three, no disappearing.
- Rule four, no cheating.
- All right, all right.
Now, pace off ten.
One, two, three, four--
- Merlin! She disappeared!
- Huh? Ah-- Duh-- Bah-- Mim!
Now, you made the rules!
Ouch!
- Change to somethin' else, Merlin.
- Ah-- Buh-- Y-Yes... yes, yes, yes, give me time to think.
- Ah, higgety-piggety. Ah, duh
-- No, no, no, no, no. - Quick, Merlin, hurry!
Ah-- Duh-- Hoppity-hip-hip.
Ha-ha!
Got me tail, now!
Madam, just a minute.
Ah-- D-D--
This is not the-the-the-the--
- Come on! Something bigger!
- Something smaller!
Mi-Mi-Mim, Mi-Mim,
Mi-Mim Mi-Mi--
Ooh!
Merlin! No disappearing.
Whoo!
Ouch!
Mim? Mim?
Are-Are-Are you--
Now-- Gah-- What-What--
W-W-What's going on here?
You, you-- You big blimp!
Squash me, will ya?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, Merlin!
- Ouch! Ooh!
- Bravo!
Oh, just you wait!
Just you wait! You're gonna pay!
So you want to play rough, do ya?
All right, Merlin. I'll smash you good, you old crab!
Jehoshaphat!
Here I come, Mim, ready or not.
Merlin, you wouldn't dare!
Now, now, Mim, Mim!
No-No dragons, remember?
Did I say no purple dragons?
Did l?
I win, I win!
Oh, that horrible old witch!
I'll, I'll peck her eyes out!
Huh, no, no.
No, no, no.
- He's gone!
- Disappeared.
Madam, I have not disappeared.
I am very tiny.
I'm a germ. A rare disease.
I'm called "malagolintomontorosis"... and you caught me, Mim!
What?
First, you break out into spots.
Followed by hot and cold flashes.
Then violent sneezing.
Huh! Watch it, boy!
Oh! Er-- You-You-You-You sneaky old scoundrel!
Oh, it's not too serious, madam.
Ah, you should recover... in a few weeks and be as good, uh--
Ah, heh-heh-- I-l mean as bad as ever.
But, ah, I would suggest plenty of rest... and lots and lots of sunshine!
I hate sunshine!
I hate horrible, wholesome sunshine!
I hate it, I hate it!
I hate, hate, hate, hate--
You were really great, Merlin, but-but you could've been killed.
It was worth it, lad, if you learned something from it.
Knowledge and wisdom is the real power.
Right you are, Wart, so stick to your schooling, boy.
Oh-Oh, don't worry, I will, sir.
I will, oh, I really will.
We will sing all night and all day we will fight
For the blue oak tree on the field of white
For the blue oak tree on the fie-ie-ie-ie-ield
Of white
Here's to victory in London for my son, Kay!
Sir Kay. I've been knighted, don't forget.
No-o, of course, son, of course.
Ah, here's to Sir Kay.
And who knows?
The future king of all England!
- Watch it, will ya?
- Kay the king?
What a dreadful thought.
Sir Ector! Sir Ector!
Hobbs has come down with the mumps!
Face all-all-all puffed up like a toad!
Then Kay'll need another squire, hang it all.
- Hmm. Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?
Kay's squire.
You're going to London, boy.
Oh, Sir Ector!
Whoa! What? Whoa!
Merlin! Archimedes! Merlin!
Merlin, look!
I'm a squire!
Hah!
Oh. Uh, very nice, boy.
Yes, indeed. A fine monkey suit for polishing boots.
It's-it's what all the squires wear.
And I thought you were going to amount to something!
I thought you had a few brains!
Great future. Hah!
A stooge for that big lunk, Kay.
Congratulations, boy!
What do y-- What do you want me to be? I'm nobody.
You-- You don't know a thing about what's goin' on today.
I-I-I-I'm lucky to be Kay's squire.
D-- Oh! D--
Of all the idiotic--
Y-Y-Y-- I--
Blow me to Bermuda!
Where-- Uh, where did he go?
- To Bermuda, I suppose.
- Where's that?
Oh, an island way off somewhere that hasn't been discovered yet.
Will he ever come back?
Who knows?
Who knows anything?
For the crown of all England... let the tournament begin.
Oh, Kay, now it's up to the swords.
Swords? Swords?
Ah-- Oh, no! Kay?
What? What?
I, eh--
I-l-l forgot your sword.
Forgot my sword?
I-- I-l left it back at the inn.
Why, you bungling little fool!
I'll-- Oof!
You better get it!
Or don't you dare come back!
Let me in! Let me in!
Somebody please!
Please let me in!
It's no use, boy.
They've all gone to the tournament.
Oh, what'll I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.
Look, boy! Look!
There in the churchyard.
A sword!
Oh, Archimedes, a sword!
You're gonna have a time pullin' it out.
Huh! Watch it, boy!
Better leave it alone!
But Kay's got to have a sword.
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here!
Y-You're up next, son.
Uh, better get ready.
Kay, Kay, here's a sword.
This is not my sword!
Hold on, Kay!
Wait a minute.
"Whoso pulleth out this sword--"
Ooh, eh-- It's the sword in the stone!
- The sword in the stone? It can't be.
- But look. It is!
- It's the marvellous sword.
- Hold everything.
Someone's pulled the sword from the stone.
Where did you get it, Wart?
I, l-l pulled it out of an anvil that was on a stone... i-in, in a churchyard.
- That's funny!
- The lad's a young Samson!
You're making a fool of us, boy.
Now tell the truth.
- But I did, sir. Ow! Ooh!
- Then come on, prove it.
- Ouch!
- Back to the stone with you.
- Yes, prove it.
- Come on, prove it.
All right, boy, let's have the miracle.
Now, wait a minute!
Anyone can pull it once it's been pulled.
Go to it, Kay.
Give it all you got.
Put your back into it!
- Here now!
- Here, here, here!
- Push him and see.
- It's my turn. One side!
- Pull this thing.
- Hold on, that's not fair.
I say we let the boy try it.
That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.
Go ahead, son.
It's a miracle ordained by heaven.
This boy is our king.
Well, by Jove.
- What's the lad's name?
- Eh, Wart.
Oh, uh, I mean Arthur.
- Hail King Arthur!
- Hail King Arthur! Long live the king!
- Long live King Arthur! Long live the king.
- I can't believe it!
- Ooh, forgive me, son.
- Hail King Arthur.
- Long live the king. Long live...
- Forgive me.
- King Arthur. Long live the king.
- Oh, please don't, sir.
- Kay, bow down to your king.
- Hail King Arthur.
Long live the king.
- Hail King Arthur.
- So at last, the miracle... had come to pass in that far off time upon New Year's Day... and the glorious rein of King Arthur was begun.
I can't be a king, Archimedes. I don't know anything about ruling a country.
I told you to leave the thing in the stone, boy.
I'll, I'll run away, that's what I'll do.
They'll just have to get somebody else.
Better take the side door, Wart.
Out the side door.
Hail King Arthur!
Long live the King!
There's another door. Over there, over there! Come on, come on!
Long live King Arthur!
Long li--
Looks-Looks like we're surrounded, boy.
Oh, Archimedes,
I wish Merlin was here.
Merlin! Merlin!
Oh, Merlin, you're back from Ber-Ber-Ber--
Bermuda?
Yes, back from Bermuda... and the 20th century.
And believe me, you can have it.
One big modern mess!
Alakazam!
I'm in an awful pickle.
I'm king.
Ooh, he pulled the sword from the stone.
Ha-ha!
Of course, of course!
King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table.
- Round table?
- Oh, uh, w-would you rather have a square one?
Oh, no. Round'll be fine.
Boy, boy, boy.
You'll become a great legend.
They'll be writing books about you for centuries to come.
Why, they might even make a motion picture about you.
- Motion picture?
- Oh.
Uh, well, um-- Uh, that's something like television... without commercials.
Hail King Arthur
Long live the King

Once upon a time... or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called...
Pepperland.
80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay, or lie, I'm not too sure.
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe.
It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
- Yes, Your Blueness.
- What?!
We Meanies only take no for an answer.
Is that understood, Max?
No, Your Blueness.
That's better.
Are the troops in readiness?
No, your Blueness.
- The Bonkers?
- No.
- Clowns?
- No.
- Snapping Turks?
- No.
- Anti-music missiles?
- No.
- The dreadful Flying Glove?
- No.
Splendid!
Today, Pepperland goes bluely!
Fire!
The Meanies are coming!
The Meanies are coming!
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove!
Look out there, and what do you see?
- Tell him, Max.
- Someone running, Glove.
Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey?
Go, Glove, point!
And having pointed, pounce down!
I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii!
What?! What?!
The Glove is losing his touch.
Do your worst!
Explode them!
It's not polite to point!
Thing of beauty... destroy it for ever!
Sir, Sir, the Blue Meanies are coming!
Not here, Young Fred.
They wouldn't dare.
They would. They are.
What are you going to do?
Finish the quartet.
Fire!
Trio, sir?
Duet, sir?
Duet?
Solo!
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!
4 scores and 32 bars ago,
- our forefathers...
- Our quartet?
- And foremothers...
- Another quartet?
Made it in this yellow submarine...
- What, that little thing?
- To Pepperland.
Climb aboard, Young Fred.
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
Lord Admiral?
In that event, yes.
Hurry, Young Fred.
Go! Get help!
Where should I go?
No time for trivialities.
Woe... is me.
Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night.
And this is only Thursday morning.
Compared with my life,
Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.
Nothing ever happens to me.
I feel like an old, splintered drumstick.
I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain.
Nothing ever happens to me.
Puss, puss-puss.
Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy.
Ahem, er...
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
No, I would not.
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine.
But that isn't logical, is it?
It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.
Help, help, help!
Thanks, I don't need any.
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
Be specific.
...Blue Meanies!
What you need is...
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent,
'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-please help.
Hiya, baby!
Your story has touched my heart.
Jump in, we'll get my friends.
- Bless you!
- Did I sneeze?
- Just park it here.
- I'll just park it here.
What would your friends be doing here?
Displaying.
- Displaying what?
- Displaying around.
Can't we take one of these?
No. I only work with my mates.
Frankenstein?
I used to go out with his sister.
- His sister?
- Yeah. Phyllis.
Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
You mustn't do that.
Can't help it.
I'm a born lever-puller.
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach.
Now listen to Old Fred.
...Blue Meanies!
What do you think?
I think he needs a rehearsal.
When do we leave?
Let's get the other two, John.
- What day is it?
- Sitarday.
Then George will be here.
George, what are you doing up there?
Now, what is it, Ringo?
Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
This chap here...
...Blue Meanies!
You're nuts, the pair of you.
Wait a minute, that's my car.
- How do you know it's your car?
- I'd know it anywhere.
- What's it look like, then?
- It's red with yellow wheels.
I mean, blue with orange wheels.
It's all in the mind.
- Move over, I'm driving.
- I got here first.
- I'll drive, if you like.
- No, you sit in the middle.
- I'm sitting in the middle.
- You said you were driving.
- I am driving.
- I'll get in the back, then.
Do you think we're interrupting something?
I think so.
We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?
It's all in the mind.
Try one of those doors.
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
Yes, they do.
- They do, though, don't they?
- Yes, they do.
- Don't dey, dough?
- Dough?
- Don't ask.
- Dat's dough.
What's the matter, fellas?
Blue Meanies?
Well, lads, what do you think?
I think that...
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead.
So, what do you think?
Well, then, um...
Pounding, overwhelming waves.
What do you think of that?
- Well, I think that...
- As a matter of fact, I...
I think...
- Well?
- I've forgotten.
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.
So, this is a submarine.
Soft, isn't it?
Not if you're on the bottom.
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
Then you start looking for a switch.
Perhaps this is it.
What time is it?
It's time for time.
Look, the hands are slowing down.
- Do you ever get the feeling...
- Yeah.
That things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
What's happening, John?
In my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
- Relatively speaking, that is.
- Of course.
- Maybe time's gone on strike.
- What for?
- Shorter hours.
- I don't blame it.
It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
- Why?
- It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
- You surprise me, Ringo.
- Why?
- Dealing in abstracts.
- Just because I'm a drummer...
- I don't half feel funny.
- You're not half the lad you used to be.
Look, everything's getting bigger.
It's not.
It's us that are getting smaller...
- I want my mam.
- And younger.
There you are, lads.
Old Fred will get you out of all this.
Look at that!
- It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
- It's not. It's Father Time.
- How do you know?
- I read it in a book.
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
What's that mean, Old Fred?
If we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
- What are we gonna do, then?
- We could always try a few buttons.
I want my mam.
Time's fast running out for us,
I'm afraid.
- Can't we do something to the clock?
- What do you mean, John?
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
Clever lad.
Something strange is happening.
It's speeding up now.
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
Uncannily.
There's someone in it. Look.
- And they're waving.
- It's a group of fellas.
Wave back.
Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
There's only two of us.
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is ourselves
- going backwards...
...in time!
Look at Ringo.
Oh dear, we're all the same.
Senile delinquents.
And I can hear my beard growing.
We'd better do something.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
That would explain a few things.
I'm glad I'm not young any more.
Or was it old?
- What kind of a sea is this?
- The Sea of Science.
Oh, yeah.
- He looks wrong.
- He doesn't look at all well.
In fact, he's horrible.
He's so ugly.
Really ugly!
Somebody push a button.
- There's a Cyclops.
- Can't be. He's got two eyes.
Then it must be a bi-Cyclops.
- There's another one.
- A whole cyclopedia.
There's a school of whales.
- They look a bit old for school.
- University, then.
- University of Whales.
- They look like dropouts to me.
You've got to steer clear.
- Steer clear?
- Yes, steer. Clear?
Yes, dear.
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
- Which button?
- That one.
This one?
That was the panic button.
- Poor Ringo.
- Poor lad.
Never did no harm to no-one.
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
Learn to sing trios.
No, let's save the poor devil.
I see footsteps.
- It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
- Preparing to attack.
- I don't half miss Ringo.
- He's far out there.
Always was.
- Here comes Ringo!
- 'H' is for hurry!
There goes Ringo.
It's seen us.
Find a boxing button.
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
Who cares? Find one.
Fire one!
Uh-oh, wrong one.
That.
There goes Ringo again.
- Rides well, doesn't he?
- 'E' is for ergent...
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum flask again.
- We'll be sucked into oblivion.
- Or even further.
Put her in reverse.
So long, sucker.
- Too much.
- Too soon.
Reverse! Reverse!
- Ringo time.
- 'L' is for love me...
Indians!
Help! Help!
'P' is for please...
So, press a button.
- How was it, Ringo?
- 'Arrowing.
Look who's back.
Full speed ahead.
- Oh, no.
- The motor's packing in.
By all the sea nymphets, we're losing power.
We're being swallowed.
What shall we do?
- Serve tea.
- Lovely.
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
- Maybe we should call a road service.
- Can't. No road.
And we're not sub-scribers.
Subscribers!
I know something about motors.
Let me have a look.
- Here.
- Is that the motor?
Can't you tell one when you see one?
Of course I can.
Let me peruse it.
- What do you think?
- I think I burned my finger.
Here, lads. Look at this.
- What do you think it is?
- Nothing.
Looks like nothing.
It's a local inhabitant.
He's probably one of the nothings.
At least that's something.
- Let's show him our motor.
- Steady on.
You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
But this is a nobody.
Medic, pedic, zed oblique, orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Can you tell us where we're at?
A true Socratic query, that.
And who the Billy Shears are you?
Who? Who indeed am I?
Jeremy?
Hillary?
Boob?
- Ph. D?
- Who?
Eminent physicist, polyglot, classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard biting satirist,
- talented pianist, good dentist, too.
- Lousy poet.
Critic's voice, take your choice.
- Must be one of them angry young men.
- Or a daffy old creep.
I, daffy old creep?
- Do you speak English?
- Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
- Well, do you speak English?
- You know, I'm not sure.
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
Why don't we show him our motor?
Should we really... show him our motor?
He may not have seen one before.
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic, this motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
- He fixed it.
- He fixed it?
Great. Let's go.
I must complete my bust, two novels, finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
Must you always talk in rhyme?
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
Hey, fellas. Look.
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
- A boob for all seasons.
- How can he lose?
Were your notices good?
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
There must be a word for what he is.
Okay, men, all aboard.
Let's go somewhere.
What about him?
He's happy enough going around in circles.
Poor little fella.
I don't know.
Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
Look at him.
Can't he come with us?
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
Down the hatch.
A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
Its usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into my New Statesman piece.
- That's the hatch, friend.
- Indeed.
Steady now, crew.
Prepare to go forward.
- Forward.
- Forward.
Forward!
It's awfully quiet.
What shall we do, Jeremy?
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.
- Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
- What's he saying?
- What's he doing?
- Chewing gum will do the job.
A turn of the screw, and all is...
...and all is new.
I can't stop her.
'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent,
'L' is for love me...
'P' is for... goodbye?
- That was lovely, Jeremy.
- We've lost the sub for good.
- Or for bad.
- Or for worse.
- I'm sorry about that.
- But he did fix the motor.
- Where are we?
- It looks like the foothills.
- The foothills of what?
- The foothills of the headlands.
- Carry on, lads, carry on.
- Certainly was carrying on.
- I feel a draft.
- We must be near the Sea of Holes.
Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
Excuse us...
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?
Thanks.
Gosh, look at all this dust!
Where did it come from?
A chemical error and quite imprecise.
This is a condiment...
- Condi...
- A spice.
- He's right, you know. It's pepper.
- Pepper?
Pepper.
John?
Paul?
George?
Is anybody home?
- Where are we?
- A holey sea.
This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
Oh, boy...
How many do you think there are in all?
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
Didn't Old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes
- just before the Sea of Green?
- Yeah.
Through one of them slots must be the Sea of Green.
But which? Which one?
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
There are simply no holes in my education.
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
Great. What shall we do?
Be empirical. Look.
The booby's making more and more sense.
It's getting better all the time.
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green.
The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.
I've got a hole in my pocket.
Where's Jeremy?
He was over there.
- He's not here now.
- He must have jumped ship, then.
He wouldn't do that.
He's our friend.
Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?
Pepperland.
A bit salty around the edges.
- Looks all dingy.
- And drab.
And quiet.
Safe at last.
And none the worse for our adventures.
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
There's an eye in the apples.
There she blows!
Lord Mayor, sir...
I've made it, I'm back.
- Who's this?
- Our Lord Mayor.
He's been bonked.
Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself.
Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
All right, let's sing.
Do I hear music?
Do I see... Young Fred?
You do, Lord Mayor.
Bless my metronome.
And did you bring help?
Yes, yes. Look.
Holy pizzicato, Young Fred.
It's quite uncanny, your faces...
We're quite cute, really.
You could pass for the originals.
We are the originals.
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.
They couldn't be much with a name like that.
Sergeant Pepper?
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
Where are your instruments?
- Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
- Sea of Monsters.
We'll get other instruments,
Lord Mayor.
Not a chance.
The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
They hate music that much, do they?
They shrink at the very sound.
Okay, you guys.
It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
Aim, fire!
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
- What do we do?
- Coagulate with the crowd.
Cut-outs at the ready.
Then let's cut out.
What a grand bandstand.
That's where the gear's kept.
Come on.
Cavey, cavey.
All right, the coast is clear.
Now's our chance.
- But how'll we get over?
- Easy. Follow me.
A-ha! You fools!
It's not very light in here, is it?
Shh! Keep the noise down.
- Look what I found.
- It's their uniforms.
- Nice bit of gear, that.
- They'll look great on, eh?
- Dey will, won't dey?
- Won't dey, dough.
- How do I look?
- Groovy. How about me?
- Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
- Oh, heck.
A million billion Meanies.
They're coming this way.
Hide!
- Do you think they heard us?
- I hope not.
- What did you say?
- Shh!
Good plan.
Look. They're all asleep.
They look cute when they're asleep.
Almost human.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- On tiptoe.
- Tiptoe through the Meanies...
- Shh!
Let's exude.
Relax, lads.
Not a Meanie in sight.
- Not even a teeny Meanie.
- Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
- Look. Breakfast.
- I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
Look out.
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
- One, two, three, four...
- Five.
Five?
- Sound off, one, two, three...
- Four.
- One, two, three...
- Four.
- One, two...
- Three.
- Three?
- Two.
- Two?
- One.
One?
Are you Bluish?
You don't look Bluish.
Run for it.
Right, men. We've made it.
- Instruments at the ready.
- Okay, on the beat.
A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six.
- Can't you make it three?
- All right.
On the beat of three...
A-one, a-two, a-three...
It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill.
You're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.
We'd love to take you home.
- The hills are alive...
...with the sound of music.
Who is responsible for this?
Rimsky Korsakov?
Guy Lombardo?
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue.
Tomorrow, the world!
Bring in my Bloobers.
- Who?
- Who?
There you are, my little Glovey-dovey.
Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.
Smash them! Squash them!
Crash them!
Oblue-terate them!
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
- Glove?
- Glove?
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
Open your mouth, it won't hurt.
John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
It's easy.
All you need is love.
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
Hey, wait, and watch.
It's all in the mind, you know.
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
In Pepperland, all things are possible.
- It's not a goldfish bowl.
- Just a big glass bowl, then.
- It's blue glass.
- It must be from Kentucky.
There's something inside.
- Four fellas.
- What are they doing there?
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
- It can't be.
- It's us.
- But we're here.
- It's Sgt. Pepper's...
- Lonely...
- Hearts Club...
Band.
The resemblance is truly striking.
If I could come in here...
I think the theory put forward by Einstein could well be applied here.
The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
- John!
...beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
- John!
- George?
- How do we get them out?
- Break the glass.
- We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
- Nothing is Beatle-proof.
Have you got your drumsticks with you?
A drum break might shatter it.
- No, I haven't.
- Have a look in your pocket.
I've got a hole in my pocket.
I wonder if...
Yeah, it still works.
Ringo, we take back all we said.
You're a genius, a sheer genius.
I know, I know, I know.
- Like coloured telly.
- Like crystal.
They're decanting.
Hello, brother.
Yeah, without a doubt.
- We're the spitting image of each other.
- Golly, yeah.
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
- Yes, I'm the alter-ego man.
- And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.
I'm glad you asked me that.
Because as a matter of fact there's a war on.
Then, brothers in war, to the skirmish must we hence.
Shall we hence?
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence.
Beatles to battle. Charge!
- We're surrounded.
- Nice dog, though.
What do you say?
Sing it.
Do you know any more?
Play it!
Jeremy, can it be you?
Can it be me? I think you'd better inquire of the guards, for when I was captured, they took all my cards.
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy.
- The whole world's being attacked.
- What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs versus the guard?
Oh, guard!
Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut, right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy!
Come on, Ringo!
Get back! Get back!
Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies!
You're advancing the wrong way!
Retreat backwards!
Get back there now!
My kingdom for a horse!
I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
He does, does he?
Yes, I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
You don't, eh?
We'll soon see about that.
He does in truth seem quite annoyed, some reference material before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
A rosy nose?
Speak your last piece!
Peace, peace, supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour, turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom, bloom, bloom...
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody,
- I knew he was somebody.
- You're right.
Hello there, blue people.
Won't you join us?
Buck up, and otherwise go mingle.
- What do you say?
- Max?
Your Blue...
I mean, your Newness!
It's no longer a blue world, Max.
Where could we go?
Argentina?
Are you with us?
Will you join?
- Shall we?
- No!
Yes, your Newness!
- Yes, Max...
- Yes.
Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing and chasing of blues, the very best word for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
Yes, let us mix, Max.
I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of Happiness.
- Catchy tune, that.
- I can't seem to get it out of my head.
- Then shake it.
- That's what we've been doing all night.
Yeah, it was a great party.
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs.
- Here is the motor.
- And I've got a little love.
- And I've got a hole in my pocket.
- A hole?
Half a hole, anyway.
I gave the rest to Jeremy.
What can he do with half a hole?
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
Look at John, will you?
What's the matter, John?
Blue Meanies?
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
- How's that?
- Singing.
One... two... three... four
Phew.
Ohh.
You didn't tell me you were gonna kill it.
Thanks, old pal.
Charge!
Never jump into a pile of leaves with a wet sucker.
Say, Charlie Brown, l've got a football.
How about practicing a few place kicks? l'll hold the ball and you come running and kick it.
Oh, brother. l don't mind your dishonesty half as much as l mind your opinion of me.
You must think l'm stupid.
-Oh, come on, Charlie Brown.
-No. l'll hold it steady.
No.
Please?
You just want me to come running up to kick that ball...
...so you can pull it away and see me land flat on my back and kill myself.
This time you can trust me.
See, here's a signed document...
...testifying that l promise not to pull it away. lt is signed. lt's a signed document. l guess if you have a signed document in your possession, you can't go wrong.
This year l'm really gonna kick that football.
Peculiar thing about this document: lt was never notarized.
Who are you writing to, Linus?
This is the time of year to write to the Great Pumpkin.
On Halloween night, the Great Pumpkin rises out of his pumpkin patch...
...and flies through the air with his bag of toys for all the children.
You must be crazy.
When are you going to stop believing in something that isn't true?
When you stop believing in that fellow with the red suit and the white beard...
...who goes, "Ho-ho-ho."
We're obviously separated by denominational differences.
Not again.
Writing a letter to a stupid pumpkin?
You make me the laughing stock of the neighborhood.
All they talk about is my little brother who always writes to the Great Pumpkin.
You better cut it out right now or l'll pound you.
There are three things l have learned never to discuss with people:
Religion, politics and the Great Pumpkin.
You're wasting your time.
The Great Pumpkin is a fake.
-What are you doing, Linus?
-l'd rather not say. You might laugh.
Oh, l'd never laugh at you, Linus.
You're so intelligent. l'm writing to the Great Pumpkin.
You say the cutest things.
On Halloween night, the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch...
...then flies through the air to bring toys to all the good little children everywhere.
Wouldn't you like to sit with me in the pumpkin patch on Halloween night...
-...and wait for the Great Pumpkin?
-Oh, l'd love to, Linus.
What's going on here?
What are you trying to do to my little sister?
And how do you think you're gonna mail that letter?
You can't possibly reach the mailbox, and l'm not gonna help you.
Hey, l got an invitation to a Halloween party. ls the invitation to Violet's party,
Charlie Brown?
Yes, it's the first time l've ever been invited to a party.
Charlie Brown, if you got an invitation, it was a mistake.
There were two lists, Charlie Brown: one to invite and one not to invite.
You must have been put on the wrong list.
A person should always choose a costume...
...which is in direct contrast to her own personality. ls Linus taking me to the party?
That stupid blockhead of a brother of mine is out in the pumpkin patch...
-...making his yearly fool of himself.
-Boy, is he strange.
But maybe there is a Great Pumpkin.
Every year, Linus misses tricks or treats, and then the Halloween party.
He'll never learn.
Do l get to go trick-or-treating this year, big brother?
-Sure, Sally.
-Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
-How do we do it?
-All you have to do is walk up to a house...
...ring the doorbell and say, "Tricks or treats."
-Are you sure it's legal?
-Of course it's legal. l wouldn't want to be accused of taking part in a rumble.
Oh, good grief.
-ls that you, Patty?
-No.
-Where is Charlie Brown?
-Here l am. l had a little trouble with the scissors.
They'll never guess it's me under here.
Hello, Pigpen. Glad you could make it.
How did you know it was me?
What in the world kind of a costume is that?
He's a World War l Flying Ace.
Now l've heard everything.
All right everybody, we'll go trick-or-treating...
...and then over to Violet's for the big Halloween party.
Hey, have you come to sing pumpkin carols?
You blockhead, you're gonna miss all the fun just like last year.
Don't talk like that.
The Great Pumpkin knows which kids have been good...
...and which kids have been bad.
-You'll be sorry.
-Oh, good grief.
He'll come here because l have the most sincere pumpkin patch...
...and he respects sincerity.
Do you really think he'll come?
Tonight, the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch...
...he flies through the air and brings toys to all the children of the world.
That's a good story.
You don't believe the story of the Great Pumpkin? l thought little girls always believed everything that was told to them. l thought little girls were innocent and trusting.
Welcome to the 20th century.
All right, once and for all, are you coming or are you staying?
We can't waste all night. l'm glad you came back, Sally.
We'll just sit here in this pumpkin patch...
...and you'll see the Great Pumpkin with your own eyes. lf you try to hold my hand, l'll slug you.
Each year, the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch...
...that he thinks is the most sincere.
He's gotta pick this one. He's got to. l don't see how a pumpkin patch could be more sincere than this one.
You can look all around and there's not a sign of hypocrisy.
Nothing but sincerity as far as the eye can see.
Trick or treat, money or eats!
Can l have an extra piece of candy for my stupid brother?
He couldn't come with us, because he's sitting in a pumpkin patch...
...waiting for the Great Pumpkin. lt's so embarrassing to have to ask for something extra for that blockhead Linus.
-l got five pieces of candy.
-l got a chocolate bar.
-l got a quarter.
-l got a rock.
Trick or treat.
-Gee, l got a candy bar.
-Boy, l got three cookies.
Hey, l got a package of gum. l got a rock.
Trick or treat. l got a popcorn ball.
-l got a fudge bar.
-l got a pack of gum. l got a rock.
By the way, whatever happened to the World War l Flying Ace?
Oh, he's probably getting ready to take off in his Sopwith Camel...
...on the next dawn patrol.
His mission is to find the Red Baron and shoot him down.
Here's the World War l Flying Ace...
...climbing into the cockpit of his Sopwith Camel.
"Contact," he shouts.
Aaahhh!
Ha!
Here's the World War l Flying Ace...
...imagining he's down behind enemy lines...
...making his way across the French countryside.
Come on, let's get going. lt's time for the Halloween party.
Has the Great Pumpkin been by?
What blockheads, sitting in a pumpkin patch in the middle of the night.
You've missed trick or treat...
...and now you're going to miss the Halloween party.
What a way to spend Halloween.
You think you're so smart.
Just wait until the Great Pumpkin comes.
He'll be here. You can bet on that.
Linus knows what he's talking about.
Linus knows what he's doing.
-All right, where is he?
-He'll be here. l hope so. l have my reputation to think of, you know.
And just think of all of the fun we're missing.
Just look, nothing but sincerity as far as the eye can see.
Charlie Brown, you'll have to model for us.
Me? You want me to model?
Sure, Charlie Brown, you'll be the perfect model.
Turn him around. lf we shape the eyes like this:
And the nose like this:
And the mouth like this:
Yes, that's the way.
Thank you, Charlie Brown.
You were a perfect model.
All right, all right, let's bob for apples.
This is the way to do it.
Yeah, Lucy, you should be good at this.
You have the perfect mouth for it.
Blah! My lips touched dog lips!
Blagh! Agh! Poisoned dog lips!
Blagh! Agh! lf anyone had told me l'd be waiting...
...in a pumpkin patch on Halloween night...
...l'd have said they were crazy.
Just think, Sally, when the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch...
...we'll be here to see him.
What's that?
What's that? l hear the Great Pumpkin.
There he is. There he is. lt's the Great Pumpkin.
He's rising up out of the pumpkin patch.
What happened?
Did l faint? What did he leave us?
Did he leave us any toys? l was robbed! l spent the whole night waiting for the Great Pumpkin...
...when l could have been out for tricks or treats.
Halloween is over, and l missed it!
You blockhead.
You kept me up all night waiting for the Great Pumpkin...
...and all that came was a beagle. l didn't get a chance to go out for tricks or treats.
And it was all your fault. l'll sue!
What a fool l was! l could have had candy apples and gum...
...and cookies and money and all sorts of things...
...but no, l had to listen to you.
You blockhead. What a fool l was.
Trick or treats come only once a year.
And l missed it by sitting in a pumpkin patch with a blockhead.
You owe me restitution!
You heard about fury and a woman scorned, haven't you?
Yes, l guess l have.
Well, that's nothing compared to the fury of a woman...
...who has been cheated out of tricks or treats.
Hey, aren't you gonna wait and greet the Great Pumpkin, huh? lt won't be long now. lf the Great Pumpkin comes, l'll still put in a good word for you.
Good grief, l said "if." l meant when he comes! l'm doomed.
One little slip like that can cause the Great Pumpkin to pass you by.
O Great Pumpkin, where are you?
Well, another Halloween has come and gone.
Yes, Charlie Brown. l don't understand it. l went trick-or-treating and all l got was a bag full of rocks. l suppose you spent all night in the pumpkin patch.
-And the Great Pumpkin never showed up?
-Nope.
Well, don't take it too hard, Linus. l've done a lot of stupid things in my life too.
Stupid? What do you mean, stupid?
Just wait till next year, Charlie Brown.
You'll see, next year at this same time...
...l'll find a pumpkin patch that is real sincere...
...and l'll sit in that pumpkin patch until the Great Pumpkin appears.
He'll rise out of that pumpkin patch...
...and he'll fly through the air with his bag of toys.
The Great Pumpkin will appear and l'll be waiting for him. l'll be there. l'll be sitting there in that pumpkin patch...
...and l'll see the Great Pumpkin.
Just wait and see, Charlie Brown. l'll see that Great Pumpkin. l'll see the Great Pumpkin.
Just you wait, Charlie Brown.
The Great Pumpkin will appear and l'll be waiting for him.
The Great Pumpkin will appear and l'll be waiting for him.
My friends, this is Paris.
Gay, beautiful, wonderful, magnificent Paris.
Paris: The tender mother of romance.
Of love. Of amour.
But not all the love stories of France begin in Paris. No, no, no.
There was one, for example, a quite unusual one that began in the hot...
...sun-drenched region in the south of France...
...in the province known as Provence.
The time is around the turn of the century.
You call it the Gay Nineties, no?
But that is beside the point.
This is the story of a little female citizen of France...
...who is as beautiful and as innocent as her name.
And her name is Mewsette.
No last name. Just Mewsette.
Hello, Jaune Tom.
Hello, Mewsette.
That was a very nice song you were singing, Jaune Tom.
- Please sing some more for me.
- Mewsette...
...you know I can't sing it when you're looking at me.
Amour, amour...
...a- mush.
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
Jaune Tom, you're wonderful.
Jaune Tom!
A moose! A moose!
I mean, a mouse.
It's as big as a moose.
- I mean, it's a whopper.
- A mouse?
Where? Where?
At the barn. Hurry! Hurry!
Come on, let's go!
Jaune Tom, you're a...
...clumsy country clod.
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!
Hey, Jaune Tom.
What are we going to do with our mouse?
We'll wrap it as a gift and give it to Mewsette.
Mewsette...
That's all I ever hear around this place.
But, my dear sister, how can you continue to bury yourself on this farm?
I like it here, Jeunesse, chérie.
I choose to live here.
And now, tell me about this friend of yours in Paris.
- Is he nice?
- My dear sister, what manners.
So polished.
Not at all like the plebeian peasants you would meet out here.
The peasants, they are good and honest...
...and very happy.
Happy, on this pile of dust?
How can you allow yourself to go to seed like a fat duck?
- Ducks don't go to seed, my dear sister.
- Well, like a vegetable then.
That's what you are, Marie:
A cabbage, an artichoke.
True, Jeunesse, and vegetables are happiest on farms.
But, darling, think of Paris.
Lovely, gay Paris.
Have you forgotten the sidewalk cafes and how we sipped champagne?
Champagne. That must be what they call catnip in Paris.
How nice.
The button champignons sauteed in butter with tiny shreds of ham.
Champignons.
I know what they are. Mushrooms!
And delicious too.
- And, my dear, the Champs Elysees.
- Champs Elysées?
- I wonder what they taste like.
- Oh, what a lovely feline.
Too bad her beauty is wasted here.
Now, in Paris, she would be perfumed and curled...
...and have a stunning coiffure.
We would go everywhere in style, wouldn't we, chérie?
The Rivoli, Maxim's, the Place Pigalle...
...boating on the Seine...
...with the music of Paris surrounding and caressing us.
Oh, those nights. So sparkling, so clear, that each star becomes...
...the glittering point of a great blue diamond.
Mewsette!
Hey, Mewsette!
What's the matter?
Are you deaf or something?
No. I am not deaf or something.
Come on, come on.
Read the poem.
Okay, okay.
You don't have to push.
A poem, dedicated to Mewsette.
To Mewsette, the prettiest cat
In all of France
All right, all right.
It's your poem.
Roses are red violets are blue
Here is a mouse from me to you
Signed, Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom! You take that horrid, vulgar thing away from here this minute!
I've never been so insulted.
How dare you think that I would eat such a coarse, plebeian thing.
But...
- But cats like mice.
- Perhaps so.
- But I am not a cat, I'll have you know.
- You're not a...?
- You're not a cat?
- Not a cat?
I am a...
A... feline.
- A feline?
- You're a fe... What?
I think she means a female, Robespierre.
And all felines really like is champagne and champignons...
...and Champs Elysees...
And all I get on this farm is mice and milk!
I feel like a cabbage that's gone to seed. Like a fat duck!
Gosh, Mewsette, you're not as fat as a duck.
Oh, go away, you ple... Ple...
Plebeian peasant, you!
I never want to see you again.
I wish I were dead!
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!
So do we.
Don't we, Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?
Jaune Tom?
Now look what you've done, you... You old feline, you!
Plebeians!
Well, if you don't like us "plebleens," why don't you go away with her?
I'll bet she just lives on "cham-pag-ne" and
"cham-pygmy-ons" and "champs-ulysses."
Why, Robespierre, that's a wonderful idea.
That's exactly what I'll do.
I'll go to Paris.
No more mice and milk for me!
Well, bon voyage, Mademoiselle Feline.
Au revoir, Robespierre!
Take good care of Jaune Tom!
What do you know?
She did it!
I must have a way with felines.
We're free! Free!
Free at last!
Well, you're a mouse.
You ought to know.
Why didn't she like you?
Did you ever have any trouble like that with your girl?
Oh. You are a girl.
Well, then tell me something from the girl's point of view.
What's wrong with me?
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
- Where are you, Jaune Tom?
- Over here, Robespierre.
You can come on back now.
Everything's okay.
You mean Mewsette...?
Mewsette'll take the mouse?
No. She's left, Jaune Tom.
Took off.
- Nothing but fun now that Mewsette's gone.
- What do you mean she's gone?
- She just went away in a carriage.
- Carriage?
- What carriage?
- The one that took her to Paris.
- Well, why did she go to Paris?
- All felines go to Paris, I guess.
Come on, Jaune Tom.
Let's go mouse hunting.
Mewsette!
Hey. Wait for me!
Mewsette! Come back, Mewsette!
For the last time, my lad, if your friend arrived in that buggy...
...she has gone to Paris.
All right. I know that, but where's Paris?
What is Paris?
What is Paris?
- Are you mad?
- Is it a school or something for felines?
A school for felines?
- No? Well, a village, maybe?
- Yes.
That is what it is. A little village a mile or two up the tracks.
And now, if you don't mind,
I do have work to do.
Well, thanks a lot.
Jaune Tom! Jaune Tom!
- Pardon me, sir, but did you see...?
- He went thataway.
Gee, thanks. Jaune Tom!
Good morning, Jaune Tom.
Nighty-night.
I can hardly believe it!
I'm really on my way to Paris!
Delightful.
Delightful city, isn't it?
Oh, yes, sir.
Even more beautiful than
I dreamed it would be.
- First trip to Paris?
- Oh, yes.
- Visiting relatives?
- Oh, no.
I just up and decided that I'd vegetated too long on that dreary farm...
...and that every girl should see Paris and Jaune Tom is so dull...
...and I don't know anybody in Paris and it's all so wonderful...
Oh, but you must think I'm terribly bold to talk this way to a stranger.
Not at all. I think your enthusiasm is charming, and I'm not offended.
Oh, thank you.
I just know I'll be happy here.
Of course. But like any big city,
Paris has its pitfalls.
Oh, I realie that.
But after all, I'm...
I'm not exactly a kitten anymore.
I choose my friends very carefully.
And that's very wise, my dear.
Nevertheless, there are still a few unscrupulous characters about.
- Oh, dear me.
- You need a friend, a sponsor.
- Now, l...
- But that would hardly be proper, would it?
Mademoiselle! You cannot be inferring that I would suggest anything improper.
Oh, dear, no. Oh.
Please forgive me. It's just that...
I thought that my sister, one of the most influential cats in Paris...
...might be persuaded to take you under her wing.
Teach you all you need to know, introduce you to society.
But of course, if you would prefer to go it yourself...
...alone in a strange city, by all means.
- Oh, no, please.
- I would love to meet your sister.
- Then it is settled.
Come along, my dear.
Jaune Tom!
What are we doing down here,
Jaune Tom?
Let's go home before something happens to us.
I can't, Robespierre.
I have to find Mewsette.
Well, you look for Mewsette.
I'm gonna look for trains.
Is it much further to your sister's shop, monsieur?
No. It is just a little further along this street.
Yes. Here we are, my dear, the best in all Paris.
"Salon de Beaute Pour Felines.
Mme. Rubens-Chatte."
Meowrice, how nice to see you again.
- This is Mewsette, my dear sister.
- Isn't she pretty?
Any sister of Meowrice is a friend of mine.
Henrietta, you are my sister.
Sister!
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
She is an old dear but a little absent-minded.
Imagine, not even remembering your own brother!
- Yes.
- How silly of me.
Of course I'm his sister.
I've been his sister for years.
Mewsette is new to Paris, dear sister.
I have told her of your wonderful salon...
...where you will make her into the belle of all Paris.
- Of course, dear brother.
- Then she is all yours, Henrietta.
- You know what must be done.
- Now, look here, Meowrice.
It's going to take time and money to make a lady out of this cat.
So this time, I want something in advance.
Don't rush things, my dear.
Just remember, time is on the side of the scoundrel.
- And you are the king of the scoundrels.
- Yes.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some business to attend to.
All right. Now listen carefully.
So I want one of you to keep an eye on that girl at all times.
Is that clear?
As they say,
"Evil is the root of all money."
Money trees, that is.
Big green money trees.
Gosh! We'll never find Paris in all those buildings and things.
- Yeah. There's a lot of them, all right.
- I told you it was a wild-goose chase.
- Come on. Let's go home.
- No, Robespierre.
- I can't go back without Mewsette.
- Well, I can.
So long, Jaune Tom.
I'm gonna miss you, Robespierre.
Take care of yourself.
Take care of myself?
Who's gonna take care of him?
Without me, no telling what'll happen to him.
Alone, friendless, far from home.
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's start looking.
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
Mewsette!
- Quiet! Stop that noise!
- Go away, you silly little pussycats.
- Get away from here!
- Scram! Go on!
Leave those cats out of here!
Allez!
I don't know why she ever came to Paris.
I don't know why you ever came to Paris.
Your purr, my dear, it's like a cement mixer.
But that's the way I purred back home on the farm.
Well, it won't do here.
It must be refined, yet seductive.
Like this:
Now try again and put some throat into it.
Stop!
- Oh, stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Madame Rubens-Chatte.
Being sorry isn't enough.
Now, look, child.
We don't want to disappoint
Meowrice, do we?
- Oh, no. I'll try very hard this time.
- Good.
Now, let's show him how poised and gracefully...
...we walk with a bowl of milk on our head.
Now walk towards me.
Head erect.
Turn right. Left.
Reverse.
Oh, look out!
Oh, no.
I'm a failure. I'll never be a Parisian.
I'm going back home, back with the peasants...
...where I belong.
- No! No! Stop her! Stop her!
Stop her yourself.
My poor dear.
I know just how you feel.
Wouldn't you like to stroll on the boulevard, stop at a sidewalk cafe?
- And order Champs Elysees, just once.
- Of course, my pet.
Let us be gay.
We shall do the town.
- Do you feel better now, my dear?
- Oh, yes.
Those sidewalk cafes were so much fun.
And Paris is so beautiful!
And I feel so important riding in a buggy and...
Oh, good heavens, Meowrice.
What are they doing?
Oh, them? Why, they are kissing, chérie.
- What's kissing?
- Kissing?
Why, kissing is...
Like rubbing noses.
But do they only kiss in buggies?
Well, if you did away with buggies, you'd stop half the kissing in Paris.
How strange. Why is that?
Because, my naive one, there is nothing so romantic as a buggy ride.
- Here we are.
- Oh! So soon?
- Now, back to your lessons, my dear.
- Goodbye, Meowrice. And thank you!
How foolish I was.
I'll never think of that dull farm again.
I tell you, Jaune Tom, it's hopeless.
Absolutely hopeless.
- She's probably miles from here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose you're right, Robespierre.
- Well, come on then.
- Let's go back to the farm.
- Okay. Okay.
Now you're talking!
Robespierre, look!
Look what it says: "Felines"!
That's what Mewsette said she was.
I'll bet they'd know where she is.
Here we go again.
Jaune Tom!
Help, Jaune Tom!
Jaune Tom! Help!
- Who is it, dearie?
- There's no one here.
No one at all.
Help!
You know, Robespierre, we're seeing parts of Paris that the tourists usually miss.
Let's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place.
"Mr. Henry Phtt, 1411 Sand Box Road...
...Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A."
"Dear Mr. Phtt:
At long last, I have found a bride for you.
With proper schooling now underway...
...she will be the most beautiful and talented cat in the world.
I shall keep you informed of her progress.
Your obedient servant,
Meowrice Percy Beaucoup."
"P.S. I'm afraid that the price we agreed upon...
...must, under the circumstances, be doubled.
There are other suitors."
Well, I'm off to mail this letter.
If you ever decide to marry, boys, marry for love...
...of money.
Jaune Tom, you take that horrid, vulgar thing away from here this minute!
Pardon me, my friend, but that was the most remarkable exhibition...
...of "virtu-mouse-ity"
I've ever witnessed.
- Virtu-what-sity?
- Virtu-mouse-ity.
A little phrase I coined to describe the incredible proficiency...
...you just displayed in apprehending that rodent.
Obviously, it was too small.
Throwing it back was such a noble gesture.
It is an imposition, I know, but it would afford me great pleasure...
...if you would join me for a bite of dinner and perhaps a sip of...
We accept! We accept!
Name's Robespierre, manager of him...
...Jaune Tom, the world's greatest mouser.
And now can we eat?
It would seem to be out of our hands, monsieur.
What'll it be your pleasure you're having, s'il vous plait?
- Milk.
- Milk?
No, no. Let's really live it up big, Jaune Tom.
- Straight cream.
- No, no, messieurs.
On an occasion such as this, we drink champagne.
Champagne, garcon.
Champagne for the greatest mouse catcher in all France...
...and his manager.
One bottle of champagne, hot off the ice.
Hey, it's made out of bubbles.
I just wanna tell you...
...that you're all a wonderful bunch of gentlemen.
Everyone.
I saloosh...
Shaloot...
I salute you!
What a head.
What a head!
Here, what is this?
A turtle, perhaps?
A turtle with a hangover?
A two-headed turtle? Impossible.
Where are you going, turtle?
What do you know?
This is no turtle.
It's just a small, bloodshot kitten.
Oh, gently, gently, shipmate.
I won't harm your little friend.
You see, we three are all in the same boat.
The same boat.
That is pretty funny.
The same boat, no?
Say... No.
No, I guess not.
The truth is, we have been shanghaied, shipmates.
Or catnapped, in your case.
And that means we have to work.
Jaune Tom.
It's all right, Jaune Tom.
We'll get back all right.
Oh, it's such a big ocean, Robespierre, bigger than all France.
Bigger than the whole world.
Sure it is, but you've never given up hope yet.
I have now.
It's too big, Robespierre.
We'll never get back to find Mewsette.
It's not as big as you think, Jaune Tom.
Why, look.
It's just made up of little drops.
It's all how you look at it.
Honestly, Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom?
There you are, shipmates.
I have good news!
We are headed for Alaska and the gold rush.
We will strike it rich, my friends.
Then we will return to Paris in style.
No time for games, little turtle.
The rain has stopped and I have work to do.
I must swab the deck, yes?
"Dear Mr. Phtt:
According to your instructions,
I am having Mewsette's portrait painted...
...by the most famous artists in Paris.
Many of them are not yet well-known in America...
...so please allow me to tell you a little bit about each one.
Claude Monet might well be said to be the father of the Impressionist movement.
You will notice how Monsieur Monet achieves a shimmering light...
...throughout the picture...
...and an impression of air and space.
A man of noble birth is
Monsieur Henri Toulouse-Lautrec...
...who is perhaps best known for his striking posters for the Moulin Rouge.
Pointillism is a highly individual style developed by Georges Seurat...
...in which he creates his astonishing effects...
...by the clever placing of tiny dots of paint...
...next to each other.
Henri Rousseau is an ex-soldier with no formal art training.
He is known as a 'primitive painter.'
With his vivid imagination...
...he is creating a charming world of his own...
...where oranges grow on banana trees.
Amedeo Modigliani is a talented young Italian painter...
...who shows great promise.
Sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him.
A Dutch painter who has found new inspiration here in Paris...
...is a man of violent temperament:
Vincent van Gogh.
To achieve a strong emotional impact...
...he sometimes applies paint directly from the tube.
Monsieur Edgar Degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his models.
To arrive at his delicate color harmonies...
...he often uses pastels instead of oil paints.
Don't be concerned when you see
Auguste Renoir's portrait.
Mewsette has not gotten fat.
Monsieur Paul Ceanne is an intellectual artist.
He is a masterful organier of color, composition and form.
His subjects often take on the aspects of a still life.
The dynamic Paul Gauguin has only recently returned from Tahiti...
...and his paintings show the influence of the South Sea Islands.
Another young painter here in Paris is a volatile Spaniard...
...who shows every indication of someday setting the art world afire.
His name is Pablo Picasso.
And so, hoping that you will enjoy them,
I ship these paintings on to you.
And tonight I am sending the original article:
Mewsette herself."
Here. Mail this letter, Armond.
Now, I want no slip-ups.
The train leaves at midnight.
I'll be back shortly with the belle of Paris.
I want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her...
...compartment.
I hope my little protegee is ready for her great adventure, sister.
She is, but you don't get her till I'm paid.
In full.
No money, no Mewsette.
Very well, then.
I'll write you a check.
- It's better than money.
- Now, that's more like it.
It will be well worth it, Meowrice.
Mewsette is my greatest achievement, my crowning glory.
For the sake of your dear neck,
I do hope so.
How gallantly you put your case, Meowrice.
No girl could resist you.
Judge for yourself whether you're getting your money's worth.
- Mewsette, chérie.
- Yes, dear Madame Rubens-Chatte?
- Why, brother. Don't tell me...?
- Momentary lapse, my dear.
Even cats are sometimes human.
Mewsette, my dear young friend, you are beautiful beyond compare.
Thank you, monsieur.
You are most kind.
Tonight I wish to speak to you of something very personal.
I think you will agree that before this night is over...
...all your dreams will come true.
Oh, Madame Rubens-Chatte, isn't it wonderful?
I do thank you for making it all possible.
Come, my dear. Paris awaits you.
And, dear madame, may I say everything that happens...
...is because of your faith in me?
I'll be back soon and tell you about it.
Don't wait up, sister.
It will be later than she thinks.
I'm going to miss that beautiful little thing.
Well, at least I've got this check to cheer me up.
What's happ...?
What's happening?
Why, that double-crosser! That crook!
He used disappearing ink.
Do you know, if the opportunity arose...
...to do him a disservice...
...I might not be able to resist it.
The moon is beautiful tonight, mon chérie.
Oh, yes. So romantic.
Step in here, my dear...
...out of the chill night wind.
What was it you wished to tell me, Meowrice?
Tonight I wish to speak of love and marriage.
You have thought of marriage, haven't you?
Yes, I...
- I suppose I have.
- Good.
Then I know just the one for you.
Here's his picture.
His name is Henry Phtt...
...of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
You mean you want me to marry this...
...fat, old...?
- You are as bright as you are pretty.
So please get into the basket...
...like a good little bride-to-be.
- Who are they?
- Business associates, chérie.
Just get into the basket, and you won't have to look at them anymore.
Into the basket?
No! Oh, no!
Yes! Oh, yes!
You are going to Pittsburgh to marry that rich American.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't that why you left the farm?
Yes. I mean, no.
I just...
I just want Jaune Tom.
Jaune Tom? You mean the world's greatest mouser?
Why, old Jaune Tom's probably in Alaska about now.
He is not. You're lying...
...just like you did about everything else.
Call it a weakness.
Now get into the basket.
No! I won't!
I'm not going to marry anybody!
After her, boys!
Don't let her fall!
I have already paid the postage.
Come down from there,
Armond, you idiot.
No time for second-story work tonight.
Well, why didn't you say so, you epithet?
Well, do you see her?
Hurry. Hurry!
You fools. Don't you see those paw prints?
This should be easy.
Let's go.
She's not down here.
Back the other way!
There she goes!
Get rid of that dog, you bumbling idiots!
Your whiskers tickle, cats.
And since I can't stand to be tickled by no cats...
...I'm gonna tear your tails off and have them for breakfast.
We understand your feelings, sir.
Nothing like cats' tails for breakfast...
...but back there, among those barrels, is a...
No! Please!
Let's talk this over.
After all I've done for you.
Taught you everything I know...
...made you despicable scoundrels beyond compare.
And what happens? You meet one little dog and I, Meowrice...
...have to save your miserable, worthless lives.
Now, get out there and find Mewsette.
Brave country, is it not, mes amis?
This weather, she's a little nippy for cats.
You could call it "catnip weather."
Catnip weather, no?
No. Well, I am discouraged too.
We come for gold, we find cold.
I tell you what.
Let's join the Foreign Legion.
We go to Africa and get warm again, eh?
Mon dieu! Little turtle, look!
We've struck it rich!
Jaune Tom, we're rich!
We're rich!
Wow!
We're rich! Now we can go back.
Six weeks. Six whole weeks lost.
Never send kittens to do a cat's job, I always say.
And now that I'm getting these splints off my tail...
How are you, baby?
Good as new?
Now, then!
We are going out and find Mewsette...
...or there will be four new violins in the world.
Lovely view, eh, mademoiselle?
Oh, no! Please!
If there was any other way,
I would have waited, Jaune Tom.
Nice fielding, team.
Come along. We'll take the scenic route home.
The first thing we do is head for that
Madame what's her name's salon...
...and they're bound to know where she is.
Come on, let's go.
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'm right behind you.
There it is.
- Where's Mewsette?
- She's in danger.
- Yes, I know, but...
- They've taken her to Meowrice's...
...and I think she's still there.
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Never mind the thanks.
Just give Meowrice my love and then turn him inside out.
Now, hurry. Hurry!
Canned fish?
What won't they think of next?
Everything is packaged these days.
Even pretty girls, hmm?
What?
Jaune Tom? The champion mouser?
At Madame Rubens-Chatte's?
Quick, then. We must be off to the train.
Grab the handles.
Put your backs into it.
Get moving, you idiots.
All right, lads, the coast is clear.
Let's go.
Mewsette.
Mewsette!
Mewsette, where are you?
Don't worry, Jaune Tom,
I'll be right there.
It's no use, Robespierre.
We're too late.
Nobody to...
...with?
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Stop.
Look. There's a message.
"Jaune Tom, I'm being taken to the train."
Tears of gratitude, chérie?
Just think, in a few hours, you will be on a boat to America...
...and your new, old, rich husband.
Well, well, there are your little friends...
...down to bid you goodbye.
What are we gonna do?
I'm too pooped.
Au revoir, my children.
Don't forget to write.
Hey. Hey, maybe if I...
Maybe if I imagine...
Mewsette?
- Mewsette, where are you?
- Jaune Tom!
Good work, gentlemen.
Stop him, someone.
Toss him out the door, boys.
He ought to make quite a splash.
Jaune Tom, help!
They've got Robespierre!
Too late, my dear.
Are you all right, Mewsette?
You look all right.
I mean, at least your eyes do.
If you'll let me out now, Jaune Tom,
I'll show you how I really look.
Sure, sure.
What's the matter with me anyway?
It doesn't really matter, though.
Why, Jaune Tom, that's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me.
Jaune Tom, I've been such a fool.
Jaune Tom, look out!
You keep out of it, Robespierre.
Jaune Tom, hold it!
Stop.
"Mr. Henry Phtt.
1411 Sand Box Road."
Oh, yes.
Good idea, Robespierre.
Now, you go to beddy-bye, and when you wake up...
...you'll be on a boat going to meet that rich husband.
Right, Robespierre?
Please. Please don't say anything more. I'm dying.
I'm dying, I tell you!
[ENGLISH]
[Birds chattering and hooting]
[Narrator] Many strange legends
are told of these jungles of India,
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.
It all began when the silence
of the jungle was broken
by an unfamiliar sound.
[Baby crying]
It was a sound like
one never heard before
in this part of the jungle.
[Crying continues]
It was a man cub!
Had I known how deeply
I was to be involved,
I would've obeyed
my first impulse and walked away.
[Baby laughing, cooing]
[Cooing and laughing]
This man cub would have
to have nourishment, and soon.
It was many days' travel
to the nearest man-village,
and without a mother's care,
he would soon perish.
- [Cooing continues]
- Then it occurred to me.
A family of wolves I knew
had been blessed
with a litter of cubs.
[Whining, whimpering]
[Barking]
[Loud crying]
[Cooing, laughing]
I knew there'd be no problem
with the mother,
thanks to the maternal instinct,
but I wasn't so sure
about Rama, the father.
[Sniffs]
[Crying]
[Cooing, laughing]
[Laughing continues]
Ten times, the rains
had come and gone,
and I often stopped by to see how
Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.
He was a favourite with all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.
[Imitates howling]
[Howling]
- [Grunts]
- [Panting]
[Laughing]
[Whimpering]
No man cub was ever happier.
And yet, I knew that someday
he would have to go back
to his own kind.
[Wolf howling]
Then one night, the wolf pack
elders met at Council Rock
because Shere Khan, the tiger,
had returned
to their part of the jungle.
This meeting was to change
the man cub's entire future.
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him.
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.
Rama.
Uh, come over here, please.
Yes, Akela?
The council has reached its decision.
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.
He must leave at once.
"Leave"?
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.
But... But the man cub is...
Well, he's like my own son.
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger.
[Rama] But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.
Akela, perhaps
I can be of help.
You, Bagheera? How?
I know of a man-village where he'll be safe.
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together.
I'm sure he'll go with me.
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.
Good luck.
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we start back home?
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle...
...and he has sworn to kill you.
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?
He hates man.
Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man, just another hunter with a gun.
Aw, we'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that.
Nonsense. No one explains anything to Shere Khan.
Well, maybe so, but I'm not afraid.
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.
We'll spend the night here.
Things will look better in the morning.
Man Cub?
Man Cub!
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.
Uh... I don't wanna go back to the man-village.
Go on. Up you go.
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.
[Laughing] Is that all the better you can climb?
[Grunting] It's too big around.
And besides, I don't have any claws.
[Grunting]
- Yeow-ohhh!
- [Snarling]
[Groaning]
Now get some sleep.
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.
I wanna stay in the jungle.
Huh? [chuckles]
You wouldn't last one day.
[Yawns]
I'm not afraid.
I... I can look out for myself.
[Smacking lips]
S-S-S-Say, now.
What have we here?
[Giggles] It's a man cub.
A delic-i-ous man cub.
Oh, go away and leave me alone.
[Yawns] Oh, that's just what
I should do, but I'm not.
Oh, now, please go to sleep, Man Cub.
Yes-s-s-s, Man Cub.
# Pleas-s-se go to sleep
# Please go to sleep
# S-S-Sleep, little man cub
# Rest in peace #
Sleep.
- S-S-S-Sleep.
- [Moaning]
Ba-Ba-Bagheera...
[gulps]
Oh, now... now, look, there's no use arguing anymore.
Now, no more talk till morning.
[Chuckles] He won't be here in the morning.
Huh? Oh, yes, he will. I...
Kaa! Hold it, Kaa!
[Grunts]
Ohhh!
My sinus-s-s-s-s.
You have just made a s-s-s-serious mistake, my friend, a very s-s-s-stupid...
[stammers] Now, Kaa, I was...
[Kaa]... mistake.
Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.
No, please, Kaa...
Both eyes, if you please.
You have just s-s-s-sealed your doom.
Ohhh... Aaah!
Aaah! Ooh.
Look, Bagheera.
Look. Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.
[Groaning] Wha...?
Just you wait till I get you in my coils.
Uhhh!
[Mowgli laughing] Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!
"He's got a knot in his tail."
[Grunting]
[Moaning] This is going to slow down my s-s-s-slithering.
[Laughing]
- [Laughing stops]
- [Nervous chuckle]
So, you can look out for yourself, can you?
So, you want to stay in the jungle, do you?
Yes, I wanna stay in the jungle.
Ohhh! Now, now, for the last time, go to sleep.
[Muttering] Man cub. Huh!
Man cub. Ahhh.
[Yawns]
[Snoring]
[Rumbling]
# Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up
Two, three, four
- # Hup, two, three, four
- [snoring]
# Keep it up two, three, four
- [yawns]
- # Hup, two, three, four
A parade!
Oh, no.
The dawn patrol again. [sighs]
Company... sound off!
# Oh, the aim of our patrol
# Is a question rather droll
# For to march and drill
over field and hill
[trumpeting]
# Is a military goal
# Is a military goal
# Hup, two, three, four
# Dress it up, two, three, four
# By the ranks or single file
# Over every jungle mile
# Oh, we stamp and crush
through the underbrush
[squeaky trumpeting]
# In the military style
[all] # In the military style
Hello. What are you doing?
Shh! Drilling.
- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.
[Leader] To the rear... march!
The other way. Turn around.
[Leader] # Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up, two, three, four #
To the rear...
...ho!
Company... halt!
That means "stop."
Company... left face!
March, march, march.
My feet are killing me.
I'm puttin' in for a transfer to another herd.
Silence in the ranks!
- Dress up that line.
- Oooh!
[Clearing throat]
Uh, pull it in, Winifred.
Inspection...
...arms!
[Whispering] Stick your nose out.
- [Whispering] Like this?
- That's right.
[Clicking tongue] A dusty muzzle.
Soldier, remember: In battle, that trunk can save your life.
Take good care of it, my man.
- Yes, sir.
- Very good. Carry on.
- [Clears throat]
- [Munching]
Let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets.
Yes, sir.
Esprit de corps.
That's the way I earned my commission in the Maharajah's
Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.
Back in '88, it was...
Or... Or was it?
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.
It was then I received the Victoria Cross, for bravery above and beyond the call of duty.
Ha ha!
Those were the days.
Discipline! Discipline was the thing.
Builds character and that sort of thing, you know.
Eh... Uh... Oh.
Uh, where was I?
Oh, yes. Inspection. [clears throat]
Well, very good.
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.
[Fly buzzing]
[Clears throat] Eyes front.
[Clicks tongue] Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation.
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think?
There. That's better.
And as for you...
Oh, there you are.
[Chuckles]
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son?
OK, Pop.
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.
Well, a new recruit, eh?
[Laughs]
- I say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!
- Stop that!
- [Gasps, sputtering]
A man cub! Ohh, this is treason!
Sabotage!
I'll have no man cub in my jungle!
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it! Hold it!
I can explain, Hathi.
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.
Good.
And remember, an elephant never forgets.
[Muttering] I don't know what the army's coming to these days.
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?
[Clears throat] Let's get on with it!
Right face!
Forward... march!
Dear, haven't you forgotten something?
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.
An elephant never forgets.
Well, you just forgot our son.
Uh, our s... Son? Son!
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Quite right.
To the rear... march!
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...
- Pop! Look out!
- [Groaning]
- [Thudding]
- [Groaning]
Ohhh! Oww!
Ohhh! Owww! Oooh!
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."
[Giggling]
He said an elephant never forgets.
- [Laughing stops]
- It's not funny.
Let's get out of here quick before anything else happens.
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?
You're going back to the man-village right now.
I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.
You're going, if I have to drag you every step of the way.
[Grunting] Let go, you...
You let go of me! [grunting]
[Splash]
[Sputtering]
Ohh!
Oh, that does it.
I've had it, Man Cub.
From now on, you're on your own...
...alone!
Don't worry about me.
[Sighs] Foolish man cub.
[Rustling]
[Munching, slurps]
# Doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee-dee-doo
# Well, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
# Yes, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
# I mean, a-doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee, doo-bee
# Doo-bee-dee-doo
# And with... #
Well, now. Ha ha.
What have we here?
[Sniffs]
Hmm. Hey!
What a funny little bit of a...
- Ooh!
- Go away!
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods.
Ooh, what have I run on?
- What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone.
Well, now, that's pretty big talk, little britches.
I'm big enough.
- [Chuckles]
- [Grunting]
[Clicks tongue] Pitiful.
Hey, kid, you need help and ol' Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear.
Come on. I'm gonna show ya.
[Growls]
Ha ha! Yeah!
All right, now, kid, loosen up.
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.
That's it. Now give me a big bear growl.
- Scare me.
- [Tiny growl]
[Clicks tongue]
Oh, boy.
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.
[Loud roar]
[Roaring continues]
He's in trouble.
I shouldn't have left him alone.
[Growls]
- [Loud roar]
- [Roaring]
- A big one, right from your toes.
- How's that?
[Mowgli continues roaring]
[Baloo laughs] You're gettin' it, kid.
Oh, no! It's Baloo!
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.
Weave about now.
Look for an opening.
Keep movin'. Keep... [laughs]
You're gettin' it, kid.
Come on! That's it! [laughing]
He's a dandy!
[Chuckles] Fine teacher you are,
Ol' Iron Paws.
Oh! Thanks, Bagheera.
Tell me, tell me, after you knock your pupil senseless, how do you expect him to remember the lesson, hmm?
Well, I... I, uh...
Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard.
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.
I'm a lot tougher than some people think.
You better believe it.
Now, let's go once more.
I want you to keep circlin', or
I'm gonna knock your roof in again.
You'd better keep movin'... Ooh!
Hey! Right on the button.
[Groans]
[Laughs] No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
[Laughs] No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
[Laughing]
No. No, n-now, we don't do that here in the jun... No!
No, you're ticklin'.
I can't stand that ticklin'.
[Laughing] Help! Bagheera!
Oh, boy. That's all he needs, more confidence.
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya!
Ha ha! Oooh! I give...
Hey! Ha ha!
You know somethin'?
You're all right, kid.
What do they call you?
Mowgli, and he's going back to the man-village right now.
Man-village? They'll ruin 'im!
They'll make a man out of him.
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.
Certainly, you do.
Oh? And just how do you think he will survive?
"How do you think..."
What do you mean, how do you think he...
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.
Oh? That shouldn't take too long.
Look, now, it's like this, little britches.
All you gotta do is...
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# Are Mother Nature's recipes
# That bring
the bare necessities of life
- # Wherever I wander
- Ooof!
# Wherever I roam
# I couldn't be fonder
# Of my big home
# The bees are buzzin' in the tree
# To make some honey just for me
# When you look under
the rocks and plants
# And take a glance
at the fancy ants
# Then maybe try a few
You eat ants?
Ha ha! You better believe it.
And you're gonna love the way they tickle.
- [Gasps] Mowgli, look out!
- [Thud]
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
But when?
# They'll come to you
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear can rest at ease
# With just the bare necessities of life
# Now, when you pick a pawpaw
- # Or a prickly pear
- Oww!
# And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time beware
# Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw
# When you pick a pear
try to use the claw
# But you don't need
to use the claw
# When you pick a pear
of the big pawpaw
# Have I given you a clue?
Golly, thanks, Baloo.
"Pawpaw." Ha!
Of all the silly gibberish.
Come on, Baggy, get with the beat.
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
- They'll come to me!
- # They'll come to you
How 'bout scratchin' that left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?
No. Just a hair lower.
There. Right there. That's it. Ohh!
This is beautiful. Oooh, that's good.
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin'.
[Laughing] You're lots of fun, Baloo.
[Moaning] Right on it.
Yeah!
That's delicious.
Ohhh! Oooh!
Just a little bit... Mmm.
Yeah! Ha ha!
Oooh!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Ha ha! Oooh!
Yeah!
Oh, man. This is really livin'.
So just try and relax. Yeah.
Cool it.
Fall apart in my backyard.
'Cause let me tell you somethin', little britches...
- [buzzing]
- If you act like that bee...
Uh-uh. You're workin' too hard.
And don't spend your time...
...lookin' around...
...for something you want...
...that can't be found.
# When you find out
you can live without it
# And go along not thinkin' about it
# I'll tell you somethin' true
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
[sighs] I give up.
Well, I hope his luck holds out.
Mowgli, how about you singin'?
[Together]
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
- Yeah, man!
- # I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear
can rest at ease
# With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah!
# With just the bare necessities of life
- # Yeah, man #
- Ha ha ha!
Beautiful. That's real jungle harmony.
I like being a bear.
That's my boy.
You're gonna make one swell bear.
Why, you even sing like one.
Yeah.
[Yawns]
# Doo-bee-doo
# Doo-bee-doo
# Aye-bee doogie-woogie doo
[fly buzzing]
Hey, Mowgli, how about you flickin' that ol' mean fly off of your papa bear's nose?
Ouch!
[Chuckles] Boy, when you flick a fly, you really...
Why, you flat-nosed, little-eyed, flaky creep!
Hey! Let go of me!
[Monkeys laughing]
Take your flea-pickin' hands off of my cub!
Come on and get 'im, champ!
- He ain't no champ! He's a chump!
- Baloo!
Yeah! Ha ha! A big hothead!
OK, you guys asked for it. I'll...
- Oooh!
- That'll cool 'im off! [laughing]
Gimme back my man cub!
Here he is! Come and get 'im!
[Monkeys chattering, hooting]
That's how a bear can rest at ease!
Here's some bare necessities!
Now, just try that again, you...
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity!
You turn him loose, or I'll jerk a knot in your tail!
We give up!
- Here he comes!
- Whoa-ohh-ohh!
- Baloo! Catch me!
- [Monkeys laughing]
- Baloo!
- Back up! Back up! Faster! Faster!
Faster!
- [Giggling]
- A rolling bear gathers no hair!
Baloo, help me!
Baloo! They're carrying me away!
Bagheera!
[Echoing] Bagheera!
Well, it's happened.
Took a little longer than I thought, but it's happened.
[Grunting]
- Bagheera!
- [Snarls]
[Echoing] Bagheera!
Oh, you heard me, huh?
Mowgli. Mowgli!
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?
They ambushed me.
Thousands of 'em.
I jabbed with my left, then I swung with a right...
Oh, for the last time, what happened to Mowgli?
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys carried him off!
The ancient ruins.
Ohh, I hate to think what will happen when he meets that king of theirs.
- [Monkeys chattering]

[Laughing] So, you're the man cub.
Crazy!
I'm not as crazy as you are.
Put me down!
Ooof!
You cut that out!
Cool it, boy. Unwind yourself.
# Doo-doo doo-doo-doo, dee
Doo-doo dee-doo-doo-doo-dee
Now, come on.
Let's shake... cousin.
What do you want me for?
Word has grabbed my royal ear...
Have a banana.
...that you wanna stay in the jungle.
"Stay in the jungle"? I sure do.
Good. And ol' King Louie...
# Bah-be-do-bay
Bu-bu-doo
That's me.
...can fix it for you.
Have two bananas.
Have we got a deal?
Yes, sir, I'll do... [gulps]
I'll do anything to stay in the jungle.
Well, then,
I'll lay it on the line for you.

[Whistling tune]
[# Singing in gibberish]
[Applause, cheering]
[Giggling]
Gee, Cousin Louie, you're doin' real good.
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz.
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire.
But I don't know how to make fire.
# Now, don't try to kid me, Man Cub
# I made a deal with you
# What I desire is man's red fire
# To make my dream come true
# Now give me the secret, Man Cub
# Come on
Clue me what to do
# Give me the power
of man's red flower
- # So I can be like you
- [trumpeting]
Fire? So that's what that scoundrel's after.
I'll tear 'im limb from limb.
I'll beat 'im. I'll... I'll...
Mmm. Yeah!
Well, man, what a beat.
Will you stop that silly beat business and listen?
This will take brains, not brawn.
You better believe it, and I'm loaded with both.
- Will you listen?
- Oh! Yeah, yeah.
Now, while you create a disturbance,
I'll rescue Mowgli.
- Got that?
- I'm gone, man.
- Solid gone!
- Not yet, Baloo!

Man!
- It's Baloo, the bear!
- Yeah, that's him!
How'd that square get in there?
Baloo! It's you!
[Roars]
[Laughing hysterically]
[Hooting, chattering]
[Shrieks]
Whew!
[Laughs]
Man, that's what I call a swingin' party!
And furthermore, Baloo,
Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble, and your influence hasn't been exactly...
Shh! Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.
- [Bagheera groans]
- Well, he's had a big day.
It was a real sockeroo.
You know, it ain't easy learnin' to be like me.
Hah! A disgraceful performance.
Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes?
[Scoffs] I hope Mowgli learned something from that experience.
[Sighs]
# Scooby-dooby-dooby
Dooby-doo #
Ha ha!
That's my boy.
Oh, nonsense.
[Bagheera] Baloo.
Over here. I'd like to have a word with you.
"A word"?
You gonna talk some more?
[Yawns]
All right, what's up, Bagheera?
Baloo, the man cub must go back to the man-village.
The jungle is not the place for him.
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.
Yes, just look at yourself.
Look at that eye.
Yeah.
It's beautiful, ain't it?
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.
Well, you don't look exactly like a basket of fruit yourself.
Ohhh! [clears throat]
Uh, Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.
Why not?
How can I put it?
Baloo, birds of a feather should flock together.
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?
I don't know.
[Laughs] Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me.
Oh, Baloo, you've got to be serious about this.
Oh, stop worryin', Baggy.
Stop worryin'.
I'll take care of him.
Yes, like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.
And another thing, sooner or later
Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.
The tiger? What's he got against the kid?
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire.
But little Mowgli don't have those things.
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless.
Just one swipe and...
Ohh!
Well... Well, what are we gonna do?
We'll do what's best for the boy.
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.
Good. Then make Mowgli go to the man-village.
Are you out of your mind?
I promised him he could stay here in the jungle with me.
That's just the point.
As long as he remains with you, he's in danger.
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?
[Stammers] Because he won't listen to me.
I love that kid. [sniffles]
I love him like he was my own cub.
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself.
Uh, well, can't...
Can't I wait until morning?
It's morning now.
Go on, Baloo.
[Sighs]
Uh...
[sighs]
[Gasps]
Oh, boy.
Mowgli. Mowgli.
Uh, it's time to get up.
[Yawns] Oh. Hi, Baloo.
Hi.
Hey, rub that ol' sleep outta your eyes.
You and me, we got a long walk ahead of us.
Swell. Gee, we'll have lots of fun together.
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, all right, let's hit the trail, kid.
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.
Me and Baloo, we've got things to do.
Goodbye, Man Cub...
...and good luck.
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is...
# Look for the bare necessities
# Some good ol' bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear
can rest at ease
# With just the bare
necessities of life
Yeah!
# I'll live here in the jungle
all my life #
Yeah, man! I like being a bear.
Where we goin', Baloo?
Well, uh, it's, uh... Um...
Well, it's sorta new and, uh...
Oh, I don't care, as long as I'm with you.
Mowgli, uh, look, buddy, uh, there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.
Tell me what, Baloo?
Oh, gee whiz.
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
It's, uh...
Uh, uh, Mowgli... [chuckles]
You wouldn't marry a panther, would ya?
[Laughing] Gee, I don't even know what you're talking about.
[Growls]
Mowgli, don't you realize that you're a human?
I'm not anymore, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!
- Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.
- [Growling]
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin' all morning to tell ya,
I've got to take you back to the man-village.
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!
That's goin' too far!
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?
Wait a minute! Stop!
Wait!
Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli. Mowgli!
Now what's happened?
Well, y-you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera, but look, now, I used the same words you did, and he ran out on me!
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's separate. We've got to find him!
Oh, if anything happens to that little guy, I'll never forgive myself.
I gotta find him.
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
[Elephants trumpet]
# Hup, two, three, four
# Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up, two, three, four
What beastly luck.
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.
Company... sound off!
# Oh, we march from here to there
# And it doesn't matter where
# You can hear us push
through the deepest bush
# Hup, two, three, four
[Hathi] # With a military air
[all] # With a military air
[trumpeting]
The jungle patrol!
# We're a crackerjack brigade
# On a pachyderm parade
# But we'd rather stroll
to a water hole
# Hup, two, three, four
[all] # For a furlough in the shade #
Stop!
Wait a minute. Halt!
- Ohh! Ohh!
- [Thudding]
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.
Well, speak up. Who was it?
Oh, it was me, Colonel.
What do you mean, sir, taking over my command? Highly irregular, you know.
Oh, Colonel, I'm sorry, but I need your help.
[Hathi] Oh, absolutely impossible.
We're on a cross-country march.
[Bagheera] But it's an emergency,
Colonel.
- The man cub must be found.
- [Hathi] Man cub? What man cub?
How interesting.
The one I was taking to the man-village.
Good. That's where he belongs.
Now, sir, if you don't mind, we'd like to get on with the march.
[Bagheera] No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.
He is lost. He ran away.
How delightful.
Well, it serves the young whippersnapper right.
But... But Shere Khan, the tiger, is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.
[Chuckles]
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.
Shere Khan isn't within miles of here.
[Chuckling]
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war and all that sort of thing, you know.
This has gone far enough.
Far enough!
Now, just a minute, you pompous old windbag!
Winifred! What are you doing out of ranks?
Never mind.
How would you like to have our boy lost and alone in the jungle?
[Hathi] Our son... alone?
But, Winifred, old girl, that's an entirely different matter.
- [Scoffs]
- Different, entirely.
That little boy is no different than our own son.
Now you help find him or I'm taking over command.
What? A female leading my herd?
Utterly preposterous.
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.
Please, Pop, sir? Please?
Now, don't you worry, son.
Your father had a plan in mind all the time.
[Scoffs] Sure you did.
[Sputtering] Troopers!
Company... left face!
Volunteers for a special mission will step one pace forward.
Ha ha! That's what I like to see.
Devotion to duty.
Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub.
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.
Yes. Yes.
Uh, Bugler, when the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet three times.
Yes, sir.
- [Trumpeting]
- [Hathi] Shh!
Not now, soldier.
[Nasal] Sorry, sir.
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be the element of surprise.
[Whispering] You will take one squad and cover the right flank.
[Lieutenant] Yes, sir.
[Whispering] And I shall meet the other squad on the left flank.
Very well.
[Shouting] Company...
[shout echoing]
...forward... march!
Element of surprise?
Oh, I say.
[Chuckling]
And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub.
Kaa! It's you!
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.
So nice to see you again.
[Giggling, hissing]
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.
Let me look at you.
You don't want me to look at you?
Then you look at me.
No, sir. I know what you're trying to do, Kaa.
You do?
Uh, I mean, you don't trust me.
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.
You want to help me?
[Hisses] Certainly.
I can see to it...
...that you never have to leave this jungle.
How could you do that?
Hmm?
Oh, I have my own...
...s- s-subtle little ways. [chuckles]
But first, you must trust me.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
I don't blame you.
I'm not like those so-called fair-weather friends of yours.
You can believe in me.
# Trust in me
# Just in me
# Shut your eyes
# And trust in me
Hold still, please.
# You can sleep
# Safe and sound
# Knowing I
# Am around
# Slip into silent slumber
# Sail on a silver mist
# Slowly and surely
# Your senses will cease to resist
[snoring]
You're snoring.
Sorry.
# Trust in me
# And just in me
# Shut your eyes
# And trust in me #
- [doorbell rings]
- Huh?
Oh, now what?
I'll be right down.
Yes? Yes? Who is it?
It's me, Shere Khan.
Uh, I'd like a word with you, if you don't mind.
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.
Oh, no, no. Nothing at all.
I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils.
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.
I was just curling up for my siesta.
But you were singing to someone.
- Who is it, Kaa?
- [Gulps] Uh, who?
[Coughs] Oh, no.
- I was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.
Yes. Yes, you see,
I have trouble with my s-s-sinuses.
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.
I can't s-s-sleep, so I sing myself to sleep.
You know, self-hypnosis?
Let me show you how it works.
# Trust in me
- [muffled coughs]
- I can't be bothered with that.
I have no time for that sort of nonsense.
- [Hisses] Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.
But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.
"Man cub"? What man cub?
The one who's lost.
Now, where do you suppose he could be?
Search me.
That's an excellent idea. [chuckling]
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?
Uh, [hisses] certainly not.
Nothing here, and nothing in here.
[Snoring]
[Snorting]
My sinuses.
Hmm. Indeed.
And now, how about the middle?
The middle?
Oh, the middle.
[Laughing] Absolutely nothing in the middle.
Hmm.
Really?
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub, you will inform me first.
- Understand?
- [Gulps] I get the point.
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.
And I must continue my search for the helpless little lad.
Ooh, who does he think he's fooling?
"Helpless little lad."
Ooh, he gives me the s-s-shivers.
Picking on that poor little helpless boy. [sighs]
Oh, yes.
The poor little helpless boy.
Aaah!
[Grunts, groans]
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.
It's like you said.
You can't trust anyone.
If I never see that skinny little shrimp again, it will be too soon.
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.
[Thunder rumbling]
[Yawns]
Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
I've got it! Let's flap over to the east side of the jungle.
They've always got a bit of action, a bit of a swingin' scene.
Aw, come off it!
Things are right dead all over.
You mean you wish they were.
[Laughing]
[All laughing]
Very funny.
OK, so what we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!
OK. What do you want to do?
Oh, blimey. There you go again.
The same notes again.
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?
Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's coming our way.
Hey, what in the world is that?
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.
Yeah, and they're all walking about by themselves.
[All laughing]
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start that again.
Come on, lads. Come on.
Let's have some fun with this little fella, this little bloke, eh?
Blimey! He's got legs like a stork, he has.
Like a stork. Ha ha!
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.
[Laughter]
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.
[Thunder rumbling]
What's wrong with him?
I think we overdid it.
We were just having a bit of fun, that's all.
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.
You know, he must be down on his luck.
Yeah, or he wouldn't be in our neighbourhood.
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!
Just leave me alone.
Oh, come on. What's wrong?
You look like you haven't got a friend in the world.
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?
No. Nobody wants me around.
Yeah. We know how you feel.
Nobody wants us around either.
Oh, we may look a bit shabby, but we've got hearts.
And feelings too.
And just to prove it to you, we're going to let you join our little group.
Kid, we'd like to make you an honorary vulture.
Thanks, but I...
I'd rather be on my own alone.
Oh, now, look, kid.
Everybody's got to have friends.
Hey, fellas, are we his friends?
# We're your friends
[harmonizing]
# We're your friends
# We're your friends
to the bitter end
# The bitter end
# When you're alone
# When you're alone
# Who comes around
# Who comes around
# To pluck you up
- Give us a smile.
- # To pluck you up
# When you are down
# When you are down
# And when you're outside looking in
# Who's there to open the door?
- Come on, kid. We need a tenor.
- # That's
# What
# Friends are for
# Who's always eager to extend
# A friendly claw
# That's what friends are for
# And when you're lost
# In dire need
# Who's at your side
# At lightning speed
# We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike
# In fact, we've never met
an animal we didn't like
Ha ha! You take it, kid.
# Didn't like
- # So, you can see we're friends
- # Friends in need
# We're friends in need
and friends indeed
# Friends indeed
- # Oh, friends indeed
- Whoops! Ooh!
- Easy, lads. Steady. Watch it!
- # We'll keep you safe in the jungle
# Forevermore
# That's what friends
# Are for #
Bravo. Bravo.
An extraordinary performance.
And thank you for detaining my victim.
Uh, don't mention it, Your Highness.
[Chuckling]
- Boo!
- [Sputtering, yelling]
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room! Gangway!
- [Thunder crashing]
- Run, friend! Run!
"Run"? Why should I run?
Why should you run?
Could it be possible that you don't know who I am?
I know you, all right.
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.
Then you should also know that everyone runs from Shere Khan.
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.
Ah! You have spirit for one so small, and such spirit is deserving of a sporting chance.
Now, I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten.
It makes the chase more interesting... for me.
One...
...two, three...
...four...
You're trying my patience.
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- [Thunder crashing]
- [Growling]
Run, Mowgli, run!
- Let go, you big oaf!
- Ooh!
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Whoa!
- [Growling]
- Yeow! Whoa, slow! Easy, now!
- [Growling]
- [Stammering] Whoa! Easy!
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.
And he better hang on too.
- Yeow!
- Take that, you big bully.
Let him have it again, kid!
Hit him again, kid! Go on!
- Baloo! Help me!
- [Shere Khan roaring]
Ooh!
Woo-woo-wooo-wooo!
- [Thunder crashing]
- [Growling]
Somebody do something with that kid!
Come on, lads!
He's safe now! Ha ha ha!
You can let go, Baloo.
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.
[Snarling]
- Ooof!
- [Thud]
- I'll kill you for this. [growling]
- [Thunder crashing]
Let go! Baloo needs help!
Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.
Oof!
[All] Charge!
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did!
[Vultures laughing]
- Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers!
- [Laughter]
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!
Look behind you, chum.
[Roaring]
[Snarling, roaring]
[Thunderclap]
- Well, that's the last of him.
- [Laughter]
[Laughter continues]
Old Stripes took off like a flaming comet, he did.
Well, come on. Let's go congratulate our friend.
Hold it, fellas.
Now is not the time for it. Look.
Baloo?
Baloo, get up.
Oh, please, get up.
[Sniffs] Oh.
Mowgli, try to understand.
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?
You've got to be brave, like Baloo was.
You... You don't mean...
Oh, no. Baloo.
[Sniffles]
Now, now. I know how you feel.
But you must remember, Mowgli,
"Greater love hath no one than he who lays down his life for his friend."
When great deeds are remembered in this jungle, one name will stand above all others:
Our friend, Baloo the bear.
[Sniffling] He's crackin' me up.
The memory of Baloo's sacrifice and bravery will forever be engraved on our saddened hearts.
Beautiful.
This spot where Baloo fell will always be a hallowed place in the jungle, for there lies one of nature's noblest creatures.
[Sniffling]
I wish my mother could have heard this.
It's best we leave now.
Come along, Man Cub.
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!
There's more. Lots more!
Why, you big fraud!
[Stammers] You four-flusher!
I'm-I'm fed up! [sputtering]
- Baloo, you're all right!
- [Chuckles]
Who, me? Sure I am.
Never felt... better.
[Laughter]
- You sure had us worried.
- Aw, I was just takin' five.
You know, playin' it cool.
- [Chuckling] But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.
It's going to be a bit dull without the little bloke, isn't it?
Yeah. So what we gonna do?
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.
You should have seen how I made a sucker out of Old Stripes with that left up in his face.
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him. "Wham!"
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.
- [Laughs] You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.
Nothing or nobody is ever gonna come between us again.
[Girl] # My own home
# My own home
# My own home
# My own home
- Look! What's that?
- [humming]
- Oh, it's the man-village.
- No, no. I mean that.
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.
So you've seen one. So let's go.
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Oh, Baloo.
Let him have a better look.
[Humming continues]
# Father's hunting in the forest
# Mother's cooking in the home
# I must go to fetch the water
# Till the day that I am grown
# Till I'm grown
# Till I'm grown
# I must go to fetch the water
# Till the day that I am grown
[giggles]
# Then I will have a handsome husband
# And a daughter of my own
# And I'll send her to fetch the water
# I'll be cooking in the home
[humming]
# Then I'll send her to fetch the water
# I'll be cooking in my home #
Oh!
- She did that on purpose!
- Obviously.
[Humming]
Mowgli, come back. Come back.
Go on. Go on.
He's hooked.
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.
The boy couldn't help himself.
It was bound to happen.
Mowgli is where he belongs now.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
But I still think he'd have made one swell bear.
Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.
Let's get back to where we belong.
And get with the beat.
- # Look for the bare necessities
- [grunts]
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife

of life #
My story begins in London.
Not so very long ago.
And yet so much has happened since then,
that it seems more like an eternity.
At that time, I lived with my pet
in a bachelor flat just off Regent's Park.
It was a beautiful spring day,
a tedious time of the year for bachelors.
Oh. That's my pet, Roger.
Roger Radcliffe, a musician of sorts.
No. No, I'm the one with the spots.
My name's Pongo.
And you know, as far as I could see,
the old notion that a bachelor's life was so glamorous
and carefree was all nonsense.
It was downright dull.
It was plain to see that my old pet needed someone.
But if it were left up to Roger, we'd be bachelors forever.
He was married to his work. Writing songs.
Songs about romance, of all things,
something he knew absolutely nothing about.
Oh, he's intelligent enough, as humans go.
And I think you could say that Roger is a rather handsome animal in his way.
I could see no reason why my pet didn't deserve an attractive mate.
At least, I was determined to do my best.
Of course, dogs are a pretty poor judge of human beauty.
But I had a rough idea of what to look for.
Hmm. Unusual breed.
Very unusual.
Oh, surely not.
Well, now, what have we here?
Hmm.
Well, a little too short-coupled.
Nope.
I say... Oh, well I do say!
Now, there's a fancy breed.
Hmm... Perhaps a little too fancy.
Yes. That's much too fancy.
Too old.
Too young.
It was a problem. A real problem.
Well, now that's a bit more like it!
The most beautiful creature on four legs.
Oh, now, if only the girl...
Well! She's very lovely, too.
It was almost too good to be true.
I'd never find another pair like that, not if I looked for 100 years.
Ah, they're heading for the park.
A perfect meeting place, if I could only arrange it.
Uh-oh. But Roger never stopped work till after 5:00.
That would be too late.
After 5:00 already.
Fancy that.
All right, Pongo. All right, boy.
Pongo, boy, take it easy!
What's all the hurry?
Pongo, boy, slow down.
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.
Then suddenly, I spotted them.
It was a perfect situation if I planned it right.
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.
He'd settle on the grass, puff his pipe and that would be it.
No, it was all up to me.
Well...
At first I had no particular plan,
just anything to attract attention.
You know, stir things up a bit.
Pongo, you silly old thing! Come on.
Come on, let's have it, boy.
Pongo!
Pongo!
For a while, it seemed to work.
At least they had seen one another.
Things were going along first-rate.
But for some strange reason they left!
Come on, you old renegade.
We're going home.
But I wasn't giving up.
I was determined that, somehow, they just had to meet.
- Oh!
- Oh!
I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry. Please excuse me.
- I must say, what on earth!
- Oh, dear!
Oh, really. Good heavens. Of all the...
- Oh!
- Ah!
Oh, my new spring suit and my new hat!
I'm terribly sorry.
Please let me help you.
I'm so sorry. Pongo, you...
I don't know what's come over him.
I'm terribly sorry. He's never acted this way before.
Never mind. Never mind.
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.
Please? Oh.
Oh, I say. Here, take mine.
Oh.
Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
For the first six months or so,
we lived in a small house near the park,
a modest little place,
but just right for two couples who were just starting out.
Perdita, darling, are you all right?
Oh, of course, dear.
After all, dogs were having puppies long before our time.
Oh, that's Nanny, a wonderful cook and housekeeper.
She's such a kind, understanding soul.
You know,
at times she seems almost canine.
Roger, dear, tea time.
Tea time!
Be down in a minute
Do you like my new song?
- Such clever lyrics.
- Melody first, my dear.
And then the lyrics, hmm?
Oh, Pongo, it's her.
It's that devil woman.
Oh, must be Cruella, your dearly devoted old school mate.
Cruella De Vil.
That's it!
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Oh, Roger.
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Oh!
Cruella
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Roger, she'll hear you.
Look out for Cruella De Vil
Let her in, Nanny.
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?
Miserable as usual.
Perfectly wretched!
Where are they? Where are they?
For heaven sakes, where are they?
- Who, Cruella?
- The puppies! The puppies.
No time for games. Where are the little brutes?
It'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.
Anita, you're such a wit.
Here, dog, here.
Here, dog.
Cruella, isn't that a new fur coat?
My only true love, darling.
I live for furs. I worship furs!
After all, is there a woman in this wretched world who doesn't?
Oh, I'd like a nice fur, but there are many other things...
Sweet, simple Anita.
I know, I know!
This horrid little house is your dream castle.
And poor Roger is your bold and fearless Sir Galahad!
Oh, Cruella.
Then of course you have your little spotted friends.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I must say, such perfectly beautiful coats.
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.
Let me know when the puppies arrive.
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruella.
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks. Cheerio.
Cheerio, darling.
Oh!
At first you think
Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realise
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
You're no help.
This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella
Cruella De Vil
Roger, you are an idiot!
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.
Don't worry, Perdy.
They're on to her.
Nothing's going to happen to our puppies.
What does she want with them?
She can't possibly love them.
Oh, Pongo.
I was so happy at first, but now I...
Oh, I...
I wish we weren't having any.
Poor Perdita. Of course, she had no choice.
The puppies arrived right on schedule,
one wild and stormy night in October.
Steady, boy.
The puppies are here!
Oh, the puppies are here!
How many?
- Eight.
- Eight?
By George, Pongo! Eight puppies.
Ten.
- Eleven.
- Eleven.
Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo, boy.
Wait a minute now, wait a minute, 13!
No, no, no. Fourteen.
- Oh, 15!
- Fifteen?
And the mother's doing fine, love.
You ducky thing, you.
Fifteen puppies?
Why, Pongo, that's marvellous!
It's fabulous!
Why, you old rascal!
Fourteen.
Just 14.
We lost one.
Oh, poor little thing.
Oh, Pongo, boy.
It's just one of those things.
And yet...
And yet I wonder.
Look, Pongo.
Anita!
Nanny. Fifteen!
We still have 15!
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.
See? He's just as good as new.
Can you imagine, Roger, 15 puppies!
Fifteen. Fifteen puppies!
How marvellous.
How marvellous, how perfectly... Ugh!
The devil take it. They're mongrels, no spots!
No spots at all. What a horrid little white rat.
They're not mongrels!
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.
That's right. They'll have their spots in a few weeks.
Oh, well, in that case I'll take them all. The whole litter.
Just name your price, dear.
I'm afraid we can't give them up.
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.
You can't afford to keep them.
You can scarcely afford to feed yourselves.
I'm sure we'll get along.
Yes, I know. I know!
Roger's... Roger's songs!
Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay you twice what they're worth.
Come now, I'm being more than generous.
Blast this pen.
Blast this wretched, wretched pen! Ah!
When can the puppies leave their mother?
Two weeks? Three weeks?
Never.
- What?
- We're not selling the puppies.
Not a single one.
Do you understand?
Anita, is he serious?
I really don't know Roger.
- Cruella, he seems...
- Surely he must be joking!
No, no, no. I mean it.
You're, you're not getting one. Not one.
And that's final.
Why, you horrid man!
You... You...
All right, keep the little beasts for all I care.
Do as you like with them.
Drown them!
But I warn you, Anita, We're through.
I'm through with all of you!
I'll get even. Just wait.
You'll be sorry, you fools!
You idiots!
Oh, Roger! You were magnificent, darling.
He was a bloomin' hero, ma'am!
Indeed he was. A bloomin' hero!
Perdy? Perdy, darling?
We're keeping the puppies, every single one of them.
My ol' pet Roger, he told that devil woman off.
He told her off, Perdy. She's gone.
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
Go get him, Thunder.
After him, boy.
He'll get that dirty ol' horse thief.
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest dog in the whole world.
He's even better than Dad.
No dog's better than Dad.
What's he going to do, Dad?
Shh. Shh. Let's just wait and see.
Look at him run, the old coward.
That old dirty Dawson!
The yellow-livered old skunk!
I'd like to tear his gizzard out.
Why, Patch, where did you ever hear such talk?
Certainly not from your mother.
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.
He'll get that yellow-livered...
Well, he'll get him, all right.
Lucky, get down. We can't see. Get down.
Mother, make him get down.
Come on, Lucky. Down, dear.
Missed him. Missed him by a mile.
I'm hungry, mother. I'm hungry.
Now, Rolly, you've just had your dinner.
But I am, just the same.
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole elephant.
Shh!
There he is, behind that rock.
Oh, dear. He shot poor Thunder.
He missed him. Ol' Thunder's pretending, I think.
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.
Lucky, get down.
I'm hungry, Mother. I really am.
Don't miss next week's episode. Who will triumph?
Ol' Thunder always wins!
And speaking of champions, friends,
Kanine Krunchies is the champion of all dog biscuits.
Kanine Krunchies can't be beat
They make each meal a special treat
Happy dogs are those who eat nutritious Kanine Krunchies
Perdy, we better get these little nippers off to bed if we're going for a W-A-L-K.
- We want to go, too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?
We never get to go.
Come along, children. Bedtime.
But we're not a... bit sleepy.
We want to go for a walk in the park.
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13...
I'm not sleepy. I'm hungry.
Fourteen.
Hmm?
So do what all the smart dogs do
And you'll feel great the whole day through
You can be a champion, too if you eat Kanine Krunchies
Remember, friends, just send five...
Lucky, you little rascal, let's go.
There they go, Horace, me lad, out for their evening constitutional.
Oh. A lovely pair of turtledoves.
Around the Johnny Horner and off to the park.
Yeah, I don't like it, Jasper.
One more pinch and they'll throw the keys away.
Oh, come off it, Horace. We're getting plenty of boodle.
Yes, but I've been thinkin'.
You've been thinkin'?
I warned you about thinkin'.
I've got the knob for this job, so let's get on with it.
Ah, nobody home but the little ol' cook.
You just leave her to ol' Jasper.
He can handle her real diplomatic-like.
Yeah, but I still don't like it.
Here, here. Patch, you settle down.
Oh, dear.
Go to sleep now.
Close your little eyes.
That's a good little one.
Who do you suppose?
Good evening, ma'am.
We're here to inspect the wiring and the switches.
- We're from the gas company.
- Electric, electric.
Electric company.
But we didn't call for any inspection.
Yes, I know. See, there's a new act just been passed in Parliament.
Under the heading of the "Defence of the
Realm Act." Article four, section 29.
It's a law. And it's for your own safety, ma'am.
I don't care what Parliament
Realm or whatever it is says.
You're not coming in here, not with the Mister and Missus gone.
Oh, now. Come off it, Ducky.
We got no time to palaver.
We got a job to do. Excuse me!
What's the matter with you two?
You got cloth ears? I said you're not coming in here!
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho!
She's a regular little tartar, ain't she, Horace?
Don't you dare go up there, you big, long-legged lummox!
Now I mean it.
If you don't get out of this house,
I'll call the police, I will.
Now be off with you, you big weasel!
Now you've been gone and done it.
You've cut me to the quick, lady.
Why, I wouldn't stay here if you asked me.
Not even for a cup of tea.
Oy! Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky suspicion we're not welcome here.
Pack up. We're leaving.
Sharp's the word and quick's the action.
Let me out! Help!
I'll call the police. Help!
Goodnight, Ducky. Ta-ta!
Those good-for-nothing hoodlums!
Electric company. Hmph!
Nothing but common sneak thieves.
I'll bet they made off with the good silver.
Why, I'll bet they took every last...
The puppies!
The puppies! They're gone!
Patch? Lucky? Rolly?
Oh! They took the puppies!
Oh, whatever will I do?
Those scoundrels!
They stole the puppies.
Police? Help! The puppies.
Police! Somebody help me!
Help! Help! Help!
"Dognapping!" Tsk-tsk. Can you imagine such a thing?
"15 puppies stolen." They are darling little things.
Anita and her...
And her bashful Beethoven!
Pipe and all!
Oh, Roger, you are a fool!
Hello?
Jasper! Jasper, you idiot!
How dare you call here?
We don't want no more of this, we want our boodle!
We'll settle for half!
Not one shilling 'till the job's done.
- Jasper! Jasper!
- Do you understand?
It's in the blinkin' papers, pictures and all!
Hang the papers! It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
- I don't like it.
- Shut up, you idiot!
What?
Not you, miss. I mean Horace!
Why, you imbecile!
Maybe Scotland Yard.
Maybe they found something.
Hello, Inspector?
- Is Anita there?
- Who?
- Anita!
- It's for you.
- Hello?
- Anita, darling.
- Oh. Cruella.
- Oh, Anita.
What a dreadful thing.
I just saw the papers.
I couldn't believe it.
Yes, Cruella. It was quite a shock.
- Is she calling to confess?
- Roger, please!
She's a sly one.
We're doing everything possible.
- Have you called the police?
- Yes, Scotland Yard.
- But I'm afraid...
- Where are they?
You idiot!
- Anita!
- Sorry, Cruella.
Yes. If there's any news, we'll let you know.
Thank you, Cruella.
Roger, I admit she's eccentric, but she's not a thief.
She's still number one suspect in my book!
She's been investigated by Scotland Yard.
- What more do you want?
- I don't know, darling.
I don't know.
Oh, Rog. What'll we do?
What'll we do?
Perdy, I'm afraid it's all up to us.
Oh, Pongo. Isn't there any hope?
Well, yes. There's the twilight bark.
The twilight bark? That's only a gossip chain.
Darling, it's the very fastest way to send news.
If our puppies are anywhere in the city, the London dogs will know.
We'll send the word tonight when our pets take us for a walk in the park.
There's no one out tonight.
I'm afraid it's too cold.
We've got to keep trying, Perdy.
Perdy, we're in luck!
It's the Great Dane at Hampstead.
Pongo. Quiet, boy!
Do you want to stir up the whole neighbourhood? Come on. Pongo.
- Perdy, come on!
- Let's go.
Pongo, you old idiot!
Come on, now. We're going home!
What is it, Danny?
Who's on the telegraph?
It's Pongo, Regent's Park!
It's an all-dog alert.
What's it all about? What's the word?
Tell me, Danny! Tell me, tell me!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Well, now... Hmm, that is something.
What, Danny? What's something?
Fifteen Dalmatian puppies, stolen!
Have they called the police?
Scotland Yard?
The humans tried everything.
Now it's up to us dogs and the twilight bark.
I'll sound the alert!
Prissy, come in here!
Coco!
Be quiet now!
Ah, shut up!
Quiet!
Will you be quiet!
Towser, what's going on?
What is it? What's all the gossip?
'Tain't no gossip, Lucy. It be all the way from London.
- You don't say!
- Fifteen puppies stolen.
There's no puppies around here, not since Nellie's last litter.
And they're all grown up.
Well, then, we'd best send the word along.
It be up to me to reach the Colonel!
He be the only one in barking range.
You'll never reach him at this hour!
Well, I can try!
I'll bark all night if I have to.
Hmm...
Hmm... Sounds like old Towser.
It's an alert. Sergeant!
Sergeant Tibs! I say, Sergeant!
Oh, yes, Captain!
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.
Yes, sir. Right-o, sir.
Right away, sir!
Colonel?
I say, Colonel!
Colonel, sir? Colonel?
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?
Sergeant Tibs reporting, sir.
- Tibs? Tibs? Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!
- Colonel, sir...
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea of barging in at this hour?
- But Colonel...
- Hold on, Sergeant.
You hear that?
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.
We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.
Right-o, sir.
It's old Towser down at Withermarsh, sir.
By Jove, yes! So it is. Hmm.
Well, I'll see what he wants. it be the Colonel.
The old boy himself!
He wants the message.
You'd better make it loud and clear or he'll never get it.
One long howl, two short.
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.
- What's the word, Colonel?
- It's from London.
Then it must be important.
Yes, yes, I'll get the rest of it.
Sounds like a number.
Three fives are 13...
That's 15, sir.
Fifteen, of course 15.
Yes, dot, spot, spotted puddings, poodles...
No, no, puddles.
Puddles, sir?
Fifteen spotted puddles stolen.
Oh, balderdash.
Better double check it, Colonel.
Oh, yes, yes, I suppose I better.
Two woofs, one yip and a woof.
It sounds like puppies, sir.
Of course, puppies.
Colonel, Colonel, sir,
I just remembered.
Two nights past I heard puppy barking over at Hell Hall.
You mean the old De Vil place?
Nonsense, Tibs! No one's lived there for years.
Hold on! There's smoke coming from the chimney!
By Jove, that's strange, strange indeed.
I suppose we'd better investigate.
I'll send word for ol'
Towser to stand by.
Please stand by.
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.
Oh, maybe the ol' boy's found something!
Oh, I do hope so.
They say the ol' place is haunted or bewitched or some such fiddle-faddle.
Fiddle-faddle and rot, sir.
Just the same, use extreme caution.
No telling what sort of hocus-pocus you might run into.
Blast it all, Tibs.
On the double, man.
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Psst!
- Rover. Spotty.
- Hmm. What?
Are you one of the
15 stolen puppies?
No, we're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.
There's 99 of us all together.
Ninety-nine!
How 'bout that bunch of little ones?
They have names and collars.
They're not from the pet shops.
- Fifteen of 'em.
- We never counted them.
They're over there by the TV.
- I'd better count 'em.
- Watch out for the Baduns.
Baduns?
Those two blokes,
Horace and Jasper.
They're mean ones, they are.
Hey, look, Horace!
Watch me pot His Lordship smack on the conk.
How's that for calling 'em, eh?
One, two,
- three, four, five, six...
- Hey, Jasper.
Come on, now, give us a swig, just a short one.
Now, Horace, this hogwash ain't fit for a fancy bloke like yourself.
Besides, you'd get crumbs in it, you cabbage head!
All right.
Guzzle the whole works. I hope it gives you collywobbles, that's what.
Hey, Jasper. Did you...
Let me see. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...
Hey, get down, you runt!
And stay down!
Go on, get out of here or I'll black your other peeper.
Where was I? Nine...
Nine, three more.
Twelve and... One, two, three. That's 15!
They're the ones!
Blimey!
What the...
Horace, look what we got! A tabby cat!
How'd you like a tabby cat stew?
Or a cat casserole?
À la mode.
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- Shh. It's the Great Dane.
He has news for us. He'll meet us at Primrose Hill.
- How'll we get out?
- Uh, the back bedroom window.
It's always open a wee bit. Come on.
Pongos, you've made it. Good.
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?
They've been located somewhere north of here,
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.
I'll go along as far as Camden
Road and give you instructions.
When you reach Withermarsh, contact old Towser.
He'll direct you to the Colonel and the Colonel will take you to your puppies at the De Vil place.
- De Vil!
- The De Vil place!
Oh, Pongo, it was her!
Oh, someone you know?
Sorry, sir. There's no time to explain.
Oh, I hope we're not too late.
Good luck, Pongos.
If you lose your way, contact the barking chain.
They'll be standing by!
Any news, Colonel?
Not a blasted thing.
They're lost or captured, or something or other.
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.
Come now, Tibs.
Don't be ridiculous.
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.
But it's heading for Hell Hall.
It's stopping at the gate!
It is? Blast it all!
Better see what's up.
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.
Take over, Captain.
Right-o, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr Simpkins.
The answer's no, no, no.
Six down, four to go.
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.
It must be a yes or no question, Inspector.
Do you understand? Tonight!
But they ain't big enough.
You couldn't get half a dozen coats out of the whole caboodle.
Coats! Dog-skin coats?
Then we'll settle for half a dozen! We can't wait.
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!
How're we gonna do it?
Any way you like. Poison them, drown them.
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, ei-ther.
Eye-ther!
I don't care how you kill the little beasts, but do it, and do it now!
Aw, please, miss. Have pity.
Can't we see the rest of the show first?
We want to see What's My Crime?
Listen, you idiots!
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done, or I'll call the police!
Do you understand?
I think she means it.
Ah... We'll get on with it, as soon as the show's over.
Will you please sign in, sir?
You'd better get out of here if you want to save your skins.
- But how?
- Shh.
There's a hole in the wall there by the door.
Come on, shake a leg.
Psst! Kids, follow me.
Hey, Jasper, look!
It's old Meathead.
Yeah, what do you know, old Meathead Fauncewater.
Come on, don't crowd.
One at a time. One at a time!
For our last contestant,
meet Mr Percival Fauncewater.
If the panel fails to guess your unusual crime in ten questions,
you will receive two weeks vacation at a seaside resort,
all expenses paid.
That is, after you've paid your debt to society.
Who will take the first question? Inspector?
Mr Fauncewater, could your crime be classified as larceny?
- A theft, burglary?
- Straighten out!
Form a queue, along the wall.
Come on. Snap it up, faster.
Mr Fauncewater is a burglar by trade, but in this case,
his crime was not burglary.
I'm sorry, the answer's no. One down, nine to go. Miss Birdwell?
If your crime wasn't robbery, did you,
oh, dear, what I mean is,
do something of a violent nature, that is...
Come, Miss Birdwell, we're running short of time.
So sorry. Did you do someone in?
No, Miss Birdwell, I'm sorry.
The answer is no.
Two down, eight to go.
- Mr Simpkins?
- Psst!
Hey, kid, let's go.
Could it be a violation of a city ordinance?
Uh, no. The answer is...
Hey, get out of the way, you little runt!
Three down, seven to go. Inspector?
Very confusing, I must say.
Surely, this crime could...
I'm terribly sorry.
We've run out of time.
Ain't that always the way!
Would it be possible for Mr Fauncewater
to come back next week?
Then we could finish our little game.
Good night, audience. See you next week at this same time on What's My Crime?
Ah. Oh, well.
Come on, Horace.
Let's get on with it.
I'll pop 'em on the head, you do the skinnin'.
No, you don't, Jasper!
I'll pop 'em off and you do the skinnin'.
Horace, look!
They're gone. They flew the coop, right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.
We'll run 'em down before you can say "Bob's your uncle."
There they go, Horace, up the stairs.
Here, puppies.
Here, puppies! Come on now.
Don't go hiding from ol' Uncle Jasper.
Oh, I ain't gonna hurt ya.
I thought we was gonna pop 'em off.
Shh! Shut up.
Take a squint in there. I'll check these other two rooms.
Here, puppies.
Puppies, come on out. Come out wherever you are.
Horace! Ooh!
It's that mangy tabby cat!
He's the ringleader!
Head 'em off, Horace! Head 'em...
You bungling blockhead!
Back here! Back here!
Shh! Here they come.
Double-crossin' little twerps, pulling a snitch on us!
After we took care of 'em.
There's gratitude for you.
It ain't fair, Jasper.
Horace, there they go!
Sergeant? I say, Sergeant.
No time to explain. Busy, sir.
Shut that door, Horace!
We'll close in on 'em. Enough of this Ring Around the Rosy.
Oh, Pongo, I'm afraid we're lost.
It can't be far.
By Jove! It can't be the Pongos.
It's the Colonel. This way.
Colonel? Are you the Colonel?
Oh, Pingo! Pongo?
Our puppies, are they all right?
No time to explain.
There's trouble.
A big hullabaloo. Come along!
Follow me!
Now we've got 'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?
Come on, Horace. Give 'em what for.
I'm right behind ya, lad.
Oh!
You clumsy clod!
Hey! I'll knock the spots off you. Let go!
Let go!
Well, by George!
You mangy mongrel!
I'll knock your blinkin' block off.
Blast 'em, Tibs. Give 'em what for.
No, Colonel. Retreat, retreat!
Yes. Yes, of course. Retreat!
Retreat, on the double!
Help, Jasper! Get me out of here!
Horace, they're fighting dirty!
Oh!
Jasper!
Horace!
Come on, Perdy. Let's go.
I'll skin every one of them spotted hyenas if it's the last thing I do.
Dad! Mother!
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.
Oh, my darlings, my darlings!
How'd you find us, Dad?
Lucky, Patch, Pepper!
Hi, Freckles.
Oh, Daddy.
And Rolly, you rascal!
Did you bring me anything to eat?
Everybody here? All 15?
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!
What? Ninety-nine?
Where did they all come from?
What would she want with so many?
She's gonna make coats out of us.
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.
Oh, dog-skin coats! Come now, Tibs!
But it's true, sir.
Horace and Jasper were gonna pop us off and skin us!
She's a devil, a witch!
What'll we do?
We have to get back to London somehow.
What about the others?
What'll they do?
Perdy, we'll take them home with us, all of them.
Our pets would never turn them out.
Colonel, sir, lights on the road.
It's a truck headin' this way.
It's the Baduns, Horace and Jasper.
They're following our tracks.
We've got 'em outnumbered, Tibs.
When I give the signal, we'll attack.
Colonel, sir, I'm afraid that would be disastrous.
Oh, you think so?
He's right. We'd better run for it.
Out the back way, across the pasture.
Thank you, Sergeant,
Colonel, Captain.
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?
Nothing at all. All in the line of duty.
That's right, sir, routine.
Better be off. Here they come.
Come on, kids, hurry.
- Good luck, Pongos.
- And never fear.
We'll hold them off
'til the bitter end.
Now, what's this?
Out of my way, you barkin' haystack.
Or I'll knock your blinkin' block off!
They ain't in here, Jasper.
They're hiding in the hay.
Give me a match.
We'll burn 'em out.
Ready, Captain. Aim.
Fire one.
Fire two.
Hey, there they go, the little sneaks.
Come on, back to the truck.
We'll head 'em off in half a mile.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.
What if they went down the froze-up creek, so's not to leave their tracks?
Horace, you idiot!
Dogs ain't that smart.
All clear, Perdy.
- All clear.
- We gave 'em the slip! Didn't we, Dad?
They didn't even see us, Patch!
Shh, children. Children, shh.
My feet are slippery.
I wish we could walk on the snow.
No, son, we can't leave tracks.
Well, any sign of them?
Not so much as one bloomin' footprint.
And we've been up and down every road in the county.
We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.
Oh, no, you don't!
We'll find the little mongrels if it takes till next Christmas.
Now get going! Watch your driving, you imbeciles! Do you wanna get nabbed by the police?
Ninety-three,
Oh, Lucky!
Come on, Lucky, boy.
We can't give up now.
I'm tired and I'm hungry and my tail's froze, and my nose is froze and my ears are froze.
And my toes are froze.
Pongo!
Pongo! Pongo!
We'd just about lost hope.
We have shelter for you, at the dairy barn across the road.
Oh, thank goodness.
Perdy! Perdy!
This way, Perdy.
- The dairy barn across the road.
- Come on, kids.
It's not far. Come on, this way. Follow the collie.
Just look, Queenie.
- Have you ever seen so many puppies?
- Aren't they adorable!
- Perfectly darling.
- The poor little dears.
They're completely worn out and half frozen!
They all here, Pongo?
Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for.
The famous Pongos. We were so worried about you.
Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.
How did you make it all this way?
- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.
I'm hungry, Mother. I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry, too.
- Mother, we're hungry.
- We're all hungry.
- I'm sorry, children.
Do they like warm milk? It's fresh.
- Where is it?
- Where is the milk?
Come and get it, kids.
It's on the house.
This way, children.
Around this way.
Don't crowd. You'll have to take turns.
Rolly, wait your turn, dear.
Don't worry, kids.
There's plenty for all.
Ooh! The little darlings.
Pongo, a few scraps I saved
- for you and the missus.
- Oh, thank you.
It's not much, but it might hold you as far as Dinsford.
Huh? Dinsford?
There's a Labrador there.
His pet is a grocer.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Quite all right.
Get some rest and don't worry.
I'll be standing watch.
I don't know what we'd have done if...
- We're very honoured to be of service.
- We're only sorry we can't do more.
Anyone who would think of hurting these dear little puppies...
- Shh! Duchess!
- They're so dear.
I wish they could stay with us for always.
Princess, shh! Quiet, everyone.
Let them sleep, the poor things.
They're so exhausted and they still have such a long way to go.
Hurry, kids. Hurry!
Well now, what have we here?
Well, so they thought they could outwit Cruella.
Jasper! Horace!
Here's their tracks heading straight for the village.
Blimey! Oh, it's them, all right.
Work your way south on the side roads. I'll take the main road.
See you in Dinsford!
Pongo, I've got a ride home for you.
A ride home? Perdy, did you hear that?
For all of us?
You mean we don't have to walk any more?
If we can manage it.
Come on. We'd better hurry.
We've got a ride home!
Come on, children.
See the van down the street?
It's going to London as soon as the engine's repaired.
And there's room for all of you.
Pongo, there's Cruella.
Yes, and Jasper and Horace.
Pongo, how will we get to the van?
I don't know, Perdy.
But somehow we've got to.
Mother, Dad,
- Patch pushed me in the fireplace.
- Lucky pushed me first.
- Did not. Did not.
- Did, too. Did, too.
Did not!
- Please, children, don't quarrel.
- Say...
Perdy, I've got an idea.
Pongo, what on earth...
Look, I'm a Labrador!
We'll all roll in soot.
We'll be Labradors.
Say, that is an idea!
Come on, kids! Roll in the soot.
You mean, you want us to get dirty?
Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.
- Mother, should we?
- Do as your father says.
- This'll be fun.
- I always wanted to get good and dirty.
That's the stuff. The blacker the better.
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.
How's this, Dad?
Wait. That's enough. Not too many at a time.
Uh-oh. Rolly, hold on.
You're only half done.
Now, stay right with me.
We're gonna fool the ol' mad lady.
Pongo.
I'm so afraid.
Look, Jasper.
Do you suppose they disguised themselves?
Say now, Horace. That's just what they did.
Dogs is always painting theirselves black!
You idiot!
Well, so far so good.
Come on, Perdy. Better get on your make-up.
I'll go ahead with the next bunch.
Jasper! Horace!
- Well?
- Aw, now be reasonable, miss.
We're froze clean to our bones.
We've been out all night and all day, with nothin' to eat.
They're somewhere in this village, and we're going to find them.
Now get swing!
Do you think they've seen us?
No, but we're running out of time.
Try 'er again, mate.
Hurry, Perdy. The van's about to leave.
Better hurry.
I'll get the rest.
That ought to do her. She'll get you back to London.
Better get aboard, miss.
Hey, Jasper.
Come on, Horace.
Hurry, kids!
Come on, kids. Run on ahead.
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.
It can't be!
It's impossible!
Run for it!
Jasper! Horace!
Jasper!
There they go! In the van.
After them! After them!
Pongo! There she is, Cruella.
Hey, lady, what in thunder are you tryin' to do?
Crazy woman driver!
Pongo, look!
Jasper!
Ain't nothin' to it.
I'll give him a nudge and shove him in the dirt.
Perdy, watch out!
- Jasper!
- Horace!
You idiots!
You fools!
You imbeciles!
Ah, shut up!
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De
Roger, after all, that's your first big hit.
It's made more money than we ever dreamed of.
Yes, I know.
I still can't believe that Pongo and Perdy would run away.
Here's a bit of Christmas cheer for you, if there's anything to be cheerful about.
Oh, the dear little things.
Sometimes at night I can hear them barking.
But it always turns out I'm dreaming.
Roger, what on earth...
They're Labradors!
No, no. They're covered with soot.
Look, here's Lucky!
Pongo, boy, is that you?
Oh, Pongo, Pongo!
Ho-ho, it's Pongo!
And Perdy, my darling.
And Patch, and Rolly, and Penny, and Freckles.
They're all here, the little dears.
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!
And look, there's a whole lot more!
Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.
There must be 100!
One, two, three and four, is seven.
Two, four, six, and three is nine, plus two is 11.
- Thirty-six over here.
- Thirty-six and 11, that's 47!
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!
Ten, 11, 12, 13!
Wait a minute, six more.
Let's see, that's 84.
And 15 plus two, 101!
A hundred and one? Where did they come from?
Oh, Pongo, you old rascal!
- What'll we do with them?
- We'll keep 'em.
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.
We'll have a plantation, a Dalmatian plantation.
Roger, that's truly an inspiration.
It'll be a sensation!
We'll have a Dalmatian plantation.
A Dalmatian plantation, I say.
We'll have a dalmatian plantation
Where our population can roam
- I'm hungry, mother.
- In this new location
Our whole aggregation
Will love our plantation home
Dalmatian plantation home
NARRATOR: Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot.
But the Grinch...
...who lived just north of Who-ville, did not.
The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.
It could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
But I think that the most likely reason of all...
...may have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
But whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes...
...he stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos.
Staring down from his cave with a sour Grinchy frown...
...at the warm lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Who down in Who-ville beneath...
...was busy now hanging a holly Who-wreath.
And they're hanging their stockings.
He snarled with a sneer.
Tomorrow is Christmas.
It's practically here.
Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming:
I must find some way to keep Christmas from coming.
Or tomorrow, I know, all those Who girls and boys...
...will wake bright and early, they'll rush for their toys.
And then... Oh, the noise. Oh, the noise.
Noise, noise, noise.
There's one thing I hate. All the noise.
Noise, noise, noise.
And they'll shriek squeaks and squeals, racing round on their wheels.
[BICYCLE BELLS RINGING]
They'll dance with Jing-Tinglers tied onto their heels.
They'll blow their Floo-Floobers.
They'll bang their Tah-Tinkers.
[PLAYING]
They'll blow their Who-Hoobers.
They'll bang their Gah-Ginkers.
They'll beat their Trum-Tookers.
They'll slam their Sloo-Slonkers.
They'll beat their Blum-Blookers.
They'll wham their Who-Wonkers.
And they'll play noisy games like Zoo Zitta Ka Zay...
...a roller-skate type of lacrosse and croquet.
And then they'll make earsplitting noises de luxe...
...on their great big
Electro Who-Cardio Shluxe.
[PLAYING]
Then the Whos, young and old, will sit down to a feast.
And they'll feast, and they'll feast.
And they'll feast, feast, feast.
They'll feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast-beast.
Oh, roast beast is a feast
I can't stand in the least.
And then they'll do something
I hate most of all.
Every Who down in Who-ville, the tall and the small...
...will stand close together with Christmas bells ringing.
They'll stand hand in hand, and those Whos will start singing.
[SINGING "WELCOME CHRISTMAS"]
And they'll sing, and they'll sing.
And they'll sing. Sing, sing, sing.
NARRATOR: And the more the Grinch thought of this Who-Christmas sing...
...the more the Grinch thought:
I must stop this whole thing.
Why, for 53 years,
I've put up with it now.
I must stop Christmas from coming.
But how?
Then he got an idea. An awful idea.
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea.
GRINCH:
I know just what to do.
The Grinch laughed in his throat.
GRINCH: I'll make a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
Then he chuckled and clucked:
GRINCH:
What a great Grinchy trick.
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like Saint Nick.
All I need is a reindeer.
The Grinch looked around.
But since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.
Did that stop the Grinch? Ha.
The Grinch simply said:
GRINCH: If I can't find a reindeer,
I'll make one instead.
So he took his dog, Max, and he took some black thread...
...and he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
Then he loaded some bags and some old empty sacks...
...on a ramshackle sleigh, and he whistled for Max.
[WHISTLES]
- Then the Grinch said:
- Giddap.
[YELPS]
And the sleigh started down...
...toward the homes where the Whos lay a-snooze in their town.
All their windows were dark.
No one knew he was there.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care...
...when he came to the first little house on the square.
This is stop number one.
The old Grinchy Claus hissed as he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
Then he slid down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
He got stuck only once, for a minute or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue...
...where the little Who stockings hung all in a row.
These stockings...
He Grinched.
- Are the first things to go.
Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant...
...around the whole room and he took every present.
Pop guns, pampoonas, pantookas and drums...
...checkerboards, bizzel-binks, popcorn and plums.
Then he stuffed them in bags.
Then the Grinch, very nimbly...
...stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney.
[WHISTLES]
[GRUNTING]
Then he slunk to the icebox.
He took the Whos' feast.
He took the Who-pudding.
He took the roast beast.
He cleaned out the icebox as quick as a flash.
Why, that Grinch even took the last can of Who-hash.
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
GRINCH: Now...
- Grinned the Grinch.
GRINCH:
- I will stuff up the tree.
As the Grinch took the tree, as he started to shove...
[CINDY-LOU WHIMPERS]
...he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who...
...little Cindy-Lou Who, who was no more than 2.
She stared at the Grinch and said:
Santy Claus, why?
Why are you taking our Christmas tree?
Why?
But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick...
...he thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick.
Why, my sweet little tot...
The fake Santy Claus lied.
- There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side.
So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear.
I'll fix it up there, then I'll bring it back here.
And his fib fooled the child.
Then he patted her head.
And he got her a drink, and he sent her to bed.
And when Cindy-Lou Who was in bed with her cup...
...he crupt to the chimney and stuffed the tree up.
Then he went up the chimney himself, the old liar.
And the last thing he took was the log for their fire.
On their walls, he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
And the one speck of food that he left in the house...
...was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Then he did the same thing to the other Whos' houses...
...leaving crumbs much too small for the other Whos' mouses.
It was a quarter of dawn, all the Whos still abed...
...all the Whos still a-snooze...
...when he packed up his sled.
Packed it up with their presents, their ribbons, their wrappings...
...their snoof and their fuzzels, their tringlers and trappings.
[SCREAMS]
Ten thousand feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpit...
...he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it.
Pooh-pooh to the Whos.
NARRATOR:
He was Grinch-ily humming.
They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming.
They're just waking up.
I know just what they'll do.
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two.
Then the Whos down in Who-ville will all cry boohoo.
- That's a noise...
- Grinned the Grinch.
- That I simply must hear.
He paused.
And the Grinch put a hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low...
...then it started to grow.
[WHOS HUMMING]
[WHOS SINGING
"WELCOME CHRISTMAS"]
But this sound wasn't sad.
Why, this sound sounded glad.
Every Who down in Who-ville, the tall and the small...
...was singing without any presents at all.
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming, it came.
Somehow or other, it came just the same.
And the Grinch, with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow...
...stood puzzling and puzzling.
How could it be so?
It came without ribbons.
It came without tags.
It came without packages, boxes or bags.
He puzzled and puzzed till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.
"Maybe Christmas," he thought,
"doesn't come from a store.
Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more."
And what happened then?
Well, in Who-ville they say...
...that the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day.
And then the true meaning of Christmas came through.
And the Grinch found the strength of 10 Grinches plus two.
And now that his heart didn't feel quite so tight...
...he whizzed with his load through the bright morning light.
With a smile in his soul, he descended Mount Crumpit...
...cheerily blowing Who-Who on his trumpet.
[TRUMPET PLAYING]
He rode into Who-ville, he brought back their toys.
He brought back their floof to the Who girls and boys.
He brought back their snoof and their tringlers and fuzzels.
He brought back their pantookas, their dafflers and wuzzels.
He brought everything back, all the food for the feast.
And he himself, The Grinch...
...carved the roast beast.
Welcome Christmas, bring your cheer.
Cheer to all Whos far and near.
Christmas day is in our grasp, so long as we have hands to clasp.
Christmas day will always be just as long as we have we.
Welcome Christmas while we stand, heart to heart and hand in hand.
[ENGLISH SDH]
If I Iive to be a hundred,
I'II never be abIe to forget that big snowstorm... a coupIe of years ago.
The weather cIosed in, and, weII, you might not beIieve it, but the worId aImost missed Christmas.
Oh, excuse me. CaII me Sam.
What's the matter?
Haven't you ever seen a taIking snowman before?
Nice around here, isn't it?
I caII it Christmas Town, better known as the North PoIe.
The Christmas Tree Forest.
Yep, here's where we grow them.
Nice pIace to Iive, you know.
Christmas seaIs.
The number-one citizens up here... are the CIauses:
Santa and the missis.
They Iive right over there, first castIe on the Ieft.
Matter of fact, the onIy castIe on the Ieft.
Papa, you haven't touched a morseI!
I'II have to take this suit in! Eat!
I'm busy, Mama!
It's aImost Christmas!
Whoever heard of a skinny Santa?
Eat! Eat!
Don't any of you worry your heads about Santa.
Mrs. CIaus wiII have him pIenty fattened up by Christmas Eve.
It's aIways the same story.
Ahh! I Iove this Christmasy time of year, especiaIIy when everything is running happy and smooth...
Iike it is this season.
Nothing Iike that year of the big snowstorms.
I don't know what we wouId have done... without RudoIph to puII us through.
Anyway...hmm, RudoIph?
CouId it be some of you are not acquainted... with the story of RudoIph?
WeII, puII up an ice bIock and Iend an ear.
Now, you know how Santa uses these fIying reindeer... to puII his sIeigh.
You know Dasher and Dancer... and Prancer and Vixen...
Comet and Cupid... and Donner and BIitzen...
But do you recaII
The most famous reindeer of aII?
WeII, now, Iet me teII you about RudoIph.
It aII started a coupIe of years before the big snow.
It was springtime, and Santa's
Iead reindeer Donner... had just become a proud papa.
Nah, we'II caII him RudoIph.
RudoIph is a IoveIy name.
RudoIph.
Hey, hey!
He knows his name aIready!
Papa. Mama.
He's got a shiny nose!
Shiny? I'd even say it gIows!
WeII, we'II simpIy have to overIook it.
How can you overIook that?
His beak bIinks
Iike a bIinking beacon!
WeII, Donner, where's the new member of the famiIy?
After aII, if he's going to be on my team someday, he'd better get to know me.
WeII, hi there. Aren't you the sturdy IittIe feIIow?
Santa?
And smart, too!
Great bouncing iceberg!
I'm sure it'II stop when he grows up, Santa.
WeII, Iet's hope so if he wants to make the sIeigh team someday.
You see, IittIe feIIow, every year I shine up my jingIe beIIs... for eight Iucky reindeer.
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe
You wiII hear my sIeigh beIIs ring
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
JingIe, jingIe, reindeer
Through the frosty air they'II go
They are not just pIain deer
They're the fastest deer
I know, ho ho
You must beIieve that on Christmas Eve
I won't pass you by
I'II dash away in my magic sIeigh
FIying through the sky
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe
You wiII hear my sIeigh beIIs ring
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
Ho ho!
Bye-bye.
Oh, Santa's right.
He'II never make the sIeigh team.
Wait a minute! I've got it!
We'II hide RudoIph's nose.
-Hide it?
-Yeah.
Come here, boy.
You'II be a normaI IittIe buck just Iike everybody eIse, right?
A chip off the oId antIers.
Now, now. You'II get used to it.
Put it there, son.
Aw, gee.
For the first year, the Donners did a pretty fair job... of hiding RudoIph's, uh, nonconformity.
Donner taught RudoIph aII the ins and outs... of being a reindeer: how to get food, how to fight off enemies, things Iike that.
But most important...
Most important of aII, he taught his son to beware... of the AbominabIe Snow Monster of the North.
He's mean, he's nasty, and he hates everything to do with Christmas.
Now, aside from the AbominabIe, business goes on as usuaI.
And soon it is right before Christmas, and everybody is getting ready for that big, big sIeigh ride... on the night of the 24th--
Christmas Eve!
See, aII the toys Santa brings are made by these eIves.
Seems eIves have that certain knack for toy-making.
AII except for this one misfit.
Hermey!
Aren't you finished painting that yet?
There's a piIeup a miIe wide behind you.
What's eating you, boy?
Not happy in my work, I guess.
What?!
I just don't Iike to make toys.
Oh, weII, if that's aII.
What?! You don't Iike to make toys?
No.
Hermey doesn't Iike to make toys.
Oh, shame on you!
Mind teIIing me what you do want to do?
WeII, sir, someday I'd Iike to be a dentist.
A dentist?!
WeII, we need one up here.
I've been studying. It's fascinating. You've no idea.
MoIars and bicuspids and incisors.
Now, Iisten, you. You're an eIf, and eIves make toys.
Now get to work!
10 minutes break!
Not for you!
Finish the job, or you're fired!
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
You can't fire me
I quit
Seems I don't fit in
Ah, weII.
Such is the Iife of an eIf.
MeanwhiIe, RudoIph is having his growing pains, too.
OId Donner is determined to keep RudoIph's nose a secret.
AII right, son. Try it on.
I don't wanna.
Daddy, I don't Iike it.
You'II Iike it and wear it.
Oh, but, Daddy!
It's not very comfortabIe!
There are more important things than comfort: seIf-respect.
Santa can't object to you now.
Why am I such a misfit?
I am just not a nitwit
Just because my nose gIows
Why don't I fit in?
And so time passes.
Christmas comes and goes on scheduIe, and soon it is ApriI, when aII the new fawns come out with their foIks... to meet the other new fawns and to be inspected by Santa.
Now, don't worry about your nose, son.
Just get out there and do your stuff.
Remember, you're my IittIe buck.
Hi. My name's FirebaII.
What's yours?
-RudoIph.
-You can be my buddy.
-Where are we going?
-The reindeer games.
Makes antIers grow.
Besides, it's a great way to show off in front of the does.
Ah, youth.
MeanwhiIe, the eIves are bustIing with activity.
Christmas is over, but they stiII keep busy with Iessons... in eIf improvement.
AII out for eIf practice!
Let's get this over with.
I have to Iook over the new deer.
OK, Santa. Let's try out the new eIf song I wrote.
And remember, it's for Santa.
And a-1 and a-2 and a-3...
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho
We are Santa's eIves
We are Santa's eIves
FiIIing Santa's sheIves
With a toy for each girI and boy
Oh, we are Santa's eIves
We work hard aII day
But our work is pIay
DoIIs we try out, see if they cry out
We are Santa's eIves
We've a speciaI job each year
We don't Iike to brag
Christmas Eve we aIways fiII Santa's bag
Santa knows who's good
Do the things you shouId
And we bet you he won't forget you
We are Santa's eIves
We've a speciaI job each year
We don't Iike to brag
Christmas Eve we aIways fiII Santa's bag
Santa knows who's good
Do the things you shouId
And we bet you he won't forget you
We are Santa's eIves
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho
We are Santa's eIves, ho ho
Hmm. WeII, it needs work.
I have to go.
What does Papa know?
It's beautifuI.
You keep it just the way it was.
Papa? Papa!
That sounded terribIe!
The tenor section was weak.
Wasn't our fauIt, boss.
Hermey didn't show up.
What?
Now, this won't hurt a bit.
Why weren't you at eIf practice?
Just fixing these doIIs' teeth.
Just fixing--
Now, Iisten! We have doIIs that cry, taIk, waIk, bIink, and run a temperature.
We don't need any chewing doIIs.
I just thought I found a way to fit in.
You'II never fit in!
You come to practice and Iearn how to wiggIe your ears... and chuckIe warmIy and go ''hee hee'' and ''ho ho'' and important stuff Iike that.
A dentist! Good grief!
No. I just can't.
It's Iike he said:
I'II never fit in.
I guess I'm on my own now.
Hey, Iook! Does!
What do you know?
One of them Iikes you.
Yeah, FirebaII?
You reaIIy think so?
Here comes the coach.
AII right.
AII right, yearIings.
AII right, now!
That's better.
My name is Comet.
Even though I'm your instructor,
I want to be your paI.
Right? Right.
My job is to make bucks out of you. Let's go.
Now then, our first game is caIIed Takeoff.
We aII want to puII
Santa's sIeigh someday, so we must Iearn to fIy.
Now, who's first to try?
Me! Me!
One at a time!
You're Dasher's IittIe boy, aren't you?
You go first. The whoIe trick is getting up enough speed... and jumping into the wind.
You got it? Go ahead.
Very good...for a first try.
Next!
He won't get to us for a whiIe.
Go get acquainted with that doe.
Nice day.
Yup.
For takeoff practice, I mean.
Yup.
I bet you'II be the best.
WeII, I don't know.
Something wrong with your nose?
I mean, you taIk kind of funny.
What's so funny about the way I taIk?
Don't get angry. I don't mind.
You don't?
My name's CIarice. Hi.
My name's RudoIph. Hi.
Hi.
Hey, CIarice... after practice, wouId you-- wouId you--
RudoIph, you get back here!
It's your turn.
Gee, I got to go back.
WouId you waIk home with me?
Uh-huh...RudoIph.
I think you're cute.
I'm cute!
I'm cute!
Magnificent!
I'm cute! I'm cute!
She said I'm cute!
Not bad. Not bad at aII.
Hey, you're OK.
She said I'm cute!
For crying out Ioud!
FirebaII, what's the matter?
Get away from me!
What's this nonsense here, bucks?
After aII--Aah!
Hey, Iook at the beak.
Hey, Fire Snout!
Rainbow puss!
Red schnoz!
Stop caIIing me names!
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer.
Donner, you shouId be ashamed of yourseIf.
What a pity.
He had a nice takeoff, too.
AII right now, yearIings.
Back to practice.
Oh, no. Not you.
You better go home.
From now on, we won't Iet RudoIph join in any reindeer games.
Right! Right!
WeII, what do you want?
You promised to waIk me home.
Aren't you going to
Iaugh at my nose?
It's a handsome nose, much better than that faIse one you were wearing.
It's terribIe.
It's different from everybody eIse's.
But that's what makes it so grand.
Any doe wouId consider herseIf Iucky to be with you.
Yeah?
But I wasn't very Iucky today, was I?
I wish...
I--I wish...
There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true
BeIieve in your dreams, come what may
There's aIways tomorrow with so much to do
And so IittIe time in a day
We aII pretend the rainbow has an end
And you'II be there, my friend, someday
There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true
Tomorrow is not far away
We aII pretend the rainbow has an end
And you'II be there, my friend, someday
There's aIways tomorrow for dreams to come true
Tomorrow is not far away
CIarice!
Get back to your cave!
-But I--
-This instant, young Iady!
Yes, sir.
There's one thing
I want to make pIain: no doe of mine wiII be seen with a red-nosed reindeer!
Oh, is this your snowbank?
No. Who are you?
WeII, actuaIIy, I am a dentist.
A dentist?
WeII, I want to be someday.
Right now, I'm just an eIf.
But I don't need anybody.
I'm...
I'm independent.
Yeah? Me, too.
I'm...whatever you said.
Independent.
Hey, what do you say we both be independent together, huh?
You wouIdn't mind my red nose?
Not if you don't mind me being a dentist.
It's a deaI.
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
We're not daffy and diIIy
Don't go round wiIIy-niIIy
Seems to us kind of siIIy
That we don't fit in
We may be different from the rest
Who decides the test of what is reaIIy best?
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
I'm a dear of a reindeer
Why don't I fit in?
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
They can't fire me
I quit
Seems I don't fit in
We may be different from the rest
Who decides the test of what is reaIIy best?
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
These two had no idea about what they were
Ietting themseIves in for.
The worId Iooked a Iot more compIicated and dangerous... than it seemed when they were snug and warm at home.
The AbominabIe!
He must see your nose.
Quick, douse the Iight.
Like I said, the outside worId is up to its ears in danger.
WeII, somehow RudoIph and Hermey managed to get through the first night.
Mush!
Mush. Don't you understand
North PoIe taIk?
What's this?
Hey, you get frostbit that way.
Who are you?
Who am I?
The name's Yukon CorneIius, the greatest prospector in the North!
This is my Iand, and it's rich with goId.
GoId!
GoId and siIver.
SiIver and goId.
Wahoo!
Nothing.
SiIver and goId.
What do you think of our friend CorneIius?
Seems aII he thinks about is siIver and goId.
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Everyone wishes for siIver and goId
How do you measure its worth?
Just by the pIeasure
It gives here on earth
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Means so much more when I see
SiIver and goId decorations
On every Christmas tree
What's a Christmas tree... without pretty siIver and goId decorations?
Can't reaIIy caII it a Christmas tree, right?
Think of aII the joy that wouId be Iost on Christmas morning... if the young foIks didn't see that sparkIing, happy tree.
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Means so much more when I see
SiIver and goId decorations
On every Christmas tree
I'm off to get my suppIies: cornmeaI, gunpowder, hamhocks, and guitar strings.
I'II give you a Iift.
Hop aboard, mateys.
Now, mush!
Like this. Watch.
Gadzooks!
The BumbIe Snow Monster of the North strikes again.
It's my nose!
It keeps giving us away.
I hate noisy bumbIe snow monsters.
We'II outwit the fiend with our superior inteIIigence.
-How?
-Douse your nose... and run Iike crazy!
Come on! Wahoo!
We're trapped.
There's no way out!
It's my nose again.
It's ruined us.
The bumbIe has one weakness, and I know it.
Do-it-yourseIf icebergs.
Observe: the bumbIe's one weakness.
The bumbIe sinks.
Yukon CorneIius scores again!
Whoopee!
Nothing.
Mister, where are we going?
You'II stay with me.
We'II aII be rich with the biggest siIver strike... this side of Hudson Bay.
SiIver!
I thought you wanted goId.
I changed my mind.
Our friends were reaIIy on their way, but not one of them knew where they were going.
You can bet oId Donner feIt bad about the way he had treated RudoIph.
He knew the onIy thing to do... was to go out and Iook for his IittIe buck.
Mrs. Donner wanted to go aIong, naturaIIy, but Donner said, ''No, this is man's work.''
No sooner did the man of the house Ieave... when Mrs. Donner and CIarice decided to set out on their own.
Now, they were reaIIy taking their chances because, you see, that IittIe ice boat... had run into a pack of mighty wicked fog.
HeIIo!
The fog is thick as peanut butter.
-You mean pea soup.
-You eat what you Iike.
Land ho!
No kidding.
WeII, where are we?
Hey! Looky up there!
Oh!
HaIt! Who goes there?
Us, of course.
WeII, then that's OK.
OK? Who, may I ask, are you?
We're RudoIph, Hermey, and
Yukon CorneIius. Who are you?
I'm the officiaI sentry of the IsIand of Misfit Toys.
A jack-in-the-box for a sentry?
Yes. My name is--
Don't teII me. Jack.
No. CharIie.
That's why I'm a misfit toy.
My name is aII wrong.
No chiId wants to pIay with a charIie-in-the-box, so I had to come here.
Where's here?
We're on the isIand of misfit toys
Here we don't want to stay
We want to traveI with Santa CIaus
In his magic sIeigh
A pack fuII of toys
Means a sack fuII of joys
For miIIions of girIs
And for miIIions of boys
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day of the year
A jack-in-the-box
Waits for chiIdren to shout
Wake up! Don't you know it's time to come out?
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day of the year
Toys gaIore
Scattered on the fIoor
There's no room for more
And it's aII because of Santa CIaus
A scooter for Jimmy
A doIIy for Sue
The kind that wiII even say
''How do you do?''
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day of the year
How wouId you Iike to be a spotted eIephant?
Or a choo-choo with square wheeIs on your caboose?
Or a water pistoI that shoots jeIIy?
We're aII misfits!
WouId you Iike to be a bird that doesn't fIy?
I swim!
Or a cowboy who rides an ostrich?
Or a boat that can't stay afIoat.
We're aII misfits!
If we're on the IsIand of Unwanted Toys
We'II miss aII the fun
With the girIs and the boys
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI, wonderfuI
WonderfuI, wonderfuI
WonderfuI day of the year
Hey, we're aII misfits, too.
Maybe we couId stay for a whiIe.
You'd have to get permission from King Moonraiser.
Who's he?
He ruIes here.
Every night, he searches the entire earth.
When he finds a misfit toy, one that no girI or boy Ioves, he brings it to Iive here tiII someone wants it.
He's hoIding court in his castIe right now.
Come cIoser.
What do you desire?
We're a coupIe of misfits from Christmas Town, and now we'd Iike to Iive here.
No. That wouId not be possibIe.
This isIand is for toys aIone.
How do you Iike that? Even among misfits, you're misfits.
UnIike pIaythings, a Iiving creature cannot hide himseIf on an isIand.
But, perhaps, being misfits yourseIves, you might heIp the toys here.
HeIp them?
Yes. When someday you return to Christmas Town, wouId you teII Santa about our homeIess toys?
I'm sure he couId find chiIdren who wouId be happy with them.
A toy is never truIy happy untiI it is Ioved by a chiId.
When and if we ever get back, we'II teII Santa, sir.
Good. You are free to spend the night.
Footman!
Show our friends to their chambers.
No. It's aII settIed.
We Ieave tomorrow together.
But the AbominabIe wiII see my nose and get us aII.
I've got to go aIone.
Nonsense. It's aII for aII...
I mean, one...
Ah, Iet's get some shuteye.
-But--
-It's aII settIed.
WeII, poor RudoIph reaIizes... that he can't endanger his friends' Iives anymore.
And so, that night, he decides to strike out on his own.
Good-bye, CorneIius.
I hope you find Iots of tinseI.
Good-bye, Hermey.
Whatever a dentist is,
I hope, someday, that you're the greatest.
WeII, time passed sIowIy.
RudoIph existed as best he couId.
The snow monster kept him on the run... but once in a whiIe, he wouId stop and make a friend or two.
But it wouIdn't Iast Iong, and RudoIph wouId be on his own.
But during aII that time, a strange and wonderfuI thing was happening.
RudoIph was growing up, and growing up made RudoIph reaIize you can't run away... from your troubIes.
And pretty soon he knew where he had to go: home.
You! I thought you were gone for good.
Hey, Iook who's back: oId Neon Nose!
Mom? Pa?
I'm home!
They're gone, RudoIph.
They've been gone for months
Iooking for you.
CIarice?
She's gone, too.
I'm very worried.
Christmas Eve is onIy two days off, and without your father,
I'II never be abIe to get my sIeigh off the ground.
Gone?
I'II find him, sir.
I'II find them aII.
WeII, he was just about to Ieave when suddenIy...
It hit!
The storm of storms, and onIy two days before Christmas Eve.
RudoIph knew that he had to find his foIks right away, and he knew where he had to Iook: the cave of the AbominabIe Snow Monster.
Put her down!
TeII me when it's over.
Oh, where was I?
Their Iast chance.
Not quite. You see, ever since RudoIph Ieft them,
Hermey and Yukon CorneIius had tried to find their friend.
They arrived in Christmas Town just as the storm hit.
It was a good thing that I sent them right out after RudoIph.
Hey, Iook!
Whoa!
Unmush, wiII you?
What do we do? We can't Iet that monster get ahoId of them.
I got an idea. Listen.
-Yes.
-And then...
Not bad.
It might work.
Why doesn't he get it over with?
Pa? Ma?
CIarice!
Are you sure we can get him out?
Never knew the bumbIe snow monster yet... who'd turn down a pork dinner for deer meat.
Do your stuff!
Oink oink.
Put some heart in it!
That bumbIe's hungry!
Wahoo!
TerribIe weather we've been having.
Snow and ice.
AII right, dentist, you take it from here.
It's Yukon CorneIius!
Ta-da! In person.
We're saved!
Let's get outta here.
I'II Iight the way.
Why, bIast your hairy bumbIe hide.
Don't Iet this big bIowhard scare you anymore.
Just waIk right past him.
I teII you, you're Iooking at a mighty humbIe bumbIe.
He's nothing without his choppers.
Let me at him.
Wahoo!
Yukon!
He's gone!
Oh, he's gone!
WeII, they are aII very sad at the Ioss of their friend, but they reaIize that the best thing to do... is get the women back to Christmas Town.
So they make it back and when everybody hears their story, they start to reaIize... maybe they were a IittIe hard on the misfits.
Maybe misfits have a pIace, too.
Even Santa reaIizes that maybe he was wrong.
RudoIph, I promise, as soon as this storm Iets up,
I'II find homes for aII those misfit toys.
AII right. You can open up a dentist office.
Next week, after Christmas.
Come here. Open your mouth.
Oh, dear.
I'II set up an appointment for you: week from Tuesday,
4:30 sharp.
I'm sorry, too, RudoIph, for the way I acted.
Open up!
It isn't a fit night out for man nor beast!
Here's the man... and here's the beast!
Now, caIm down.
I reformed this bumbIe.
He wants a job.
Looky what he can do.
And he doesn't even need a stepIadder.
But...but...you went over the side of the cIiff.
Didn't I ever teII you about bumbIes?
BumbIes bounce!
WeII, as good as everyone feeIs, this is no time for ceIebrating... because the next day is Christmas Eve-- the biggest day of the year.
Eat, Papa, eat.
How can I eat? That siIIy eIf song is driving me crazy.
You're going to disappoint the chiIdren.
They expect a fat Santa.
Latest weather report, sir.
WeII, this is it.
The storm won't subside by tonight.
We'II have to canceI Christmas.
Papa, are you sure?
Everything's grounded!
Oh, the poor kids.
They've been so good this year, too.
But I couIdn't chance it.
I'II have to teII everybody that it's aII off this year.
Quiet! Quiet!
PIease, everybody quiet!
I've got some bad news, foIks.
Christmas is going to be canceIed.
There's nothing I can do.
This weather--
RudoIph, RudoIph, pIease!
CouId you tone it down a bit?
I mean, that nose of yours.
That nose!
That beautifuI, wonderfuI nose!
-Huh?
-RudoIph, Christmas is not off, and you're going to Iead my team.
I am?
Yes, sir. You and that wonderfuI nose of yours.
My nose, sir?
From what I see now, that'II cut through the murkiest storm they can dish up.
What I'm trying to say is...
RudoIph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sIeigh tonight?
It wiII be an honor, sir.
I knew that nose wouId be usefuI someday.
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'II be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And when you waIk down the street
Say heIIo to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Ho, ho, the mistIetoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by goIIy
Have a hoIIy, joIIy
Christmas this year
HoIIy, joIIy
HoIIy, joIIy
Oooohhhhhh
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by goIIy, have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
This year
Eat now. ''Ho ho ho'' Iater.
Let me check. Turn.
Oh, Mama!
Now, shake when you Iaugh.
Now, that's my Santa.
Oh, thanks, Mama. My coat!
Ready, RudoIph?
Ready, Santa!
WeII, Iet's be on our way.
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!
First stop, the IsIand of Misfit Toys.
Up, up, up, and away!
He'II be a hero after this.
Yes, a hero.
That's my buck!
Now, you see how it's done?
Wahoo!
Peppermint! What I've been searching for aII my Iife!
I've struck it rich!
I've got me a peppermint mine!
Wahoo!
WeII, it's Christmas Eve, but...
Looks Iike we're forgotten again.
But RudoIph promised we'd go this time.
Guess the storm was too much for them.
Might just as weII go to bed and start dreaming about next year.
I haven't any dreams Ieft to dream.
We'II never get off this isIand.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
Is it...is it...
It sure is! It's Santa!
And Iook!
RudoIph is Ieading the way!
You can see his nose from here.
WeII, Iet's be on our way.
Ready, RudoIph?
Ready, Santa!
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!
Up, up, up, and away!
WeII, foIks, as for the rest of the story...
He went down in history
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You wouId even say it gIows
AII of the other reindeer
Used to Iaugh and caII him names
They never Iet poor RudoIph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
''RudoIph with your nose so bright''
''Won't you guide my sIeigh tonight?''
Then how the reindeer Ioved him
As they shouted out with gIee
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
You'II go down in history
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
You'II go down in history
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

Excuse me ...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, sorry.
Pardon me. I think there is room for one more in here, is there not?
Yes, right here.
Oh, thank you.
I'm so sorry to disturb you.
- Oh, that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Hey, that's a funny looking deck, man.
How do you play poker with these?
They're tarot cards.
You are familiar with the tarot?
I wouldn't say that. But
I've seen the cards before.
Doctor Schreck. Doctor of Metaphysics?
The science which investigates the first principles of nature and thought.
And nonsense.
Schreck is a German word, isn't it?
Means fright, fear, something like that.
A more exact translation would be terror.
An unfortunate misnomer for I am the mildest of men.
However, I sometimes foretell things that are frightening.
With these?
They are the key, yes.
The key?
The key to what?
Ancient wisdom.
The tarot deck is a picture book of life, an answer to the deepest questions of philosophy and history, and sometimes a means of prediction.
Fortune telling?
Of a kind.
What kind?
There is within each of us a twin destiny: the natural and the supernatural.
The cards are attracted to the supernatural part of that destiny as one pole of a magnet attracts an opposite pole.
Supernatural part?
The strange, the weird, the unknown, the terrifying, the mysterious.
At one time or another during our lives we may, any one of us, encounter it.
This deck can forewarn us.
I call it my House of Horrors.
How does it work?
The person, whose fortune is to be told, touches the cards three times.
Then they are shuffled and dealt. The first four cards predict his destiny.
The fifth gives him the knowledge to change it . If change is possible.
Really, do we have to suffer all this nonsense?
There's no harm in it.
Astrologers, spiritualists, table-rappers, the entire lunatic fringe.
They have been exposed for the charlatans they are, over and over again.
I don't know. I don't know. A gypsy once told me I was going to get an unexpected gift. That very day I walked under a pigeon...
The tarot deck is a serious matter.
The cards predict the truth.
The supernatural truth. Always!
Anybody, who believes that, will believe anything.
Perhaps you would like to learn your future?
Just tap the cards.
I must warn you, gentlemen. This is undoubtedly a well rehearsed prelude to some shabby confidence trick. You can fool all these others as much as you please, Doctor, but kindly leave me out of it.
How about me?
Come on. I'm game.
You are not afraid?
Well, if it's going to happen to me anyway, what's there to be afraid of?
Very well.
Tap the cards three times.
I do not manipulate them.
They use my hands to manipulate themselves and to present your destiny.
The Chariot.
The High Priestess.
The Moon.
The Enchantress.
Fine. Yes. Yes, you do that.
I will. Goodbye.
Oh, how they talk! You busy?
Yes, I'm working on the Morrison project.
Well, there's no rush for that.
This letter came this morning from that
Biddulph woman you sold your house to.
She wants to make some major structure alterations and seems to think you're the only architect to deal with it.
Doesn't say what the alterations are.
Does it matter?
A lonely widow, rich, beautiful
Well, I'd be glad to spend a few days on that island with her myself.
Thank you, sir.
Hey.
Hey, if it's not Mr. Jamie
Caleb!
How good to see you.
I didn't expect you back, sir.
Well, Mrs. Biddulph wrote and asked me to give her advice about altering the house.
Is anyone at home, d'you know?
My grand-daughter, Valda
Ah, Valda, is the mistress in?
Upstairs, Grandfather.
Come in.
You were about this high the last time I saw you.
Oh, Mr. Dawson, how wonderful. I had no idea you would be here so soon.
I was free and naturally I was interested in the house.
I'm very grateful to you, by the way, for calling in my firm for the job.
Oh Valda, will you prepare the guest room for Mr Dawson, please?
Come in here.
It doesn't seem to have changed very much. What exactly do you want clone?
Oh, what I want principally is to have that wall knocked down to make one large room.
You know like a ballroom.
There shouldn't be any problems, should it?
No. No, I don't think so.
But it's an old house. I'd want to examine it very carefully before I make up my mind.
Well, I thought you'd know it better than anyone else.
Yes, I should.
My family lived here for centuries before I had to sell it.
But still
I think I'd better look at the foundations and the walls very carefully before we decide to make any radical changes.
Well, I have to go down to the village for an hour or so.
If there's anything you want, just ask Caleb or Valda.
May I ask you a personal question?
If it's not too personal.
Why does a beautiful woman like yourself want to bury herself in the Hebrides?
My husband was a very wonderful man.
It took me a long time to get over his death.
In fact, after the funeral
I had a sort of breakdown.
The doctors decided that I needed complete rest and quiet.
So I came here.
But now you've decided you want to rejoin the human race, aye?
Why do you say that?
Well, you're having this room made into a ballroom.
That's not for entertaining.
You see my husband was an archeologist.
He had a large collection of very valuable specimens from all over the world.
I intend to turn this into a sort of museum to his memory.
It's a beautiful house, and you're welcome to visit us any time.
Thank you.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
Valda!
Valda!
Yes, sir.
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you, but d'you know where the key to the cellar is?
No, sir, I don't.
Well, would you be good enough to ask your grandfather if he knows?
Yes, sir.
The lock's been oiled recently.
That's strange. I didn’t do it.
Here is the torch for you.
Caleb.
Aye.
Come down here, will you?
Caleb, do you know what this is?
Must be the coffin of Cosmo Waldemar.
The werewolf! Over two hundred years ago
Cosmo Waldemar claimed that this house was really his and that my ancestors had stolen it from him.
And he vowed that one day he'd return.
He swore that his place would be taken by whoever owned the house and that he himself would once again assume human shape.
His grave was never found.
But it was here in the walls of this cellar for all this time.
Not all this time.
This plaster is new.
I'm going to find out what's in that coffin.
Come on. Give me a hand.
We'll need something stronger than this.
Come on.
Oh, Mrs. Biddulph.
Did you see anything come out of the house?
No. What's the matter?
Nothing. Here let me give you a hand with those.
Oh, thank you.
The only thing I don't like about living on this island is the fact that the shops won't deliver...
Oh, put them down there, will you?
Oh, I see you've found the key.
No, no. Caleb had a spare one.
Will you have to work down there?
Eh, yes, yes, I think so.
Well, how long do you suppose the work will take?
Just a short time, Mrs. Biddulph.
Has anyone been down in the cellar since you moved in?
Well, I suppose the workmen were down there. I haven't. Why?
It doesn't matter.
Go up to your room and lock your door. Go on.
Caleb, what does the legend say?
That Cosmo would return and take his revenge on the owner of the house.
Do you know that Valda left me a note tonight, saying she had to see me?
She knew something about
Do you have a gun?
Aye.
Get it.
What are you going to do?
Something came out of that coffin tonight.
Something evil and strange.
I don't know why it killed Valda.
But I know who it's going to kill.
My great grandfather had this made of the silver sword that killed Cosmo.
It's hung in the house ever since to protect it.
I'm going to melt it down and make bullets, silver bullets.
And when that coffin opens tomorrow night, I'll be waiting.
Come in.
I don't understand it.
The legend says the only way to kill a werewolf is with a bullet made from a silver crucifix.
I had six.
You mean these?
You see, what the legend really says is that Cosmo Waldemar will resume human shape again when he's replaced in his coffin.
Not by the owner of the house, but by a descendant of the man, who killed him.
Now any dutiful wife would do anything to bring her husband back to life.
Even after two hundred years.
Are you trying to tell me that's going to happen to me?
Where are you going now?
Bradley.
And then?
To the Island of Unga in the Hebrides.
Turn the fifth card.
Well, what was it?
Nothing.
Come on, show me that card. Tell me.
Don't be so gullible. Can't you see it's all part of the act?
What act, Mr. Marsh?
Is your name Marsh?
Don't be mislead by his knowing that.
There's no magic about it. I can assure you.
Yeah, but how did he know?
Maybe it's on his baggage.
There's no mystery about it, gentlemen.
Most informed people have heard of Franklyn Marsh, art critic.
Confidence tricksters make a point of being familiar with people in the news.
Well, I've never heard of you.
Dr. Schreck,
I'd like to try those cards if you don't mind.
If you think so.
And now your prediction.
You are going on holiday soon?
Alone?
- With your wife and your daughter.
Who told you? How did you know?
Perfectly simple. He saw the doll up on the rack.
And a dog.
That's right. You'll see them all when we get to Bradley.
They're meeting me at the station.
And when you return from holiday and when you return.
I've got Katie, Mummy.
Bill?
- Yeah.
Bill, come and look at this.
It wasn't there before.
It must have grown while we were away.
Well, you'd better get rid of it, or it'll kill all the hydrangeas.
Not even home yet and back to work already.
Au!
What is it?
What is it?
Bill?
It seemed to cry out in pain when I hit it.
And I couldn't cut into it with a hoe. Give me the shears.
I could almost swear that vine pushed those shears out of my hands.
Have you ever seen anything like this before, Gerry?
No, it's new to me. You say this vine seemed actually to resist cutting?
Well, I'm pretty good at handling garden tools.
I don't think those shears slipped.
Can you put me up for a few days?
Hm. Sure.
Easier to find out what this is all about on the spot.
Better than staring through some wretched microscope here at the Ministry.
Too true.
Come on, raise up
Rusty, come on.
Come on, Rusty.
Oh Rusty, come on.
Rusty, go on, fetch it.
Fetch it!
I'm sorry, Mr. Drake.
- That's all right. Here you are.
Come on, Rusty
Come on, Rusty.
Come on. Come on. Raise up
Rusty.
Carol!
Yes, mummy?
Time for tea. I'll get
Rusty's in a minute.
All right. Rusty, go after it, go after it!
A dog strangled by a vine.
I can hardly believe it.
A plant that protects itself.
It's impossible.
Hm. That's what I thought at first, but have a look at this.
Now these are the main groups of plants of whose existence we already now know.
First: plants without roots, stems or leaves, bacteria, and lichens.
Fungi
After that: mosses.
A slightly higher form with neither roots nor vascular tissue.
Third: ferns which have roots and vascular tissue but no flowers.
And fourth: a flowering plant.
They have roots, stems, leaves, vascular tissue and flowers to help spread their seeds.
Finally the
Just one second.
They're what we call the insectivorous plants. The borderline between the plant and animal kingdoms.
Plants which are not dependent entirely on soil and sunlight for their food, but which sometimes eat live insects.
Well
Each stage, each adaption, each mutation is one step higher in the battle of the plant kingdom for survival.
Now what if
What if a plant were to take the next step?
What if there were a mutation that could developed intelligence?
The ability to protect itself?
Perhaps even to know who its enemies were and destroy them?
A plant like that could take over the world.
But it's not possible, it's fantastic!
I wonder
Lunch will be ready in a few moments.
Oh yes. Well, I'm awfully busy at the moment. Do you mind if I skip lunch today?
Oh, you've got the eat something. I'll get you some coffee and sandwiches.
Oh, thank you.
A brain.
I was right.
Darling, it's a lovely clay.
Why don't you go out and play?
It isn't any fun without Rusty.
Did you call the police?
We didn't know what to do. We thought it'd be better to call you first.
He was alone in the room?
- Yes, all the time.
I'm going to the lab to get my men down.
Carol
Carol, come away.
How are we going to get out?
There must be some way of destroying this.
There must be. I know it.
Get some newspapers.
There's one thing, which every intelligent thing is afraid of: the fire!
If a species ever develops that isn't, it could be the end of the world.
Open the door.
Should be alright now.
And that's going to happen to me?
Maybe to all of us.
But you need not despair.
The fifth card may show you how to avoid
What is it?
It does not matter.
What was it?
I was hoping it
.. it might not be
Oh for heaven's sake!
What is all this nonsense?
No nonsense, I assure you. Now is there anyone else who would wish to try?
Okay I'll have a I'll have a try.
The first time I've ever done this without chips.
Just tap the cards three times.
And now your future.
You are a musician?
Yes. A lot of people don't seem to think so.
Ah, that's more like it.
That's my mother in law.
Do not jest at the image of a God.
A God?
The powerful and malign God of Voodoo.
Hi, Wally. What's the good word?
You're going to love me.
Oh yeh. Purely, as a mother.
I've got a great booking for you.
Oh yeah, what have you got us this time? Siberia?
No. Days of sunshine and romance.
Nights under an azure sky.
Another holiday camp, right?
The West Indies, Island of Paiti, town of Dupont, Club called "The Flamingo".
Good?
Yeah, great. When do we go?
- Two weeks.
Hey, you little sweetheart.
We gonna go to the West Indies!

Biff Bailey.
What is this?
Oh, well, I was listening to your music, so I I wrote it down.
You wrote down the sacred music of the great God Dambala.
It could be a hit, make a fortune.
If you wrote it, we could go 50-50.
It belongs to the God Dambala.
Known only to his own people for centuries.
Oh, well, if it's that old, then it's out of copyright.
You get creases in my shirt.
The God Dambala is a jealous God. If you steal from him, he will be revenged.
Wherever you are, he will be revenged.
Do not steal from the God Dambala.
Now go.
Now when we get back to London,
I'm going to make a whole routine around that voodoo number.
Biff man, you be careful of that Voodoo God.

During his recent trip to the West Indies
Biff Bailey heard an ancient Voodoo tune.
Here it is, in his own special arrangement.
Told you!
My beautiful club
You're insured, aren't you?
Yeah. I could have the whole place redone Moroccan
Oh man, you don't play around with Voodoo.
What are you doing?
I want to change this arrangement, actually.
It wasn't too good in the middle, so
I'll take it home
Take it home? After what happened here?
What happened here?
Who d'you think sent that wind,
Kenny Ball? That was Voodoo, man.
I'd burn that music fast.
You're not still believing in this Voodoo stuff, are you?
No, man, but I play percentages.
I wouldn't take that home. Not after what happened here tonight.
No? I'll see you.
Well, more work for my uncle!
Got a match?
Oh, yeah yeah sure.
Here, you keep them.
- Thanks.
Which way to Piccadilly Circus, mac?
Yeh Yeh
Oh, these British are all nuts.
That'll teach me not to steal tunes.
Well, how do I get out of it?
Ours was the same?
What does it mean?
I'll tell you what it means.
Absolutely nothing.
What makes you so sure?
Foretelling the future with a pack of cards Complete rubbish.
Then why are you afraid to try them?
Afraid?
To participate in your ridiculous parlour game?
Very well. Very well. Shuffle your cards. Foretell my destiny.
Remarkable, really remarkable.
I don't think there's very much more that can be said about that particular atrocity.
Dear, dear, dear
Yes, atrocity is right.
Ah. What have we here?
Yes, indeed a work of notable incompetence, even for Mr. Eric Landor.
You don't like my work,
Mr. Marsh?
Ah, the great man himself.
One wonders why you come to my exhibitions so regularly if my work displeases you.
,I  9 f'  D
My paper pays me to attend these exhibitions, so attend them I must whether the artist in question is a genius or a charlatan.
And you consider yourself competent to judge?
I don't think my reputation as a critic has ever been called in doubt.
In that case, I wonder why you never give me advice on how to improve my work.
My clear sir, the only advice that I could possibly offer you, would be: give up.
A harsh thing to say to a man who's been painting all his life with some measure of success.
Success!
If we are discussing money, pray let's not delay any longer.
I was under the impression we were discussing art.
Take this masterpiece, for example.
Just what is it supposed to say?
It is merely a series of splodges of print applied without any creativity whatsoever.
What is it supposed to mean?
Nothing specific. The viewer is supposed to react to it.
To create his own meaning out of his own experience.
Everyone will see something quite different.
In other words: it means absolutely nothing.
To those who can't see.
But I can see, Mr. Landor.
I can see very well, when there is something worth seeing.
I live by my vision, Mr. Landor.
Mr. Marsh
We have a canvas in from a young artist we're thinking of exhibiting shortly.
I wonder if you'd mind telling us what you think of his work.
Well, it's highly irregular.
Oh please, please.
Oh very well, just this once.
Thank you.
Ah now, this is quite a different matter, quite a different matter indeed.
Clearly the work of a creative artist of considerable promise.
Notice the wide sweep of colour, the balance, the brushwork, together with a certain denial of the accepted standards, the mock critical humour of the entire composition. You could learn a great deal about painting from this artist, Mr. Landor.
Then I should very much like to meet him. Would that be possible?
He's here now as a matter of fact.
-Indeed?
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have as our guest of honour tonight the eminent author and art critic Mr. Franklyn Marsh.
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am extremely honoured to have been asked to address this fine organisation, which has done so much to foster an interest in the arts.
The world of art today
The world of art today
The day of the action painter is over.
Soon art will regain its sanity and return to the fundamental representational principals of
You were saying, Mr. Marsh
I must crave your indulgence.
I have a pressing appointment.
He's so fascinating on this subject.
Have they found out who the patient is yet, nurse?
Yes, Eric Landor, the artist.
Artist? Not anymore!
The European Space Research Organisation plans to ask the United States for permission to set up a satellite contacting station in Alaska.
In London the well-known artist Eric Landor was the victim of a hit and run driver.
Mr. Landor was taken to
St. Michael's Hospital.
He has not yet regained consciousness.
Fran k?
Oh, what's the matter? Why so jumpy?
Words don't seem to be coming very easy this day.
What you need is a drink.
What? No, no thank you very much. I want to get home.
Oh come on, just a quick one.
No, thank you very much, George,
I really must get on with this.
Oh alright.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Well, wherever you've been for the past few days, it's certainly improved your temper.
Don't tell me he actually liked a painting for once.
Well, I had a slight problem, but everything's alright now.
That calls for a celebration.
What are you going to have?
No, no, no, the drinks are on me. Hey miss, please.
The same again, will you please?
I heard you calling a round, Frank.
You know that's too good to miss.
Yes. Please, have anything you want, anything at all.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
Is he hurt bad?
- He'll live.
Yeah, but he'll be blind for the rest of his life. Poor guy.
Still there's lots of things a blind man can do.
A very pretty story. Thank you.
It is not all the story.
Then it's the same for all of us.
What do you mean?
Every time the cards have been asked how we could avoid the future, the answer is the same: death.
That's a bad word, man.
Well, let's see what the cards have to say about me.
You are sure you wish to know?
Deal the cards.
The Empress.
The Hermit.
The Star.
The Lovers.
Oh, why this?
It's an old American custom.

Welcome to Pemberton, the prettiest little town in New England.
I hope it likes me.
Honey, it could not help but like you.
You know, I was worried about coming with you to America.
You're going to get on just fine.
Are you hungry?
I'll go and see if there's something in the kitchen.
Eat.
You go and get acquainted with the house, okay?
Au!
Bob?
I I... I cut myself.
The can opener.
I'll wash it.
No, no.
Let me do it.
Okay. You can have the car.
Dr. Blake is going to come and pick me up anyway.
Who is Dr. Blake?
Dr. Blake? Dr. Blake is the only other doctor in town, and we work at the clinic together and he is gonna
That'll be him now.
Come on, honey. I know he wants to meet you.
Hi.
- Hi. Good morning.
Good morning. Doctor, this is my wife Nicolle. Dr. Blake.
Glad to know you. I hope you like our fair city.
I'm sure I will.
If there is anything I can ever do for you, don't hesitate to tell me.
Thank you.
All set?
It was nice meeting you.
Bye,honey.
Drive carefully, eh?
- I will.
Bye.
Well, as you say, it is a strange case. Sounds like anemia.
No, no. It's not the quality of the boy's blood that's wrong.
It's the quantity. I mean it's that there doesn't seem to be enough of it.
The boy's in here. Do you want to see him?
All right.
Johnny, this is Dr. Blake.
Hello.
- Hello, Johnny.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.
Dr. Blake just wants to have a look at you. Okay?
Has Johnny been eating his food?
YES.
Getting enough sleep, fresh air?
Well, he always sleeps with his window open.
Well, let's have a look.
When did he get these?
Just a few days ago. The clay he complained he was feeling weak.
All right. Thanks.
Eh, will you wait in the other room?
Come on, Johnny.
Would you come this way, please?
Yes, thank you.
Well, what do you think?
I don't know. I really don't know what to make of it.
What do you think?
I don't know. If these were medieval times,
I'd I'd almost say he was the victim of a vampire.
A vampire?
Yes, that's what Dr. Blake said.
Can you imagine in this day and age?
He took some blood samples from the boy though and we should know by tomorrow morning what it really is.
How will you know?
Well, he'll work some tests on it in the laboratory tonight.
He has a laboratory in the clinic?
No, no. He has got a workshop on top of the old Finch building.
He works there at night sometimes.
He's a real lonely guy.
You want some more steak, honey?
No, no.
Why didn’t it attack you then?
I figured that out later.
My arms made the sign of a cross as I raised them to shield myself.
But how could it know that I suspected?
Dr. Blake, your patient is ready.
Did he sleep with his window open last night?
That's not wrong, is it?
He must have fresh air.
No, no. It's not wrong. Leave it open.
Only tonight I want to be there in case anything happens.
Sweetheart?
R" (m "I I
Nicolle is my wife.
Do you know what a vampire is?
A spirit which takes up residence in a human body, conferring upon it the power to turn into a bat at night so that it can glut itself on the blood of innocent victims.
And if the victim dies, he becomes a vampire and after death rises from the grave and walks the earth in search of blood.
That would have happened to Johnny if he had died of Nicolle's bite.
It may happen to her next victim.
Tonight she will go in search of someone.
Watch her.
The only way to kill a vampire is to drive a wooden stake through its heart.
Watch her!
And when she returns
Nicolle
I love you.
A vampire?
It's true.
I never heard anything so crazy in all my life.
Look, Dr. Blake will confirm it when he gets here.
Confirm what?
That my wife was a vampire.
But that's nonsense.
There are no such things as vampires.
But you told me.
You gave me the stake.
She attacked you.
I don't know what you are talking about.
Nobody attacked me.
Well, tell them please.
Tell them!
Cuff him!
YEW I and
Ok, let's go.
Doctor, please.
Can we give you a lift, Doctor?
No, no thanks. I'll walk.
Okay.
This town isn't big enough for two doctors or two vampires.
Nicolle
Do you know someone by that name?
I met her on the continent.
I was thinking
Turn the next card, please.
Ave, ave, aye
There are five of us here and none of us has a future.
What about him?
- Yes, what about you?
All of us.
We're all together in this carriage and none of us has a future.
It's this train
- It's going to crash.
What are you doing?
- Pull the communication cord.
Don't you fool. For that way you might cause an accident. Sit down.
We can't just sit here and wait.
Why have you done this?
What do you want? Who are you?
Have you not guessed?
We're slowing down.
Is it Bradley? Can you see a sign?
I don't know.
Well, where else could it be?
We've reached the end of our journey.
No accidents. So much for Dr. Terror.
Dr. Schreck.
Two thousand years ago and more,
Julius Caesar came, saw and... conquered the land of the Gauls after a long and bitter struggle.
The resistance was led by Vercingetorige.
This valiant young leader... was forced to lay down his arms at the feet of Caesar. lt's an historical fact that Caesar had a lot of Gaul but he didn't have it all.
One little region held out.
A fortified village surrounded by the... entrenched Romans and it is in this village that we shall meet the hero... of our tale, the mighty warrior Asterix.
There he is now, about to go hunting for wild boar, their habit.
You'll be back soon Asterix ?
- Yes l'll be back in time for dinner.
Ah something tells me there are
Romans around here.
What hit me ?
- The Gaul keeper's key.
The occupation of Gaul as we see was no Roman holiday.
And one sweet morning the legion leader , Bonus Belonus, was meditating.
Hail Bonus Belonus !
The patrol is back.
Hail Patroleum, lets hear the report !
- Hail Bonus Belonus.
By Jupiter, how did you men get so badly beaten, were you outnumbered ?
Well, were we outnumbered ?
- Outnumbered ? l wouldn't say that.
There was a boy.
And he wasn't too big either.
By Jupiter there is a deep secret to the Gaelic strength.
Well Asterix, anything special happened ?
- Oh no, oh yes, l crowned four Romans.
That all ?
- Obelix, how would you like some boar ?
Oh sure, just got a couple of these to drop off.
Yum yum roast boars. l guess the Romans were furious.
They are going to attack us again you'll see.
Why worry as long as Panoramix can cook up his magic potion.
That reminds me this is my ration day, let's go see the old Druid.
Come along Obelix ?
- You know we mustn't waste food.
Hear that ! That's him cutting mistletoe with his golden sickle.
Panoramix, Druid ?
What's the matter Panoramix ?
- You scared me, you made me... cut my finger with my sickle.
- Sorry,l've come to get my potion.
Shhh, it's a secret, come with me !
With stirring motion l mix the potion that gives us our magic powers.
The magic potion that increases your strength a thousand fold.
Exactly what do you put into that potion, oh druid ?
The origin of the potion is lost in the darkness of the ages.
A Druid can only repeat the secret to another druid, all that l can tell you... is that it contains mistletoe and lobster, the lobster is not necessary... but it tastes good.
Can l have some too ?
- No Obelix, no no you know you can't !
You fell into the potion when you were just a baby and the effects... of the potion on you are permanent, you know that.
Why don't you try out the effects of the potion for us ?
Sure here l go. lt works, old druid it works.
Those poor poor Romans, how sorry l feel for them.
And now lets see what the Romans are up to.
And in spite of our siege, these Gauls go on defying us ! lf they are going to fight one against four it isn't fair !
We have to find out their secret .
- You're right Marcus Sufrus. l must have a volunteer, who will go and spy on the Gauls ?
With so many volunteers l 'll decide by playing musical chairs.
This game which has come to us down through the ages. lt was played with one chair less than there were legionnaires ... when the music stopped... lt's Caligolaminus ! lt's Caligolaminus ! lt's Caligolaminus !
No no l won't go
- Caesar will reward you Caligolaminus.
No not me !
Either you volunteer or l will feed you to the lions. lf you insist, l'll go.
- Make a Gaul out of Caligolaminus.
Meanwhile in the Gaelic village...
Men it's a long time now since we last heard from the Romans, that's a bad sign.
We must be vigilant and remember to get your ration of the potion.
Hooray for Tunabrix, our chief !
Hooray for Tunabrix, our chief !
Chief ! Chief !
- Yes Obelix ?
Panoramix won't give me any potion, that's not fair. Because l feel weak.
You weak ?
- Oh my oh my, here comes Stopthemusic ! l shall now sing a lay in honour of Gaelic courage !
Barbarians, they can't appreciate my art.
Caligolaminus is now ready !
- Good, lets go and see.
Put him in chains.
You're going for a stroll near the village of the Gauls, when the Gauls see you ... they'll rescue you, when you'll be within their gates, you'll learn their secret.
Now how do you like my plan ?
- Well just between us l don't understand.
Take him to the enemy.
- Take it easy, easy man easy ! l'm a real Roman, l'm a Roman, hey ! l'd like to get into a good fight.
- Yeah but don't count on it Asterix.
The Romans are staying close to their camp, they're tired of getting beat.
What's that ?
The sound of chains
Somebody's arriving, up the tree.
How long are we going to have to walk like this.
Shut up, you'll be the only one spared when the Gauls attack, don't forget !
Romans coming, they've got a Gaul.
- Let's save him ! l feel better.
Let's we wake them up and start again.
No come on, it's getting late.
- Come along little fellow.
Mission accomplished.
Well lets take off his chains.
- But you can't do it without tools.
Tools ? Who needs tools ?
Well who are you ?
- l'm Cali... Caligoliminix. l live in Lutetia.
But the Romans and Gauls live in peace there, don't they ?
Well in their eyes l appear so foxy, that they think l am a spy.
The Romans take you for a spy ?
Are they stupid ?
The heroic patrol, commanded by
Marcus Sufrus returns to the camp.
At HamsweetHam.
Oh hail, the Gauls came they saw and they freed Caligolaminus.
What a great victory for us ! l hope that Caligolaminus will come back to us in a single piece. l hope so for him otherwise l'll grind his pieces to pieces.
And throw him to the lions.
Poor Caligolaminus.
We're approaching the village, there you'll be safe. There's only us Gauls.
Oh great !
Asterix and Obelix they brought company !
- l wonder who it is.
You'll have to meet our chief, the great Tunabrix.
Where are the Romans ? Let me at them !
Where are the Romans ?
Here we are ! l bid you welcome brother and l hope you'll feel at home.
Well, thanks.
And now l shall carol a song of welcome.
Stroll around the village till supper.
- All right. l'll find out what sort of tools these Gauls use to work their metal.
Hey come on Obelix , that stone !
- Here it is, coming right up.
Gosh They really are strong !
There must be a secret to this power.
Hey Caligoliminix ! Supper's ready !
Roast boar.
- Roast boar ? ls there a secret to your super human strength ?
Yup, but we can't tell it.
Why don't you eat ? lt'll get cold otherwise.
Why can't you tell me what the secret is ?
- Because it's a secret. lt's not fair ! lf we Gauls can't share our secrets, what's the use ? lf l was as strong as you l could get past the Roman line and get back to my home.
What do you say ?
- Well l say lets finish his roast boar.
My relatives are probably worried.
- Well lets go and see the Druid.
Panoramix ! Panoramix !
What do you want now Asterix ?
Me, nothing, but our new friend want to know why we're so strong. lts absolutely out of the question.
But l have to get home to get back to work.
What do you work at ? l'm a guide, l guide for Lutetia by night. National tourism.
No ! No ! And No !
All right, l get it, you don't want me. l'll get to Lutetia anyway and if the Romans throw me to the lions... at each bite l'll say,
''You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
Oh Well, all right !
- Come back Caligoliminix !
Come back, Caligoliminix ! l'll show you the secret of our power, l'll even give you a portion of a potion. lt's a secret you can drink ?
- Go call the others Asterix. lt's a secret you can drink ?
- Go call the others Asterix.
Get your magic potion !
Come and get your potion !
Come and get your potion !
Magic ?
- Potion ?
Come and get your potion !
- Magic ?
Potion ?
- The magic potion ?
A portion of this potion, can give you the necessary strength to return... to Lutetia but the effects of it disappear quickly. lt tastes like vegetable soup.
- l can make it taste like other things... lamb barbecue, clam chowder, cheese omelette, steak and onions...
But l don't feel anything special.
- Why don't you try lifting up that rock ?
But l will never be able to.
Hey little fellow, you have to be careful anyway.
What are we going to do now ?
- Were going to dance.
Lets the dance now begin !
Take your places !
Step to the right !
Step to the left !
Left row forward, right row back !
Mark your places, reach your partner.
Pull your partners moustache !
Pull your partners moustache !
These are removable moustaches,
They are the latest style in Lutetia.
Your are no Gaul, you're a Roman spy.
Get the Roman ! lt's no use Asterix, remember he just drank the potion. lt's because of you that he escapes.
By my golden sickle, you are the one who insisted that l give him some.
Lets forget it, he didn't learn much and the effect will disappear soon.
Hail Bonus Belonus ! l've learnt the secret of the Gauls. lt's a magic potion.
Where is this potion ?
- Here here here !
Come along Caligolaminus, l want to see what effects this potion produces.
Fight them !
Fight them ! l said fight them !
- Him ? Fight us ? By Jupiter, he can't !
We'll make mincemeat out of them.
That's that !
Wonderful ! Trouble is we don't have the potion to study ! l suggest we cut him open just like a rabbit.
You just try it, come on you just try it.
Your idea isn't bad, but
Caligolaminus refused to cooperate.
Sure l refuse !
How long is the potion effective ?
How long ? l don't know.
All right, lift that rock.
There you are.
What a man ! Now don't move, when that rock gets too heavy for you ... it'll mean the effects of the potion have completely disappeared.
Much much later...
Well now, you don't feel quite so strong ?
- No not quite. lf l can find out what's in that potion, l can become emperor, Bonus Caesar.
We leave Bonus Belonus to his dreams and return to the Gauls. l'm going to gather mistletoe.
- Do you want me to come along ?
No Asterix, you stay here and protect the village, your strength is ... due to my potion but your intelligence was yours from the day you were born.
Anyhow l won't be very long.
All right.
You Roman nincompoops !
We've captured the Druid, Bonus Belonus.
- Bravo, Julius Octopus, as a reward... you can have a pass to go to Rome and see the circus.
Rome, l'm going to the circus !
Rome, l'm going to the circus !
Druid tell me your secret.
- The secret ? Not on your life.
This man must talk, get me the torturer.
We'll see if he'll talk or not.
Cough !
Come on druid ! We've been torturing you for hours and it hasn't helped. lt has helped me pass the time.
- Speak, l'll make you powerful and rich !
No !
You will have lots and lots of money.
No
The magical powers of this Druid are much too strong for me.
And he's so stubborn, a stubborn as a mule.
What's the matter Asterix ?
You look worried.
The Druid went to gather mistletoe and he hasn't come back. l'm going to go and find him.
- Be careful Asterix !
You had your potion a long time ago.
- Well l'll just have to trust my brain.
Panoramix !
Druid, where are you ?
Panoramix !
Panoramix !
Panoramix !
Don't worry, don't sell your oxen.
- Then what ?
Just sell your cart .
- What ?
Just sell your cart and go home with your oxen.
What a brilliant idea that is !
Stop, stop enough !
Tell me, have you seen a Druid gathering mistletoe ?
No but l did see one being carried in a net, a group of legionnaires.
They were taking him to HamSweetham.
What ? You take me to Hamsweetham.
- But that is a way out of my way !
Hamsweetham is the biggest market around and it has a great used cart park.
How lucky for me to have met you,
Hamsweetham, here we come.
Why are you hiding ?
- To play a joke on my Roman pals.
That's great, l love jokes.
This jackass should get the laurel wreath for stupidity.
What are you carrying in your cart ?
- Nothing.
By Jupiter, are you laughing at me ?
What is going on here Cracsus Daris ?
This sap is laughing at me, l'll have to check his cart.
Let him enter, l know him he's not dangerous.
That idiot had almost got me caught.
Here we are in camp, are you going to play your joke now ? lt's dark, ln the morning it'll be funnier.
- Oh sure.
Goodnight... l better start looking for the
Druid, lets start there.
Lie down and dine, oh Marcus, my loyal right-hand. We must talk.
Thank you Oh gracious Bonus.
We must get the secret recipe the
Druid has for the potion, understand ?
And when we do we shall march on Rome and take the place of Caesar.
Julius Caesar ?
Right friend, Jules, and the two of us will form a powerful triumvirate. l have need of him now but later in Rome, l'll be the triumphant. l'll have him eaten by a lion in Rome, l shall become Caesar, just me, all alone.
This is very interesting but it doesn't help me find Panoramix the Druid.
Oh he's certainly being guarded in that tent. l beg your pardon, l've come to free Panoramix, my friend.
Don't let him get out, he's an unconquerable Gaul. l'll go get some help.
- Sure go.
Asterix !
- How are you ?
Have you gone mad ? Why did you come here you've walked into the lions den.
Chief ! Chief !
These asses can't do a thing against my magical powers. l know that, lets have some fun, with them, l 've got a few ideas.
Chief ! Chief !
Oh Bonus Belonus
- What now ?
We've captured a Gal, G, Gaul in the t, tent of the D, D Druid.
We need reinforcements or the prisoner is sure to get away.
By the great Jupiter, sound off the alarm !
Surrender, you Gauls, if not l'll order my brave legionaries to attack you. l hope he surrenders.
The suspense is killing me. l toss my weapon at your feet as
Vercingetorige, my chief, tossed his ... at Caesar's feet, come on, l'm surrendering. l've got no time to waste !
Seize that Gaul or l'll have you all fed to the lions.
Lions ?
- Fed to the lions he said !
- And he means it too.
Hey what's happening ?
The camps been invaded by a Gaul.
- Well that's not fair, he might have waited will l woke up to begin his joke.
He doesn't play fair, it's not nice !
So you refuse to speak, do you Druid ?
But tomorrow on the torture rack ... your friend may be a bit more gracious !
They've no idea how loquacious l'll be. l'll break the record for loquacit
Shh they're coming !
Bonus Belonus wants to see you.
You, do you know the secret of the magic potion ?
Me ? No !
- For the last time Druid... give me the recipe for the magic potion or l'll have your friend tortured.
You can't scare me Roman.
- l trust in the courage of my friend.
Well, we shall see, l want this Gaul tied to that table, and go get the torturer.
Here l am, you know my motto, always ready.
Pity please, don't hurt me, l can't take anymore !
Enough, l can't see him suffer like this, l'll tell you all.
Torturer, desist !
But chief l didn't even get started.
Oh pity please, pity please !
OK druid, let me in on the secret, if not l'll have him finish the job. l'll prepare the potion in front of you but l need a number of ingredients... that l can only find in the forest.
- What scared-i cats these Gauls are !
You will have what you need, go with him l will hold the other Gaul as a hostage. l'll need mistletoe... herbs and a few roots, and some flowers.
The Druid is back.
- Now he wants a big pot.
Then give him one !
Just a pinch of salt, a tiny touch of pepper and let it bubble.
Bubble ? Bubble oh make it bubble fast.
- Something is lacking.
An ingredient that is important,
- What ? What ? What ?
Strawberries.
- Strawberries at this season ?
Of course it won't be that easy, we could wait until the right season.
No, send out our fastest messengers, l want strawberries, strawberries !
Strawberries, strawberries !
Asterix, you get good ideas.
- You are the one who thought of ... sending them strawberry picking, while we lounge at Caesar's expense.
The messengers have been gone for days, not a single one has returned.
The messengers have come back !
- That's fine.
Hail Bonus Belonus.
- Hail my legionaries, did you find them ?
No, no sir !
- No strawberries Bonus.
- And we lost Julius Octopus.
Here l am Bonus Belonus, look l found the strawberry, l ran into a route... merchant just back from Greece, l had to pay their weight in gold !
That's good, you shall have a reward, l grant you a pass to Rome and you've... my permission to go to the circus.
- l'm going to the circus !
Druid, here are the strawberries you needed for your magic potion.
What do you think of them Asterix ?
- l'm not sure they are of fine quality.
Could be worse. l've changed my opinion they are excellent.
Yes, just what l needed for my potion, send for another basket. l've had about enough, you're driving me mad, you're not being fair.
All right, all right, take it easy, don't cry l'll prepare your potion.
Stop crying, he'll prepare it.
- Sure, l'll make it without strawberries.
Of course it won't be as sweet.
- Anyhow strawberries ... can give you a rash. lt's ready, it's best to serve it hot.
- l'll be first.
Where is the proof that your potion is not a poison, by Jupiter ? l'll be happy to taste it first if you are afraid.
No, if this potion is the real one it will increase your power ... and you will become invincible. l want a volunteer ! l said l am calling for a volunteer.
Oh Bonus Belonus, don't risk the life of a legionnaire, try the potion ... on some ordinary person for the experiment.
Good idea !
You come over here, friend.
- Who me ?
Are you well, my good friend ?
- No l am not, l was told l could sell ... my cart but no one wants to buy it, and it is all his fault ! l don't quite get what you mean but for consolation you may have some of this.
No thanks, l don't drink.
Drink it !
Why are you looking at me ? Didn't you ever see a cart dealer taking a drink ?
After drinking this potion, you are the worlds strongest man.
Me ?
You're so funny, he's a big joker.
We'll find that out, punch somebody !
- But l'm not mad at anybody.
A volunteer for a good wallop ! l would like a bit more enthusiasm when l call for a volunteer.
Me, l'll volunteer.
- You, that's an idea By Jupiter.
Go on !
- Go ahead hit him !
Go on, hit him !
- Hit him, you fool !
By Jupiter, its absolutely marvellous.
Did it hurt much ?
- l thought the sky dropped on my head.
Well you don't need me anymore so, l guess l'll go.
That potion is simply, that is its magic.
Forward, come and get your magic potion.
The road to Rome lies before us, oh Marcus, Caesar's days are numbered.
You Druid, you write down the recipe of the magic potion.
They will be cooked once it is in our possession, that will teach them a lesson.
A good idea yes.
Let us tryout our great new strength. l'm trying to over do it. l'll try that boulder.
A smaller one. l'm strong, l am a superman !
What great power !
- Yes ?
Bonus Belonus ?
- Yes ?
There is no powers in lifting that little stone.
You're right !
So you tricked me you Gauls, this potion is not magic.
Yes it is !
Oh Bonus Belonus, lets settle the hash of these Gauls.
How dare you appear before me without shaving ?
A good legionnaire should be clean shaven !
You are right but a legionnaire leader should set an example.
But, what, what is gong on ?
- Look at them !
What's happening here Druid ?
- lt's an old formulae for a hair growing... lotion, an extremely powerful one, the hair on you heads and on your face... will grow and grow with the fastest pace. l will have you killed.
Give me the anti-dote for this. lf you kill us who will make the antidote for you ? We are a little bit tired today.
- Yes, we are going to retire to our tent.
Hey you two ! Wait, hey !
What's wrong oh Bonus Belonus ? l caught my foot in my beard, imbecile ! l am at the mercy of these Gauls, l'll have to bargain with them.
Three thousand and seventy five.
- What ? lt's a new game we invented, one who sees a beard gets 15 points, 10 000 wins.
You've got your goal, you Gaul, well what do you want ?
Promise not to split hairs about it ?
- Don't you mention hairs again, you hear ?
That's for the beards.
- No wait, please.
All right but don't get in my hair again.
Oh to be exact to a hair we'll listen !
All right, l give up, just give me the antidote and l'll let you go free.
Well you see l don't feel very much feel like working now.
He gets a hand for being hair brained.
You wouldn't think he's just had a close shave.
All right, all right don't get so upset, l'll do it. l'll have to go out again and... get all the ingredients in the forest.
Yes but with an escort.
Why did you accept so fast, he's up to no good.
The effects of the potion l laid down aren't going to last very long.
Tomorrow there won't be any beards, so we had better try to get out of here.
As soon as l'm rid of this long hair and this beard, l'll murder those Gauls. lt will give me a riotous satisfaction.
We have come to escort you to the forest to gather the ingredients for the potion. l have a plan.
- That's great, we've got a million idea.
You will keep off my beard.
Keep your beard off from under my feet.
Come on hurry, our beards keep growing. l think that now l have got pretty much what is necessary. lt's only us.
- That's fine, well get to work. l've been working all morning, l hope l will be able to take a rest sometime.
Where are you going ?
- Can l see him prepare the anti -dote ?
No, better not, you would hinder us, you are too nervous.
You guards, watch this tent, see to it they don't escape.
Well that's good, you see Asterix, in the small pot l have prepared ... our real magic potion, l think we will need your muscles if we are to get out ... of here and here in the big pot l have prepared the anti dote. water, salt, vegetables and a marrow bone, since we have to taste it in front... of the Romans l thought you would like something good.
The magic potion is ready, might as well take a good portion.
All right now call our bearded hosts.
Hey Romans, soups on !
You bring that pot out here.
- All right, all right.
You taste it first. ls it good ?
- lt's fine but l like it with more salt. lt's your turn Bonus Belonus.
How can we really be sure that this potion keeps the hair from growing longer ?
You really are clever, watch my moustache you will see, it has stopped growing.
By Jupiter, it is true, drink men.
They swim like swine.
- Yes.
Now my guards, seize those two Gauls.
- The pleasure is mine.
Not by the hair of your chinny chin chin.
Let me go, please let me go, help me.
Run, we'll leave while they are picking up the pieces. l was just starting to have some fun.
- Halt you, get back in there.
Romans !
More Romans !
Many more !
More there ! We are surrounded.
Reinforcements, they got here just in time, what luck. lt's not so good.
Now l've got you Gauls, l'll have you eaten by the lions.
Oh Bonus Belonus, you are awaited in your tent, it's urgent.
Urgent ?
- Yes urgent.
Who's cloak is this littering my tent ?
Remnant of Caesar, that which is Caesar.
Julius Caesar ?
- ln person. l have come to find out what you are been doing about he Gauls.
And I want to know what has been going on here to keep your garrison... from receiving me with all due honour.
Well you see, l mean, we have been fighting what l mean is with some Gauls.
Fighting with Gauls ? How many Gauls ?
- Two.
By Cleopatra, show me the two man who are capable of standing up against... a garrison of my legionaries.
Well so there are the terrible Gauls ?
Tell me just what happened here ?
Caesar, Bonus Belonus was trying to steal our magic potion so he... would be invincible. He intended to become emperor.
Well, well
- Oh well, let me explain...
You need not bother, and go and shave will you ? You and your men will be... leaving for Mongolia, there're other barbarians there who tried to oust me.
But l could explain everything.
- And as for you, in exchange for the services you have rendered l shall... allow you your liberty, but we will meet before long, Gauls. l'll count on that Caesar.
By the Gods here they are.
Hooray Panoramix, Hooray Tunabricks our chief hooray Asterix,
Let us rejoice because our brothers have reached a decisive new victory.
Hooray for Tunabricks our chief.
Let the festivities start.
Under a star studded sky, the little fortified village of brave Gauls celebrated one more victory. Obtained through the protection of their Gods. lntelligence, magic and courage, they knew the future would bring them ... further victories over the Roman legions.

{275}{358}About two thousand years ago|in the time of Cleopatra, queen of Egypt...
{361}{463}The Egyptians talked like this:
{1388}{1468}This language was rather|difficult to understand.
{1471}{1566}So the film you are about to see has|been dubbed into English. However ...
{1569}{1663}due to the fact that dubbing techniques|had not been perfected in this period ...
{1666}{1765}you may notice that the movement of|lips is not always synchronised exactly ...
{1767}{1866}with the words being spoken.
{1873}{2021}And now after this|interesting and instructive prologue, ...
{8782}{8881}...and as for the saying that we Egyptians,|who are the descended from the great...
{8883}{8984}Gods, have built things proudly...|Well it's a disgrace, it's a shame, ...
{8986}{9110}it's absurd, ridiculous and its just|plain silly and there's nothing else ...
{9113}{9261}to add unless it's to say that your|stable is infamous, oh Caesar!
{9275}{9353}But you really do have to face the facts|oh Queen, that Egypt is decadent.
{9362}{9469}My people have built the pyramids, the|tower of Souls and the temples, the Obelix!
{9473}{9612}A long time ago I might add.|- Enough!
{9495}{9594}I Cleopatra, will prove my people aren't|decadent! In exactly three months ...
{9596}{9695}I will have a magnificent palace built|for you, here in Alexandria.
{9705}{9802}Very well then.|If you win your bet I will admit the ...
{9805}{9904}Egyptian people are still powerful.
{9961}{10093}She's a nice girl but her nose is easily|put out of joint, it's a pretty nose too.
{10280}{10367}Edephus! I have summoned you because|you're the best architect in Alexandria, ...
{10370}{10447}not that that is saying very much,|your building crumble.
{10450}{10528}They are the laughing stock for those|that don't live in them.
{10531}{10663}Well you see, actually what I like|to build is pyramids.
{10666}{10753}Silence! you have three months to|make good, you are to build a ...
{10756}{10828}magnificent palace here in|Alexandria for Julius Caesar.
{10833}{10932}What three months?|- If you succeed I'll cover you ...
{10934}{11031}with gold, if not, I will have you|thrown to the crocodiles. Go!
{11034}{11157}Three months! Well I need someone|who can work magic to help me do that.
{11185}{11333}A magician, oh I got it,|I know the very man!
{12090}{12196}I'm training him to carry the menhirs|- In the meantime what about a boar?
{12764}{12885}Where do I find the Druid, Getafix?|- Up that tree, under the mistletoe.
{12892}{12989}Getafix!
{13005}{13102}What a pleasant surprise!
{13290}{13410}Meet my dear old friend Edephus, he's an|Architect from Alexandria.
{13449}{13579}Well I've been told to build a palace|for Caesar within three months, and ...
{13582}{13712}if I don't, Cleopatra will throw me|to the crocodiles.
{13715}{13791}Are crocodiles good to eat Asterix?|- Be quiet!
{13794}{13907}And if you won't help me,|I'll never get it done.
{13910}{14028}Now you mustn't cry Edephus,|I'm coming back to Egypt with you.
{14126}{14196}By yourself? Do you mean it?
{14200}{14274}We're off on a long sea voyage Dogmatix.|- You're not going to take him along!
{14276}{14353}Why not mister Asterix?|- Because he's far too small for such ...
{14356}{14440}a long journey Mr. Obelix,|so you go and pack.
{14444}{14570}Oh sure, I'm just an extra to fill in,|non one ever listens to me.
{14614}{14737}My friends, the best of luck to you and I|hope the sky never falls on your heads.
{14795}{14871}I will now sing a for you a|little farewell tune.
{14875}{14948}Oh no!
{15080}{15154}Philistine!
{15461}{15566}That was me barking, woof woof.|Can't I even bark now?
{15573}{15670}All right you idiot, let Dogmatix|out of the bag.
{15986}{16109}Weight anchor now, send the bags up|- Hoist the bags up
{16381}{16504}In Egypt we'll have to contend|with a lot of difficulties and ...
{16507}{16606}there's always the danger|of meeting pirates.
{16619}{16705}We'll look after the pirates, won't we?|- Oh sure.
{16736}{16810}Ship to starboard!
{16944}{17062}The pirates! The pirates!
{17419}{17567}Yoohoo, yoohoo wait for us|we are coming, yoohoo!
{17786}{17909}Right then me hearties, don't loose your|nerve. We'll comer them, we'll cut ...
{17912}{18035}their throats, we'll have their guts, we|will throw them in, sink the lot of them.
{18083}{18191}Same old drill as usual, wait till a I|give the word then board them.
{18194}{18342}Come on board them!|- Did you say board us?
{18980}{19041}I'll be right with you.
{19209}{19279}I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
{19310}{19358}That's not fair.
{19362}{19410}Did you say board us?
{19732}{19786}Did you say board us?
{20155}{20202}Obelix, come on.
{20337}{20411}Come on let's go.|- Right Asterix, but there's still one ...
{20414}{20562}pirate left up there!|- No, no!
{20739}{20862}You say board us?|-Same old drill as usual boy!
{20957}{21056}And one fine night after a long calm|voyage, unbroken by further incident ...
{21058}{21181}the ship approaches the end|of its peaceful voyage.
{21213}{21286}What's that light on the horizon?
{21292}{21389}That's the tower of Pharaoh, it guides|ship into the harbour, ...
{21391}{21453}we'll be in Alexandria tomorrow.
{21459}{21570}A tower for guiding ships in?|They're crazy these Egyptians.
{22228}{22353}Cleopatra' s bath!|- Queen Cleopatra's bath!
{22405}{22478}Queen Cleopatra's bath!
{22924}{23062}Bring Cleopatra's soap!|- Bring Cleopatra's soap!
{23065}{23177}Bring Cleopatra's soap!
{23760}{23894}Bring Cleopatra's lion!|- Bring Cleopatra's lion!
{23897}{23952}Bring Cleopatra's lion!
{26678}{26801}Oh my Queen, this are my friends from|Gaul, a powerful magician and ...
{26804}{26907}two brave warriors, who have|come to help me in my task.
{26911}{26971}Well get going, you really|don't have much time.
{27027}{27170}If you succeed there will be gold for all,|if not you'll be thrown to the crocodiles.
{27175}{27274}And by the way, I warn you that your rival|Ardefus isn't please that I chose you ...
{27276}{27386}and not him to build the palace and he's|jealous. If you want to know what I think ...
{27389}{27481}he'd love to see you wind up inside...|- A Crocodile
{27486}{27552}That is right. Now go!
{27557}{27646}She's bad tempered but what a pretty nose.|- Yes very pretty.
{27651}{27721}Now I'll take you to my place.
{27783}{27906}That's my work there.|I designed that one too.
{27942}{28025}And that is another one of mine.
{28189}{28263}That was one mine too.
{28330}{28408}And this is my house.|- I might have guessed it.
{28630}{28766}The door is jammed, it's the dampness.|- I'll just give you a little hand.
{28770}{28816}No Obelix!
{28887}{28953}Oh don't scold him the|wood is still too dry.
{29005}{29079}Welcome to my house.
{29438}{29512}Come this way please.
{29514}{29573}Coming Obelix.
{30223}{30271}And this is where I work.
{30321}{30440}Master, the architect Ardefus|demand to see you.
{30444}{30567}My rival, show him in.|- I'll come straight to the point, ...
{30570}{30693}let us build Caesar's palace together.|If we succeed then we divide the gold ...
{30696}{30844}between us, if not, you can be food for|the crocodiles by yourself, after all ...
{30847}{30995}there wouldn't be any need to give|them two when one will do nicely.
{30998}{31121}I refuse, you are a cruel, two-faced|schemer that's what you are.
{31127}{31275}Now get out of my home!|-You'll be sorry for this, you wait, ...
{31279}{31427}and I'll see you later in an alligator!
{31790}{31879}I'll take you to the building site.|- Yes do Edephus, It should be ...
{31882}{31956}interesting to see where you work.
{31962}{32026}Dogmatix!
{33036}{33148}Are they slaves?|- Oh no, those are free workers.
{33152}{33220}They are crazy these Egyptians.
{33824}{33921}This is lunch hour, come and see the|plans for the palace.
{33924}{33996}Why aren't those two stopping?|- They are getting a little overtime.
{34065}{34211}Here are the plans, I designed them.|- I recognise your style.
{34620}{34743}Good people, don't let that wretched|architect Edephus exploit you.
{34746}{34869}You have eaten too much and|you are paid too little, stop work now!
{34872}{34995}Take action against such as|exploiter, leave him in the lurch.
{34998}{35099}Go on strike, go back home!
{35708}{35818}Master the workers have just told me|that they refuse to do any more work.
{35821}{35910}Someone is stirring them up against me.|- But who?
{35913}{35996}Yes, who?|- Ardefus, your rival of course.
{35999}{36146}All this worry makes me feel ill, when the|crocodiles get me, I'll be uneatable!
{36149}{36299}You're eager to make them a good meal.|- Of course, they are sacred crocodiles!
{36299}{36361}After all, they are crazy,|these architects!
{36365}{36464}Let's see what is going on.
{36487}{36569}We refuse to go on working under|this condition, the work is too hard.
{36574}{36629}Right!
{36640}{36786}They don't want to go on working.
{36791}{36877}The work is too hard.
{36884}{36985}Asterix light me a good fire|under that cauldron.
{37241}{37387}No, not for you. You fell in the potion|when you were a baby.
{37391}{37482}Give them a little|demonstration Asterix.
{38285}{38408}It works like a charm.|- Of course, bring your men along, ...
{38411}{38528}a little portion of this magic potion|will do the trick.
{38829}{38902}No!
{39079}{39152}No!
{39225}{39298}No!
{39434}{39538}No!|- How does he manage to recognise me?
{41063}{41186}I must do something and fast. Crewcut!
{41191}{41323}Yes, oh Ardefus my master|- I know that Edephus's expecting stone ...
{41325}{41473}to come down the Nile from the south,|that stone must never arrive.
{41480}{41567}Here is gold, Crewcut for you|to settle this business.
{41574}{41675}I hear you and obey you and|Ardefus my master.
{41937}{42077}Take this gold and make sure that the|stone doesn't reach its destination.
{42081}{42182}Done by Osiris.|Thrown this stones overboard.
{43073}{43188}There's non stone left.|- This is Ardefus's doing.
{43205}{43328}No more stone, no palace,|no palace, the crocodiles!
{43336}{43397}Calm down, we'll get your stone for you.
{43401}{43477}Don't worry, we'll get it back|as soon as we can.
{43481}{43574}I hope, but we've only a month's|time left to finish the palace.
{43578}{43716}They must never come back from their|journey alive. I'm counting on you.
{43721}{43791}They won't ever arrive, oh master.
{43875}{43948}{Y:i}This is slow, too slow
{43959}{44036}Move all the ships to the back and|fasten them together with rope.
{44040}{44092}That's what I like, a little exercise.
{44335}{44416}I must say the boy never|fails to surprise me.
{44873}{44996}There's no much beer or boars here.|- You have to eat what is put before you.
{45143}{45266}Beer for Asterix!
{45839}{45938}Boars and beer for Obelix!
{46697}{46796}Bones for Dogmatix!
{49736}{49859}Look here, I've got one hump,|I'm a dromedary, not a camel!
{49862}{49966}Honest I ask you!
{50679}{50828}Tomorrow we shall go and see the Sphinx|and the pyramids, they are worth a visit.
{50897}{50945}What do you think of that?
{51050}{51198}Dogmatix, Dogmatix, come here!|Come here Dogmatix!
{51205}{51294}Dogmatix, you leave her alone Dogmatix!
{51450}{51549}There must be a great view|from up there
{51565}{51626}Dogmatix, you wait here.
{51917}{51992}Obelix!|- Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{52155}{52226}We'd better get out of here, come on.
{52878}{53017}From the top of these pyramids here,|twenty centuries look down on you.
{53137}{53244}There must be a great view from up there.|- Obelix you stay here.
{53247}{53357}Oh pyramids, give me a menhir any day.|- Can't you forget Stonehenge?
{53364}{53490}I wonder if they would let us visit them.|- Yes of course, of course, I'm a guide ...
{53500}{53648}and I can take you noble foreigner|tourist for a visit inside the pyramids.
{53682}{53755}In that case we accept with pleasure.
{53810}{53888}Follow the guide.
{53901}{54000}This is no place for a nice little dog,|wait for me here, Dogmatix, ...
{54005}{54125}and if you're good|you'll get a nice bone.
{54428}{54520}Absolutely fascinating, these pyramids.
{55048}{55147}Dark blue sky told me, noble strangers,|without me you would never get out ...
{55149}{55275}of this labyrinth alive.
{55338}{55486}Come along in here, this room boasts|some magnificent hieroglyphics.
{55566}{55689}You will never get out of here|noble strangers.
{55692}{55811}This room will be you tomb.
{55913}{56012}Very interesting these old carvings.|- Yes, but our first concern is to find ...
{56014}{56068}our way out of here.
{56071}{56135}Non of this would never|have happened inside a menhir.
{56139}{56262}All things considered, Obelix for the|very first time, I'm going to give you ...
{56265}{56413}some of the magic potion.
{56491}{56639}Honest? I'm going to have some magic|potion! La la la!
{56883}{57031}I'm glad I came inside this pyramid.|- Obelix, after you.
{57083}{57156}Can I have a little bit more?
{57429}{57477}Well are you coming?
{57614}{57737}Very interesting, these mazes.
{57786}{57872}How about that door there?|- Can I have a little bit more?
{57876}{57975}No Obelix! No!|- It's just isn't fair! I hardly had time
{57977}{58076}to taste it and now he won't give me|any more, it's not fair!
{58325}{58412}I'm afraid that guide was right, it's|just possible we won't get out alive.
{58498}{58607}I'm sorry for poor Edephus, without us|he won't have his palace finished in time.
{58611}{58734}{Y:i}I'm sorry for Dogmatix that's outside!|- Dogmatix!
{58813}{58952}Dogmatix has tracked us down here thanks|to his nose, so he can find the way out.
{59033}{59114}You'll get two big bones.
{59322}{59395}You'll get lots and lots of bones.
{59519}{59621}Sometimes I think he understands|everything I say to him.
{59625}{59658}Follow the guide.
{60084}{60207}It's magic! You're all wizards.
{60461}{60584}It's magic, they're all magician, they|managed to get out of the Great Pyramid.
{60623}{60722}Those Gauls are really fantastic,|even so they still haven't reached ...
{60724}{60823}Alexandria, they still have to get back|up the Nile, we must stop them somehow.
{60928}{61051}I know just the men you need master.|It's a bold gang of pirates who lost ...
{61054}{61153}their ship on high seas|when they got on the wrong tack.
{61156}{61253}Send them to me.|- They are here master!
{61316}{61439}I'll give you a boat and you will sail|this boat down the Nile. Somewhere ...
{61442}{61565}you'll meet a fleet of ships carrying,|stone if those ships fail to reach ...
{61568}{61716}Alexandria, you will get gold,|lots of gold! Now look you, you board ...
{61723}{61871}them, cut their throats, have their guts|you do them in and then sink them.
{61893}{62006}Same old drill as usual boy.
{62254}{62391}These cruises are such a bore.|I'm bored Asterix!
{62469}{62553}I have the impression that there's|going to be some fun soon, Obelix.
{62557}{62669}There's a fleet of ships carrying|stone dead head.
{62674}{62756}Right then me hearties,|don't loose your nerve.
{62759}{62840}It's full of Gauls! Full of Gauls!
{62842}{62970}Full of Gauls? Full speed astern|let's get out of here, about turn!
{63063}{63162}Obelix, here's something to help you|pass the time, there are pirates up head.
{63167}{63266}Real pirates? Oh goodies, goodies.
{63391}{63521}Yoohoo wait for me!
{63525}{63648}Faster boys, faster!
{63996}{64078}Well I think we can get on|with our journey now Obelix.
{64082}{64203}Ah a bite, I'm not eating that fish.
{64382}{64523}Well, we are on the wrong tack again.
{64537}{64646}You know they are beginning to get me|down a little those Gauls.
{64680}{64828}Very well, if that's how it is,|I have an idea, a great idea.
{64832}{64980}You have an idea master?|- Right, a piece of cake, follow me.
{65204}{65352}Pestilential pastry. poisonous pancake.
{65355}{65416}Yes!|-Murderous bangers!
{65420}{65475}Not bad.|- Viper's venom topped with cream
{65478}{65550}Good!|- Cyanide custard pie.
{65553}{65652}Great!|- Special ice arsenic.
{65654}{65720}Oh yes!
{68829}{68943}A present for you oh Queen!|- Bring it in.
{69077}{69186}The three Gauls sent this cake as a gift|to the Queen of the Queens.
{69190}{69335}How sweet of them, you may thank them|in the name of Cleopatra.
{69342}{69393}My taster, send for my taster.
{69396}{69460}Coming! Coming!
{69467}{69577}Taste, tester.|- With pleasure my Queen.
{69716}{69864}Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{69902}{69976}Finally my friends,|you are back at last.
{69987}{70088}And we bought you plenty of stone|enough for you to finish the palace.
{70106}{70180}Gauls, I arrest you|in the name of the Queen!
{70184}{70283}Shall I smash them one?|- No, Obelix you can't, let us see ...
{70285}{70345}what is going to happen next.
{70373}{70489}Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
{70501}{70591}Gauls you were trying to poison me|with that cake, weren't you?
{70594}{70666}Cake? What cake Queen?|- Throw them into the dungeon ...
{70669}{70737}until I have decided on their fate.
{70767}{70890}There's not a moment to loose,|lets drink this antidote.
{70907}{71006}This potion will neutralise|the effects of the poison.
{71011}{71145}They are just giving the royal|crocodiles their appetisers.
{71148}{71232}Step aside, we are coming out!
{71829}{71932}May we come in?|- Guards, guards seize those three men.
{71985}{72133}Gauls from far, sworn to destroy my power,|I shall show you how a Queen can die.
{72136}{72284}Now is the fatal hour, see how a Queen|can die, here I come, Osiris!
{72302}{72352}Gosh, she's a good actress.
{72356}{72435}No, no, calm down, we simply want to|know what we're being charged with?
{72439}{72509}What you're charged with? With that!
{72512}{72652}Looks like a very good cake.|- Obelix, will you find me a cake knife?
{72667}{72790}May I?|Now cut three pieces of this cake.
{72957}{73008}Three pieces I said!
{73012}{73103}That's right, three!|- Greedy pig!
{73283}{73407}I call that an excellent cake, my Queen,|what was so special about it?
{73413}{73537}Just ask my taster.|- Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{73547}{73695}Ah lets see, he's just got a little touch|of indigestion, that's all it is.
{73786}{73934}Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!|That's much better I'm hungry!
{73940}{74063}I've treated you unjustly, Oh Gauls,|I will set you all free, you may go!
{74070}{74169}Someone must have|wanted to hurt us.
{74171}{74237}Yes but who?|- Ardefus.
{74241}{74302}You mean Edephus's rival?|- Who else?
{74305}{74394}Suppose we pay him a little visit.|- That's just what I was going to suggest.
{74427}{74504}Where does Ardefus live please?|- Ardefus? That way!
{74511}{74600}Here is to our victory Crewcut.
{74603}{74696}The time has come for us to drink|to success.
{76147}{76295}Since you wanted to work on the palace,|we are going to give you your chance.
{76482}{76610}The construction of the palace is going|well, You will have it finished on time.
{76621}{76680}Cleopatra is going to be very pleased.
{76684}{76781}Very pleased. The palace is nearly built|Caesar and you know I think I'm ...
{76784}{76844}going to win that bet Julius.
{76847}{76927}Delighted to hear it, oh my Queen,|simply delighted.
{76980}{77103}I'm shall loose face with Cleopatra.|i was told that her architect Edephus ...
{77106}{77209}was only a nit wit, something odd|is going on here, go and find my spy.
{77311}{77398}Here I am. Here I am.|- Come nearer.
{77402}{77485}Go and see what's going on in|Edephus building site.
{77488}{77583}I want to know why the work|is getting on so fast.
{77592}{77722}Quite a job, hey.
{79197}{79322}Three Gauls? An old druid,|a cunning little one and a fat oaf?
{79328}{79476}Asterix, Obelix and Getafix, those three|men can perform any kind of miracle.
{79487}{79561}I must act now!
{79565}{79674}Send for my Egyptian|mercenaries and quick!
{79757}{79905}Hail Caesar, those that are to serve you|at reduced rates, salute you.
{79951}{80091}You 're to get onto Edephus's building|site, without anyone seeing. Then you ...
{80095}{80243}are to knock over the cauldron of magic|potion, and you're to get hold of that ...
{80246}{80388}Gaulish druid, a bag of gold if you are|successful. Get moving, by Jupiter!
{80392}{80540}We are moving oh Caesar, by Osiris.
{80953}{81061}I'll see about that cauldron, you two|take care of the druid.
{81071}{81154}We get it brother!|- Okay brother!
{81265}{81413}If that potion is all that it's supposed to|be, I won't be sharing that bag of gold.
{82015}{82133}Hey look at that, who are you and where|is our druid Getafix gone?
{82233}{82328}Julius Caesar sent us to capture your|famous druid.
{82335}{82444}But our big brother has double-crossed|us to get all the reward for himself.
{82449}{82597}Without the magic potion, without Getafix|we are lost, the sacred crocodiles will...
{82620}{82754}Lets go and get our druids back.|- All right Asterix.
{82809}{82935}Dogmatix I'm leaving you here to|guard the building site, watch out.
{83077}{83195}One of the mercenaries is back, Caesar!|- Send him in.
{83214}{83292}Mission accomplished oh Caesar!
{83295}{83441}You have deserved well Caesar mercenary|here is the reward I promised you.
{83445}{83575}Have this troublesome druid locked up,|I want him thrown into the dungeon.
{83617}{83765}I'm the hottest, I'm the|richest, I'm the...
{83837}{83920}Where is our druid?|- Caesar has had him shut up in the ...
{83923}{83997}dungeon of the palace, please don't|beat me anymore.
{84074}{84138}Coming Obelix.|- Yes Asterix.
{84167}{84315}It's big brother. Big brother, junior|and I want a word with you.
{84371}{84453}I only hope we'll be able to find our|poor old druid.
{84457}{84591}All these old dungeons are the same.|It's just as easy to get in as it is to get out.
{84604}{84684}Halt, you can't come in.|- So we can.
{84687}{84810}May I Obelix, if you don't mind.
{84945}{85018}Asterix, Obelix!
{85112}{85211}Step aside, we're coming out.|- Oh no, you're not coming out.
{85213}{85282}- Oh yes we are.
{85417}{85510}You meant, you're coming out.
{86043}{86166}What? The druid have escaped from|prison? Those Gauls will soon find out ...
{86169}{86292}what it means to brave Caesar' anger!|Tomorrow when they waken I will have ...
{86319}{86467}a little surprise waiting for them,|and I think you will like it!
{87056}{87182}Master, the building site is deserted,|none of the workers have come to work.
{87189}{87301}What's going on? What's happened now?
{87475}{87598}In the name of Caesar, we hear some|Gaulish troublemaker are hiding on this...
{87601}{87734}building site. we order them to surrender,|if they don't we shall attack, by Jupiter!
{87739}{87876}We don't want to fight, but if we have|t o, we've got the men and the stones!
{87880}{87934}You'll be sorry for this. By Mercury!
{87938}{88070}What are we going to do, by ourselves?|- We build our fortifications by Felenos.
{88074}{88148}You're quite right, my ben salaam.
{88152}{88249}Do you think we might go home now|by any job?
{89530}{89578}To the attack!
{90358}{90474}Return to the battle!|- Join the army, re-enlist the masses.
{90478}{90601}They are back again!
{91251}{91308}To the attack!
{91311}{91394}See the world, the man said.
{91741}{91820}To the attack!|- He's nut!
{91823}{91878}You're off your head!|- No kidding.
{91881}{91978}If that's the way it's going to be,|we'll have to bombard them.
{92276}{92412}Hey look, they've got guided missiles.|If they miss I'll be surprised.
{92415}{92463}Fire!
{92734}{92850}My palace! They are|breaking up my palace!
{92853}{92976}We ought to let Cleopatra know,|she is the only one who can get ...
{92979}{93078}Caesar to stop this attack!|- Good idea, I'll write Her a letter.
{93102}{93226}And Dogmatix will deliver it for you.|Dogmatix? But he's much too small.
{93229}{93326}Dogmatix is not too small.|- Obelix don't be pig headed, ...
{93329}{93419}Dogmatix can not deliver that message.|- Yes he can! Mr. Asterix does ...
{93422}{93477}everything, Mr. Asterix|has to be the boss!
{93480}{93528}You know what Mr. Asterix has to say?
{93531}{93630}No just what does Mr. Asterix has to say?|- Here is the message, but how are ...
{93634}{93731}we going to get it to Cleopatra?|We are being besieged.
{93737}{93824}Oh you had better ask|Mr. Asterix, he's boss.
{93831}{93932}Now, now Obelix, don't be cross|I was only teasing.
{93934}{93969}My dog is no good.
{93972}{94059}Dogmatix will deliver the message,|and I'll deliver Dogmatix.
{94070}{94157}Watch out, one of the Gauls|is breaking out.
{94342}{94435}He went the same way he came.|- He was only passing through.
{94821}{94944}Oh Gauls from a far, sworn to destroy|my power, I will show you how ...
{94947}{95020}a Queen...can die, now is the great love...
{95023}{95146}No, no, my dog has brought|a message for you.
{95184}{95258}Oh isn't he sweet? Someone bring a|bone for the dear little dog.
{95274}{95393}This will never do. By Osiris,|Julius Caesar isn't play fair.
{95396}{95491}Right oh Gaul, I will take care of this.
{95495}{95592}Watch out! One of Gaul is breaking in.
{95729}{95832}There you go Obelix, Dogmatix is back.|He carried out his mission perfectly!
{95834}{95892}Oh you see, I was right?
{96012}{96100}Let's hope Cleopatra acts quickly, those|Romans meddlers are demolishing ...
{96103}{96167}the whole palace!
{96169}{96262}You see Caesar, even if we don't capture|those three Gauls, it comes to the ...
{96265}{96360}same thing, the whole palace|will be destroyed.
{96363}{96420}Good excellent!
{96423}{96512}Hail Caesar, there is someone who wants|a word with you, there.
{96959}{97082}Oh my Queen, what a happy chance.|-That will do! When I heard what was...
{97085}{97184}happening I hurried out at once.|I didn't even stop to change my dress.
{97187}{97305}When you make a bet you're supposed|to play it fair and I had every right to...
{97309}{97412}call the Gauls, and I'll prove to you that|my Egyptians can still build a beautiful...
{97414}{97539}palaces, and I insist that the Roman leave|the builders alone and let me tell you...
{97543}{97691}Yes, yes, all right I apologise.|- Well I should hope so, let's go home.
{98007}{98130}Well, what do we do now Caesar?|- We lift the siege, you idiot.
{98663}{98789}Look, the Romans are lifting the siege!|- Victory by Tutatis!
{98793}{98872}Goodies, goodies!|- And it's all thanks to Dogmatix!
{98876}{98924}Now then, back to work.
{98987}{99086}Sure enough the work gets going|again and at considerable speed, ...
{99088}{99180}since you will remember when architects|did not finish the job on time ...
{99183}{99306}they were thrown to the crocodiles, a|good old custom sadly neglected today.
{99309}{99382}At last one fine morning...
{99402}{99510}Oh my Queen the palace is ready for you!|- You have kept you word Edephus, ...
{99513}{99633}I Cleopatra will keep mine.|By Osiris cover him with gold!
{100330}{100478}Oh My Queen! The loveliest of Queens!|I have lost my bet and now I yield
{100484}{100558}the victory to you, yours is the honour|of cutting this ribbon Cleopatra.
{100893}{101016}I know how much i owe you Gauls,|and you have earned my heart felt ...
{101019}{101136}gratitude, I will have you sent home|to Gauls on my own state galley.
{101141}{101220}It was nothing Cleopatra,|it was nothing, goodbye now.
{101226}{101294}Say, will there be any boars|on this galley of yours?
{101297}{101383}Obelix!|- Why does he have to keep ...
{101386}{101485}telling me off all the time? This state|galleys might be all very but if there ...
{101487}{101540}aren't any boars it's hardly worth|making all fuss over!
{101889}{102012}Everyone is eating, everyone is|drinking, everyone is joyful and ...
{102015}{102138}celebrating and the happy ending|of this story.
{102104}{102208}Everyone is drinking? Everyone is eating?|Everyone?
{102214}{102274}Well, nearly everyone.
{102544}{102667}And when spring comes ...
{102671}{102787}Cleopatra's magnificent ship approches|the coast of Gauls where the little village...
{102790}{102913}welcomes its heroes with its usual|enthusiasm and feasting.
NARRATOR: And it came to pass that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed, and all went to be taxed, everyone, to his own city, for to disobey the Roman emperor meant certain death.
Oh, there were young people and old people.
There were the famous and mighty, and some not yet known, but whose names would eventually linger and be revered for all time.
There were good people who could ill afford the cruel tax about to be imposed upon them, and there were others.
And there were others.
Observe, Ali, the little drummer boy Aaron.
Are those animals dancing, Ben haramed?
BEN: They certainly are.
Faster, old friends. Faster.
You, samson, smile.
Hee-haw!
And you, bimbaba, be lighter, happier.
Baa!
Baa!
Oh, Joshua, you can do better.
[BRAYING]
[BRAYING]
Oh, with this marvel in my show caravan,
I will be as rich as Solomon.
But it is said
Aaron dislikes all humans.
He will not join us willingly.
BEN: Fool! Why do you think we brought the rope?
Ah!
Ah!
Let me go! Do you hear me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Get the camel!
Get the camel!
BEN: Ah! The donkey, too, fool!
BEN: Ah! The donkey, too, fool!
The lamb, you oaf!
Grab the lamb!
How? I have only two hands!
Stop concerning yourself with details!
Do it!
Do it!
Drummer boy, you may not believe me, but this is the luckiest day of your life.
But this is the luckiest day of your life.

NARRATOR: The little drummer boy Aaron fought Ben haramed and Ali with all his might.
He most definitely did not want to join the showman's caravan, a journey into the crowded city,
FOR IT WAS TRUE:
Aaron hated people...
All people.
No! No! I won't go with you!
Stop struggling, boy!
There is money to be made.
We can be rich!
While those taxpayers are waiting to be counted, they will grow bored.
They will crave the entertainment which only I...
Ben haramed, king of the desert showmen... and of course you, too, can provide.
But I do not want to go near that mob.
I hate people! All people!
Do you think ilovepeople?
What a beautiful world it would be without people.
But, alas, one must exist with people.
And indeed, it is better to be crowded and rich...
Than crowded... And poor.
Than crowded... And poor.

NARRATOR: Oh, Ben haramed was a wily old desert jackal.
Only he could have talked Aaron into visiting the crowded city.
For you see, Aaron truly did hate all people.
Now, it wasn't always this way, for Aaron was once a happy farm lad, the son of a Shepherd.
Father! Mother!
Father! Mother!
And why this exceptional greeting today, my son?
Oh, no reason.
Happy Birthday, Aaron.
Oh, father! Mother!
Did you bring me something?
I don't suppose...
This would interest you, young man?
A drum!
My very own drum! Oh, father!
Try it out, Aaron!
NARRATOR: And perhaps because it was a gift of love, the drum had an almost magical quality.
And the animals, when they heard it, began to dance to its sound.
And the animals, when they heard it, began to dance to its sound.
But Aaron's happiness was to end all too soon, for one night, bandits of the desert attacked.
For one night, bandits of the desert attacked.
What's going on out there?
Father!
You must run, my son. Escape!
But... run!
But... run!
NARRATOR: They burned the farm and took the sheep, and Aaron's happy life had changed forever.
And so, Aaron roamed the land a lonely orphan, his only friends 3 of the farm animals who had escaped.
He vowed to hate all humans for what they had done to his family, and he kept that vow.
And he kept that vow.
BEN: Ah, Jerusalem at last.
Here we shall make our fortune.
AARON: All these people!
Aha! The rest of my show caravan.
Hello! Hello!
Jameel and mesaal!
Jameel and mesaal!
Set up our performing carpets, and let us be on with the show.
And let us be on with the show.
[HORN]
[HORN]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Fellow taxpayers!
The day need not be all gloomy.
For I, Ben haramed, king of the desert showmen, have brought at great expense direct from the palace of the emperor of China, the toast of royalty, mesaal and jameel, tumblers extraordinary!
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Perhaps you will show your appreciation for such a performance.
For such a performance.
Philistine!
And now, let's move it right along with Ali of Arabia, greatest juggler under the stars.
Greatest juggler under the stars.
Boy, you perform next.
The crowd is restless.
You must appease them.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
No, no. Smile. Smile!
See, only a smile pleases the crowd.
Smile. Smile!
I cannot.
Not at... Them.
You stubborn little fool!
Then wear a painted one.
There. That's better.
When do I go on?
Now, before the dope juggles me out of my life savings!
Now, before the dope juggles me out of my life savings!

Don't let them get away before I pass the hat!
NARRATOR: But as Aaron looked at the faces of the cheering mob, a great rage rose up inside him.
How dare they laugh and be happy after what their kind did to his family!
Stop! Quiet!
I hate you all for what you did!
You're all preying thieves and bandits and knaves and... and knaves and... run for it!
NARRATOR: And so, the troupe was chased out of Jerusalem by the mob.
BEN: Boy, you shall pay for this indignity.
Ben haramed! Look!
Ben haramed! Look!
BEN: By the hounds of heaven, it is the caravan...
Of a king! We're in luck!
Can I believe my luck?
Two kings!
Hold me up! Three!
Three kings!
Three kings!
NARRATOR: And behold, there came wise men from the east, three kings of the orient, and lo, the star which they saw went before them.
Went before them.
Yes, it was the star of Bethlehem which shone so brightly and graced the lonely darkening desert with its silver light.
But the little troupe did not see the star's beauty, for the souls of Ben haramed and
Ali were too filled with greed and the heart of Aaron too overflowing with hatred to take any note of the wonder just above them.
Now you listen, drummer boy.
If you give this one performance, half the money shall be yours.
Then you are free.
NARRATOR: Aaron agreed, only because he knew that with the kings' money, he would be free to go his own way and never again have to trouble himself with humans.
AND SO THEY APPROACHED
THE THREE KINGS:
Melchior, caspar, and balthazar.
'Tis night. We must break camp.
And swiftly!
The star waits not for us.
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!
No! Don't go!
We just got here!
Halt! Out of my way!
We must perform!
Down, knave! Down!
Ben haramed... A knave?
Ben haramed... A knave?
I am crushed.
Lower your Spears.
These desert vagabonds seem to mean us no harm.
Why do you come to us?
We are a troupe of players, your majesty... uh, majesties.
We have no time for making merry, as you see.
We break camp, and... well, that's ridiculous.
Begging your pardon.
Nobody travels the desert by night!
We do...
For we follow the star.
For we follow the star.
BEN: How very... Convenient.
But, uh...
Enough.
Begone.
Now, to resume our journey.
Now, to resume our journey.
So close.
My fortune was so close!
And see what they load on the camels, great one.
Gold!
Oh, it's too painful.
[MOANING]
AND MORE VALUABLE
EVEN THAN GOLD:
The precious eastern resins frankincense and myrrh.
Frankincense and myrrh.
She is too weak to go on, your majesties.
Poor creature.
She has been weakened by the long journey.
Have we no extra beasts?
All are laden, almost beyond their strength.
MELCHIOR: Wait!
Did that player not own a camel?
Perhaps he would sell it.
No!
No!
You strike a hard bargain, player.
I've had a hard life.
CASPAR: Now load the beast, and let us be on our way.
And let us be on our way.
Gold. Ah.
I adore the feel of it, the weight of it, the look of it.
Ahh.
Ahh.
Your share.
I don't want it!
I don't want any part of you!
Come, samson, baba.
We must find our old comrade.
No!
BEN: Let him go!
We're done with him!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
NARRATOR: Aaron climbed the tallest hill he could find, but the royal caravan was nowhere in sight.
But the royal caravan was nowhere in sight.
Baa!
What is it, baba?
Samson?
Samson?
The star?
Yes.
The kings were following that star.
If we follow it, we are sure to catch up with them.
Come, quickly!
NARRATOR: And so they followed the gleaming star, little realizing where it was leading them.
CHORUS:

AARON: The town of Bethlehem.
NARRATOR: And as Aaron glanced back out over the countryside, he saw what seemed to be a gentle army of poor Shepherds, all of them being led toward the tiny town.
Why... They're all following the same star.
Why... They're all following the same star.

Joshua!
NARRATOR: Their hearts were so full of joy that they did not look where they were going.
Suddenly, something came careening out of the darkness.
DRIVER: Out of my way, ragamuffin!
Baba!
Baba!
Oh, baba, you mustn't die! You mustn't!
Who could help me?
Who could help me?
Yes. The kings.
The kings are wise.
They will be able to save baba.
They will be able to save baba.
Please, I've got to get inside to see the kings!
You must let me through!
NARRATOR: And when Aaron came to the entrance of the stable, he could hardly believe what he saw.
He could hardly believe what he saw.
And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.
Oh, your majesty!
You must... shh.
You must... shh.
Oh. The player boy.
My lamb has been injured.
You must save him.
He is near death.
Oh, lad, there is nothing I can do.
But... But you're a king!
A mortal king only.
But... There is a king among kings who would save your little friend.
The babe?
But I do not understand.
CASPAR: It is not necessary that you understand. Go to him.
But... I...
I have no gift to bring.
Go. Look upon the newborn king.

NARRATOR: And as Aaron looked at the babe, he thought it was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.
AARON: And yet, there is something more about him...
So much more.
Your gift, little drummer boy, given out of the simple desperation of a pure love, is the one favored above all.
See?
NARRATOR: Aaron's heart was filled with joy and love, and he knew at last that the hate he had carried there was wrong, as all hatred will ever be wrong.
For more powerful, more beautiful by far than all the eons of sadness and cruelty and desolation which have come before was that one tiny, crystalline second of laughter.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
For they shall see God.
Captioning made possible by golden books family entertainment captioned by the national captioning institute... Www.Ncicap.Org...
Gentlemen...
We are gathered here today as representatives... of some of the greatest design teams in the world.
We are here to listen to a proposal... from a Mr. X... a man who is 50 years ahead of his time...
A man who is undoubtedly... the world's greatest aircraft designer.
The daddy of them all.
Mr. X?
Are you with us?
Yes... l am with you,
Mr. President.
Gentlemen, you must forgive the extraordinary... security precautions taken today.
But when l tell you that Mr. X... is none other than the man who designed... the International
Rescue aircraft... you will understand the importance of security.
Mr. X has a proposition to put to us... for a revolutionary new type of aircraft. lt is, perhaps...
The most exciting moment in the history of our company.
And now, gentlemen, the moment has come.
What is it to be?
An aircraft that flies 10 times the speed of sound...
A space vehicle that travels the speed of light? lf l were able to guess...
Mr. X would not be here today.
And now, Mr. X, it is with great excitement... that we await breathlessly... the details of your new design.
Well, gentlemen... l thought it would be a good idea... in this day and age of, uh, speed...
And, uh, things like that... to build an...airship.
An airship?
An airship?
A beautiful island in the pacific... secret base of
International Rescue...
So far undetected.
Outwardly, the luxury home of millionaire ex-astronaut...
Jeff Tracy.
Now, let's have a rundown... on the International
Rescue craft.
At the moment, there are 5.
Thunderbird 1... sleek, first, and fast.
Thunderbird 2... giant transporter.
Carries all the rescue gear to the danger zone.
Thunderbird 3... designed for space rescue.
Thunderbird 4... capable of withstanding the pressure of the depths.
Thunderbird 5... space monitor.
Capable of receiving or intercepting... distress calls from any part of the world.
And l'm telling you, Brains, in no uncertain terms...
That we now need a Thunderbird 6.
Sure, Mr. Tracy.
But can you give me some sort of a steer? l like to work to a specification.
Specification?
You didn't need to work to a specification... when you designed that airship... for the New World
Aircraft Corporation.
That's right. l didn't.
And what happened?
They laughed.
Yeah, that's right.
They laughed.
And then they built it.
There you are, Brains.
Your specially commissioned painting of Skyship 1.
Thanks, Virgil. lt's really great.
But l guess that's about the nearest... l'm gonna get to it for some time. l'm sorry about this,
Brains.
But l've got this feeling, and l know l'm not wrong.
We desperately need a Thunderbird 6.
That's OH, Mr. Tracy.
Of course, l would have liked... to have been on the maiden voyage.
Sure.
But at least
International Rescue... will be represented by
Alan, Tin Tin, and Penelope.
They'll give you a full report.
So, you like the painting, eh?
Say, talking of painting...
Alan?
Yes, Dad?
You better get cleaned up.
Don't forget, it's your farewell dinner tonight.
Just 10 more minutes, Dad, and l'll be through.
How's she looking?
Great. Just great. l finished our packing, Mr. Tracy.
Our packing?
Tin Tin, come here a minute.
Certainly, Mr. Tracy. ls there anything wrong?
Tin Tin, Alan wanted to travel to England... in an unconventional way.
Well, l've organized that.
But it's gonna be a long journey... and not exactly the way for a young lady to travel... in this day and age.
You are traveling by scheduled airline.
But Mr. Tracy... l want to travel with Alan.
Now, Alan leaves tomorrow... and you leave in 2 weeks' time.
Understand?
Come on, Mother, over here.
You'll get a good view.
Well, l guess we've seen a lot of launchings... but this will beat all.
Say, where's Tin Tin? l don't know, Dad.
Strange.
Unusual for her not to see Alan off.
Here she comes.
So long, folks.
Dearest Brains... l know how much this project means to you... and l feel that you, not l, should be making this trip.
But, of course, you are the one person who cannot be spared. l shall be thinking of you.
Love, Tin Tin.
P.S... l stowed aboard the Tiger with Alan.
She's what?
That's right, Mr. Tracy.
She's aboard the Tiger with Alan.
He flies through the air
With the greatest of ease
The daring young man in his flying machine
His movements are graceful
All girls he can please
And my heart is stolen away lsn't it a lovely ou_it? lt belonged to my ancestor, the Duchess of Crighton Ward.
Well? What do you think,
Parker? l think it's very elegant, milady.
Mind you, l prefer mini-skirts m'self... but l suppose it's appropriate... that you should be dressed like that...
For the revival of the airship, so to speak.
Thank you, Parker.
And that ou_it suits you beautifully.
Well, if Alan's on schedule... he should be arriving at any moment.
Yes, milady. l understand that he's been on his way now for 2 weeks.
That's him, Parker.
We must go onto the roof and see him land.
Come on.
There it is, Tin Tin.
Yes, Alan!
It looks lovely!
OH. You know what to do. l expect he's coming in to land.
Milady, he's coming straight for us! l don't believe it.
Hi, Penny. Hi, Parker.
Alan, l'm so glad you're safe.
You gave us quite a scare.
Gee, l like your ou_it, Penelope.
Yes, l was rather pleased with it myself.
Uh, uh, excuse me.
All the family send their love to you.
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Alan. Excuse me.
What is it, Parker?
Uh, your aircraft, sir.
It's got no pilot. l--l just thought l'd point it out to you, sir.
Oh, forget about it,
Parker. l'm finished with it now.
Now, you were saying,
Penelope...
Mr. Alan, please!
Don't you understand? lt's gonna crash into the house!
Parker! What has got into you?
Sorry about that, Alan.
Stone the crows... lt's going to land on its own.
Parker? Milady?
Tin Tin's an excellent pilot.
Don't you think, Parker?
You should have seen
Parker's face, Tin Tin. lt was the funniest thing l've ever seen in my life. l can just imagine it.
Of course, l saw immediately what Alan was up to because l knew you were on board.
Jeff called me yesterday. l could hardly keep a straight face.
Come in.
All the baggage is aboard, milady.
Thank you, Parker.
Now, there's only one thing
Ieft to do before we leave.
Bon voyage.
Bon voyage.
Bon voyage, milady.
As president of the New
World Aircraft Corporation... this flight is of paramount importance to me.
The fact that members of International Rescue... will be on the maiden flight... enables us to achieve worldwide publicity. ln order to make this possible in the first place... we have given assurances to them... that the strictest security arrangements... will be enforced.
That is why the airfield is cleared of all personnel.
The passengers are due to arrive in, um...
30 minutes.
Contact.
Virg, l can see them at 2 o'clock!
OH. l've got them, Scott.
Right.
Operation escort, go!
This is what l call driving in style, milady. lt isn't every Rolls-Royce that has an aircraft escort.
OH, all checks complete.
-Martin?
-Yes, sir.
-Lane?
-Yes, sir.
-Carter?
-Yes, sir.
-Hogarth?
-Yes, sir.
OH. Return to your posts... and await the arrival of the passengers.
Hold it right there.
Quickly, we haven't much time.
Scott from Penelope.
Come aboard with the others and have a farewell drink.
We'll meet you in the ballroom.
The ballroom!
May l book the first dance?
No, Scott.
It isn't what it seems.
You'll see.
And now, by the courtesy... of the New World
Aircraft Corporation... we bring you the
Drinking Half Hour!
Now, milady, what will it be? l think this occasion calls for champagne... all around, Parker.
All around, milady?
All around, Parker.
And now,
Iadies and gentlemen... on behalf of the New World
Aircraft Corporation... l welcome you aboard
Skyship 1.
As you know, this is the maiden flight. lt is, of course, a great honor... for us to have such distinguished guests.
You can be assured that the crew and myself... will do everything in our power... to make this a trip to remember.
Well, bon voyage.
Bon voyage!
Godspeed, milady.
OH, one minute to takeoff.
Now, we know the ship is fully automated.
Everything is preprogrammed-- height, speed, course.
We're all supposed to be trained men.
The only way that our cover will be broken... will be if anything goes wrong with the ship.
Takeoff now, 30 seconds.
Well, we're off.
Come in.
Dinner is served in the bottle room, milady.
Well, they've gone.
May we have the blinds drawn, Captain?
The entire operation of this Skyship...
Lady Penelope, is totally automatic.
As the light falls, the curtains will draw automatically.
Of course.
That's just the sort of thing...
Brains would have thought of.
Well, it looks as if we're all set for a lovely, peaceful holiday.
Calling Black Phantom.
This is White Ghost.
Calling Black Phantom, this is White Ghost.
Come in, Black Phantom.
Come in, Black Phantom.
Have disposed of cargo.
Operation Ambush underway.
Calling
International Rescue.
This is Lady Penelope.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbird 1 and 2... to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details. lt's going to be difficult.
That's what we're paid for.
Now, l've had this whole place bugged. l want every word she speaks on this trip... to be recorded.
Whenever possible, l'll talk to her myself... and maneuver the conversation... in the right direction.
Right. Get to work.
OH, Carter, breakfast is served.
Start recording.
Morning, Alan.
Morning, Penny.
Morning, Alan.
Breakfast over New York.
What an experience.
This is really the way to travel.
Yeah, it's great.
Only thing is, as the ship's fully automated... if anything should go wrong with the computer... we could hit one of these skyscrapers... and then we'd really be in trouble.
Then, Alan... it would just be a simple case of... calling
International Rescue.
OH.
Calling International Rescue.
And now, gentlemen... it is with pride that l present to you Thunderbird 6.
Now, so that l'm able to demonstrate... this new machine properly... l have built this radio-controlled model.
The situation?
Man trapped in top floor of burning skyscraper.
Thunderbird 6 drives up to the building.
The helium balloon now rises... lifting a plastic hose into the air.
When the balloon reaches the correct height... the reel is locked off. l don't get it, Brains.
What's the point?
This is the point.
And so you see, gentlemen... another international rescue is made possible.
Well, Mr. Tracy, what do you think?
Well, it's, uh, certainly ingenious, Brains.
But it means building a vehicle... that gives us only one means of rescue.
The end product just doesn't justi_ the cost. l--l'm sorry. l'm afraid you'll have to scrap it... and start again.
Too bad about the wasted effort.
Wasted effort, Mr. Tracy?
Heh heh.
What's a mere 28 days...
Working day and night...
Think nothing of it.
We must be descending. l'm getting butterflies. l always do when we lose height.
You're absolutely right,
Lady Penelope.
We'll soon be flying over the Grand Canyon... at zero feet.
An automated announcement... will tell us when it's the right time.
Don't worry, you won't miss a thing.
There. You can see our exact position.
The Grand Canyon.
You know, l was once hopelessly lost... in a jet plane, and then, at last... l made contact with the Grand.
Was l glad to hear that voice!
You are directly over the Grand Canyon.

Correction, Captain Foster. lnternational fix system

Of course. 24-04.
Heh. l didn't think l'd ever forget that.
Ladies and gentlemen... we are now approaching the Grand Canyon. lf you care to take up your positions on the balcony... you will be in good time... to get the most advantageous view point. l think it's the most beautiful sight l've ever seen.
Come across to the other side of the ship.
There's an even better view over there.
Yes, let's do that. l really don't think l like Captain Foster.
Ah, he's just an old man.
Thunderbirds 1 and 2... l trust the beaujolais was to your liking, Parker?
And now, how about a cigar?
As you know, milady... l've been spending quite a lot of time... with the stewards... drinking and all that sort of thing.
Well, what worries me-- they--they don't seem to know as much... about the ship as they ought to.
Thank you, Parker. l've had my own thoughts on the matter. l'm glad you told me.
Yes. Well, uh-- sorry if l disturbed you, milady.
You were quite right,
Parker.
Good night.
Good night, milady.
Yes, Penelope? l've just had some information from Parker. l'm a little uneasy.
Tell me, what do you think of Captain Foster? l don't go for him,
Penelope.
He's a little too smooth for my liking.
Tell me, Alan, has he been questioning you... about International Rescue?
As a matter of fact, he has.
Well, not directly, mind you... but the conversation always seems to lead that way. l think we'll have to go into the situation... a little more closely. l don't like the sound of it.
The storm seems to be getting worse. l think you'd better come in here.
We need to discuss this right away.
Oh, well, um...
Perhaps we are allowing our imaginations... to run away with us.
After all... everyone's interested in International Rescue. lt's only natural he should ask questions.
Oh. So you don't think there's anything... to worry about, Penelope?
No. After all, they have all been screened.
They're carefully selected men.
That was a close one.
Put on the edited tape.
Right.
One thing's for sure.
We gotta play this really cool from now on.
Lady Penelope, l underestimated you.

Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
OH. Continue recording.
Doesn't sound as if we'll get much more tonight.
When l was talking to you just now, Alan... l discovered a bugging device in a lamp by my bed. l wondered why you'd changed your attitude... so abruptly.
What's our next move?
For the moment, nothing.
We know we're being bugged, but we don't know why.
We must just be on the alert.
OH. l'll mosey around... and see what l can find out.
Of course l understand,
Mr. Tracy. lt isn't quite the thing you had in mind.
Of course l don't mind designing yet another one.
You know, Scott, one of the remarkable things... about Brains is that he never loses his temper.
Well, if he did, l wouldn't blame him... after all the work he's done.
Upset? Me upset?
Of course l'm not upset!
Go ahead, John.
Father, l've just received a message... from Lady Penelope. lt was sent in scrambled electronic code.
Right, John. Let's have it. lt's just coming out of the descrambler now. lt reads, ''Ship bugged.
Reason unknown.
''Am investigating.
''lmperative, no communication from you.
''Will contact you when we have a lead.
''Signed, Penelope.''
F.A.B., John. Heep in touch. l don't like the sound of it, Dad.
We've gotta do something about this.
Yeah. But what?
Well, why not radio the police... at their next port of call?
Have the crew interrogated.
No. Whoever it is on that ship... that is looking for information... is probably an agent for a larger organization. lf we're to protect ourselves, we've gotta... wait for them to show their hand.
You lead an interesting but secretive life.
Your lifeline shows that you will meet many dangers.
You will become involved with a handsome stranger.
You would be well to let your heart guide you.
Well...stone the crows.
Beautiful, Alan.
But it's far too expensive.
Right. We'll take it.
You won't regret it, sir. lt will bring you much happiness.
Oh, Alan, it's been such a lovely day. l just wish it could never end.
The sari suits you very well, Penelope. lt was a very kind thought,
Captain. Thank you.
Did you get anything interesting today, Tin Tin?
Yes. Alan bought me this beautiful ring.
He paid far too much money for it... but l'm very thrilled with it.
Buying a ring for a young
Iady is prem significant... to me, Alan. Don't tell me you're going to desert... the league of bachelors. l'm afraid not,
Captain Foster.
The life l lead in
International Rescue... is far too dangerous to ask anyone... to share it with me.
For me, at the moment, marriage is out of the question.
That's right,
Captain Foster.
We all of us lead dedicated lives... in International Rescue.
And now, if you'll excuse me, l think l'll retire.
But wouldn't you like another drink?
Thank you, Captain, but no. lt's been a lovely, but very tiring day. l'm going to bed.
Oh, so soon? l'm afraid so.
Good night, everyone.
So, your rooms aren't bugged... but the lounge, bar, and dining room are.
All places where l go.
It would seem it's me... they want the information from.
But what? lf we knew that, we'd know the answer to everything.
Have you found any trace of the receiver?
Parker's had no luck.
None. The only place l haven't searched... is the gravity compensation room.
Well, the trip comes to an end in 14 days' time.
Whatever move they're going to make... must be made before we get back to England.
So we'll soon know. l think l can claim to have been to most places... in the world, but, oddly enough... l've never seen the pyramids. l've never seen them, either.
Well, we won't have long to wait.
We land in 15 minutes.
Oh, how dreadful.
What is it, Penelope?
There's been a terrible air crash.
A DX 102 airliner... tried to make a forced
Ianding on a disused... airfield 10 miles south of Casablanca. lts nose wheel collapsed... and the aircraft blew up, killing all aboard.
At last, we've got it. l've got to hand it to you, Carter... that newspaper idea of yours was just great.
Now, complete the editing. l want to hear that final message as soon as possible.
OH, girls, let's go.
Don't forget your camera, Penelope.
Don't worry. l've got it right here.
So, you see, Jeff, we nearly lost Parker.
Ah, now here's the coded bit.
We are enjoying our trip and looking forward... to our last port of call,
Switzerland.
Scott, take this along to Brain's lab... and get it decoded.
Yes, sir.
Oh, that's all right,
Mr. Tracy. l just love having my designs turned down.
Gee, Brains, your beautiful model.
Oh, h-hi, Scott.
Yeah. It just slipped out of my hand.
Dad wants you to decode this right away.
Gee, l wish there was something we could do to help them.
Don't worry. l've got a feeling... it won't be long now.
Mr. Tracy?
Yes, Brains?
Decoding of Penelope's
Ietter is as follows...
''lnterest is in me.
Reason unknown.
''Continue to stand by.''
Thanks, Brains.
Well, we now know that they're bugging only Penelope.
They're interested in what she says.
Now, what could
Penelope say... that would mean so much to someone with designs... on International Rescue?
Jeff, l want you to send...
Thunderbirds 1 and 2 to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details.
Perfect. Just perfect.
OH. Now, what next?
Now, watch carefully.
Tomorrow, we make our
Iast stop--Switzerland. lt certainly is a fantastic car you have, Penelope.
The only one of its kind in the world, Captain Foster.
When those skis appeared out of the bottom... l just couldn't believe my eyes.
Oh, it has many other devices, Captain.
Many of them still top secret.
Switching to full boost, milady.
How are you doing, Tin Tin?
Fine. Just fine.
Switch in thrusters.
OH.
Right, have you decided what you're going to eat?
Mmm. l think l'll start with avocado.
Tin Tin?
Artichoke, please.
Likewise.
Ah. And for me the speciality of the house.
This is a cute place. lt's certainly imaginative.
Let's hope the service is as good.
Well, l guess this is for us.
Gee, what a novel idea. lt must have been fun traveling in trains... like this years ago.
Well, let's unload the cargo.
As Parker would say,
''lt looks a real good nosh.''
Talking of Parker... what's happened to him?
Surely he's not still outside?
But, of course.
The car is heated, you know.
11 :OO. We must go.
The skyship is programmed to take off at midnight.
As a matter of interest,
Captain... what would happen if you didn't get back on time?
Your dream holiday would just come to an end.
And now, Cinderella, we must go.
Are we clear, Parker?
Quite clear, milady.
You debugged the whole place, Parker?
No need, milady. It was already done for me.
There's not a hidden microphone anywhere, milady.
They've all been removed.
That can only mean one thing.
They've got the information they wanted. What now?
Parker, what have you to report?
Well, milady, they've been recording you on a tape machine... in the gravity compensation room. l managed to get a look in there.
They've been editing the tape--that was obvious.
And now they've got the tape machine... linked to a radio transmitter.
The jigsaw's nearly completed but not quite.
Parker, issue the guns.
They're in the false compartment... at the bottom of my blue suitcase.
From now on, it's emergency standby.
Black Phantom from White Ghost.
Message will be transmitted
1000 hours tomorrow morning.
Gentlemen, the Thunderbird machines... will be arriving here at approximately...
1100 hours tomorrow morning.
The final phase of Operation
Ambush has commenced.
OH. Rewind and stand by.
OH. Ready.
15 seconds.
Calling International Rescue.
This is Lady Penelope.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2... to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details.
The Thunderbird machines should be arriving... in approximately
10 minutes.
Stand by. lf pilots offer any resistance as they leave their machines... shoot them down. l've got it.
Penelope, l've got! lt's the only possible answer.
They've been recording your voice, right?
Right.
They've been editing the tape, right?
Right.
Editing is a form of rearranging.
They've been rearranging your words... to make you say something that they wanted you to say... and then they've transmitted it.
Now, who's the one person... who would act on your instructions?
Why, Jeff Tracy.
Roger, Scott.
Understand that you are at disused airfield.
Call me as soon as you've landed.
F.A.B.
Go ahead, Penny.
Jeff, this is an emergency.
Have you received a message from me?
Yes, Penelope. The boys are just about to land... at the rendezvous you requested.
Jeff, l haven't sent a message.
This is a trap.
Now, remember... just one sign of resistance from those pilots... and let them have it.
Thunderbird to base.
Thanks, Dad.
You gave us the warning just in time.
Setting course now to rendezvous with Skyship 1.
That's right, Scott.
The message was a recording of my voice.
Now, the quicker you arrive, the better for us.
You've got a fix on our position.
F.A.B.
OH, l've received a message from Black Phantom... to say the Thunderbird machines were landing.
By now, they must've taken over the ships... and shortly, they'll be on their way... to rendezvous with us.
Right, the playacting's over.
Round up our International
Rescue guests.
They're unsuspecting, so they won't be armed.
Not so unsuspecting,
Captain Foster.
Raise your hands, all of you. lt sounds as if Alan needs some help.
Tin Tin, l'll leave you my compact.
You can keep in touch with the boys.
F.A.B., Penny.
Come on, Parker.
Quickly, Parker.
Lane, get the other one as hostage. Quick.
OH, Foster, the numbers are eVen nOW... and we can outshoot you, you know that.
Throw your guns down and give yourselves up. l suggest you throw your guns down. lf you don't, you can say good-bye to Tin Tin.
Father, l've lost contact with Skyship 1.
Right, Scott.
At what position... do you expect to rendezvous with it?
According to my calculations, at approximately 10,OOO feet.
About 5 miles east of Dover.
Well, all you can do, Scott... is beat the hell out of those machines... and get there as soon as you can.
F.A.B.
Very smart, Penelope.
So you radioed your base?
That's right, Mr. Foster.
You should know that you can't outwit International Rescue. l'm not so sure.
The game isn't over yet.
We have you all as our hostages.
When the Thunderbird machines arrive... l've got an idea they're going to do... just what we tell them to.
Meanwhile, the gravity compensating machine... has come to a standstill.
The jet engines on this bus... are to give it forward movement only.
The ship can't maintain height... unless the gravity compensators are working. l'm well aware of the situation.
We're losing height quite slowly. lt'll be half an hour yet before there's any real danger. lt'll be half an hour yet before there's any real danger.
Martin, go up on the top deck... and radio down as soon as those
Thunderbirds arrive. Right.
Father, l'm at rendezvous point.
No sign of Skyship 1. l don't understand it, Scott. lt's a big ship.
It'd be hard to miss.
Oh, wait. l can see it. lt's about 8,OOO feet below me. l don't get it.
According to the New World pre-programmed schedule... it should be at 10,OOO feet at this point. l'm going down to take a look.
F.A.B.
Foster, Thunderbird 1 directly above us.
OH, Martin.
Right. Untie them. l want you all up on the top deck... and no false moves.
OH, father, l'm alongside. l can see one of the stewards standing... on the top deck.
Otherwise, no sign of life.
When Thunderbird 2 arrives, we'll attempt to board her.
Be with you in about
5 minutes, Scott.
OH, Virgil.
Dad, there's trouble ahead.
Dad, Skyship 1 is losing height.
Why? l don't know.
About one mile ahead is an early warning system... with interceptor towers.
The estimated height:
1,200 feet.
Below it is a missile site.
The way it looks from here...
Skyship 1 is on a collision course.
The only thing that can save it is its height.
But l've got my doubts. lt's a tower head.
We're going to hit it!
How far away is it? l don't know.
About a quarter of a mile. l'm coming up.
Dad, there's going to be a collision.
You'd better alert... all emergency services down on the ground. lt's a missile base about 5 miles east of Dover.
F.A.B.
What's the situation, Scott?
Well, the ship's swaying on top of one of the towers. lf that tower gives way... or the ship loses its balance... it's going to drop like a stone... it's going to drop like a stone... right onto that missile site below.
Come on, quickly.
Up on the top deck and move!
We've crashed, Foster.
Don't you understand?
Throw your gun away.
We're all in this together now. l said move!
Scott, l've been listening to your transmission. l've sighted Skyship. l'm coming in straight over the top.
Will lower escape unit.
Brains is already in there.
F.A.B. ls Brains armed?
He ought to be.
We've no idea what's going on. lt's OH, Dad. l've taken care of that.
Good boy.
Attention! Attention!
All personnel in section ''D''... to vacate site immediately.
Proceed with all movable equipment... to rendezvous ''G.''
This is an emergency.
Repeat: This is an emergency.
Virgil, pull off!
Pull off!
Your thrusters are throwing it off balance.
F.A.B.
Base and Thunderbird 2... we need to decide a course of action but fast.
As far as l can see... any attempt to get near that ship... is going to bring a disaster.
The turbulence from our motors alone... will be enough to tip it off balance.
Have you any ideas, Dad?
All personnel and vehicles to proceed to rendezvous ''G'' immediately.
This is an emergency.
Repeat: This is an emergency.
We need a solution,
Gordon, and quick.
As far as l can tell... the only way we're going to get them off that tower... in one piece is to get a vehicle on that top deck.
Nothing we've got would be any good, Dad.
Our machines are too heavy. l know. l know.
We need something light,
Iow air speed... high maneuverability, short landing distance.
Say, l've got the answer, Dad! lt's crazy, but it could work.
Hey, what's going on?
Thunderbird 2 is leaving.
Don't tell me they've given up.
That's right, Mr. Tracy.
We've got it aboard
Thunderbird 2... and they just left.
We did all the necessary checks and fueled it. l certainly hope it works. lt's just got to work.
It's just got to.
The top of the tower is crumbling. l'm going to attach a line... to the front of the ship to see if l can hold it steady.
F.A.B.
What the heck are they doing?
Why don't they come in and get us off this thing?
You saw what happened when they came in close.
Well, what are they going to do? lf you let me call them, l can find out.
Oh, no, you don't! l'm not falling into that little trap.
OH, Dad. Line secured. l think it's going to help.
Thunderbird 1, from Thunderbird 2.
One mile from you. l'm landed on a grassy stretch down below.
Well done, Virg.
That was a quick trip.
Yeah, well, you see... l've got a Tiger in my tank.
OH, Brains, over to you.
Scott and Virgil... l'm going to circle the ship... and then attempt a landing.
OH, Brains. lf you make it, the order of evacuation... will be first, Tin Tin, second, Penelope... then the crew, and finally,
Parker and Alan.
F.A.B.
Right, Scott, l'm in position.
Brains is on his way up. l'm going to fix a line to this end.
OH, Virg.
Still no radio contact with Skyship 1. l just don't understand it.
Something must be wrong.
We'll soon find out.
Attaching line.
Don't tell me they're going to try a rescue with that thing.
They must've got it from a museum.
You're dead right,
Mr. Foster.
But l'll tell you something.
It's a brilliant idea. l think it's the only chance we've got.
Lane, Get over on the other side of the deck.
Get ready to welcome our guest.
Right.
Brains!
Scott, that was a close one.
Are you OH, Brains?
OH. Climbing for second attempt.
Brains, you're not going to make it.
As soon as you touch down, l'll open up with my jets.
The slipstream should slow you down.
Right. Let's try it.
F.A.B.
Penelope and Alan, in a few moments... l'm going to open up my jet engines.
Hold tight to that rail.
Alan, raise your hand if you've understood me.
OH, folks, hold tight!
Well done, Brains.
OH. Tin Tin, you're first.
Jump aboard.
Oh, no, you don't.
Get out of that cockpit and move!
Scott, one of the stewards has got Brains at gunpoint.
Now we know why there's been no radio communication.
What're they going to do, Virg?
Looks as if Penelope is boarding the aircraft.
And the Captain's getting into the rear cockpit.
OH. Turn this crate around.
What's happened to Brains?
Everyone's moving towards the Tiger.
There's no doubt about it.
The crew is in control of the situation.
Things look bad, Dad.
Guys, hold it a minute.
Come on! Hurry it up!
Get back fast! This thing's going to collapse any moment!
What makes you think l'm coming back?
Double-crosser!
We've got to stop him!
Quick! Jump aboard!
Come on!
We're going to crash!
We're just overloaded.
That's all.
Watch out for trees!
Penelope, throttle back.
Thunderbird to base.
Father, we're not going to be able to hold her much longer.
How's the evacuation... of the rocket site progressing?
Nearly complete... but they want about another 5 minutes.
Do everything you can, Scott... to prevent that ship falling.
Penelope, throttle back.
We're down!
Where's the throttle?
Down on the left hand side.
Throttle back.
Penny, throttle back.
Penny, that's the wrong way.
Alan, it's jammed. l can't move it.
Alan, l can't free it.
What shall l do?
Get her nose up! Quickly!
Don't panic.
Alan, there's another bridge ahead.
Pull...up!
Pull the stick back.
Pull it back! Penelope...
Hold the rudder steady,
Penelope.
Alan, obstruction ahead.
Alan!
Alan!
This is it!
All personnel and vehicles... should by now be clear of sectors ''A'' to ''Q.''
Danger imminent. l repeat: Danger imminent.
Thunderbird 1?
Loud and clear.
Scott, l just received the OH from the missile base.
Evacuation has been completed.
You can let her go.
Right.
Did you hear that, Virgil? l heard.
OH. Release cables on 5 second countdown.
F.A.B.
Zero! l want to get into the rear cockpit, Penelope.
But first, we've got to get rid of Foster.
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
OH, Alan.
Hold tight, Brains.
OH, Penny, push the stick over to the left.
OH. Heep us steady, Penny. l'm getting into the rear cockpit now.
Alan, l've only just realized
Parker isn't with us.
We must've left him aboard the airship. lt's too late now, Penny.
Anyway, a few moments from now... we may be sharing the same fate.
That's our engine gone, Penny.
Hold tight.
Hold tight, Tin Tin. l'm putting her down.
OH, Alan.
Hold tight, Brains.
Emergency landing.
Good luck, Alan.
Hey, Tin Tin! l still say, Alan, that was a fantastic landing.
Well, if it hadn't been for Parker... we could've said we'd got away with it.
Are you sure there was no chance of him surviving... when Skyship 1 crashed?
Not a chance, Alan. l suppose it must be shock... but a few moments ago, l'm sure l heard... a distant voice calling, ''Milady.''
That's funny. l thought l heard it, too.
Milady!
Milady!
And now, it gives me great pleasure... to introduce to you all... my new vehicle--
Thunderbird 6.
Thunderbird 6? l don't get it.
Oh. l know what you're going to say, Mr. Tracy.
That you haven't approved the plans... how could it have been built anyway... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
But, nevertheless, l present to you...
Thunderbird 6.
Built, tested, and approved.
This is
Thunderbird control.
Launch Thunderbird 6.
Brains! Ha ha.
Well, l'll be a...
Look at that.
Brains, you old son of a gun. l'll buy it. l agree it's a good design.
It has been built... and it sure has been tested.
I think there must be something wrong with me, Linus.
Christmas is coming, but I'm not happy.
I don't feel the way I'm supposed to feel.
I just don't understand Christmas,
I guess.
I like getting presents and sending Christmas cards...
...and decorating trees and all that, but I'm still not happy.
I always end up feeling depressed.
Charlie Brown, you're the only person I know...
...who can take a wonderful season like Christmas and turn it into a problem.
Maybe Lucy's right.
Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you're the Charlie Browniest.
Hello in there.
Rats.
Nobody sent me a Christmas card today.
I almost wish there weren't a holiday season.
I know nobody likes me.
Why do we have to have a holiday season to emphasize it?
Thanks for the Christmas card you sent me, Violet.
I didn't send you a Christmas card,
Charlie Brown.
Don't you know sarcasm when you hear it?
Pigpen, you're the only person I know...
...who can raise a cloud of dust in a snowstorm.
Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.
It's fun.
Mm. Needs sugar.
It's too early.
I never eat December snowflakes.
I always wait until January.
They sure look ripe to me.
You think you're so smart with that blanket.
What are you gonna do with it when you grow up?
Maybe I'll make it into a sport coat.
I think you have a customer.
May I help you?
- I'm in sad shape.
- Wait a minute.
Before you begin,
I must ask that you pay in advance.
Five cents, please.
Boy, what a sound.
How I love to hear that old money plink, that beautiful sound of cold, hard cash.
That beautiful, beautiful sound.
Nickels, nickels, nickels.
That beautiful sound of plinking nickels.
All right, now, what seems to be your trouble?
I feel depressed.
I know I should be happy, but I'm not.
Well, as they say on TV...
...the mere fact that you realize you need help...
...indicates that you are not too far gone.
I think we'd better pinpoint your fears.
If we can find out what you're afraid of, we can label it.
Are you afraid of responsibility?
If you are, then you have hypengyophobia.
- I don't think that's quite it.
- How about cats?
If you're afraid of cats, you have ailurophasia.
Well, sort of, but I'm not sure.
Are you afraid of staircases?
If you are, then you have climacophobia.
Maybe you have thalassophobia.
This is fear of the ocean.
Or gephyrophobia, which is the fear of crossing bridges.
Or maybe you have pantophobia.
Do you think you have pantophobia?
- What's pantophobia?
- The fear of everything.
That's it!
Actually, Lucy, my trouble is Christmas.
I just don't understand it.
Instead of feeling happy,
I feel sort of let down.
You need involvement.
You need to get involved in some real Christmas project.
How would you like to be the director of our Christmas play?
Me? You want me to be the director of the Christmas play?
Sure, Charlie Brown.
We need a director, you need involvement.
We've got a shepherd, musicians, animals, everyone you need.
We've even got a Christmas queen.
I don't know anything about directing a Christmas play.
Don't worry, I'll be there to help you.
I'll meet you at the auditorium.
Incidentally, I know how you feel about all this Christmas business...
...getting depressed and all that.
It happens to me every year.
I never get what I really want.
I always get a lot of stupid toys or a bicycle...
...or clothes or something like that.
- What is it you want?
- Real estate.
What's going on here?
What's this?
"Find the true meaning of Christmas.
Win money, money, money.
Spectacular, super-colossal neighborhood
Christmas-lights-and-display contest. "
Lights-and-display contest? Oh, no.
My own dog gone commercial.
I can't stand it. Oh...
I've been looking for you, big brother.
Will you please write a letter to Santa Claus for me?
Well, I don't have much time.
I'm supposed to get down to the school auditorium and direct a Christmas play.
You write it, and I'll tell you what I want to say.
Okay, shoot.
Dear Santa Claus, how have you been?
Did you have a nice summer?
How is your wife?
I have been extra good this year...
...so I have a long list of presents that I want.
Oh, brother.
Please note the size and color of each item and send as many as possible.
If it seems too complicated, make it easy on yourself:
Just send money.
- How about 10s and 20s?
- Tens and 20s? Oh...
Even my baby sister.
All I want is what I have coming to me.
All I want is my fair share.
All right, quiet, everybody.
Our director will be here any minute and we'll start rehearsal.
- Director? What director?
- Charlie Brown.
- Oh, no, we're doomed.
- This will be the worst Christmas play ever.
Here he comes.
Attention, everyone, here's our director.
Booooooo.
Man's best friend.
Well, it's real good seeing y'all here.
As you know, we are going to put on the Christmas play.
Due to the shortage of time, we'll get right down to work.
One of the first things to insure a good performance...
...is strict attention to the director.
I'll keep my directions simple.
If I point to the right, it means focus attention stage right.
If I make a slashing motion across my throat...
...it means cut the scene short.
If I make a revolving motion with my hand, it means pick up the tempo.
If I spread my hands apart, it means slow down.
It's the spirit of the actors that counts, the interest that they show in their director.
Am I right? I said, am I right?
Stop the music! All right, now.
We're going to do this play and we're going to do it right.
Lucy, get those costumes and scripts and pass them out.
Now, the script girl will be handing out your parts.
You're the innkeeper's wife.
Do innkeepers' wives have naturally curly hair?
Pigpen, you're the innkeeper.
In spite of my outward appearance,
I shall try to run a neat inn.
Shermy, you're a shepherd.
Every Christmas it's the same.
I always end up playing a shepherd.
Snoopy, you'll have to be all the animals in our play.
- Can you be a sheep?
- Baa.
- How about a cow?
- Moo.
How about a penguin?
- Yes, he's even a good penguin.
- Ooow!
No, no, no.
Listen, all of you.
You've got to take direction.
You've got to have discipline.
You've gotta have respect for your director.
I ought to slug you.
Ugh. I've been kissed by a dog.
I have dog germs.
Get hot water, get some disinfectant, get some iodine.
- Waaah.
- Ah.
All right, all right, script girl, continue with the scripts.
Linus, you've got to get rid of that stupid blanket.
And here, memorize these lines.
I can't memorize these lines.
This is ridiculous.
Memorize it and be ready to recite when your cue comes.
I can't memorize something like this so quickly.
Why should I be put through such agony?
Give me one good reason why I should memorize this.
I'll give you five good reasons:
One, two, three, four, five.
Those are good reasons.
Christmas is not only getting too commercial...
...it's getting too dangerous.
And get rid of that stupid blanket.
What's a Christmas shepherd gonna look like...
...holding a stupid blanket like that?
Well, this is one Christmas shepherd...
...who's going to keep his trusty blanket with him.
See? You wouldn't hit an innocent shepherd, would you?
Okay, Mr. Director, the cast is set.
Take over.
All right, let's have it quiet.
Places, everybody.
Schroeder, set the mood for first scene.
Cut, cut. No, no, no.
Look, let's rehearse the scene at the inn.
- Frieda, this is...
- We can't go on. There's too much dust.
It's taking the curl out of my naturally curly hair.
Don't think of it as dust.
Think of it as maybe the soil of some great past civilization.
Maybe the soil of ancient Babylon.
It staggers the imagination.
He may be carrying soil that was trod upon by Solomon.
Or even Nebuchadnezzar.
It sort of makes you wanna treat me with more respect, doesn't it?
You're an absolute mess.
Just look at yourself.
On the contrary,
I didn't think I'd look that good.
Sally, come here.
- What do you want her for?
- She's gonna be your wife.
Good grief.
Isn't he the cutest thing?
He has the nicest sense of humor.
- Lunch break, lunch break.
- Lunch break?
All right, now, there's no time for foolishness.
We've got to get on with our play.
That's right. What about my part?
What about the Christmas queen, hmm?
Are you going to let all this beauty go to waste?
You do think I'm beautiful, don't you,
Charlie Brown?
You didn't answer me right away.
You had to think about it first, didn't you?
If you really had thought I was beautiful, you would've spoken right up.
I know when I've been insulted.
I know when I've been insulted.
Good grief.
All right, let's take it from the top again.
Places. Action.
Charlie Brown, isn't it a great play?
That does it.
Now, look, if we're ever to get this play off the ground...
...we've gotta have some cooperation.
What's the matter, Charlie Brown?
Don't you think it's great?
- It's all wrong.
- Look, Charlie, let's face it.
We all know that Christmas is a big commercial racket.
It's run by a big Eastern syndicate, you know.
Well, this is one play that's not gonna be commercial.
- Look, Charlie Brown, what do you want?
- The proper mood.
- We need a Christmas tree.
- Hey, perhaps a tree.
A great big, shiny, aluminum Christmas tree.
That's it, Charlie Brown. You get the tree.
I'll handle this crowd.
Okay. I'll take Linus with me.
The rest of you practice your lines.
Get the biggest aluminum tree you can find,
Charlie Brown, maybe painted pink.
Yeah, do something right for a change,
Charlie Brown.
I don't know, Linus. I just don't know.
Well, I guess we'd better concentrate on finding a nice Christmas tree.
I suggest we try those searchlights,
Charlie Brown.
This really brings Christmas close to a person.
Fantastic.
Gee, do they still make wooden Christmas trees?
This little green one here seems to need a home.
I don't know, Charlie Brown.
Remember what Lucy said?
This doesn't seem to fit the modern spirit.
I don't care.
We'll decorate it, and it'll be just right for our play.
Besides, I think it needs me.
This is the music I've selected for the Christmas play.
What kind of Christmas music is that?
Beethoven Christmas music.
What has Beethoven got to do with Christmas?
Everyone talks about how great Beethoven was.
Beethoven wasn't so great.
What do you mean,
Beethoven wasn't so great?
He never got his picture on bubble-gum cards, did he?
Have you ever seen his picture on a bubble-gum card?
- Hmm?
- How can you say someone is great...
...who's never had his picture on bubble-gum cards?
Good grief.
Say, by the way, can you play "Jingle Bells"?
No, no. I mean "Jingle Bells. "
You know, deck them halls and all that stuff.
No, no. You don't get it at all.
I mean "Jingle Bells. "
You know, Santa Claus and ho-ho-ho.
And mistletoe and presents to pretty girls.
That's it!
We're back.
Boy, are you stupid, Charlie Brown.
- What kind of a tree is that?
- You were supposed to get a good tree.
Can't you even tell a good tree from a poor tree?
I told you he'd goof it up.
He's not the kind you can depend on to do anything right.
- You're hopeless, Charlie Brown.
- Completely hopeless.
Rats.
You've been dumb before, Charlie Brown, but this time you really did it.
What a tree.
I guess you were right, Linus.
I shouldn't have picked this little tree.
Everything I do turns into a disaster.
I guess I really don't know what Christmas is all about.
Isn't there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?
Sure, Charlie Brown.
I can tell you what Christmas is all about.
Lights, please.
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field...
...keeping watch over their flock by night.
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them...
...and the glory of the Lord shone round about them...
...and they were sore afraid.
And the angel said unto them:
"Fear not, for, behold,
I bring you tidings of great joy...
...which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a savior...
...which is Christ the Lord.
And this shall be a sign unto you.
Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. "
And suddenly, there was with the angel...
...a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:
"Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth, peace, goodwill toward men. "
That's what Christmas is all about,
Charlie Brown.
For, behold,
I bring you tidings of great joy...
...which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day...
...in the city of David, a savior, which is Christ the Lord.
And this shall be a sign unto you.
Linus is right.
I won't let all this commercialism ruin my Christmas.
I'll take this little tree home and decorate it...
...and I'll show them it really will work in our play.
First prize?
Oh, well.
This commercial dog is not going to ruin my Christmas.
I've killed it. Oh...
Everything I touch gets ruined.
I never thought it was such a bad little tree.
It's not bad at all, really.
Maybe it just needs a little love.
Charlie Brown is a blockhead, but he did get a nice tree.
What's going on here?
Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown.

I suppose it all started with the snow.
You see, it's a very special kind of snow.
A snow to make the happy happier and the giddy even giddier.
A snow to make a homecoming homier and natural enemies friends, naturally.
For it was the first snow of the season.
And as any child can tell you, there's a certain magic to the very first snow...
...鰖ellikle Noel arifesinde ya瘕yorsa. especially when it falls on the day before Christmas.
For when the first snow is also a Christmas snow, well, something wonderful is bound to happen![Laughing]
[Ruler tapping] Children, back to your seats. The snow can wait.
Now, now. I've hired professor
Hinkle, the magician, to entertain at today's class
Christmas party, so pay attention!
Now, Professor Hinkle was just about the worst magician in the world.
And so, I put the magic eggs in to my hat.
Abracadabra, to coin a phrase... [Laugh]
And voila the eggs have turned in to...
Messy messy messy.
[Children groan]
Where IS that rabbit?
Hocus Pocus! Where are you?
Bah, the only thing this hat's good for is the trash can!
[Children laugh]
[Bell rings][Children cheer]
[Hinkle grumbles]
Hey, look at the snow! It's cold and snowy!
It's the best kind of snow! [etc.]
We're building a snowman, Karen.
You make the head!
The head is the most difficult part, ask anyone!
What will we call him?
Should we call him Harold? Nah.
[Mumbling]? Oh, No.
Oatmeal? Oatmeal?!
How about... Frosty?
Frosty?
Yeah! Frosty it is. Frosty the snowman!
[Cheers]
[Frosty the snowman, what a happy, jolly soul.
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.]
Frosty the snow -
Come back here, you!
Happy Birthday!
That hat brought Frosty to life.
It must be magic.
Magic? My hat, magic?
Just look.
If that hat is magic, I want it back.
But it's not yours anymore!
You threw it away!
Don't talk back to your elders, you naughty naughty little girl.
And you, stay in there, or there will be no carrots for Christmas.
But you can't take that hat back, it brought Frosty to life
You saw it happen!
I saw nothing of the kind.
I saw nothing of the kind.
[Chattering]
Quiet, I can't lose that hat if it's really got magic now!
It'll make me a billionaire magician!
But we saw Frosty come to life, didn't we? Uh-huh, we sure did.
You silly children believe everything you see.
When you're grown up you'll realize that snowmen can't come to life.
But we -
Silly, silly silly!
Aw, Frosty, we don't care what grown-ups say, we know you DID come to life.
We know, Frosty. We just know.
#Frosty the snowman, was a jolly, happy soul.
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.
# Frosty the snowman is a fairy-tale they say.
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day.
Now, of course, the hat did belong to
Frosty and the children.
That part must be made very clear.
Therefore, Hocus Pocus was entirely in the right in what he was about to do.
Well, Hocus Pocus raced back to the children just as fast as he could.
[Hocus Pocus whistles]
Look! The hat's back. Let's see if it will make Frosty alive again.
Happy Birthday!
Hey, I said my first words...
But snowmen can't talk.
Alright, come on now, what's the joke.
Could I really be alive?
I mean, I can make words, I can move.
I can juggle, I can sweep, I can count to 10.
Well, I can count to 5. [laughing]
What do you know? I'm even ticklish.
In fact, I'm all living. I am alive!
What a neat thing to happen to a nice guy like me. [Children cheer]
#There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found.
# For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around.
# Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be and the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me.
Uh oh...
What's the matter, Frosty?
Whew, is there a thermometer around here?
Over there on the wall, why?
Oh, I was afraid of that. The thermomter is getting red. I hate red thermometers.
Why, Frosty?
'Cause when the thermometer gets all reddish, the temperature goes up.
And when the temperature goes up,
I start to melt. And when I start to melt...
I get all wishy washy!
Then you've gotta go some place where you'll never melt.
The only place I'd never melt is the north pole.
Then we've got to get you there!
Yeah, we'll take you downtown to the railroad station and put you on a train.
Great, I always wanted to see the town.
Let's make a party out of it!
Let's have a parade!
# Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day, so he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away.
# Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand, running here and there all around the square, saying catch me if you can.
Come on kids, follow the leader!
# He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop, and he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop.
[Cop blows whistle] Stop. Stop. Stop!
Alright, didn't you see that traffic light?
What's a traffic light?
Up there on the lamp post!
What's a lamp post?
Oh, do you want a ticket, wise guy?
I'd love one, to the north pole, please!
You've got to excuse him, sir.
Alright, didn't you see that traffic light?
You see, he just came to life and he doesn't know much about such things.
Oh, well, okay, if he just came to life.
[Cop blows whistle] Move along!
Them silly snowmen. Once they come to life they don't know nothing.
Come to life?! [Soft whistling]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
We'd like a ticket to the north pole please.
Hmm... What? Yes.
The north pole? Oh, yes ma'am.
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]
Route you by the way of
Saskatchewan, Hudson Bay,
Nome Alaska, the Klondike, and Aurora Borealis!
Gotta make a change at
Nanuk of the Northville.
That'll be $3,000 and four cents, including tax.
Oh, but we don't have any money...
No money!?
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]
No money, no ticket! [Slam!]
[Sad music plays]
Now I'll never get to the north pole.
Oh, Frosty, you just can't melt!
Oh, Karen, don't you get all slushy too.
What is it, Hocus? Out the window?
A refrigerated boxcar on a train headed north.
You'll be safe there, Frosty! Come on!
It's full of ice cream and frozen Christmas cakes.
What a neat way to travel!
[Whistle blows]
Hurry up, Frosty, the train is pulling out!
Are you coming to the north pole, too?
I'm sure my mother won't mind, as long as I'm home in time for supper.
[Whistle blows]
# Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way, but he waved goodbye saying don't cry. I'll be back again some day.
I must get that hat back.
Think, nasty, think, nasty, think nasty. [Evil laughter].
# He'll be back again some daaaaaaaaaay.
Now actually, a refrigerated boxcar is a splendid way to travel.
Splendid that is... if one is a snowman or a furry coated rabbit.
But for Karen...
[Sneeze] Are you cold, Karen?
Now that's a silly question.
You wouldn't be sneezing if you weren't cold.
Well... just... just a lit... little.
[Sneeze]
Frosty realized that Karen had to get out of that car as soon as possible.
So when the little freight train stopped to let an express full of happy
Christmas travelers pass,
Frosty took advantage of the opportunity and quickly got them all off.
Oh, you tricked me! No fair!
The only thing professor Hinkle could do was make a jump for it.
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]
[Howling wind]
Frosty wanted to get as far away as he could before Hinkle woke up.
[Hocus' teeth chatter]
[Sneeze]
But the woods through which they traveled were still bitterly cold.
Hocus, I've got to get Karen all warmed up or she's a gonner!
I can't make a fire. Oh boy, that's one thing I really can't do.
I guess we just better keep moving until we find somebody who can.
Then suddenly they came upon a tiny glen which seemed almost magical.
For it was Christmas eve and the woodland animals were all decorating for their big celebration.
They knew Santa was to come that night and they wanted everything to be just right.
Hocus, speak to the animals.
See if they won't all pitch in and build a fire for Karen.
[Squeaky noises]
The animals were delighted to help. so they found a spot away from the glen where the fire wouldn't catch on to the trees.
Soon there was a spark and in almost no time a splendid fire was crackling away.
Frosty was careful to stay far away from the flames.
Hocus, we've got to find someone to help Karen get home before she freezes.
And me to the north pole before I melt, but who?
No, not the Marines.
No, not the president of the United States.
Oh, they were both swell ideas, but we've got to find someone nearby.
Yeah, Santa Claus. That's a great idea.
Why didn't I think of that before?
Hocus, you go back with the animals and when Santa comes, you bring him right here.
Understand?
Hurry now!
So Frosty kept a silent vigil, waiting patiently all through the night until Santa would arrive.
But suddenly...
Oh, a campfire.
Well isn't that all snug and comfy?
[Evil laughter]
[Professor Hinkle blows]
No! Don't!
Now give me that hat or else!
Or else what?
Well don't bother me with details, give me that hat!
Get on my shoulders, Karen!
You see, Frosty, since he was made of snow himself was the fastest belly-whopper in the world.
And old professor Hinkle was soon far outdistanced.
And now it was Frosty's good fortune that right at the bottom of the hill was a tiny greenhouse used to grow precious tropical poinsettias for Christmas.
It's got to be all warm and snug inside for those Christmas flowers to grow so beautiful.
Let's go in.
Oh, but, but you will melt!
Just a little. I'll only stay inside for a minute.
Besides, I've been meaning to take off a little weight anyway.
Whew, stay in here much longer and
I'll really make a splash in the world.
Now I've got you, and the minute you're all melted the hat will be mine! [Evil laughter]
Santa had arrived but was he too late?
Hocus explained the situation to Santa, who (as you know) speaks a fluent rabbit.
And when they didn't find
Frosty and Karen on the hill...
Santa followed Frosty's path in the snow to the greenhouse.
But when they got inside, a terrible sight met their eyes.
[Karen weeping]
[Sad music plays]
# (Very slowly) Frosty the snowman was a happy, jolly soul with a corn-cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal.
They were too late.
Too late? Why, nonsense!
Don't cry, Karen.
Frosty's not gone for good.
You see, he was made out of Christmas snow and Christmas snow can never disappear completely.
Oh, it sometimes goes away for almost a year at a time and takes the form of
Spring and Summer rain, but you can bet your boots that when a good jolly
December wind kisses it, it will turn in to Christmas snow all over again!
Yes, but he was my friend.
[Chuckle] Just watch.
Wait a minute!
I want that hat and I want it now!
Don't you dare touch that!
And just what are YOU going to do about it?
If you so much as lay a finger on the brim,
I'll never bring you another
Christmas present as long as you live.
Never?
Never!
No more trick cards or magic balls or...
No more anything.
Oh, that's not fair.
I mean, we evil magicians have to make a living too.
Now you go home and write "I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty" a hundred zillion times.
And then maybe, just maybe, mind you... you'll find something in your stocking tomorrow morning.
A new hat maybe?
Oh, yes sir. Goodbye everyone.
Sorry to lose and run, but I've got to get busy writing.
Busy busy busy!
Come on, Frosty, we're all waiting for you.
Happy Birthday!
#Frosty the snowman is a fairy-tale they say.
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day.
And so Santa took Karen home and made ready to bring Frosty back to the north pole.
Karen hated to say goodbye to Frosty, but as Santa promised, Frosty returned every year with the magical Christmas snow.
And every year there was a great celebration with a great Christmas parade.
#Thumpity thump thump thumpity thump. Look at that Frosty go.
Thumpity thump thump thumpity thump. Over the hills of snow.
#Frosty the snowman, was a jolly, happy soul.
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.
And with Frosty the snowman,
Christmas was always very merry indeed.
You have a merry Christmas too!
#Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way, but he waved goodbye saying don't you cry.
I'll be back on Christmas day!
