Comrade Senior Lieutenant!
What is it?
We detained someone... The lieutenant told me to bring him to you.
Light the lamp.
He was crouching in the river, near the bank.
He won't say why, nor answer any questions.
He says he'll only talk to the commander.
He must be very weak, or just pretending.
The second lieutenant's ordered to bring him here.
Stand by the stove.
Who are you?
First, send him out.
Wait outside. I'll call you.
Well? Say something.
Where are you from?
I'm Bondarev.
Tell number 51 at HQ that I'm here.
And who's number 51?
What HQ do you mean?
What army?
Code address: VCH-49550.
Come on, strip and rub yourself down.
Here. Take it, it's dirty, anyway.
Take off your pants, too.
Don't be bashful.
What's that on your back?
Answer me!
None of your business.
And don't shout at me.
You just tell HQ I'm here.
They'll know what to do.
Don'tyou teach me.
You know where you are?
I never heard of you.
You'll stay here until you tell me who you are and where you are from.
Are you going to speak?
If you want me to report aboutyou, tell me where you are from.
- I'm from the other bank.
- What?
And how did you get here? Can you prove thatyou're from the other bank?
I don't have to prove anything.
And stop questioning me!
Or you'll answer for it.
Tell number 51 at HQ that Bondarev's here. Now!
They'll know what to do.
Number 3?
Comrade Captain, number 8 reporting.
I've got Bondarev here.
- Who?
- Bondarev.
He demands that I notify "Volga".
You mean Major Bondarev?
From the operations unit?
No, he's not a major.
A kid about twelve years old.
Are you kidding? What's the matter with you? Are you sober?
Well, I thought... Comrade Captain, he says he came from the other side.
Did he get here on the magic carpet?
He's just snowjobbing you.
Tell him that if he doesn't notify number 51, he'll be held responsible.
See? I reported aboutyou as you have asked me to.
I was told to lock you up.
I asked you to tell number 51 at HQ.
And who'd you ring up?
You expect me to personally contactArmy HQ?
- Let me do it, then.
- Don'tyou dare!
Who are you going to ring up?
Who d'you know atArmy HQ?
Captain Kholin and Colonel Gryaznov.
Tell Colonel Gryaznov I'm here. Now.
Or I'll do it myself.
"Baikal", get me number 51 at "Volga".
Comrade Colonel,
Senior Lieutenant Galtsev reporting.
I got Bondarev here. He demands...
Bondarev? Is he alone?
Galtsev!
Listen carefully, Galtsev.
No questions. No talking.
You got me?
Kholin!
Kholin's already on his way to pick him up. Meanwhile, be nice to him.
See that he's comfortable.
Mind you, he has a hot temper.
And give him a pencil and paper.
Anything he writes send to me immediately.
- You got me?
- Yes, sir!
Are you hungry?
I'll eat later.
I won't look.
Get me number 13.
Vassiliev, bring in two pails of hot water.
What? Yes, I'm going to have a bath.
Go on, wash up. I'll be back soon.
Thanks.
It's deep!
Of course it is.
If a well is deep, you can see a star in it even in the daytime.
Which star?
Any star.
- I see it, mom!
- Yes, there it is.
Why is it shining?
Because it's nighttime for the star.
That's why it's shining.
Is it really nighttime now?
No, it's daytime.
It's daytime for you and me, but it's nighttime for the star.
Mommy!
Haven't they come yet?
No. Go back to sleep.
I'll wake you up when they come.
Were you here while I was asleep?
Yes. Why?
Did I talk in my sleep?
No. Why?
Never mind.
I never used to talk in my sleep.
Now I don't know.
I've become jittery.
Ivan!
Kholin!
Katasonych is waiting for you at the hollowtree, and you're here.
The nazis are there.
So I swam.
I had cramps, and nearly drowned.
- You mean you swam across?
- Yes. Don't get angry.
They're patrolling the bank.
I couldn't find our boat in the dark.
They could catch me.
You got so skinny.
Just a bag of bones.
Go and bring the car up close.
Tell the sentry not to let anyone in.
Here, put this on.
Go on.
Stop!
Where have you been?
- Where are you going?
- For kerosene.
What for? We're leaving.
Here's to our meeting!
Kholin, Katasonych is still waiting for me at the hollowtree.
To his safe return!
Number 2 here.
This is number 51. Malyshev, remember, you had an argument?
They were right. We should take the Fyodorovka direction.
But we've already decided...
Save your breath, I've heard it all.
- May I come in, Colonel?
- Yes, come in.
- What?
- I said I've heard it.
I have absolutely reliable, first-hand information.
Waited all night for nothing, eh,
Katasonych?
Sit down.
Ivan's here.
He couldn't get to the bank at the hollowtree.
He says there are German patrols everywhere.
- How did he get here?
- He swam across.
Jesus!
A grown man might've drowned.
Well, that's it.
Enough of a good thing.
Wait, Ivan!
Comrade Colonel, why?
He said I'll be sent to the rear.
To a military school, by your order.
Is that true?
Why did you do it? You deceived me.
An offensive is being planned.
I can still be useful.
You yourself said that reconnaissance is most important!
That scouts are the soul of the front.
You were trying to trick me!
I'm not going! And if you force me to,
I'll run away.
I'll join the partisans.
Ivan, you're going to a military school. You got me?
And stop arguing.
I won't discuss it.
But I will!
Kholin, tell him I'll do a good job,
I'll be useful.
I just can't...
You tell him, Katasonych,
I can't go to the rear!
The matter is closed!
All right... Military school, or a children's home, it's all the same to me.
Be quiet...
The stove and chimney will stand forever.
Where is it?
I put it here.
Are you going far?
Yes.
Right.
Everybody's going far nowadays.
But why?
Who knows?
I lost a nail.
Could you help me find it?
You have nothing to do, anyway.
Come in.
The stove and chimney will never burn down.
Here's a straight nail.
No, it won't do.
Where's your ma? Alive?
A nazi shot my old woman, too.
Where can it be?
I saw it a minute ago.
He was a tall fellow...
He wore glasses.
And had long hair.
- What's your name?
- Ivan.
Pelageya will be back soon...
That's my wife's name.
I'll have the house all ready for her.
Ivan!
Why'd you run away, Vanya?
You think I have nothing better to do than chasing after you?
I didn't ask you to.
Don't talk back at me. Look at him, he wants to join the partisans!
Get into the car!
You won't run away again.
Yes, I will.
I said get into the car!
I'll run away from that military school, just like I did from the children's home.
"I ran away from Granny,
And from Granddad, too..."
O Lord, will this ever end?
Vanya, can'tyou understand, silly, that war is for grown men?
You promised you won't issue that order!
Lyakhov and Moroz were killed because they were big. I can get through.
Besides, I'm all alone.
You know I have no family left.
That's enough, Vanya.
It's been decided.
Nothing is decided!
You're not my dad to decide.
Shut up!
Or I'll spank you.
I'll run away anyway, if you don't let me go.
I'm my own boss.
Indeed!
You're my pain in the neck.
D'you knowthat there's lice in Company 5?
The linen isn't disinfected properly.
Do something about it.
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant!
The situation is out of control.
Yes, sir.
There'll be no time for that when the offensive begins.
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant!
Thank you, Comrade Senior Lieutenant.
- A letter from home?
- Yes.
- Everything all right?
- Yes.
Greetings!
I've been looking for you.
Carry on. I'll wait here.
You're a commander. You must be strict with your subordinates.
Butyou try to do everything yourself.
There's a lull now, and we have time.
When the offensive starts, there'll be the wounded.
I don't know what to do aboutyou.
Since you're a commander, get the medical service in order.
You've got two days. Then report back to me.
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant.
Don't worry.
Everything'll be... in order.
What's your name, Lieutenant?
- Masha.
- That's a pretty name.
My name's Leonid.
Lennie for short.
Have you ever had a boyfriend called Lennie?
- No.
- So I'm the first?
Are you from the Ukraine?
- Why?
- You're beautiful and stubborn.
No, I come from near Moscow.
Peredelkino. Twenty minutes by train.
In Siberia, where I come from,
300 km is considered "near".
Surikov, the painter, used to live in our town. Ever heard of him?
And in our town, writers used to live.
We once saw Alexei Tolstoy.
And Korney Chukovsky.
He's very tall, with a white head.
They were walking in the woods.
- Were you ever wounded?
- Yes, I was.
Why are we so formal?
Let's be on first name basis.
- I find it hard to so quickly.
- And I don't.
I'll start now, and you start gradually, okay?
- What is it?
- A cobweb!
So what? Aren'tyou a brave soldier!
Some brave commander!
I'm only afraid of spiders.
Nothing else?
Vassiliev!
Have you seen Captain Kholin?
He went that way with the doctor's assistant.
Walk the trunk! You said you're not afraid of anything.
Well, I will.
That's enough.
Jump! I'll catch you.
Got scared?
Then why don'tyou?
No special reason.
So you were frightened?
All right, I forgive you.
I don't need your forgiveness.
You don't?
- Let me help you.
- I'll manage.
She'll manage!
Come here, Masha.
What for?
Come on, Masha, come here.
What for?
Come here, quick!
Hurry!
Now go away...
Go away, Masha.
You hear me, Masha? Go!
Go away quick, Masha...
Let's go and have a look atyour troops.
There they are, Lyakhov and Moroz.
Go have a smoke.
- Good morning!
- Hello, Katasonych.
Galtsev, give me the defense line map.
Wait for me in your "underground".
I'll be right back.
Comrade Senior Lieutenant, the gunners gave me a record.
They say you have a gramophone.
Could we listen to it?
- The gramophone's broken.
- I'll fix it.
Thanks, Katasonych.
This place is best, Captain.
But where will we land?
What d'you say, Katasonych?
In those bushes.
It's a safe place.
Only be sure to tell the gunners to leave us a corridor.
WELCOME
Damn! Couldn'tyou have dug a deeper one?
D'you know who's sitting there, on the other bank?
I know.
Then why can'tyou bring them here?
It'll take but an hour.
- Have you got any boats?
- No.
You're lying.
- What for?
- I need them.
You are not even good at lying.
- They're for the landing party.
- That's what I need them for.
Are you and Katasonych planning a scouting mission?
No, a picnic with your gramophone.
Will Ivan go again?
Ivan, Ivan...
I'm not an information bureau.
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.
You've got a pretty doctor's assistant.
I'm sending her away.
She can't cope with the job.
Aren'tyou severe, Galtsev!
Have a heart.
War is a man's business.
It's not for girls.
All right, go. I don't need you here.
Some man!
Excuse me, are you Masha?
Yes.
Don'tyou remember me?
No, I don't.
We took the college entrance exams together.
Yes... now I do.
I'm so glad I metyou!
Me, too.
I'm glad I saw you.
Where'd you go after the exams?
I looked everywhere...
Now I've found you, Masha.
I'm coming!
I've found you!
We'll meet again, won't we?
We'll meet again, Masha!
We'll meet again!
WELCOME
Captain!
- That's you, Katasonych!
- We are here.
- Good.
Hello, Kholin!
- Hello, Ivan!
Ivan?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Give us a hand, Galtsev.
- Hello, Katasonov!
- Hello, sir!
Give us something interesting,
Galtsev, some magazines.
With lots of pictures.
Come here.
- Here. This one's about scouts.
- I've read it.
- How about this one?
- This one, too.
- And this one?
- This, too.
- You're lying!
- I'm not.
I was stuck at HQ all this time.
I did nothing but read for 3 days.
I gotyou a spring for the gramophone at HQ.
Thanks, Katasonych.
It's under the bed.
- What's this, so big?
- An art book. Captured material.
- Any pictures in it?
- It's all pictures.
Give it to me.
You should've listened to him sprechen.
Like a real Fritz.
I wanted to make him an interpreter, now he's in command of a battalion.
Look!
Are these Germans?
Yes, it's an old engraving.
They're Germans, all the same.
Look at this skinny one on a horse.
I saw one just like him on a motorcycle.
Look, they're killing the people here, too.
It's just a painting.
No...
I knowthem.
Who is this? A German?
He's either a German doctor, or writer.
They have no writers.
I sawthem burning books on the square.
They poured petrol over them and set them on fire.
There was soot in the air for a week after that.
This writer lived about 400 years ago.
Well, then maybe...
If they spot us, our gunners will keep them down.
We'll leave Ivan a passage in the swamp.
I retreat last.
Got it?
What's this?
I think I'd better take one of Galtsev's boats.
- Will you take me along?
- Where to?
To the other bank.
A volunteer, eh?
Can you swim?
Don'tyou worry. I can swim this river and back 5 times.
What a hero.
Are you trigger-happy, too?
Stop it.
You see? He's so touchy.
No self-control.
How can I take you across?
- Then you don't get a boat.
- We'll commandeer it.
Or I'll reportyou to the Commander, and you'll bring it to us on your back.
Come on, stop it.
He'll give us a boat.
Am I right?
All right. Let's go have a look.
You stay here and rest up.
Wow! What a knife!
Listen, Galtsev, would you give it to me?
I would, Vanya, but...
Don't be a miser. Give it to him.
This is a memento.
It was my buddy's. He was killed.
- Let me have it till tonight.
- All right.
Why should I go with you? You're not taking me across, right?
Come on. I'll take you, but not today. After the war.
It's okay now.
We'll listen to it after supper.
I'll getyou a knife just like it.
I'll get one tomorrow.
By all means.
Where're his parents?
- Whose?
- Ivan's.
I don't know. They say his mother and sister were killed.
His dad was a border guard.
I guess he was killed in action.
Really?
He's been through more than you can imagine.
He was a partisan, too.
He knocked about the world.
What'll become of him?
The colonel or Katasonych will adopt him when the war's over.
Why them and notyou?
I would, but the colonel says
I need some upbringing myself.
Katasonych!
He's really good at stealing boats.
He'll never take a bad one.
Tell us, Galtsev, how many owners have you ripped off?
- Which one?
- Take this one.
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
He should be sent to the rear.
A war is no place for children.
Stop it, will you?
You see, Lieutenant, if we don't take him across, he'll go on his own.
All he can think of... is vengeance.
Don't waste your breath explaining.
They can't see here beyond their nose.
Didn'tyou say you wanted to adopt him, and now...
What's the matter with you?
Get lost! We'll manage withoutyou.
That's not the way to do it.
- All right, Kholin.
- Don't Kholin me!
The colonel is right.
You do need upbringing.
Watch out, or I'll reportyou to the commander.
Well... keep cool.
That's the main thing.
Slowly... carefully.
And remember, we have to get him alive.
Got it?
THERE ARE 8 OF US.
ALL UNDER 19.
IN AN HOUR FROM NOW
THEY'LL SHOOT US.
AVENGE US.
Hurrah!
Surround the building!
Don't let him out!
Hands up! Come out!
So you're hiding!
You can't hide from me!
Are you shaking?
You'll answer for everything!
I'II...
D'you think I've forgotten?
I'll putyou on trial!
I'II... I'II...
Want some tea,
Comrade Captain.
Damn! It was our best boat!
You're lucky to be alive.
Forget the boat.
Faster! Hurry!
Can you hurry up?
Ivan!
Don't be afraid. It'll be over soon.
What is it, Ivan?
I'm not afraid.
I hear you were a partisan.
- Why'd you leave them?
- We were surrounded in the woods.
They sent me out by plane to a boarding school.
But I ran away.
They're just wasting food there.
Memorizing names of reptiles.
Yeah, that's not for you. You ought to go to a military school.
Did Kholin make you say so?
Why Kholin?
He's not the only one with brains.
I think so, too.
You've done your fighting.
Rest up, go back to school.
Whoever's of use doesn't rest up in wartime.
Right. But war isn't for boys.
Not for boys?
Have you been to Trostyanets?
- Where?
- That's a death camp.
Why are you teaching me?
What do you know?
You're all together in it.
Smoking again?
Go on, smoke.
It'll turn you lungs green.
So what?
Nobody can see them.
- I don't wantyou to smoke.
- Okay, I won't.
We'll start out in an hour and a half.
Let's have supper.
- Where's Katasonych?
- He was summoned to HQ.
Why didn't he stop by to wish me good luck?
He couldn't. It was an emergency.
Why'd they summon him?
They know how badly we need him.
And they summoned him all the same.
A fine friend! He could've stopped by.
Will it be just the two of us?
The three of us. He'll go, too.
Stop grinning. And don't stare at me.
You volunteered, didn'tyou?
Are you frightened now?
No, I'm not. It's sort of unexpected.
Unexpected...
Everything in life is.
- May I come in?
- Yes.
What's up?
We billeted the new men, Lieutenant.
- Where?
- In Companies Two and Three.
- Very well. You may go.
- Yes, sir.
I wouldn't take you, but it's an emergency.
Make up your mind.
No complaints afterwards.
What d'you think I am?
All right.
Who'll you leave in command?
I think, Guschin, of Company 5.
If they learn you crossed the river without permission... we'll be in trouble.
Although it won't take more than two or three hours.
AVENGE US
Wake up, Ivan!
Do you hear? It's time.
Katasonych didn't even stop by.
I told you he couldn't.
You know how he loves you.
Don'tyou?
I know.
But still, he could have...
Here. Get dressed.
- Need any help?
- No.
Let's jump.
To see if anything rattles.
Dump your matches.
Are you crazy?
Crews, take your positions.
Go chat with the sentry so he won't notice us... Got it?
And no comments!
Got a light?
Who's that?
It was all so stupid...
They brought the boat here and had a smoke...
The captain was here.
He was over there...
He started climbing out of the trench.
And then he slid back down.
We didn't even hear a shot.
The captain shook him up:
"Katasonych! Katasonych!"
But he was dead.
The captain said to leave him here... till morning.
Don't discuss it.
Get the oars.
Who's that?
Who's that, Kholin?
That's our men.
Lyakhov and Moroz.
They went across after you.
There's still time.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Come over here. It's dryer here.
- Makes no difference now.
MG-34.
- Are you nervous?
- A bit.
I've become jittery lately.
Can't get used to begging.
They should be buried.
- Who?
- Lyakhov and Moroz.
Sure, we'll do it.
Quiet! Everything's tiptop.
Let's go.
This is the place, guys.
- How do you feel?
- Fine.
- Well, I'll be going.
- I'll go a part of the way with you.
No, you're too big. They'll catch on.
Let me go.
The gully's clayey. You'll leave footprints. I'll carry you over.
I said I'm going alone.
- See you soon.
- See you.
I'll see you.
Be careful.
If the offensive starts, meet us in Fyodorovka. Got it?
- See you soon.
- Goodbye, Vanya.
What's up?
I want a smoke.
- Wantyour mommy, too?
- Cut it out. l, for one, really do want my ma.
Won't it be good, eh?
- They'll notice the boat!
- What if they spot Ivan?
Are you a louse, or plain stupid?
Just stupid.
See a doctor aboutyour nerves when the war's over.
Damn! It's a clayey gully!
What we need now is a good rain to wash away all footprints.
I think he made it.
Wait here for me.
I'll go for the boat.
When I come back, call out to me in German.
- Try it.
- Halt!
If I'm caught, swim back.
You said you could swim this river and back five times.
What if you're wounded?
Don't worry about me.
Halt!
Quiet!
Damn you! Come here!
Hurry up!
Is that them?
Yes.
Them yesterday, us today.
Climb in.
- Are things quiet on the bank?
- Yes.
See? Nothing to fear.
Where are you going?
Why aren't we going back?
It's the first snow of the year.
Kholin!
What if he hasn't passed yet?
He might still be hiding, waiting.
Jump in the water!
Let's drink to...
May I come in,
Comrade Senior Lieutenant?
Masha!
Who were you talking to on the road the other day?
- Your friend?
- Yes, my friend.
The one... that wore glasses?
He wasn't wearing glasses.
But he was!
He is strange.
No, he isn't.
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- I've come to say goodbye.
I'm transferring her to a hospital.
That's a good idea.
Masha!
How quiet it is, Galtsev.
Isn't it, Masha?
It's so quiet.
The war...
Brothers!
Victory!
IMPERIAL CHANCELLERY
I can take you there.
- Is it far from here?
- No, it's not far.
Come closer.
Can you identify these bodies?
He says he can.
It's Goebbels, his wife and daughters.
He poisoned his family with potassium cyanide and ordered his body to be soaked with petrol... and burned.
He can show you the place.
At night he murdered his wife, children, and himself...
I see. Let's go.
Won't this be the last war on earth?
You're too nervous, Galtsev.
See a doctor aboutyour nerves.
But, Kholin, wait...
You were killed.
And I'm alive.
I must not forget it.
Shot.
Hanged.
Shot.
Hanged.
Shot.
Shot.
Hanged.
Hanged.
Shot.
Hanged.
The End
If you remember Pearl Harbor... you'll recall that in the year that followed... the Japanese were almost invincible.
Early in 1943, however, they were checked.
Stopped cold by the Marines at Guadalcanal... the Navy in the Coral Sea... and the Allied armies in New Guinea.
This was a period of far-reaching decisions, desperate strategies... and incredibly daring counter-strokes... not the least of which involved... two bright young naval officers.
This bold, slightly improbable adventure began with a message... authorized by the Commanding General,
South West Pacific Area... and flashed by top priority to the lone carrier on patrol in the Coral Sea.
It was an urgent request for a particularly qualified young officer... to lead an extremely delicate missi髇.
It demanded a man... a man of executive ability and high intelligence... and that innate quality that enables a man to swiftly estimate a situation... and make a wise decisi髇.
In bestowing that most thrilling of all awards, an officer's first command... the Navy knew it had a man that would ask no questions and offer no excuses.
He would carry out orders regardless of what obstacles fate put in his path.
Well...
Within the hour, with high hopes and only a mild headache...
Lieutenant Rip Crandall was on his way... to a secret anchorage, a hidden harbor, so shrouded in mystery... that it was known only as
"somewhere in the South Pacific. "
Here, the U.S. Seventh Fleet, victors of the Coral Sea... drowsed at anchor, licking their wounds and dreaming of the great battles to come.
And here, the Lieutenant saw his passport to high adventure.
Here, somewhere among the flotillas of destroyers... their vital supply and repair ships... among stalwart battlewagons of the Nevada class, carriers... deadly cruisers of the Boise class, escorts, and tenders of all classes... he found the ship of his dreams, the Echo... in, well, a class by itself.
While at first glance, it might have looked like England's reply... to the Boston Tea Party... it had nevertheless had a distinguished career in the copra trade.
The Navy had not only gratefully received it from New Zealand... as a sort of reverse lend-lease, but had taken great pains... to man it with a picked crew of specialists.
Dedicated, highly skilled seamen... who chafed at inactivity here in this quiet backwater far from the battle lines... and awaited only the arrival of their commander to swing into action.
Duck!
Bring that gear aboard.
Welcome aboard, sir.
What? Belay that racket!
You want the whole flotilla to hear us?
What is this?
Honors for the prospective commanding officer, sir.
The officer in commissi髇 shall see that all honors and ceremonies-
This hulk is commissioned? As what?
- It's unclassified, sir.
- I can believe that.
Duck!
Sorry, sir. All right, bear a hand, there.
Let's get that thing in port and secure it!
- Johnson?
- Yes, sir?
I'm sorry, sir, but we've only been aboard a couple of hours.
- How many men have you lost so far?
- None, sir, just a few cuts and bruises.
Don't forget Miller, sir.
Yeah. Yeoman Miller, sir.
Transferred to the hospital ship.
He's a real nut, sir.
I told him to look out for the hatch, and he thought I wanted a match, and...
Thanks, Johnson.
You can take this man below and show him where to stow his gear.
All right, sir.
What is all this malarkey about this ship being commissioned?
It's true, sir. Admiral Hathaway had me commissi髇 her... and sign her over to you.
The papers are in your stateroom.
My what?
Your cabin. You can go right ahead.
I'll bring your gear along.
Yes. Just leave it there.
Sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
I meant to warn you about these beams.
You gotta watch it.
- What did you say your name was?
- Tommy.
Sorry, sir. Hanson, sir. Ensign Thomas J.
Let's sit down.
My name is Crandall. Rip Crandall.
I know that. I'd have recognized you, even if they hadn't told me.
You know me from someplace?
Balboa. The California Yacht Club.
You were getting ready for the Honolulu race in '39.
What did you do? Crew for me? Or...
I tried to, sir.
You're not the kid that fouled up the genoa jib?
Oh, gee.
I remember
I was a little rough with you that day.
- Didn't I chase you up the mast?
- Yes, sir.
You said I didn't know enough to pour water out of a boot.
Boot. That was nice.
You were right, sir.
I nearly wrecked your ship.
But I've studied a lot about sailing ever since. That's why I volunteered.
You volunteered? What? For this?
Yes, sir. I had a desk job here at the base... and when Cmd. Vandewater told me about this-
Vandewater? Not Wilbur Vandewater?
I don't know. Kind of slim, blond hair.
And a blackguard Nazi! That nose-
- Sir?
- What does he do here?
- Flight secretary to the Admiral.
- Yes, he would be.
You have to take him those clearance papers when you've signed them.
- This ship's not officially yours until you do.
- lt isn't?
You're right. It isn't.
I'll get the ship's boat in the water so you can take it.
Do that, Bill. Tommy. Wait a minute.
You got a copy of the Navy regs?
- ln the top left-hand drawer, sir.
- Thank you.
Anything wrong?
No. It's just that I do everything by the book, you know.
Your gear, sir.
I already got that gaff secured.
The gaff. Chief.
Watch...
For your information, it's not a gaff, it's a boom. The main boom.
Yeah. Sorry, sir.
Mr. Hanson has been teaching us.
The gaff is the...
The spar that, on this ship, you would bend the head of the foresail to.
You didn't make your rate in sail?
No, sir. But do you think the rest of these clowns know anything...
Beg pardon, sir.
My last hitch was on The Hamill, the tender alongside, sir.
- And you volunteered, too?
- ln a manner of speaking, yes.
That is, no, sir.
You'd see it in my record anyway.
It was this, or else.
Else what?
Chief Svenson started his fifth hitch.
And the Chief's mess gave him kind of a testimonial... and I figured a party is no good without entertainment... and they got this girl dancer at the tavern.
I see.
Nothing like that, sir.
Her husband came with her.
Only...
Only it's wartime, and unauthorized civilian personnel... are not allowed on naval installations.
Particularly tenders, the skipper said.
So he gave me my choice of being busted or grabbing the first ship out.
So, you volunteered. What, the first...
- The first ship out?
- That's what they said, sir.
- I've got to get out of here. Pardon me.
- Sir!
All clear? Lower away together.
If you don't mind, I'd just as soon you didn't mention it to Mr. Hanson.
He really believes I did volunteer, and he's kind of young and eager... and you know?
Let go of the after fall.
Let go the forward fall.
Chief, your secret is safe with me... because I'm not going to be around to tell him anyway.
Leaving the ship.
I should have checked the caulking, sir.
It's okay, kid, it's nobody's fault.
Don't you worry about it.
But we'll get you ashore, sir.
Won't we, Chief?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Horse, slack your stern line.
Shark Bait, heave around on the bow.
Get that thing aboard.
- He can handle anything, sir.
- Yeah, I'm sure of that.
- He can't wait till we get to sea.
- Yeah, I'm sure of that, too.
- What's up, Chief?
- Brass, coming through.
Right this way, sir.
- Family entrance?
- Dock is on the port side, sir.
Show the Captain the quarterdeck, sailor.
Welcome aboard, sir.
With him in command, we could sail right into Tokio Bay.
- I'd settle for just getting out of the harbor.
- He can do that blindfolded.
Yes, sir, but I don't think he's going to.
He didn't take them papers, sir.
He forgot them. He must have.
He's got to sign them. Can I still catch him?
Sir, you get them papers.
I'll see that you catch him.
Ahoy, the weather deck!
What do you want, Jack?
A new rubber band for the engine?
Got a special delivery for the dock.
Can you handle it?
Yeah. Hey, Boats, throw the hook over the side.
Just put your foot in there and hold on tight, sir.
Jack, don't forget to tell him to get a transfer.
Yeah! You have to switch over when you get up there, sir.
Okay, let's go.
Easy, Leahy! Take it up!
Okay, Boats, bring him up.
If you're looking for your brother, he's in a scow on the other side of this monster.
No, sir. It's me, sir. Tommy.
The Chief had the ship's crane put me on the dock.
That Chief. He's just full of ideas, isn't he?
What's the rush?
I promised I'd meet some guys at the Officers' Club for dinner.
- I just thought I'd walk in with you.
- It's a little early for dinner, isn't it?
Yeah, but you know, junior officers have to get in and get out.
I was hoping you'd have dinner with us.
I'd like the fellows to meet my new skipper.
Thanks, Tommy, but I'm not your skipper yet.
You see, I haven't signed those papers in your pocket.
Yeah. I figured you forgot them, so I brought them along.
- You really didn't forget them, did you?
- You didn't think I did, did you?
I know the ship doesn't look like much, sir, but it's no scow... and once the men get to work on it, you'll be surprised.
If it's on account of me, sir, don't worry, you can get another junior officer.
Wait. Look, kid, this has nothing to do with you.
It's just that I don't want to get stuck on that ship, you see?
But it sails, sir.
And it might have an important missi髇.
Tommy, if it was the Vanderbilt yacht,
I wouldn't want it, kid.
Do you see all those ships?
That's only a fraction of the Japanese fleet.
Do you want to go up against that in the Echo?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I guess I'll have to give these to Cmd. Vandewater myself.
I'll give them to Vandewater.
I'll take care of him. Where's his office?
Headquarters building.
Behind the tug mooring, sir.
Thanks.
Look, kid, I may end up as your skipper yet... but you understand why I'm trying not to, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
How do we set up now, Maggie?
Cpl. Hathaway's office called at 17:00, sir.
Col. Harris at 17:05.
Briefing's at 18:30.
- That'll clear the deck, sir.
- Fine.
- Is Lt. Crandall still waiting?
- Yes, sir.
But I'm sure he understands... that you have a full schedule and won't mind.
No. Send him in, please.
Yes, sir.
Permissi髇 to secure at 18:00, sir?
Permissi髇 to... Sure.
And get me Admiral Hathaway, would you?
Tell me, once you secure at 18:00, what would you be doing, Maggie?
Keeping a date at 18:01.
With the base efficiency expert, of course.
Of course.
Stun the crows.
Flag secretary returning the Admiral's call.
Yes, sir. Got it right here, sir.
- Somewhere. Hi, I'll be right with you.
- Yeah.
Sir? Absolutely, sir.
What is 19:00, anyway?
7:00. I might have known you had your finger in this.
All steamed up about my new command and I end up in a Chinese junk.
What are you talking about, Rip?
- I thought you were at sea.
- I was, and very happy... until I get orders transferring me to a grain barge masquerading as a Navy vessel.
- The USS Echo?
- Echo?
Say, is that the racing sloop-
Joke's over.
I've been aboard this career-wrecker.
I was hoping you'd report here first, so that l-
You could con me into it?
She's a brute, isn't she?
I'd liked to have seen your face when you went aboard.
But it's no joke, Rip.
- This is an important assignment.
- You're getting funnier by the minute.
No, I'm serious.
Gen. MacArthur himself wants her delivered to New Guinea.
Why?
Why?
You know, I asked him that same thing.
I said to him, "Doug," I said...
"why do you want that old hulk sailed to New Guinea?"
- And he said to me, "Van, boy"-
- "Drop dead."
What's MacArthur got to do with the Navy, anyway?
Say, you have been at sea.
Let's just say that he mentioned it to Admiral Hathaway... and Admiral Hathaway suggested that I get with it or else... and l, in turn-
You saw a chance to do a favor for an old sailing buddy.
Rip, I swear it, your name popped out of the lBM machine... with five or six other ex-yachtsmen... none of whom I would trust with a canoe.
And if you don't think it's a favor,
I heard about your fitness report.
That popped up, too?
You should get your next promotion around 1980.
Come on. Now, look.
All you've got to do is slip up inside the Great Barrier Reef... run across the Coral Sea, and take her into Port Moresby.
It's blue water all the way, prevailing winds-
Enemy planes, enemy subs.
400 miles of open water,
I got a crew of cherry pickers.
You beat me to Santa Barbara once with five Sea Scouts.
But that's got nothing to do with this.
No. I picked you because you're the only man I know who can do the job.
Now I get it. Now, what,
I sit on that bucket for the duration?
The ship's to be turned over to the port detachment in Moresby.
What they'll do with it, I don't know.
That's their business.
All you've got to do is get it there.
You'll be flown back here for reassignment the same day you drop the hook up there.
Now, why don't you just sign the papers and get it over with?
Wait, a reassignment to what?
You'll have demonstrated your fitness for command.
"D," maybe.
Maybe even a destroyer.
This is a chance half the guys in the fleet would give their eyeteeth for.
How come I feel like I'm buying a used car?
How much time do I have to train, Van?
A couple of days, maybe.
- Or more. Let's see, to be in Moresby-
- Not a chance.
Now, look, Rip...
I don't want to have to lean on you, but if I have to-
You'd have done it when I first walked in.
I don't have to take that ship.
Don't have to face a court-martial, either.
A prospective commanding officer must first certify a ship in proper condition-
That applies to assuming command in a naval shipyard.
Paragraph 1 does.
Paragraph 3 states elsewhere-
All right! For a direct commissi髇 you got to be a sea lawyer in a hell of a hurry.
Skipper had me memorize a page every time I goofed.
Then you must know the whole book by heart.
But Admiral Hathaway isn't that soft.
Good luck on your next duty.
Wait a minute.
Van, just give me 10 days to train.
Tell you what, give you an extra day.
That's impossible, and you know it.
I don't know anything, except she's got to sail.
Under the second officer, if necessary.
The kid? But that's insane. He couldn't.
You know as well as I do he doesn't have the experience.
Do l? Maybe this will give it to him.
- Did you talk him into it, sir?
- No, but I got him worried.
- Keep working on his conscience, mister.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Kid, what's with you and Vandewater?
Nothing, sir. He just told me to stand by.
There might be new orders for the Echo tomorrow, sir.
What are you doing here, anyway?
I just came over from the Officers' Club, sir.
I thought, you not knowing the base,
I'd show you where it was.
I was hoping you might have dinner with us, sir.
Sorry, I didn't mean to be so suspicious.
Thanks.
The new orders, sir.
Does that mean you got the transfer?
He's gonna talk to the Admiral.
- You'll get it.
- What makes you say that?
With your experience, they'll have to give you a command.
Good officers are scarce.
Command? If Admiral Dewey was still running the Navy...
I'd be a big man, but he ain't.
"lronsides" Hathaway is.
Where did you say that Officers' Club was?
Over there, in back of the shelter.
- I would like a double anything.
- Yes, sir.
Do you have any chit?
Have to get it from the mess officer.
- We're not allowed to take cash.
- Here, sir. You can use mine.
I couldn't do that to you, too.
I mean, it's bad enough that... Never mind.
This is the officer
I was telling you about, Arthur.
Lt. Crandall? This is a real pleasure, sir.
There's nothing too good for you, sir.
Mr. Hanson was telling me you are going to command the Echo.
If you need an extra hand,
I sure would like a transfer.
If I were going to command the Echo...
I doubt that we would observe the cocktail hour.
No, sir, he didn't mean that.
He's a real sailor.
Did two years as a deckhand before the war.
Right, Arthur?
Right, sir. The Old Escobar out of Frisco.
But that was power.
And there's nothing like sail, is there, Lieutenant?
Coming right up, gentlemen.
You know, once the sea gets in your blood,
I guess you never get rid of it, sir.
Tommy, The Old Escobar out of Frisco is the ferry to Oakland.
I've been on it. I wish I was on it now.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
Did Cmd. Vandewater say who they'd get, sir?
No. I imagine they'll find somebody. Why?
No reason, sir.
I just thought, with you in command,
I'd get real practical experience.
I've been studying up on seamanship and navigation-
Tommy, if you knew
I was gonna be your skipper... you and Vandewater cooked this thing up.
No, sir. Not until I saw your name on the orders this morning.
No pretzels.
Then what difference would it make who got the assignment?
None, sir. Except I thought
I'd try and show you...
I wasn't as stupid as you thought I was.
In Balboa.
- I told you before. That was five years ago-
- Excuse me, sir.
The two gentlemen with the nurse are waiting for you, sir.
Thanks. Won't you join us, sir?
I told them about you, too.
I see. And you primed them full of the salty talk... on how they were gonna sail with me, too?
What are you trying to...
I'm sorry. It's really nothing.
I've got a lot on my mind.
It's been a tough afternoon. You run along.
- I'm sorry. I'll join you later.
- Yes, sir.
Arthur.
Would you like me to freshen it up a bit, sir?
- You're gonna freshen that up?
- You can't fly on one wing, sir.
- Thanks, Jimmy. And don't bother to wait.
- Yes, ma'am. Thanks.
Coming through. Pardon me, gentlemen.
Do one of these.
Kid, I got one that will stop you.
Okay.
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day?
I know I'm not wrong
The feeling's getting stronger
The longer I stay away
Miss the moss-covered vines
The tall sugar pines
Where mockin' birds used to sing
And I'd like to see
The lazy Mississippi
A- hurryin' into spring
The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there
Do you know what it means
To miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart?
And there's somethin' more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans
Wonderful, boy.
Tommy, you're magnificent. Wonderful.
Hanson, you were the... Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
We're just getting warmed up.
We should get back to the ship, sir.
We have to get the anchor watch set.
Ship's security.
Yeah, you're right. I'll just finish this.
Here he comes. I love your work.
From the time we came in here this afternoon... this guy's kept my glass filled with whisky so you can shanghai me.
Where'd you get
"we gotta go back to the ship" business?
Will you fill me with the sauce and then...
No, sir. You left your gear over there.
And you haven't got a place to stay.
Until you're reassigned, I mean.
Right.
I could stay at the Bachelor Officers' Quarters.
Yes, sir. I forgot.
I'll have them bring your gear over.
No, wait a minute, kid. I'm sorry.
I've been needling you all night long... and you haven't done anything to deserve it.
It's just something is eating me.
Look, just chalk it up to the fact... that I'm a heel, and you're much better off that I didn't take command.
No, I couldn't do that, sir.
You have to do what you think is right.
- I'll have them bring your gear over.
- No.
Leave it there and I'll pick it up sometime.
Give me a chance to see the hulk again.
And you.
Thank you, sir. Good night, sir.
Take care of yourself, kid.
Miss Typewriter of 1943.
What happened to your efficiency expert?
Did he get his head caught in a filing cabinet, I hope?
Never mind, old daddy's here.
Arthur. Old daddy's here.
Would you bring this girl something tall and cool?
If you don't mind, Lieutenant,
I'm looking for an Ensign Hanson.
He's your date?
He gets around better than I thought.
This is official Navy business, sir.
I have some documents which must be signed by 23:00.
There you go with those numbers again.
Ensign Hanson just left, ma'am.
I could try and catch him.
He left in a fast jeep. What documents?
I don't believe that's any concern of yours, Lieutenant.
It's in connection with
Ensign Hanson's ship, the Echo.
I see. At the moment,
I'm still under orders to take command.
And if you don't mind, anything concerning the Echo also concerns me.
Would you step into my office for a moment, please?
Arthur! The wine.
Here we are, open for business.
Let's see the papers.
I understood you were to be reassigned, sir.
I don't think I should.
I haven't been reassigned yet.
Give me the papers.
I want to see the swindle
Vandewater's trying to pull.
This has nothing to do with Cmd. Vandewater.
And I don't think Admiral Hathaway would appreciate your terminology.
They're the acceptance papers from the Echo.
The Admiral wants them signed tonight.
- By Ensign Hanson?
- By Ensign Hanson.
If you really need him, his ship's down at the end of the dock.
- I can send a fellow over for him.
- You're a little over-trained.
If you're not careful,
I'll have you transferred to the Echo.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
He did it. He wasn't bluffing.
I think that Admiral will have his grandmother made skipper.
Are they all in order, sir?
Right down to the fine print.
In that case, you can't have any objection to Ensign Hanson signing them.
Where did you say his ship is?
- Bye, Arthur.
- Bye, sir.
Now, Lieutenant, look. I told you, the Admiral wants those papers signed by-
- They will be. You got a pen?
- Yes, sir.
But they have to be signed by the officer taking command.
I know that. Give me the pen.
Gosh, Lieutenant, after the way you behaved this afternoon...
I wouldn't have thought a team of horses could've gotten you on that ship.
Shut up.
Well, missi髇 accomplished.
- Good work, Hanson.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
I guess. Good night.
- Shark Bait, will you just try to stay with it?
- I'm sorry, Chief.
Good morning, sir.
Beautiful morning, Captain.
Horse.
You might have better luck... Chief.
You might have better luck with that thing if you laid the gasket on the boom first.
- Yes, sir. Lay the...
- Gasket.
Under the foot of the sails there, on the boom.
Yes, sir.
- Your coffee, sir.
- Thank you.
What was in that?
That was an egg, sir. And Mr...
I thought it'd settle the grounds, sir.
Something wrong with it?
Yeah. I thought I swallowed my tongue.
Mr. Hanson meant eggshells in the bottom of the pot.
Not a raw egg in the cup.
What were you before you entered the service?
I was a cook, sir. I've been one for years.
- I'll have another cup. With grounds.
- Yes, sir.
Shackle the foresheet to the traveler.
Good morning, sir.
This to that.
- This is supposed to be the winch?
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Winch?
- Yeah.
No, sir. This is a spark plug, sir.
I was talking about the engine itself.
This is the power takeoff?
Beats me, sir.
Mr. Hanson just told me to get it running.
I see. What's your name?
Sparks, sir.
- Radioman, Second Class, sir.
- Yes, all radiomen are called Sparks.
I mean, what is your actual name?
That's it, sir. A.J. Sparks, Jr.
Funny, ain't it? I mean, being named Sparks and making radioman.
It's very...
All I wanna know is if this is the power takeoff?
I wrote my old man about it.
And he's A.J. Sparks, Sr.
But he darn near died laughing.
A fortunate thing he didn't.
Ship rigged and ready, sir. Request permissi髇 to send watch to breakfast.
I'd like to see the foresail set first, mister.
The foresail? Yes, sir.
Chief!
Set the foresail.
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by to set the foresail!
Chief, get a load of this.
- Man the fore halyards.
- Man the fore halyards!
- Stand by the foresheets.
- Stand by the foresheets!
Take this line and wrap it a couple of times around the winch.
Get that line ready for running.
Come on. Get that other line clear.
Stand by to hoist away.
All hands, stand by to hoist away!
All hands, stand by to sink!
All right, break it up, you guys.
You got nothing to do?
Sir, the winch is still being repaired.
Shall we take it up manually?
No.
Have the men stand down.
I wanna talk to them.
Stand down.
Sir?
Stand easy.
That was pretty miserable, wasn't it?
No reason why it shouldn't be.
With the exception of
Mr. Hanson and myself... none of you knows the slightest thing about sailing.
Nobody expects you to.
However, this ship sails for New Guinea Friday morning.
Once we're at sea, any sailing order that isn't carried out... sharply and efficiently could cost any or all of you your lives.
Now, I can't make blue-water sailors out of you overnight.
But you are all Navy men.
If you're willing to work 18 hours a day for the next three days...
I think I can teach you enough to get by on.
But if you can't cut it... if any one of you thinks that he might endanger the lives... of the rest of the members of this crew, then put in for a transfer, and now.
There's no disgrace to it.
I'll be in my quarters for the next hour, any man who wants to see me.
That's all. Dismissed.
Chief, I prefer that you and Mr. Hanson remain on deck.
Let the men decide this for themselves.
What do we do if they all quit?
- Hello, Johnson.
- Yes, sir.
You didn't eat very much, sir.
I wasn't very hungry.
Not that there was anything wrong with the food. I just...
Men eat yet?
Yes, sir. They ate real good.
- Kind of quiet, but real quick.
- What do you mean, "quiet"?
Sir, a couple of them said something about seeing Mr. Hanson and the Chief.
They wanted to see Hanson and the...
Upper shroud, lower shroud, topping lift.
Upper shroud, lower shroud, topping lift.
Jibstay, forestay, foremast, stow.
- How about that?
- Don't knock it. It works.
Gaff, foresail, gasket.
Gaff, foresail, gasket.
Callahan, standing or running rigging?
Blue standing, red running...
Running rigging, Chief.
Sheet or halyard? You.
Sheets, trims, sails, halyards, hoists.
Halyard, Chief.
- Which one?
- I don't know.
They'll know her by tomorrow, sir.
With your permissi髇, the crew'd like to take another run at setting the foresail.
- Very well.
- Okay, Chief.
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by to hoist the foresail!
Shark Bait, throw up the...
- Gaskets.
- Gaskets.
Horse, stand by the foresheet.
Halyards to the winch!
Come on, you told me you'd get that thing working.
Sure. When do you want it for?
Now, you idiot. You think you're back in that service station?
Take up the slack.
- Set the foresail, Chief.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Stand by the mainsail. Engage the winch.
- Spark!
- I'm trying!
Hoist away!
Take it easy! You'll rip the mast out.
Slack it easy.
It's stuck. Heave!
It's stuck, sir.
- It's stuck, sir.
- Yeah.
Did you grease the mast? That's all it needs.
Don't worry about it.
You better bring it down.
Okay, slack it off and lower away.
Slack off and lower away!
It's still stuck. You get a man up on the rig and kick the gaff jaws loose.
I'll go myself, sir.
One volunteer. You.
There's nothing to it, sailor.
- Yeah? Why don't you go?
- Move.
Can't we talk this over, Chief?
He's scared to death, sir.
If he doesn't do it here, he'll never do it at sea.
Come on, boy. There's nothing to it.
You'll be all right, son.
Just take one step at a time, okay?
Take it easy. Now, don't look down!
Close your eyes.
Now, when you open them, look straight ahead.
That's a boy. Just keep your eyes level... and go on up one rung at a time.
You can do it.
That's it, sailor. Now, go ahead.
Now, I want you to go on up... until you are level with the gaff jaws.
You know what they are?
- Yeah.
- All right.
When you get there, and when you're ready, just reach out... and see if you can kick them free with your foot.
You understand?
That's the boy. When you feel it, I want you to reach out with your right foot... and kick the gaff jaws loose.
That's it. Reach out.
Don't look down!
Now, kick it loose.
Hook your foot in the shroud.
I can't.
Take another turn around that winch and hold it fast.
Take it easy, kid, I'm coming.
I'm slipping. My hands are slipping. I'll fall.
Stop that! Wanna land on someone?
Got you.
Let go with your left hand.
Oh, boy.
I would've fell.
- lf you hadn't been here, I'd have let go.
- Never.
- Hang on, I'm going up and kick her free.
- Okay.
Hang on, kid.
All right, lower it away, Mr. Hanson. It's free.
All right, lower away, Chief.
Slow now, slow. Slow.
Pull what you got.
Wait for me!
That's my ship leaving.
Will you let me through, you guys?
That's my ship.
Wait a minute, boy.
What you got in the bag?
For Pete's sake, I'm gonna miss it.
It's leaving.
He's afraid of missing that?
Wait for me! Wait! Come on! Wait for me!
- I made it.
- Yeah. Nice going, sailor.
Now, bear a hand on the bowline.
We're just coming into the dock.
Say, you have got a few, haven't you?
He's a nut. But he's eager.
Here goes nothing.
- You'll be back before you know it.
- Just be sure I am.
The order's on my desk.
See they get processed, will you, beautiful?
Just pop them into that little lBM machine.
I'll square things with you when I see you again next Friday night.
Are we getting an lBM machine, Commander?
- My, that'd be-
- Yes, we might. Good luck, old boy.
Good landing.
You can take her on out now.
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by the line.
Not now, Johnson.
Chief, I want all this gear stowed before we hit open sea.
Aye, aye, sir.
Come left, mister.
I said, come left.
You're cutting across the bow.
It's no use. She won't answer the helm.
Did you drop the centerboard?
Get up there and do it!
Go down and give me full speed astern.
- Sparks, back full quick!
- Back full, sir.
Not another one!
Come on with that centerboard!
Come on, you monster.
Centerboard down and locked, sir.
- Full speed astern, sir.
- Full speed ahead!
- Full speed ahead!
- Right, sir. Full ahead, sir!
Mister, will you get a helmsman on that wheel... and set sail, while I go below and change my clothes?
Yes?
Shall I notify the Admiral's office of the time of departure, sir?
Yes, please, Maggie.
While you're at it, you might notify air-sea rescue... to be on the lookout for a ship in distress.
- Now what?
- I think that Australian ship's saluting us.
They always cheered the Christians before they threw them to the lions.
- You getting the sail up?
- Yes.
I'll be right up.
He's off to port.
- He's off to port.
- He's off to port.
- Sparks, kill that eggbeater.
- Yes, sir!
What are you doing here?
Thought you left an hour ago.
The weather report said winds up to hurricane force in the Coral Sea.
I thought you might have a message.
- From that little boat, I mean.
- Ship.
They're under orders not to break radio silence, remember?
You're really worried.
- Did you fall for that wild man?
- No.
Mind you, he was kind of cute.
Don't worry about him.
The rougher it is, the better he likes it.
He's having a ball out there.
Besides, the last aerial sighting put them way up here.
They're probably beyond the storm and just loafing along.
If I ever get my hands on that Vandewater...
Yes, sir?
Get this from the files immediately, please.
Now, then... what's the report on that schooner we sent to Moresby last week?
- The...
- Echo, sir.
She rode out a storm Tuesday night and was sighted from the air yesterday.
From the position report, they'll raise the New Guinea coast-
Don't guess, Commander. I want to know.
That ship is a vital part of joint operations.
- The Echo, sir?
- The Echo.
What do you know about an officer named Foster?
Lt. Dennis M. Foster.
Why, nothing, sir. Should l, sir?
He's been assigned to take the Echo to Cape Gloucester.
Cape Gloucester on New Britain, sir?
Why, that's enemy territory.
Very good, Vandewater.
It also happens to be an excellent place to watch Japanese ship movements.
For the past six or seven months... the Australians have had a coast watcher there doing that.
Then, two weeks ago, in the middle of a transmissi髇... he went off the air.
Killed? Taken prisoner, sir?
I don't know.
But that's why the Echo was sent to Moresby... on a faint chance that it could take in a replacement if everything else failed.
A sub couldn't drop the man off at night?
What was the Spearfish doing in the Solomon sea last week?
Uncharted reefs will make it impossible to get anywhere near the coast.
And an airdrop is out of the question.
No, it's got to be a shallow draft vessel like the Echo.
The Australian replacement is in Moresby waiting for the ship to arrive.
As soon as it does, this man Foster is supposed to take command... and try and make the run up to Cape Gloucester.
I'd feel better if I knew more about him.
It's a ticklish job.
I'll get Lt. Foster's file out immediately.
I've got it right here.
He seems to be qualified, and Capt. McClung picked him.
He commands port detachment of Moresby and ought to know what he's doing.
He wants to hold Lt. Crandall for a few days... until Foster's familiar enough with the ship to take over.
Tell him he can have Lt. Crandall for as long as he likes.
Yes, sir.
Lt. Foster will not relieve Lt. Crandall... until, in the opinion of the port captain...
Lt. Foster is fully qualified to command the Echo.
That means I can hold Crandall here as long as I like.
- That make you any happier about Foster?
- I've got nothing against the bloke.
He's just not the type that I'd pick for a mate.
- He's a good officer.
- The best. A real sterling character.
But if you can have this Crandall bloke, why can't he stay in command?
Because his job is to acquaint Foster with the Echo, that's why.
Of course, we could try sending you in again in another sub.
Now, wait a minute.
I'm crazy about Foster.
- Where is that flaming ship, anyway?
- Simmer down, Pat.
She'll be along.
On deck!
- What's that?
- I can make out a pier in the harbor, sir.
Nan. Easy. Roger. King.
That's her, Mr. Foster, the Echo.
I was afraid of that. A tub.
All right. Contact and please pass the word to stand by for special instructions.
Aye, aye, sir.
There's a building at the shore end.
That must be the port detachment.
Fine. Sparks, ready on the engine.
Some navigation, mister.
Have the boatswain stand by to down sail.
- Sir!
- What's the trouble?
I wish I knew. I can't get it started.
I checked the ignition system, the valves, the pumps.
- I'm going through the fuel lines.
- Can we take her in under canvas?
- No room to maneuver in there.
- We'd be going in in style.
In style?
As long as we don't end up on the beach.
How long is it gonna take you to fix it?
If I can find the trouble, not long.
But if I can't?
We have orders to get in as fast as we can.
Get with it.
Wipe that grin off your face.
This isn't as easy as it looks.
Keep the deck.
Hold that beacon in your port bow... till I give the order to come about. Hold this.
No reason to get excited.
It's a tricky maneuver.
If you handle your duties as well as you've been doing, we'll be all right.
There's one very important thing.
We'll be on the wind when we fetch that dock.
I must come up fast, lose weight, try to coast alongside, understand?
- When we start to luff-
- That's when the sails flap?
Right. I want every inch of canvas down as fast as possible.
- Mister, stand by to come about.
- Man the sheets. Keep a close haul.
Tell the man up the crosstrees to watch the gaff jaws.
- I don't want them sticking again.
- Aye, aye, sir. Guys, keep your eye on the-
- Somebody's firing at us.
- Over us, so far.
What did we do? Lose the war already?
- Who's responsible for firing on that ship?
- I was trying to warn them, sir.
They've not answered our transmissi髇 and don't know of harbor defenses.
She's already in the harbor!
Did it ever occur to you she might be on a radio silence?
They're coming any minute.
Get down and warn him off.
Yes, sir.
- Where are you?
- I'm sorry, I can't get the engine started.
Get the transmitter.
I want to know who fired on us and why.
I can't do that either.
It doesn't put out without the engine.
- Sir!
- What?
There's a flashing light on the dock.
Take out the hand blinker.
Stand by to come about.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- All hands stand by to heave to.
- What's the matter with them?
- They're going right into it.
- Got them now, sir.
- Tell them.
What do you got?
"You are...
"approaching..."
Cancel it, they're already in it.
Tell them quick.
Cancelled. Restart, sir.
All they're telling us is we're approaching a Navy dock.
"You are...
"in...
"a...
"fine...
- "area."
- lsn't that nice?
Must be the chamber of commerce.
What are they saying?
- Excuse me, sir. That "F" was an "M."
- That's different.
- "You are in a mine area."
- Mine area? Get directions, quick!
Lookout, keep your eyes peeled for subsurface objects.
There's something there now, sir!
Dead ahead!
There they are! Two of them!
Dead ahead, sir!
- Orderly!
- Another one, sir. Off the port bow.
Man the back stage.
Go forward, get that centerboard up.
She won't answer the helm.
It won't make any difference if we hit a mine. Go on.
- They request we move inshore, sir.
- Get back to that engine, quick.
Centerboard up and secured, sir.
Another one off the port bow, sir!
Another one at starboard.
They're out of it.
Tell them they're in the clear.
- We're all clear, sir.
- Roger.
On deck!
Low waters ahead, sir.
Lower away all sails, Tommy.
Drop that centerboard.
Sparks, put it forward.
Lower away all sails! Let's get this down.
The gaff jaws are stuck again.
Kick that gaff jaw free.
- Centerboard down, sir.
- Right!
You monster, come about.
- Sir, we're closing on the dock.
- What? Back full, Sparks!
Sir, we're gonna ram the dock.
No. Go forward and get ready to let go of the anchor starboard.
Johnson, bear a hand on the anchor.
Cameo, grab that line.
Stop it up short. Tend that line.
Sparks, I said back full!
Excuse me, sir, she quit on me again.
Go forward and rig the fenders on the port side.
Shark Bait, let go of the anchor and hold it underfoot.
Man overboard!
Look out below!
Nice work, mister.
- What did you say, sir?
- I said, very nice.
Is that all for this performance, or have you got an encore?
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
This is a centerboard ship-
A ship?
Why, I was under the impressi髇 that it was a USO Tour.
This is an official Navy ship, sir.
The crew is doing the best they could under the circumstances.
This crew is doing the best they can?
I suggest you take this crew out for about six months.
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
This is my ship.
Anything this crew does is under my orders.
If you have any further remarks about this ship or my crew... you come aboard and make them to me.
- Throw the sails.
- Astern to.
Thank you for your invitation, Captain.
Since I'm relieving you, that won't be necessary.
Whatever I have to say to this crew,
I'll say to them directly.
You're taking over?
As soon as you report your arrival to the port captain.
I would be obliged if you do that as quickly as possible.
Furl the sails.
Excellent, Lieutenant.
- At ease, please.
- Yes, sir.
You've done a remarkable job bringing that ship up here.
Thank you, sir. I had a remarkable crew.
Yes, I saw them in action as you came in.
I'm sorry you won't be commanding them on the missi髇.
Missi髇?
You don't think we brought that ship up here just for the ride?
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
The missi髇 is top secret.
You weren't informed, were you?
- No, sir.
- Come here.
Temporarily, the ship is being placed at the disposal of the Air Force.
It's imperative that they get one of their men ashore... here on Cape Gloucester.
- ln New Britain? With the Echo?
- Yeah.
They seem to think if she's disguised as a Navy training craft... that she has a chance.
That's what they're doing to your ship now.
Camouflaging it.
And the Air Force will provide what fighter cover they can.
Fortunately, that won't concern you, will it?
No, sir.
You've met your replacement, Lt. Foster?
- Yes, sir.
- Fine.
I have Admiral Hathaway's permissi髇 to hold you here... until you can familiarize Foster with Echo.
- I know you're anxious to get back to town-
- That's all right.
It would take some time for the men to get used to a new skipper.
It won't take more than 48 hours.
- I don't suppose you would be-
- Sir?
Yes, Davis, what is it?
Air Force reports enemy bombers over the Solomon Sea.
They expect a raid in 20 to 25 minutes.
Mr. Patterson and the native corporal are in the briefing room.
Shall I ask them to wait for the all clear?
- The Lieutenant and I will be over directly.
- Yes, sir.
Warn Echo. tell those
Air Force people to clear the dock.
Yes, sir.
They're going up to make the intercept.
Our ClC Room is over here.
Bogie 1 appears to be splitting.
Designated raids. One Abel and one Baker.
One Baker.
We know there's a convoy building up here over BAM.
I'm fairly certain it'll take off in the next 10 days... run along the north coast of New Britain and land troops either here at Madang... or down here at Lae.
Lae, they'll land at Lae.
They'd be a month coming over land from Madang.
We also know that they'll be making a grave tactical error...
Mr. Patterson, that's right.
No Navy man would risk putting ships through narrow straits like that.
They'd be a sitting duck during an aerial attack.
- lsn't that right, sir?
- Absolutely, Lieutenant.
What Patterson is thinking of, though... is this weather front that's moving in from the central Pacific.
By the end of the week, this whole area will be socked in so tight... there won't be any chance for aerial observation.
That's why it's so vital... to get Pat in there to take the place of that coast watcher... who disappeared.
Tom Evans. Wasn't that his name?
Yeah.
Then we can hope, with Pat's help, to get a visual sighting from the land.
Would it be difficult to drop Mr. Patterson and the corporal by parachute?
If you ask me, it'd be flaming impossible.
I'd as soon go in with a brass band and a neon light on my hat.
Besides, I don't like airplanes.
- Or air raids, either. Goodbye, all.
- Stick around a few minutes.
They'll be concentrating on the airstrips.
Yeah, and they might miss, too.
Don't you get any wrong ideas about Patterson, Lieutenant.
If it weren't for him and the Australian coast watchers who hid in the jungle... when the Japanese occupied these islands, we'd be in a bad way.
Both here and in the Solomons.
Patterson and that native corporal of his... have spent the last six months right here in the hills... constantly in danger from Japanese patrols... and just as constantly sending us our vital information.
So don't-
Now, they're entitled to sit this one out, son.
One Baker. 050.
One Baker should be overhead in two minutes.
Very well.
You have air cover as far as the Trobriands here.
Across the Solomon Sea, you'll just have to pray... that the enemy thinks you're a native trading vessel.
That'll be two, maybe three days.
Right, Crandall?
I'm sorry, sir. This is the first time my crew's been under fire.
I'm afraid it won't be the last.
No, sir. Let me see, three days, you say?
If you took off from here at dusk, and you were sharp on celestial navigation... it could be two nights and a day.
Foster is a qualified navigator.
Thank you, sir.
You have a few days to acquaint him with the ship's peculiarities.
That won't be necessary. Thank you.
If this weather front does move down, you'll have to do some dead reckoning.
Why don't you let me worry about that?
Pardon me, but they're swinging in over the harbor.
Everybody but the duty section should be in the slit trenches.
- What?
- Your own orders, sir.
Welcome to the club.
- Where's he going?
- To be with his ship, I imagine.
Quite a bloke, that Crandall.
Duck!
The port captain's here, skipper.
- Kind of soggy out, isn't it, Crandall?
- Yes, sir.
We could run up the coast for a few miles.
I can show the Lieutenant how the ship handles.
That won't be possible now.
The size of that air raid shows the Japanese are building up to something.
Air Force wants Echo underway as soon as possible.
I see, sir.
Get underway as soon as you've accomplished the transfer.
Bring your papers to my office.
We'll see about arranging air transport for you to Australia.
Yes, sir.
After you, Captain.
Yes, come in, Crandall.
What're you doing here?
Why aren't you underway?
I request you to order Lt. Crandall... to turn over the Echo to me without further delay.
He's got me signing for equipment
I can't even find. He's...
Sir, he's getting underway.
He is?
No. He wouldn't do a thing like that.
Sir, he must be.
No, really?
He's taking it out himself, sir. See?
Yes, he is, isn't he?
My ship in that minefield again.
He knows where those mines are now.
Aren't you going to order him back, sir?
The Air Force would demand an explanation... for the delay, and-
Sir, this is a court-martial offense.
- What, Lieutenant?
- I said this is a court-martial offense, sir.
Yes, I guess you're right.
Still, he was assigned to me for an indefinite period.
For as long as I needed him.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Lieutenant.
If he ever comes back from that missi髇...
I'll consider a court-martial.
Yes, sir.
This channel of yours is less than 100 feet wide.
Is that the only break in the reef?
The only one I know of, and I've covered over 100 miles of it.
- On deck!
- What is it?
Another enemy aircraft on the starboard quarter... closing in on us, sir.
You'd better get below, sir.
Same order stands!
Don't fire unless they fire first!
Hold fire.
Drop dead, you creeps.
- Blow a couple of gaskets!
- Yeah.
Looks okay, sir. They're waving back.
Dogs.
I hope that's the last of them.
This thing's starting to itch.
It is. With that weather front coming, be lucky to make home.
Flaming shame if we didn't.
Run forward and tell cook to barbecue poultry for dinner.
We need a decent meal for tonight's work.
We'll hit that front in one hour.
By midnight, it'll be darker than 3-4 feet down a cow's throat.
- How will we see the reef?
- Nothing to it.
You can hear the surf pounding on the reef for miles.
Fine. How do we know how much water's under us?
That depends on the size of the waves, don't it?
Don't worry, I can take you through there with my head in a bag.
Yeah, you may have to.
Yeah?
Thanks for trying anyhow, Major.
Yeah, I'll be seeing you sometime soon.
No, sir.
He checked every squadron that had a plane in the area today.
That's absolutely the last time she was seen by anybody.
But that was at dawn this morning.
By late afternoon, they should've been somewhere up here.
What about that observation flight sent from there?
Canceled due to the weather.
You can bet the Japs didn't cancel that convoy.
If we'd just gotten that ship underway one day sooner.
Lower away all sails.
Stand by the engine.
I want full power going over that reef.
Tommy, take the deck.
Where did you say this inlet was?
- Straight ahead. Through those trees.
- Right.
At least the Air Force has been up here.
They sure worked that one over.
I guess so, sir.
Lead him.
I can knock that teacup right out of his dukes.
Don't.
He may have friends, like about 200,000 of them.
Just keep your eye on them. Don't get itchy.
You were going to glide through the jungle like a ghost.
- This looks like Hannibal crossing the Alps.
- Take off.
I'm gonna be here a long time.
I like my comfort now and then.
You've enough for a hotel.
How far do the men have to lug this stuff?
The other side of that little hill up there.
I'll hide this stuff there till I'm ready to move on.
It'll take them hours to get up there.
What am I to do?
Wait here like a sitting duck?
Who's gonna know?
You're tucked in here real nice and cozy.
The Japanese Navy never spotted you, did they?
- Where are you going?
- You have to stay on the ship, sir.
- There has to be an officer with the patrol.
- Why don't you let the kid go?
Give him a chance to stretch his legs and look at the countryside.
- Hanson, come-
- Thanks for the boat ride.
- I'll radio your regards to Capt. McClung.
- Thanks.
- I'll bring them back safe and sound.
- You better, or don't come back yourself.
On the bow.
- How do my men find their way back here?
- No problem.
Those masts of yours stick up like a lighthouse in the fog.
Good on you, mate.
You.
Get out of here with those whites.
They'll spot you for two miles.
Come on.
Must have jumped him without his knowing.
- I'll have the boys dig a-
- Leave him.
Leave everything just where it is.
I can't have them know I'm here.
He had no family that I know of, Chief.
Quicker I'm out of this, the better I'll like it.
Let's go.
- A little different up here.
- It's beautiful.
- It's hard to believe.
- Your first stiff, kid?
- Yeah.
- There'll be a lot more of them.
No cup of tea, this war.
Chief...
Goroka will show you where to dig my stuff in.
You'll have no trouble finding your way back.
You've left a trail as wide as George Street, Sydney.
- Will it give you away?
- No, it grows over in a day.
By tonight, we'll be a long way from here.
You're gonna stay down there in the jungle?
Till the Japs get me.
Or our blokes come down and run them out of here.
Don't worry about it.
Just reckon I'm crazy enough to get a kick out of it.
That don't mean I wanna stay here for ever.
You do your best to keep the Navy moving.
Goroka, we go along now.
- Stay awake.
- I'm awake.
Give me some air, will you?
Coffee, skipper?
Shark Bait... secure that boom crutch.
I want to move fast when they get back.
Yes, sir.
The crew will finish up.
There's nothing left but pulling some brush over.
We'll be ready by the time you cool off.
You went to the wrong school, sir.
- Officers ain't supposed to work so hard.
- I needed it.
Chief, come here.
That's it, the Japanese convoy.
Lucky we got the old man up here when we did.
He's still down in the jungle.
He can't possibly see it.
We've got to get back to the ship.
- All right, guys. Let's haul it.
- Come on, let's go.
Get going.
Sir, so the war lasts five minutes longer.
It'll be dark in an hour.
- Can I help you?
- I'm all right.
Sir, I saw the mast. They're right below us.
Go ahead.
Last time I ran like this, four MPs were on my tail.
Rip! Listen up!
Wait a minute.
- Rip?
- Yeah, come in, kid.
We saw the convoy. It was...
Let him talk. Makes no difference now.
Tommy, I'd like you to meet
Capt. Shigetsu. UCLA, '38.
Bachelor of Science in Horticulture.
So, you saw our convoy?
Move over there where I can watch you.
- Not now, kid.
- No, later.
As you were saying, you saw our convoy.
Where were you and what were you doing when you saw it?
My name is Thomas Hanson,
Ensign, United States Naval Reserve.
No use.
The good captain was just reminding me... that Japan is not a signatory of the Geneva Convention.
It really makes no difference.
We can classify you as a spy.
This is an aerial photograph... taken of this ship in the Solomon Sea yesterday.
You certainly weren't in uniform then.
Shall we get back to details of the missi髇?
Let's get back to the Rose Bowl game.
Okay, but Maj. Samada's gonna ask you the same questions.
- Very educated man, the Major.
- Really? I'm Stanford myself.
In that case, it'll be my pleasure to assist the Major in his questioning.
He's a big one.
I thought they were all little jokers.
Shut up.
What happened to you clowns? Asleep?
They were on us like tents.
We didn't have a chance.
It's for me. I'll get it.
Real brass.
Lay you eight-to-five he braces the sergeant.
- You'll rise when the Major enters.
- Sure, we will.
- You better.
- Okay.
Do me a favor.
It's there, right there. That's it.
I don't think they'd look good here with the Major coming down.
Thank you.
Close the door.
I won't tell you anything more!
Good boy. Get the guns.
Get below. Prime that engine.
Give me back full when I yell.
- You want these?
- There are too many.
- What're you gonna do?
- Like I know! Get on the engine.
Chief, look aft.
Sarge.
Didn't I meet you in Singapore once?
I remember, you used to hang out at that high-kickers club... in Saigon, huh?
Duck!
Go, Tommy! Give it full, and get up here on this machine gun!
Sparks, on the engine.
Chief, drop the centerboard.
Give me full ahead.
Duck!
See if you can get that machine gun nest.
Hang on to that gun, kid. Here we go.
You could've bet me we wouldn't make it.
Sorry, sir.
The engine flooded out going over the reef.
- Who needs it? Stand by to make sail.
- Aye, aye, sir!
Get this overboard so we can raise the mainsail.
Port Moresby trying to reach us, sir.
Good. Get on that thing and tell him what you saw.
- I can't transfer without the engine, sir.
- Fix it.
Look out, Rip!
Don't shoot.
Keep going.
- Rip, you all right?
- Are you kidding? I can't...
Move. Just make one little move.
Johnson, get the aid kit.
Let him handle it, sir.
- I can transmit now, sir.
- We'll contact them.
- lf you do, you kill your captain-
- Shut up, you crumb.
What do you mean?
You're still within range of the shore battery.
The second you start transmitting, they'll blow you out of the water.
Surrender. Your captain will be hospitalized.
- We have excellent Japanese doctors.
- Sir.
- Send it.
- It's insane.
You'll all be killed.
Can you stand by and let them destroy you?
- Let me plug him, sir.
- Shut up.
Enemy convoy seen north of Cape Gloucester.
What's the matter with you, you got four thumbs?
I told you so.
At 1600, heading west.
- Break out the life raft, Chief.
- Yes, sir.
Message received, sir.
Get that life raft over the side!
- How's he doing?
- I'm okay. Let's get out of here.
We're hit in the forward hull.
We're taking water fast.
- You abandon ship.
- Abandon ship!
Come on.
Aren't you gonna stay and die for the rising sun?
You out of your mind?
He's got a pretty high fever, sir.
Can still fire flares.
Japanese nurses very good.
One more crack out of you and you're in the water.
Sir, I hear a plane.
There it is!
It's a PBY.
Looks like UCLA blew another one.
On this same morning of 3 March... projecting the course of the enemy convoy from the slim information received... the Allied forces in New Guinea put every available aircraft in the air... met the Japanese ships and their air cover in the straits... between New Guinea and New Britain... and in a two-day running battle, wreaked total destruction on it.
Of this little-known, yet highly decisive battle...
Gen. Douglas MacArthur said:
"The battle of the Bismarck Sea won a victory of such completeness...
"as to assume the proportions of a major disaster to the enemy. "
And so it is recorded in the history of Worid War II.
Of considerably less importance... yet of vital interest to us... is the fact that six months later... in what was now just a quiet backwater in the rear area... a newly promoted Lt. J. G. pulled alongside his first command... and prepared to take over.
Belay that racket.
You want the whole area to hear us?
As a matter of fact, sir, yes.
- Stations for getting underway.
- Weigh her to side!
What did you say about going ashore and speaking to the Admiral?
You weren't interested in any more special missions.
I can let the man talk, can't l?
Come on! Knock it off.
Knock it off!
Gardner, keep telling them you're innocent.
Don't let them see you're afraid, kid!
It'll be all right, son.
I didn't wanna do it, sir.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry!
I didn't... Sir? Sir?
It won't happen again, sir.
I didn't want...
I didn't...
Private Arthur James Gardner... you've been found guilty as charged for the crime of murder.
Your case has been appealed three times... and reviewed three times.
The verdict of each court-martial has been the same:
Guilty as charged.
Do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out?
I didn't mean it.
I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.
Open it up.
Enjoy the show, major?
I want to see Major Armbruster.
- Just down the corridor...
- Yeah, I know where it is. I know.
John. Good to see you.
Don't you give me that. We had dinner last night together, remember?
Be nice. Take it easy.
This time it's serious, John.
You've gotta cooperate.
Let's go.
Colonel.
General is waiting, major.
Major Reisman, sir.
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.
- Sit down, major.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, major, what did you think of the hanging?
Looked very efficient.
Then again, I'm not an expert.
I meant, how did you personally feel about it?
It wasn't the nicest way to spend an evening.
Well, it wasn't staged for your entertainment, you know.
I hope Private Gardner was aware of that.
- Private who?
- Private Gardner.
He was the object of the exercise.
There happens to have been a reason, major.
I've got your service record here, major.
A lot of fireworks. A lot of transfers.
One tough scrape after another, very short on discipline.
Very short on discipline.
I hear you did a pretty good job in Italy.
Then you loused it up by exceeding your orders. And that's not the first time.
- I didn't write those reports, sir.
- What is that supposed to mean?
I don't necessarily agree with what's in them.
- Maybe you'd like to write your own?
- No, thank you, sir.
I'm not very interested in embroidery, only results.
Now, you hold it right there.
This war was not started for your private gratification.
And you can be damn sure that this Army... isn't being run for your personal convenience, either.
You've been waiting for a transfer for over two months now.
With a record like yours, you could go on waiting forever.
However, I get orders too.
And right now I've got some... that sound as if they were made for somebody just like you.
Personally, I don't go for this behind-the-lines nonsense.
As far as I'm concerned, a soldier's job is to wear his uniform and kill the enemy.
But that's another matter.
I'm gonna ask General Denton to read these orders... just as they came down to us.
After, if you have any questions, ask.
Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- General.
"Project Amnesty:
You will select 12 prisoners sentenced to death... or long-term imprisonment for murder, rape, robbery or other violent crimes.
Train these prisoners in as much of the behind-the-lines operations... as they can absorb in a brief but unspecified time.
You'll then deliver them secretly to Europe and prior to the invasion... attack and destroy the target specified: Overleaf."
- That's all?
- That's all.
What about the target specified,
Overleaf?
Doesn't concern you now.
Well, what do you say, major?
I'd say it confirms a suspicion
I've had for some time now, sir.
Do you think we might share that suspicion, major?
I think you should.
Since I'll have to assume we're over here to win the war... it wouldn't pay to advertise... that one man we're working for is a raving lunatic.
Now, that's enough, major. You're here to be briefed on an operation.
You have permission to ask questions about that operation.
You do not have permission to make personal comments... concerning the officers responsible for its conception.
- Now, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Ask relevant questions or shut up.
Is it relevant to ask why I'm being offered this mission?
It's not, as you say, being offered.
I'm volunteering.
Exactly, major.
I'm glad you look at these things so realistically.
I don't mean to appear unduly cautious, but if my personal survival... depends on the performance of 12 deadheads... it might be helpful to know exactly what I'm training them for.
Now, that's a very good question, major.
- Armbruster, let's have the basic outline.
- Yes, sir.
"The Germans are using a large chateau near Rennes in Brittany... as a rest center and a conference place for general staff officers."
The target has no real military value itself... but with these conferences, discussion groups and the like going on... there's hardly a day when there aren't a considerable number... of important general officers in residence.
Usually with the benefit of female companionship.
"Eliminating a number of senior officers couldn't but have the effect... of disrupting their chain of command."
The idea is simply that our men are dropped by parachute.
They enter the chateau and kill as many senior officers as is possible... in the time available.
Naturally, the place is fortified and heavily guarded.
Naturally.
What's the deal with the men?
None whatsoever. Let's have no misunderstanding about that.
It's exactly what it says, an amnesty.
A temporary postponement.
You take it or leave it on that basis.
Like you say, sir, let's not have any misunderstandings.
I don't like it. I think it stinks.
I've had enough of your insolence.
It's not a question of insolence but of practicality.
I'm the guy that's being asked to sell this idea... to 12 happy, smiling faces, right?
They do have an alternative way to go, you know.
- That's no way for anybody to go.
- Oh, the hell you say, major.
Why, I know a lot of people who should go exactly that way.
But that's beside the point.
Now, come on, major, what's your basic objection?
These men are, by definition, incapable of any discipline or authority... much less intensive training.
If there isn't a possibility for a remission of their sentence... they have nothing to look forward to and no reason to cooperate, right?
Got a point.
You got a point, major.
However, as you know,
I don't have the power... to reverse the findings of a court-martial.
You do have the power to commute the sentence of such a court.
- Excuse me, general.
- Yes?
You do have authority under the Visiting
Forces Act to make such a ruling.
- Visiting Forces Act?
- Yes, sir.
All right, major, you got a deal.
Let's say that if any of these men distinguish themselves... then we will give serious consideration to commuting their sentences.
That's no deal.
Who's to say whether they really distinguish themselves or not?
You can leave that decision to me.
But remember, the other alternative will apply with equal force.
Any breach of security, any failure of discipline... those prisoners go right back where they came from.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
Good. Anything more, gentlemen?
Well, yes, sir. I noticed
Colonel Breed in the waiting room.
I wondered whether he was connected with this operation.
- What if he is?
- I'd be very unhappy, sir.
Major, Colonel Breed is your superior officer.
And you will behave accordingly, at all times.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Now, it so happens that Colonel Breed is not concerned with this operation.
But he is running the parachute school where part of your training will be.
I don't want to hear any complaints, from either of you.
Now, you've got a job to do, mister, so move it.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Major Reisman seems to be heading to his own court-martial.
He's the most ill-mannered, ill-disciplined officer... it's ever been my displeasure to meet.
You think so, Denton?
You may be right.
But he's sure right about one thing.
Somebody up there must be a raving lunatic.
Let's get Colonel Breed in here.
Open.
All right, you men, this is an exercise period.
So exercise!
Major Reisman, Sergeant Bowren, sir.
- Have the prisoners fall in.
- Sir.
Prisoners, fall in.
All right, come on now. Get with it!
- Come on, come on.
- Move it!
Come on, move!
Hey, you, move, I said, move.
"Franko, V.R.
Death by hanging.
Vladek, M.
Thirty years' hard labor.
Jefferson, R.T.
Death by hanging.
Pinkley, V.L.
Thirty years' imprisonment.
Gilpin, S.
Thirty years' hard labor.
Posey, S.
Death by hanging.
Wladislaw, T.
Death by hanging.
Sawyer, S.K.
Twenty years' hard labor.
Lever, R.
Twenty years' imprisonment.
Bravos, T.R.
Twenty years' hard labor.
Jiminez, P.
Twenty years' hard labor.
Maggott, A.J.
Death by hanging."
All right, sergeant. Have them fall in according to height, right to left.
According to height, fall in!
Come on, you jokers, you heard him.
Get in there! Fall in line!
- Come on, move!
- Come on, come on. Turn around.
Come on, here! I said, get in line.
Straighten up your jacket there.
Get over there.
- All right, have them count off.
- Sir. Count off!
Let's see what they can do with a little close-order.
- Hut, right!
- Right.
Left, march!
Hut, hut, hut, hut.
Two, three, four, hut, hut, hut.
Two, three.
Squad, halt!
About face!
Left, march!
Squad, halt!
Right face! At ease.
Now, what did I say to you?
Or maybe you don't understand English!
- What's the matter, Number 11?
- I got a pain.
- Where does it hurt?
- Well, I'll tell you. It's...
I wish you would.
And do it correctly, please.
Oh, I don't have to say, sir, I...
To you or anyone else.
And I don't have to march, either.
And I know the rules.
Why don't you have to march?
Because condemned men don't have to drill.
And there's nothing you can do about it, mister.
What's your name, son?
Eleven.
His name is Franko, sir.
Franko, come over here a minute.
Come on.
Look, you little bastard, either you march or I'll beat your brains out.
Understand?
What'd you see, sergeant?
I saw the major attacked by the prisoner and forced to defend himself, sir.
All right, have the prisoner taken back to his cell.
Take his head, I'll get his feet.
Now let's see what they can do with a little close-order.
Yes, sir.
Squad, ten-hut!
Right face.
Forward, march! Hut.
Squad, halt!
About face!
Forward, march!
General prisoner Franko, Victor, sir.
So how's the jaw?
If you're gonna act tough, you should learn how to take care of yourself.
You really should.
You're worried about my jaw?
Franko's pain bothers the major?
You were a big man with the syndicate back in Chicago?
You've seen my record.
Yeah, I've seen your record, so let's knock it off, huh?
So, what happens first when you hit London?
You get involved in a penny-ante stickup and start blasting and kill some old guy.
And come away with what?
- What did you have when they got you?
- What did I have? What do you mean?
Come on, big shot.
How much money did you have?
I had enough.
Two pounds and 10 shilling.
That's almost 10 dollars.
You're gonna get yourself hung for a lousy 10 bucks.
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.
Then why don't you get off my back?
You didn't come to visit me.
What do you want?
I don't care if they hang you for 10 dollars or 10 cents.
It makes no difference to me.
But it just so happens that temporarily
I got a little pull around here.
And I might be able to get you off the hook, if I wanted to.
Are you a general?
You're not a general, and only a general can grant my reprieve.
Look, stupid.
I'm making you a proposition.
All I want from you is a straight yes or no.
- You talk, I'll listen.
- Okay.
You either can sweat out the two days you have before the hanging... or you join an outfit that I'm putting together.
If you do that, I'll have you out of here in less than 24 hours.
But you'll be worked to death, and there's not a beating you won't take.
And then when I'm satisfied with you... you'll go where the Army tells you.
Chances are you'll get killed anyway.
You don't know Victor Franko.
- Guard.
- All right, what's the deal?
What's the deal if I do stay alive?
- Might get off the hook.
- Count me in.
But you foul up once, anywhere along the line, just once... and you'll be back here at the end of a rope.
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?
You think I want to die?
If you do, then you don't know Victor Franko.
How come you speak German?
Because my old man was a coal miner in Silesia.
If he didn't speak German, he didn't dig coal and he didn't eat.
That was the language he spoke when he came to the States?
Pretty tough job in those days.
Yeah, it still is.
I don't like officers, not any of them, and I never have.
But you were one yourself, weren't you?
Yeah, three lousy days.
Somebody must have thought you'd make a good officer.
They made a big mistake, didn't they?
Well, I thought you claimed he was going over the hill.
What the hell are you talking about,
"claimed"?
He was going over the hill.
My outfit was pinned down by the worst crossfire you ever saw.
Half of them bleeding to death.
And this lover took off like a rabbit... with the medical supplies on his back.
The only way to stop him was to shoot him.
Anyhow, he had it coming.
Yeah. But you only made one mistake, huh?
Guard.
You let somebody see you do it.
General prisoner Maggott, A.J., sir.
"Maggott, A.J. Death by hanging."
Hey, midnight.
Be a real good boy, now, and maybe
I'll let you eat with the white folks.
Well, Maggott, I see you've got a sense of humor.
The all-American hero, laughing in the face of death.
They're not gonna hang me, major.
I never raped that evil slut... or any other creature.
The Lord gave me that woman and told me to chastise her.
Then he told you to beat her to death, huh?
I only do what I'm called on to do.
I was in a state of grace.
And that woman... she tried to soil my spirit.
Well, I'm sure you were, Maggott.
But it seems to me I remember a quotation that goes like:
Vengeance is mine.
Vengeance is mine.
I will repay, sayeth the Lord.
Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.
Exactly. Now, isn't that supposed to mean... that we leave punishment of the transgressors to his hands?
That's right, major.
That's exactly what it means.
But it doesn't restrict him to the kind of tools he would use, now does it?
And like I told you, major,
I only do what I'm called on to do.
You know, Maggott, I don't think you're going to hang after all.
I think a man like you is destined for higher things. Guard.
Besides, us Southern boys have to stick together now, don't we?
I sure didn't mean to kill that fella.
But you do like I say, and maybe they won't hang you.
Fixing to kill me some other way?
It might not come to that.
I reckon the folks would be a sight happier if I died like a soldier.
Can't say I would.
Who does this hotshot major think he is?
Making us play wet nurses to a bunch of scum.
Corporal Morgan.
If you can't find something to do,
I'll find something for you.
Now, move it.
Don't sweet-talk me, whitey.
You know why I'm here.
Or maybe you think I should've let those cracker bastards... go right ahead and castrate me?
Seeing what those guys tried to do to you...
I'd say that you had considerable justification.
Thank you, Mr. Major, sir.
I really do thank you for that.
But the court didn't agree, right?
So where does that leave you?
I'm offering you an alternative, which means you can keep fighting.
- Who for, major?
- For yourself, if you want.
But the Krauts, they're the real master-race merchants.
That's your war, man, not mine.
You don't like the Krauts, major, you fight them.
Me, I'll pick my own enemies.
That's your privilege. But you won't be able to exercise it much longer.
Guard.
Because on March 25th, you have a date with the hangman.
That's just six days from now.
Buenos dias, major.
You know, sergeant, going over the transcript of that man's trial... there are a couple of things
I don't get.
Did he ever claim that he didn't do it?
I beg your pardon, but you haven't been around prisons very much, have you?
You see, the first thing one learns in prison, everybody is innocent.
This one, he doesn't say too much about that one way or another.
He's only disturbed because we don't allow him to have strings for his guitar.
Sergeant, did you ever lose a man... because he hung himself with a guitar string?
No, sir, I haven't, and I'm not about to.
Well, if he makes the trip, see he gets the strings.
Yes, sir.
Attention!
- Tell the men to be seated.
- Yes, sir. Take seats!
- Guards out.
- Sir, I...
- Guards out.
- Yes, sir.
You heard him. Guards, out!
My name, for those of you who may have forgotten, is Reisman.
You've all volunteered for a mission which gives you just three ways to go:
You can foul up in training and be sent back here for execution of sentence... or you can foul up in combat... in which case
I'll blow your brains out... or you can do as you're told, in which case you might just get by.
You must not attempt to escape.
There will be no excuses, there will be no appeal.
Any breach of either of these conditions by any one of you... means you'll all be shipped back for immediate execution of sentence.
You are therefore dependent upon each other.
Any one of you try anything smart... and the 12 of you get it right in the head, all right?
So try to remember that.
Now, are there any questions?
Sir?
Do we have to eat with niggers?
It's all right.
The gentleman from the South... made some kind of inquiries about the dining arrangements.
He and his colleagues are discussing the place-card settings. All right?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Look, corporal, fellas, let's get with it, right? Remember?
Baseball, pitching?
Chicago's always had the pitching.
But now, as far as...
As far as hitting goes... well, my sister, she can hit better than half them fellas.
Let's move it out!
- Well, what do you think, sergeant?
- I think you'll do just fine, sir.
Don't give me that.
I said, what do you think?
I think the first chance one of them lovers gets... he's gonna shoot the major right in the head, sir.
- Thank you, sergeant.
- Sir.
Okay, Franko. Let's go.
All right, move it out.
Come on.
Over there.
Sergeant, have the men fall in, facing me.
Sir. All right, on your feet. Fall in over here, double-quick! Come on now!
Come on, snap it up.
Snap it up!
Jiminez, get in there!
Ten-hut!
All right, Franko, get rid of that cigarette.
Thank you.
This will be your new home until further notice.
What there is of it will be built by you, but the construction... will in no way interfere with your training.
So the sooner you get it up, the sooner you'll be sleeping in out of the rain.
- Sergeant.
- Sir?
You're in charge. I want this compound up and completed within the month.
Thank you.
If this place was on fire, it'd burn to the ground.
Come on, what are you doing?
All right, come on. Let's move.
Come on.
Hey, Maggott, what are you? German?
Hey, what are you trying to do, break the window?
All right, sergeant, fall them in.
Fall in, in front of the hut.
On the double!
Round it up!
At ease.
All right, that'll be all for today.
How come they got all the comforts of home?
Why can't we put our floor in?
Why can't we put our windows in?
- Franko's right.
- I'd rather sleep in my cell.
Mr. Franko, with his keen eye for detail... has noted that the prisoners' quarters are not yet ready.
The answer to that is simple:
You are not yet ready to occupy that hut... with the degree of comfort that you would like.
When I think that you've earned that privilege, I'll let you know.
Reveille is at 0530.
That is all. Sergeant.
Sir. You heard the man, chow time!
Dismissed!
That's it, fellas. Speak up, boys.
Speak up.
Wind it up, strike one!
Hey, Joseph, is that the way they did it in the Polish navy?
You won't win any cigars that way.
Hey, Franko, number please.
Ask the operator for my nickel back.
Why don't you guys just dry up and blow away?
Meanwhile, on the Atlantic wall...
the German forces
have been preparing...
a few nice surprises for you,
gentlemen...
just in case Mr. Churchill...
is really foolish enough
to attempt an invasion.
He may not be
unduly worried about this...
but then, of course, he will not
be taking any active part...
in such an...
Hey, what's this guy's name again?
You ought to know.
You listen to him every night.
- Dumbo, get me a cup of coffee.
- You crazy?
I say shut the guy up.
- Sleepy time.
- Hey, jump through this, will you?
Hey, you. Come here.
You look like an intelligent guy.
- You like it here?
- No.
You gonna stay here?
- Well, I ain't got nowhere else to go.
- Ah, you're an idiot.
Hey, Wladislaw.
You understand German.
Who's that dame singing about?
Well, it's about a very lonely girl... who's sick and tired of war and being left alone.
- Waiting for her man to come home.
- Keep that cheap, wailing slut quiet!
Let's cut out the community sing.
Get some sleep. You're gonna need it.
Up yours.
Creeps. They're all creeps.
That's what they are. Creeps.
- Hey, where you going?
- Going to the can.
- Want me to come with you?
- You kidding?
They're after Franko.
You trying to get us all hung?
We're all dead anyway. Don't tell me you believe that creep Reisman.
Want that slick bum to make suckers out of you? Whose side are you on?
What's with you?
What is this, anyway?
Uncle Tom week?
You come with me, we're home free.
He doesn't give a damn about you.
If we go on that mission, we all get killed. That's what they want!
Those idiots in there are gonna get shot, and they're not even due for hanging.
You, you slob, you slob.
What do you think you got coming?
- Slipped on a bar of soap, huh?
- Yeah.
Pull with your arms, hold with your legs.
Pull with your arms, hold with your legs.
Come on, Jiminez. Move it.
When the time comes... you've got exactly 34 seconds to clear that distance.
I really can't make it, major.
Oh, come on, Jiminez.
Move it. Don't stop now.
I can't! I can't!
- Come on, Jiminez. Move.
- I really can't.
I can't make it, major.
I can't make it! I can't make it!
Jiminez! You come back down that rope, you're going straight back to prison.
I can't. I can't!
Really, I can't.
Sergeant, give me that weapon.
Take a spin on that rope.
I can't make it. I can't make it!
I can't!
I really can't make it, major.
I can't!
Boy, look at him go now!
So you couldn't make it, huh?
Okay, Posey, let's see a little of that Apache know-how.
Re-thread that pulley and get another rope down here. Come on!
Give these other characters a crack at immortality.
You said Mayonnaise was the only one supposed to get on top of that chateau.
But suppose Jiminez gets killed before he gets to the top of that chateau.
- Come on, Posey. Move it.
- Come on, get that thing up here.
We'll have it ready in a minute, major.
All right, Franko, you're next.
All right, so much for hygiene on the field.
Now, which one of you guys would like to stick this in the major?
Well, major, if it's gonna help the war effort...
Franko, sit down.
You'll get your chance.
Well, let's see...
- Posey.
- Me?
Yeah, step out here.
I'd rather not, sir.
Look, Posey, it's just an example.
Come on, now. Step out here.
Now, will you hold this knife?
Posey, it's got a scabbard on it.
It can't hurt anybody.
Tell me, Posey, what did they lock you up for?
I mean, what did you do?
I already told you that, sir.
Well, tell me again.
I'm sure that your friends over here would like to know too.
- What'd you do, Posey?
- Yeah, fill him in.
This fella kept pushing me.
I don't like to be pushed, so I hit him.
Killed a man with your bare hands because he shoved you?
I only hit him once.
Only hit him once.
And drove his jawbone right through his brain because he pushed him.
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- You didn't mean to kill him, but you did.
Now, what would you do if you meant to kill somebody? Could you do it?
If you had to kill somebody with a knife, do you think you could do it?
- Come on. Tell me.
- I'd rather not.
I don't care what you'd rather do.
Come on, stick that knife in me.
You can do that. Come on.
Major, I don't want to do this.
Come on, Posey. Just stick it right here in me, it won't hurt.
Come on.
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You're not. I'm gonna hurt you.
- Posey, stick me.
- I don't want no trouble.
You got no trouble. I'll give you all the trouble you'll get.
Come on, now, Posey. Just stick that knife right there, right there.
You're a big boy.
You killed a man for shoving you?
I'm shoving you.
- Come on. Let me have it.
- Stick him!
I'm talking to you. Give it to me or I'm gonna shove you right through the wall!
Come on, Posey. Give it to him!
- Stab him!
- Get him, Posey! Come on, Posey!
I want that knife.
Why won't you give it to me?
- I don't like to be shoved, major.
- You're being shoved!
- Stick him!
- Knock him down, Posey!
Posey. What a name for a guy like you.
- Stop!
- Don't tell me what to do.
- I'm giving orders.
- I don't like pushing.
Give it to him, Pose! Come on!
I don't like to be shoved.
Stop pushing!
Posey. Posey!
- Posey.
- Yes, sir?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
All right, now. Relax.
Come on, get up.
You know, you learn how to take care of that temper of yours... ain't nobody gonna take this knife away from you.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Okay, major. We're all set.
All right, you go in and see Captain Kinder.
- What's he gonna do?
- He's just gonna talk to you, Posey.
- Brush yourself off and go on in.
- Yes, sir.
All right, which of you gentlemen is next?
Come on. I'm looking for a volunteer.
All right, Maggott. You're next.
Speed it up, men.
Come on, speed it up.
They're looking good.
Yes, sir. I hope they don't forget what they're getting in shape for.
Captain Kinder figures maybe he can teach me letters.
Folks back home would be proud if I could write.
Well, that would put you way ahead of most of the guys around here.
- Better fall in and join them.
- Yes, sir.
It's true that I've been blessed... with an insight into women that others don't have.
And sometimes...
Well, sometimes I'm called upon... to use it in our beloved master's will.
If women are your special province, why do you hate Major Reisman so much?
There are 11 evil men out there... and they must be punished for their wickedness.
And this Major Reisman, he just snatched them up... from the brink of the pit, and he cheated the master of his vengeance.
And you think that's what God wants?
To punish these men?
Oh, he will, captain. He will.
And Major Reisman too.
- So, what does that give you?
- It doesn't give me anything.
But along with these other results, it gives you... about the most twisted, anti-social bunch of psychopathic deformities ever.
And the worst, the most dangerous of the bunch is Maggott.
You've got one religious maniac, one malignant dwarf, two near-idiots...
And the rest, I don't even want to think about.
Well, I can't think of a better way to fight a war.
The results of these tests point to the fact that each man... has a built-in resentment against any kind of authority. Any kind.
- Don't you?
- But this is different.
These guys think the U.S. Army is their enemy, not the Germans.
Well, they know the U.S. Army.
But the Krauts haven't done anything to them yet.
Very sophisticated.
Well, at least they know the U.S. Army.
You can twist it any way you want.
But the point is... you are their main enemy.
And when the time comes, you'll be the number one target.
Well, at least it gives them something in common.
What do you mean?
They've come a long way individually, further than we have a right to expect.
But not as a unit. Not as a group.
They've gotta function as a team.
And that's what's lacking.
You think putting them on guard duty will help?
Well, it might give them a sense of participation.
Why don't you let me weed out the real morons? Especially Maggott.
I didn't pick these men, the Army did.
And I didn't pick the assignment either.
This is one time the Army's going with a starting lineup all the way.
- Including Maggott?
- Including Maggott.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- We could get ourselves hurt, right?
- Why don't you shut up, huh?
What's the matter?
You planning to save your mother?
Why don't you lay off?
Want me to show you how to do it, huh?
All right.
Take my arm, put it around your neck.
Very simple, right?
And then it's all in the leverage.
Better learn how to fall.
You'll end up in a wheelchair.
That's what I tried to tell him.
Trouble is you just don't know how to fall right. Here.
Slob. Ah, that's a bad attitude.
Kind of rough on the little fella, aren't you? Like to try that with me?
Now, this is really quite simple.
I'm going to say a word, and you come back at me... as fast as you can with whatever comes to mind.
For instance, if I were to say
"happiness," you might say "children."
I wouldn't say that.
Well, that was just an example.
But if I said "ambition," what would you say?
I wouldn't say anything.
Well, let's give it a try, okay?
- Weapon.
- Baseball.
- Knife.
- Dodgers.
- Officer.
- Pitcher.
You seem to be thinking about just one thing, aren't you?
Yeah. What are you thinking about?
Well, you see, I don't want you to think of just one thing.
I'd like for you to concentrate on each word I throw at you. Okay?
Okay.
Food.
Cincinnati.
- Comfort.
- Chicago.
- Now, what made you say that?
- That's what I was thinking about.
The hell with it!
Franko, what is it this time?
How am I supposed to shave in cold water?!
You're in the field now.
Where are you gonna get hot water?
The guards got hot water!
You got hot water!
- You're in the field!
- That's tough.
Right. How come you guys have hot water and we don't?
You keep quiet!
You keep your big mouth shut.
- We ain't shaving in cold water!
- Not if all you don't.
You want us to shave in cold water?
Why don't you?
- That's right.
- Yeah!
Franko means it.
We ain't shaving. We ain't washing.
Not in cold water!
- Is that right?
- That's right!
The guards got hot, we won't use cold.
And you can't make us!
You're gonna get yourself into hot water, Franko.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hang us?
What can they do?
They can't do nothing!
- Nothing.
- Now what are you gonna do?
You know, I think Franko might be right this time.
Yeah, shaving in cold water won't make us any better soldiers.
Excuse me, sir.
We got some trouble outside.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear.
- All right, sergeant. Fall them in.
- Yes, sir.
All right, fall in. On your feet!
Come on, right over here, Posey!
Come on! Dress it up there. Get in line!
What's this about refusing to shave?
Who is refusing to shave?
- We are!
- Who is we?
We!
All those refusing to shave, take one step forward.
So you want to stink, huh?
And maybe itch too?
Well, that's okay with me because I don't have to smell you.
Sergeant, there will be no further issue of shaving equipment... or the use of soap.
And there will be no more hot meals.
Just K rations.
Courtesy of Mr. Franko.
At ease.
- Hey, I really think we got something.
- Yeah, it's what the Navy calls "mutiny."
No, no. Remember what I was saying last night about 12 rugged individualists?
So?
You heard them. It was "we ain't gonna do this and we ain't gonna do that."
When I asked them to step forward, even Posey joined.
I'll bet you he's been shaving in cold water since he was a kid.
Boy, do I love that Franko.
That means that we are going to have that much more time for work.
Right?
So now, if you...
You "dirty dozen" have no objections... we will get our equipment... and we will start in right now.
Attention!
Ready, hut!
That's very good.
You look just like real soldiers.
Fall out!
Now, move it!
You're still the dirtiest soldiers in this man's army... and you're getting filthier every day.
But your training is almost over.
In two days, you'll be learning how to jump with a parachute... and you'll learn quick.
This training will take place at a regular Army base.
And I just want to remind you that this operation is secret.
Top secret.
You will not be wearing dog tags.
You will not say anything to anyone.
Do you understand? Nothing.
Nothing!
One word, one slip from any one of you... and the deal is off!
And you all know what that means, right?
All right, serve it up.
All right, serve it up!
Colonel Breed won't like this secrecy bit.
He'll want to know.
- We're still top-priority, aren't we?
- You can't ignore his author...
- Do we have the juice?
- Yes, but Colonel Br...
Then I don't care what Colonel Breed likes.
Look, you're supposed to be the liaison officer.
I want you to get orders to the highest echelon... stating to Colonel Everett
Dasher Breed... that a group, over which he will have no authority, will be arriving Tuesday... and the identity of the men is secret.
Tell him we got a general with them... tell him anything you want, just get that West Point bum off of my back.
A general, huh?
I'll see what I can do.
- I know you will.
- Hey, Franko. What is it, man?
- What kind of food is that?
- Pig face, serve it up!
What is it?
I don't know. I never ate anything like this before.
I've stepped in it a couple of times, but I never ate it.
What is it?
Did you ask what general?
Yes, sir. Got the same thing again.
No information beyond what was in the order.
What about General Denton?
When we first called, his extension was busy. Now he's not there.
Not now.
- Well, what about you?
- Nothing, sir.
Not now, you...
I think they're coming.
Yeah, it's them.
Yes? Sir, they just passed the checkpoint.
Let's go.
Now. Now!
Sounds like we're running into a party.
Boy, you don't suppose it's for us, do you?
Present arms!
Major Reisman reporting, sir.
Where's the general?
He's in the truck. But you understand that he's traveling incognito.
We thought he might care to inspect our number one platoon.
If you give me a moment,
I'll see if he's willing to do that.
Order, halt!
How come the band?
- What are we waiting for?
- They're inspecting the guest list.
- What guest list?
- What's the matter with you?
Which one of you wants to be a general?
Be a what?
Pinkley.
What? What kind of a general, sir?
Just a plain ordinary, everyday, home-loving American general.
I'd rather be a civilian, sir.
What do I have to do?
You've seen generals inspecting troops.
Just walk slow and act stupid.
Up one rank, down the other, and straight back to the truck.
They're expecting a general, and that's exactly what they'll get.
So let's go.
- Move it. Come on, move it!
- Ten-hut!
Present arms!
Move it.
Let's go, move it.
Fall in!
- Pinkley's gonna be a general.
- Why?
- Pinkley's gonna be a general.
- What for?
Shut up and watch.
First Platoon waiting for inspection, sir!
They're very pretty, colonel.
Very pretty.
- But can they fight?
- Yes, sir.
I hope you're right.
- Where are you from, son?
- Madison City, Missouri, sir.
Never heard of it.
All right, major, let's go. We got work to do. Thank you, colonel.
Hold it down. Hold it down.
You pull a stunt like that again,
I'll beat your brains out.
Major, you d...
Sergeant, fall them into a column of twos, then move out.
Yes, sir. Fall out. Fall into column of twos on me. Fall out!
Reisman!
Some people may consider you a first-class officer.
But as far as I'm concerned, you're a disorganized, undisciplined clown.
I'm gonna make it my business to run you out of this Army.
I owe you an apology, colonel.
I always thought that you were a cold, unimaginative, tight-lipped officer.
But you're really quite emotional, aren't you?
Clayton, Blake.
- Hey, watch it.
- Look out, will you?
- Hey, hold this.
- All right, let's go!
- Do you believe this guy?
- Okay, all right, we're coming!
Come on, let's go!
You're in the way.
What's the matter with you guys?
- Listen, buster.
- Hands off!
Now, take it easy.
- Just want to ask you a few questions.
- Questions, huh?
Hold him! Hold him!
You son of a...
In the gut, so it don't show.
That's the way!
Talk, you bastard.
Who the hell are you?
- Number Nine, you crumb.
- Number Nine?
- You gonna tell us or not?
- Go to hell.
Hold him.
Where the hell are your dog tags?
- I ate them.
- You ate them?
- You gonna tell us now?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Number Nine!
- Wladislaw!
What happened?
They tried to make me talk.
Where the hell have you been?
- Wait. What happened to him?
- He slipped on a bar of soap.
Everybody's slipping on soap.
Of all the miserable...
- Who?
- Who? Reisman.
He had a couple of those paras jump him.
- Major did this?
- Gave him a pretty hard time.
- Well?
- Well, what?
Did he tell them anything?
Are you crazy?
Three wise men.
"Trust your major."
I'd rather trust Hitler.
- All right, move it out.
- Come on, move it! Move it!
You'll find this easier than our jump-tower training.
Action stations!
Go!
Morgan.
- Yes, sir.
- They should be here any minute now.
Get the men together.
I'll talk to them first.
- We'll use your hut tonight.
- Our hut?
Your hut.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
All right, Ike and Mike.
Come on, get on your feet.
Come on, let's go.
Move it!
What are you, the Gold Dust Twins?
What, you need a special invitation?
- No, sir.
- No, sir?
- I mean, yes, sir.
- Then move it.
That's TS, Greek.
Why don't you tell it to the chaplain?
All right, you foul-ups, come on!
Get over to the MP hut.
The man wants to talk to you.
Come on, move it!
All right.
Stop pushing.
Come on, off it now. Let's get going!
So this is how the other half lives.
Get going!
Hey, we're not going to the junior prom.
- Pretty sweet, huh?
- No dancing. Come on, let's go!
- They got electricity.
- Nice to be rich.
- Hey, what does he want to see us for?
- A radio.
- A radio?
- Hey, look at those pictures.
Maybe the guards are lonesome.
- Horny bunch of mothers.
- Wow!
All right, give them a little air, boys.
Move it, Jiminez.
Okay, sarge.
Well, jump school didn't kill you.
Maybe that stuff will.
Your training's about over and I figure that entitles you... to a graduation ball or something.
You have cups and glasses.
All right, wheel them in.
Shall I say they're with your compliments?
Hell, no.
Tell them it's part of their training.
Yes, sir.
Where are we?
Oh! Somebody in this truck has a cold nose.
Get off me foot!
Watch yourself, baby.
- Have you hurt yourself?
- It's a limey barrack!
I'm not one for orgies meself.
- Should've asked for more money.
- Bitch.
You sadists!
- Good evening.
- I'm already too worn out to work.
- Right this way, ladies.
- Move along. That's nice.
Good evening, major.
I could only get eight, sir. It's like cops.
If you want one, you can't find them.
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, admiral.
Blimey, they're filthy!
They may be, lady, but they sure do mean well.
Hey!
All present and accounted for, major.
You gentlemen will be on duty again at 0600 hours in the morning.
That's, oddly enough, the same amount of time... that these young ladies have allotted to be your guests.
In the meantime, I suggest that you use that time to get acquainted.
I don't believe that Mr. Maggott would care to indulge... so I suggest you save some whiskey for him when he gets off of duty.
Good night, gentlemen. Ladies.
Good night, colonel.
- Are you crazy?
- Let's go. We might inhibit them.
- You want to bet?
- Major!
Yes, you, Major Reisman!
I saw those filthy strumpets!
You're turning this place into a bottomless pit of vice!
Comes Judgment Day!
And Judgment Day is coming!
Those men, major, they'll suffer eternal damnation... because of you, major!
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.
You're on guard duty, Maggott.
Want to dance?
There's no music.
Try humming.
All right, girls, you want to lose those wraps?
- Put on that radio.
- Make yourself at home.
You think those guys realize tomorrow's Mother's Day?
Is it?
Now they're doing it to music.
- This is a restricted area, sir.
- I know that.
Two groups, three ranks in.
Open the gate.
Come on, let's move it!
Open this gate.
Yes, sir.
Hey, look at those guys.
You can't come in here, sir!
Sergeant, take his weapon.
Take his weapon.
Corporal Morgan. Sergeant, get that rabble in some kind of order.
Yes, sir. Commander, man to man!
Sir, you are contravening a direct order.
Contravening nothing!
Fall in with the rest and speak when you're spoken to.
You heard what the colonel said.
Fall in!
Come on, move it!
All right, you heard what he said.
Fall in!
Come on, come on!
Let's get the lead out.
What's he all upset about?
All right, you bunch of foul-ups.
Come on. Grab a formation.
Fall in there!
Come on, you yard birds!
You believe this Army?
We gotta be losing.
Move it! What's wrong with you?
You got lead in them?
Come on, get going!
Hey, ain't those the jokers that roughed you up in the latrine?
Come on!
Hey, come on, pick it up!
Yeah, we had Reisman all wrong.
- Come on, move it!
- Not now. Wait for it.
What's going on up there?
Hey, you!
What are you, something special?
We gotta wait all day for you?
Come on!
Get in position there.
Let's try and make a straight line.
Let's look like soldiers, huh?
I told you nobody could pass.
Now, open the gate. Let's get going.
Those are the two guys that got Wladislaw.
Those are the two guys that gave Wladislaw his lumps.
Those are the two guys that jumped Wladislaw.
Those are the two guys that banged Wladislaw.
Those two gorillas beat up Wladislaw.
Those are the two guys...
In my opinion... the officer in command of this operation... has either disregarded his orders or is flagrantly disobeying them... one way or the other.
And that is what I am here to find out.
All right... gentlemen, let's understand each other.
I'm here to find out exactly what this is all about... and I intend to do it if it takes all day.
Now, you can make it easy or tough on yourself. That's up to you.
Before I leave, we're going to find out who's involved in this insanity... what you're doing here and why.
Is that understood?
All right, general.
What's your name, rank and serial number?
You tell him, we've all had it!
Quiet!
What's your name, soldier?
Number Two, sir.
Morgan. Clayton.
Yes, sir?
Give Clayton this man's name, rank and serial number. For all of them.
- I really don't know that, sir.
- Then tell him what you do know.
You fink, you tell him nothing!
- What was that talk down there?
- Nothing, sir.
Come here, soldier.
When did you bathe last?
- I don't remember, sir.
- You're filthy.
You're a disgrace to the uniform.
Sergeant Fredericks, get a razor and water.
He will demonstrate proper procedure for shaving and bathing in the field.
- Yes, sir.
- Right, soldier?
No, sir!
No, sir, what?
No, sir, I am not going to shave, sir!
Then we'll have to do it the hard way.
Clayton, Blake, dry-shave him.
Now!
- Reisman!
- That's right!
You be good enough to have your men dispose of their weapons!
- Sergeant Bowren!
- Sir!
Get some special help and get those weapons!
Yes, sir.
All right, you heard the man!
Now, get moving!
Hit them only where it hurts.
- Turn it loose!
- That's great.
Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.
You Nazi!
I'm with you, major, all the way.
Don't call us, we'll call you.
You must be out of your mind.
It might seem that way.
Take it all back, colonel.
They aren't pretty and they can't fight.
They're all 4-Fs!
Hey, colonel, I hear they don't even use parachutes!
Hey, colonel, you crybaby!
Don't just stand there, pick it up!
- Stick around for tea.
- Put some money in there.
Come again, colonel!
Stop by any time, bozo.
I'm sure you look upon your service record as being highly colorful, major.
Well, that's not my view of it.
I think you know I was never in favor of you leading this operation.
So I can't say that I'm disappointed in your performance.
Because the impression you made on me was unfavorable in the first place.
You behave as if this were a personal matter.
Let me assure you, it isn't.
What happens to you is something to which I am indifferent.
But the nature of the operation
I am running is not.
Colonel Breed's report on your unit's level of achievement... and general behavior at the parachute training school is entirely negative.
It would in itself justify my recommendation... that this operation be canceled.
Your men will be sent back for execution of sentence.
Whether disciplinary action should be taken against you... is a matter for General Worden here.
I take it you don't deny your responsibility for the fact that... on the night of April 14-15, a military establishment of the U.S. Army... was the scene of a drunken party... at which no less than seven female civilians took an active part.
Oh, yes, sir, they took an active part all right.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Are you in a position to offer even the remotest mitigating circumstances?
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, sergeant, more ice.
Yes, sir.
Well?
You offered those men a chance to get off the hook, and they worked hard.
Now that they're just shaping up, you're gonna say, "Sorry, the deal's off"?
You've only yourself to blame for that.
You brought those women to camp.
So I broke an Army regulation.
You're gonna kill five men and send the rest to prison for life?
Because if you did that... you'd have to lock up half the U.S. Army, officers included.
Anyway, you said it yourself, it was my fault.
It's not gonna affect their ability as soldiers.
Yes, well, we've heard about their ability as soldiers from Colonel Breed.
That's his opinion.
My men have crammed six months of intensive training into as many weeks.
As of this moment, I'd stack them up against any men in the Army.
You can't be serious.
You're damn right I am!
They might not be pretty... but any one of mine is worth 10 of yours.
- Those comparisons are hardly the point.
- It's precisely the point.
My contention is that my men are more than able to handle any job given them.
Now, you gentlemen set this thing up.
You promised them a chance.
At least you can let them show you what they're capable of.
I shudder to think what they might be capable of.
Give them a chance to prove it, then if they fail, your conscience is clear.
Tell me, major... just how would you have your men prove it?
It can't be done, can it?
Well, yes. I suppose it could.
I mean, there might be a way.
What I mean is, general, if you recall... next week we've got divisional maneuvers in Devonshire.
Yes, yes, yes.
Colonel Breed's outfit will be part of that exercise.
As a matter of fact, one of his companies... has been assigned the defense of divisional headquarters.
So?
So...
So you let my 12 men act as an independent unit... attached to the opposing force.
And they'll knock out Breed's headquarters and capture his entire staff.
That I'd like to see.
So would I.
Charlie and Fox Companies will support the back of the woods.
They'll need supplies from the 2nd Battalion.
Rogers won't like that, but I don't want to hear about it.
- Yes, sir.
- How's Johnson's armor?
They just ran through two minutes ago, sir. The armor's all set.
Hold it!
Back!
Change!
You think we're gonna get away with this?
Smile, you idiots! If those blue slobs recognize us, we're in trouble.
Can you believe it?
They shaved.
How about that?
Get a load of the major.
He can't believe we made it.
- The day go fast, major?
- You're beautiful, but you're late.
- Got everything you need?
- Absolutely.
Think you can remember the plan?
- So where'd you get the vehicle?
- We stole it.
Like we're gonna steal everything else.
We're playing war games, right?
Anything else, sir?
I guess not. All right, we'll be with the generals at headquarters.
From now on, you're on your own.
So take off and good luck.
Let's move!
All right, split up into three groups.
These two belong to you?
Where's General Worden?
Well, he's gone to check up in the field, sir.
Oh, my God.
- Well?
- Be with you in a minute, sir.
- Well, how about this one?
- Yes, sir. I think that's it, sir.
Oh, that's excellent,
Haskell, excellent!
Come on, let's go.
- We made it.
- Where are the others?
8:45. Four of them ought to be coming over that ridge soon.
0845? They'd better be coming fast then.
The enemy is gonna lay a live barrage on that ridge at 0850. Did you know that?
Yes, sir, I knew that.
But that's the one direction Colonel
Breed won't be looking for them.
- Are they all set?
- All set, sir.
Batteries one, three and four, open fire and continue at will.
Batteries one, three and four, open fire and continue at will.
Batteries one, three and four...
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Come on!
Let's go! Come on!
Load!
Now, come on!
- While they're reloading!
- Let's go!
- Down! Can't you hear it?!
- Hit it!
Secure guards!
All right, let's go!
Let's go.
Now, what the hell were you guys waiting for?
What do you m...?
Mean, boy?
Those lovers were trying to kill us back there.
Change.
Change? What do you mean, "change"?
You can't do that!
It's all right, major.
We're gonna change back later.
They can't stop us now.
Let's go.
Come on.
We're on our way.
We get across this road, take 10.
What are we waiting here for?
For a jeep, a heavy machine gun and four men.
Like this one?
Slow down.
Ten-hut!
Good afternoon, general.
The Mafia has landed!
- Whatever Franko says, Franko does!
- Machine gun.
Let's get it out. Move it out.
- Come on, snap it up.
- Franko, out!
Out? What do you mean, "out"?
- Who do you think stole this thing?
- You did, my boy.
Look, you and Pinkley are the only guys that Colonel Breed got a good look at.
This operation is a big enough risk without you coming along.
- Out.
- Come on, Franko.
Jefferson, you have until 0930 to show up with the ambulance.
You don't make it,
I'll figure you got nailed.
- Then we'll take a whack at plan B.
- Right.
So long, major.
Hold on, Maggott.
Don't want to lose you now.
Attention!
Attention.
Ten-hut!
- Morning, Breed.
- Morning. Quite a surprise.
- Everything under control?
- I think you could say that, sir.
Good, good.
At ease, gentlemen, at ease.
Just thought I'd drop by to see how things are shaping up.
So this is what it looks like, huh?
Come on, push!
- Posey, remember, you're hurt.
- Oh, I'm dying.
Come on, Maggott.
Stand back, now.
- What's that?
- Over there!
- What was that?
- Down the road, sir. See that smoke?
- Sergeant, have somebody take a look.
- Yes, sir.
- What are they doing around that ridge?
- I don't know, sir.
That should've been cleared half an hour ago.
Now, colonel, it sure doesn't look like it's been cleared, does it?
Let's go.
- Posey, remember, you're injured.
- Gilpin, you forgot the ketchup.
- Help!
- Come on.
Sir?
We got a man that's hurt bad.
We'd like to call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance.
Go see what happened.
- Yes, sir. Come on, you two.
- Private?
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.
What were you doing on that road?
Our jeep got a flat tire.
We went into a ditch.
I didn't ask you that. I asked you what you were doing on that road.
Spotting for the Field Artillery, sir.
Let's see that map.
Move Able, Charlie Company to... the bridge under smoke screen.
Baker Company bank towards the ridge at 1420 hours.
- Private. Come here.
- Yes, sir.
What's your name and outfit?
Private Matthew Donald, sir.
Serial number 726256.
Battery B, 526th Field Artillery, sir.
- Where are your orders?
- Right here, sir.
From Captain Thornhill, sir.
I know most of the men under my command.
But I don't recall seeing you before.
No, sir.
I was transferred in last week, sir.
We're getting congested at point B.
Two forces have mined the road.
- Where's Peterson?
- Here it comes!
Clear the way!
Looks like somebody got hurt.
Watch it there!
Okay, let's have some help with this soldier.
Count of three, lift. One, two, lift.
Take it easy now.
- Where do we put him, sir?
- Put him there.
- You can stay, but keep out of the way.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Sorry, but this is the end of the line for you.
But we got a bad accident down here, sir.
That's too bad, because you just became prisoners of war.
It's the enemy, sir!
All right, come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.
They can't do that.
You're wearing Red Force insignia.
That's right. We're traitors.
- Watch my finger.
- They use real bullets, you idiot!
Now, look here, I'm a doctor, major.
And I'm a major, captain.
Yes, sir, but we had a radio message.
There's a man badly hurt down there.
Hurry it up!
Here's our permission to cross all lines and roadblocks.
Very cute idea, captain.
But it won't work. Get out.
But it's not a gag, sir.
There's a real casualty there.
All set back here, Jefferson.
Sir, will you explain the rules to him?
The man may be dying.
I'm just an observer, captain, not an umpire.
I can't interfere or make any rulings.
Come on, doc,
I've got a sick tree back here.
Come on, you too.
She's blond, she's engaged.
Come on, sugar!
- Got your bracelet right here.
- What's the matter?
Come on, Little Red Riding Hood.
You're really gonna enjoy this.
How about this patient, huh, doc?
You're really gonna enjoy it here, doc.
Come on, men. What about 0930?
All right, take out the blue bands.
Let's go!
Change to the blue armband!
What about the prisoners?
Sorry, major. We can't spare any men to look after prisoners.
You coming?
- Is he trying to kill us?
- We must be going 120.
He's gonna squash us in this sardine can.
You want to be there by 0930, don't you?
Yeah.
- Pulling back the map reference,
That's Blue Force crew.
Call in company orders and hit them when they reach crossroads.
Hello, Able 3.
Don't worry, Bill. They called for the ambulance.
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yes, it will.
It's gonna be all right.
I want a strike on Hill 80 between them at 1400 hours.
Move them up to the base of the hill and keep their heads down.
Well, thanks very much, colonel.
It's been very instructive.
I think I'll take a little ride now and get the overall picture.
Yes, sir, thank you.
Move it over. Give them room.
Forward observation report.
Blue Force tanks approaching... airfield at map reference...
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Come on.
Watch out for the ambulance!
There he is. The old man.
Come on, observers!
Major Reisman's compliments, sir.
Hey, major. What do you think about that one, major?
I didn't wanna tell you before because
I thought it might make you nervous.
After our last little party, the generals were all in favor... of sending you back to finish your sentences.
- Or get hung.
- Or get hung.
Or get hung.
But I made a deal with them.
Knocking off Breed's headquarters is what got you guys off the hook.
You weren't really worried, were you, major?
No, not much, he wasn't.
But we still have one operation to go.
If you guys foul up on this one, none of us will ever play the violin again.
Because up until now, it's all been a game.
But as of tomorrow night, it's gonna be the real thing.
If you want to know how real,
I'll tell you.
It's my guess the lot of you guys won't be coming back.
But there's no sense in squawking about that.
Because the Army never did love you.
Besides, you all volunteered, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, that's more than I did.
Sergeant Bowren.
Look, I know we've been over this a thousand times... but a lot can go wrong.
We gotta be prepared to improvise.
So let's see what happens if everything goes right. Ready?
- One.
- At the roadblock, we've just begun.
- One.
- At the roadblock, we've just begun.
- Two.
- The guards are through.
- Three.
- The major's men are on a spree.
- Four.
- Major and Wladislaw through the door.
- Five.
- Pinkley stays out in the drive.
- Six.
- The major gives the rope a fix.
- Seven.
- Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.
- Eight.
- Jiminez has got a date.
- Nine.
- The other guys go up the line.
- Ten.
- Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.
- Eleven.
- Posey guards points five and seven.
- Twelve.
- Wladislaw and major go down to delve.
And where's Donald Duck?
Donald Duck's down at the crossroads with a machine gun.
And he'd better not be asleep, or we'll all be in trouble.
- Thirteen.
- Franko goes up without being seen.
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.
- And?
- Mayonnaise cuts the cable...
Franko cuts the phone.
- Fifteen.
- Franko goes in... where the others have been.
- Sixteen.
- We all come out like it's Halloween.
And kill every officer in sight.
Ours or theirs?
Well, let's start off with theirs, huh?
Let's take it again from the top, without the ad-libs.
- All right, one.
- Down the roadblock, we've just begun.
- Two.
- The guards are through.
- Three.
- The major's men are on a spree.
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.
- And?
- Mayonnaise cuts the cable...
Franko cuts the phone.
- Fifteen.
- Franko goes in... where the others have been.
- Sixteen.
- We all come out like it's Halloween.
Seventeen?
Seventeen. D-day.
We get out as best we can and make our way to the coast.
And hope that the entire invasion hasn't been a total disaster.
Otherwise, we got a long swim home.
How much longer, major?
I'll ask the driver.
You're not worried about jumping at night, are you?
Getting back.
Ready.
Cargo.
Go.
- Where have you been? We're late.
- We've been looking for Jiminez.
- And?
- We found him hung up in an apple tree.
- His neck's broken.
- You mean he's dead?
That's exactly what I mean.
- This far.
- Yeah.
All right, Franko, now you know why we all checked out on that rope, huh?
Gilpin, number eight.
Gilpin, did you hear me?
- Eight.
- Gilpin's got a date?
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.
- And?
- Gilpin cuts the cables...
Franko cuts the phone.
- Let's go.
- What a great way to start out, huh?
- Yeah.
So far, so good, major.
Where are those guys?
Here they come.
Let's go.
Come on, Pinkley, let's go.
It's just like the major said it would be.
Yeah, really some spread, ain't it?
There they go now.
- No blackout?
- Think they're expecting us?
Hey, the silencer!
Let's go.
"Radio room."
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
I don't know how many
Germans we'll kill... but we're gonna make an awful lot of noise.
Hey, do you believe in stuff like that?
Oh, I don't know, can't hurt nothing.
I don't think I believe in stuff like that.
- So, how's your German holding up?
- Oh, man, I don't know.
You know those two guys walking down the stairs?
I couldn't understand a word they said.
- Just act mean and grunt, huh?
- Yeah.
Okay, Room 11.
So?
You go first, I'll carry the bags.
We'll set it up here.
- They should've been here by now.
- Yeah.
Guard!
I left the rope.
Hold it.
Idiot.
- Do it, Polack!
- Shut up.
Hurry up.
Now.
Now.
Ready for the turkey shoot?
I wish I could read this.
I think it's dirty.
Hey! What are you doing?
Franko and the others are still down there. Come on!
Hey, Maggott.
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of sight.
Wolfgang?
Wolfgang?
Wolfgang?
Scream.
Scream.
Scream, you slut.
Sprechen, you harlot.
Scream.
Radio room.
Blow it! Blow it!
- Hey, what's going on?
- Shut up.
It's Judgment Day, you sinners.
Come out.
Come out, wherever you are.
Come out.
Come out.
Now!
- You didn't think about that, did you?
- They gotta breathe.
You got the grenades?
Right. Right, sir.
We got enough here to blow up the world.
What are we gonna do about them?
We'll feed the French and kill the Germans.
- Franko, cover that corner.
- What happened?
They're locked in the bunker. There's gotta be some air vents. Take a look.
All right, bring your grenades!
Over here!
I'll take them.
Here they are.
Take it down there.
Bowren, get Vladek out here.
Where's that coming from?
Come on, Vladek, we need you.
Come on, come on.
Franko! Get over here and see if you can start one of those trucks!
Wladislaw, Jefferson. Get the lids off those other ventilators.
You know what you gotta do, so do it.
Hurry up!
All right, you Frenchies, beat it.
No, it's all right. It's all right. Go on.
Get back up there and cover that bridge!
Move it!
Help Bowren!
There they are!
Hurry it up. Posey's got trouble!
Get one of those trucks started!
No, no, no. Leave the pins in.
The pins in, huh?
Bowren, get some gasoline.
Some gasoline?
Are you sure?
You want to ask Pinkley and Vladek?
Now, get going!
Yes, sir.
Sawyer, Lever, cover that bridge!
Do you believe these guys?
They keep these things locked.
Keep looking!
The other road! The other road!
Come on, baby.
Where are you, baby?
Let's go!
Move over.
Move over!
Wladislaw... get Vladek out of there, huh?
Another flare! Another flare!
Come on, you...
Jefferson! When I give you the signal... set them off one, two, three, four, and get the hell out of there.
We'll wait for you at the bridge.
- Right?
- Right.
Let's go!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, hurry up!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Jefferson, set them off!
Get that thing out of here or we'll all go up!
Let's go.
They're not gonna make it.
We'll get a boat and get out the other side. Come on, let's go.
All right, blow it!
Remember, Jefferson, 20 seconds!
Run!
- Faster, faster.
- Come on! Come on!
Jefferson faster.
Come on, Jefferson. Run!
- Go!
- Hurry up!
- Come on, move!
- Come on, come on.
- It's gonna blow!
- Come on!
Come on, Jefferson!
Jefferson!
Come on, start.
It won't start! It won't start!
The bastard won't start!
All right, get in!
Shift! Shift it, shift it!
We made it!
We made it. Those stupid bastards, we made it!
Come on! Keep shooting!
Major!
Among the many reports of the raid
on the chateau near Rennes...
perhaps the most objective
is the one by General Worden...
in which he states:
"We are recommending that those
members of the group known...
as 'The Dirty Dozen ' who survived
this operation...
should have their records
amended to indicate...
that they are being returned
to active duty at their former ranks.
And that the next of kin of those
prisoners who were killed be advised...
that they lost their lives in the line of duty. "
You did a fine job, major.
I'll see you around.
You did a good job, soldier.
Hurry up and get well.
We need men like you out there.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Killing generals could get to be a habit with me.
Franko, V.R.
Vladek, M.
Jefferson, R. T.
Pinkley, V.L.
Gilpin, S.
Posey, S.
Sawyer, S.K.
Lever, R.
Bravos, T.R.
Jiminez, J.P.
Maggott, A.J.
They lost their lives
in the line of duty.

Couldn't you have talked sooner?
It would've gone easier for you.
He finally came clean.
Give him some coffee.
Don't worry.
Drink this.
You'll feel better.
Don't take it so hard, fella.
At ease.
Is it true?
- Looks like it. 3 rue des Abderames.
Get him dressed.
Buck up.
It's all over now.
Just one last little effort.
Can you stand?
Let go of him.
Here, put this on.
It'll suit you fine.
We're going to the Casbah now.
They won't recognize you in that.
Show us Ali La Pointe's hideout.
Then you'll be free.
Give him a cap and dress him.
You're inducted!
Cut the clowning, Lagloy!
Let's go.
Knock it off!
Wanna go through another round?
Quit fooling around.
Pull yourself together.
THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS
Maybe they don't know we're here.
Ali La Pointe, the house is surrounded. It's useless.
Give yourselves up.
Let the boy and the woman out first.
Then the other man with you.
After that, you come out.
Leave your weapons behind.
No tricks. You're done for.
We have you covered.
You don't have a chance. Got that?
You hear me, Ali?
Listen good! You're the last one.
It's all over.
The organization's finished.
Everyone's dead or in prison.
If you come out now, you'll get a fair trial.
Make up your mind!
THE EUROPEAN QUARTER
THE CASBAH
National Liberation Front (FLN),
Communiqué No. 1:
People of Algeria, our combat is directed against colonialism.
Our aim: Independence and restoration of the Algerian state, in accordance with Islamic principles and the respect of basic liberties, regardless of race or religion.
To avoid bloodshed, we propose that the French authorities negotiate with us our right to self-determination.
Algerians, it is your duty to save your country and restore its liberty.
Its victory will be yours.
Forward, brothers! Unite!
The FLN calls you to arms.
Ladies and gents, place your bets.
This loses, this loses...
Ace wins.
500 francs.
Your turn, madam.
Ace wins, this one loses.
He's always there!
- What's his big hurry?
- Stop him.
Bash the bastard's head in!
Omar, Ali.
Alias Ali La Pointe.
Born January 15, 1930, in Miliana.
Illiterate.
Occupation: Laborer, bricklayer, boxer.
Currently unemployed.
Military status: Draft dodger.
1942, Algiers Juvenile Court, one year in reformatory for vandalism.
1944, Oran Juvenile Court, two years for disorderly conduct.
1949, Court of Algiers, eight-month prison term for insulting a police officer on duty.
Allah is great!
Long live Algeria!
Shut up! There he is.
Keep quiet.
FIVE MONTHS LATER
Beat it!
"Men have two faces.
One smiles, the other cries."
They sent you?
Yes, they sent me.
Here.
Wait!
Come back here.
Know how to read?
- Sure.
Read it to me.
"There's a Moorish café on rue Randon, in the Casbah.
Merabi, the owner, is a police informer.
Every afternoon at 5:00, a French policeman stops by.
He stays a few minutes, long enough to drink a coffee and get information.
Then he leaves.
You are to kill the policeman."
- Not Merabi?
- No, the policeman.
Okay.
"You can't go wrong.
Right next to the café you'll see a girl with a basket.
You'll both follow the policeman.
At the right moment, she'll hand you a revolver.
You just have to pull the trigger."
Let go of me!
Watch me, brothers!
So, you're afraid now!
Look how the organization deals with traitors.
- You bitch! You set me up.
- Careful, the police!
- Now explain!
- If they don't catch us first.
Who sent you?
Take me to him.
- He's waiting.
- Where?
You'll see, if we don't get caught.
You go first.
I'll be right behind you.
What if you were a traitor?
We had to be sure.
- The gun was empty.
- Say you'd been a police spy, the FLN contacts you in prison, you pretend to be for the cause, and the French let you escape.
Then they shoot me?
Blanks.
You escape, go to the address the FLN gives you in prison, and infiltrate us.
And who are you?
Jaffar. El-hadi Jaffar.
To join us you had to do a job.
If I'd told you to kill the bar owner, an Algerian, the cops would've let you kill him even though he's a stoolie.
It wouldn't have proved your loyalty.
If I told you to kill the cop, the French would never have allowed it.
If you had been one of them, you wouldn't have done it.
But I didn't kill him.
No, but you tried.
That's the important thing.
You didn't trust me!
Come on, don't get excited.
I said to shoot him in the back.
No way!
You still don't understand.
Explain it better.
Okay, I'll explain.
First, we need to get organized and secure our hideouts.
Then we can take action.
The organization's getting stronger, but there are still too many drunks, whores, junkies, people who talk too much, people ready to sell us out.
We must win them over or eliminate them.
We need to clean house first, organize the country.
Only then can we take on our real enemy. You understand, Ali?
APRIL 1956
National Liberation Front,
Communiqué No. 24:
People of Algeria, the Colonial Administration is responsible not only for impoverishing our people but also for corrupting and degrading our brothers and sisters, who have lost their sense of dignity.
The FLN is leading a campaign to eradicate this scourge and requests the population's help and cooperation.
This is the first step towards independence.
As of today, the FLN assumes responsibility for the physical and moral well-being of the Algerian people and has therefore decided to ban the sale and use of all drugs and alcoholic beverages and to ban prostitution and procuring.
Offenders will be punished. Repeat offenders will be sentenced to death.
Wino! Wino!
Don't you know drugs are forbidden?
- Why?
- Don't do it again.
Have you seen Hassan El-Blidi?
You seen Hassan El-Blidi?
Tell him I'm looking for him.
Seen Hassan?
If you see Hassan El-Blidi, tell him I'm looking for him.
Ali, where've you been?
- Is Hassan here?
- He left very early. Need something?
If you see him, tell him I'm looking for him.
Ali! How're you doing?
Stay there. Don't move.
- Take it easy.
- I told you not to move.
What are you afraid of?
I fear only God.
What's all this about?
There's nothing between us.
We're friends.
Have you forgotten?
We were friends.
What's happened to you?
You're sentenced to death.
Now I understand.
You've sentenced me to death.
What are they paying you?
Only one thing can save you.
You've been warned twice.
This is your last warning.
What do you mean?
Work for the FLN.
Get lost!
Don't try it! Take a good look.
Things will change in the Casbah.
Take a good look.
We'll clean this place up.
Now beat it!
And watch yourselves.
JUNE 10, 1956
Stay outside and keep watch.
Everything all right?
- Fine.
Be seated.
We'll skip the formalities.
You know why.
The day will come when we will have our weddings in the open.
Remember, we are at war against colonialism.
A strong army has occupied our country for 130 years.
This is why the FLN has to make decisions concerning the civil life of the Algerian people.
With this marriage we fulfill our duty, a duty of resistance.
And now,
Mahmud and Fatiha, come forward.
Sign here.
May God grant you good fortune.
Sign here.
On behalf of the FLN, my sincerest congratulations.
Make yourselves comfortable.
JUNE 20, 1956 - 10:32 A.M.
Come here!
What is it? Calm down.
Come in here.
Hey, Antoine...
Take them in to see the captain.
Yes, sir, but they didn't get a search warrant.
Rue d'lsly?
They followed them some distance but then lost them.
Of course, sir, but that's in your precinct.
It's not their job.
Rue Marengo?
We do have some suspects.
The DA first demands an official request.
Yes, sir.
But I don't have enough men.
I understand.
But if you could...
The prefect can't.
But couldn't you?
Okay.
They can slaughter all of us!
Right.
3:00 p. M:
Attempted attack against a patrol.
Location: Rue Luciani.
Weapon: 7.65mm revolver.
4:00 p. M:
Attack on territorial guard, intersection of rue Consulaire and Avenue Général Laquière.
For Paris, the solution is to put
Algiers under tight police control, guard police stations, close off streets.
I don't agree.
So, Corbière, where were we?
"Intersection of rue Consulaire and Avenue Général Laquière."
The governor general decrees:
Article 1: Purchase of medication for the treatment of gunshot wounds must be authorized by the prefecture.
Article 2:
Health care institutions must keep the police informed of all wounded patients admitted for treatment.
From the prefecture of Algiers:
In recent days, dozens of attacks have taken place in the city.
The perpetrators are known to come from the Muslim quarters.
Each time, they quickly find refuge in these areas.
Consequently, to restore order, the prefect has decided to seal off the Arab quarters.
Checkpoints will be set up at all access points.
Civilians must show ID and may be subject to searches.
In line!
- Going back to the barracks?
- No, I've got two more days.
Don't touch me!
Keep your hands off me!
Never touch their women.
JULY 20, 1956 - 11:20 A.M.
What are you up to?
I'm meeting friends at the beach.
- You still there?
- This is my route.
Come here.
Beat it.
You go that way!
You, this way!
Same old story!
It's the government's fault.
What do they care?
Murder all the bastards!
Then we'll have some peace!
There he is!
I'm sure it's him!
- Where?
- Down there.
Get him!
Murderer! Murderer!
He looks like a dirty fellagha!
Where are you headed?
- Filthy Arab!
- Don't let him get away!
He's getting away! Stop him!
I saw him!
Stop him!
He's getting away!
Culprit: Laknan Abdullah.
Laborer, married, three children.
Address: 8 rue de Thèbes.
How many today?
- Seven attacks, three dead.
One copy for the prefect, the press, the archives and for you.
Thanks. Night, Corbière.
Good night, sir.
Say, Corbière... where's rue de Thèbes?
In the upper Casbah, I think.
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, children.
Fatma, why aren't they in bed?
They're just on their way.
We must get going.
What's your hurry?
You and your card games!
Can't you play here?
- One more for the road?
- Sure, one more.
Sorry, we're already late.
Good night everyone.
Hurry up.
Good-bye, Lucien.
Don't keep Henri up too late.
Get in back.
- Is it far?
- We're almost there.
- Can we go through?
- Too late.
Curfew's already started.
Let us through. He's with me.
Very well, sir. Go on through.
- No. 8, right?
- Yes. Make it snappy.
Murderers! Murderers!
Ali! Stop!
Jaffar says you must stop.
Listen to me, Ali.
Don't go down there.
The army will slaughter us.
Listen to me.
- Get out of here!
Halt!
Stay calm!
The FLN will avenge you!
The FLN will avenge you!
Stand guard on the roof.
You, come in.
- Is this all right?
- Fine.
Fine.
No good? Listen.
I'll take my son. It'll work.
Okay, but use the rue du Divan checkpoint. It's easier there.
Then meet up with the others.
Air France, rue Mauritania.
The café, rue Michelet.
The milk bar, rue d'lsly.
The bomb timers are short.
They'll be set outside the Casbah.
Taleb is waiting for you at the fish market.
But then you must hurry.
You only have 30 minutes to place them.
Good luck.
God be with you.
Halt!
- Your papers.
- I forgot them.
- Over there. Move it!
- They're at home.
Let me go get them!
- Get back.
- I'm in a hurry.
I said wait!
Get back or no one goes through.
- Let me through.
- Wait there.
- It's not fair.
- I said wait.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.
May I go through, sir?
- Go ahead.
Excuse me.
It's all right.
Hands up.
Go on, madam.
Go on.
I'll only be an hour.
He's a good boy.
Thank you.
Going to the beach, miss?
- How'd you know?
- Oh, I just guessed.
Care for some company?
Not today. I'm meeting friends.
What a shame!
Maybe another time?
Who knows?
Good luck.
A Coke, please.
Would you like to sit down?
One hundred francs.
Leaving, miss?
What a pity.
Attention, please.
Flight 432 to Paris will be delayed for 20 minutes.
Care for another martini?
What's going on?
A propane tank must've exploded.
The paratroopers are here!
JANUARY 10, 1957
Jean Charrot, Inspector General on special assignment, presided over a special meeting convened to organize the fight against rebel activity.
Major decisions were made concerning the maintenance of law and order and the protection of persons and private property.
General Carelle of the 10th Airborne Division will be in charge of maintaining order in Algiers.
He will command all civil and military forces and exercise special powers by official decree.
Mathieu, Philippe.
Born August 5, 1907, in Bordeaux.
Rank: Lieutenant colonel.
Campaigns: Italy and Normandy.
Member of an anti-Nazi resistance movement.
Expeditions: Madagascar and Suez.
Wars: Indochina and Algeria.
So we now average
4.2 attacks a day.
We must distinguish between attacks on individuals and bombings.
As usual, the problem involves:
First, the adversary, and second, the means to destroy him.
There are 400,000 Arabs in Algiers.
Are they all our enemies?
We know they're not.
But a small minority holds sway by means of terror and violence.
We must deal with this minority in order to isolate and destroy it.
It's a dangerous enemy that works in the open and underground, using tried-and-true revolutionary methods as well as original tactics.
It's a faceless enemy, unrecognizable, blending in with hundreds of others.
It is everywhere. In cafés, in the alleys of the Casbah, or in the very streets of the European quarter.
This footage was taken by the police with cameras hidden around Casbah checkpoints.
The police thought it might come in handy, and indeed it does, to show the futility of certain methods, or at least their drawbacks.
I deliberately chose footage taken shortly before a number of recent terrorist attacks.
Among all these Arab men and women are the perpetrators.
But who are they?
How can we recognize them?
ID checks are ludicrous.
If anyone's papers are in order, it's the terrorist's.
Note the cameraman's hunch.
He's sure there's something in that box.
And his film provides us with the details.
There might have been a false bottom with a bomb inside.
We'll never know.
That's enough, Martin.
We have to start from scratch.
The only information we have concerns the organization's structure.
Let's start from there.
It's a pyramid organization made up of a series of sections.
These sections, in turn, are made up of triangles.
At the apex is the Executive Bureau.
The military head of the Executive Bureau finds a competent person and names him section head: No. 1.
No. 1 finds two others:
Nos. 2 and 3.
This makes up the first triangle.
Now Nos. 2 and 3 each select two men:
Nos. 4,
5, 6 and 7.
The reason for these geometrics is that each organization member knows only three other members:
The one who chose him and the two he himself chose.
Contact is made only in writing.
That's why we don't know our adversaries.
Because, in point of fact, they don't know each other.
To know them is to eliminate them.
Consequently, the purely military aspect of the problem is secondary.
More important is the policing aspect.
I know you dislike that word.
But it's the only one that describes the work at hand.
We must investigate to reconstruct the pyramid and identify the Executive Bureau.
The basis of our job is intelligence.
The method: Interrogation.
Conducted in such a way as to ensure we always get an answer.
In our situation, humane considerations can only lead to despair and confusion.
I'm sure all units will understand and act accordingly.
Unfortunately, success doesn't depend only on us.
The city must be at our disposal.
We must comb it thoroughly and question all inhabitants.
But that's where we run into the maze of laws still in force, as if Algiers were a holiday resort and not a battlefield.
We've requested a free hand, but it's hard to obtain.
So we need an occasion that will justify our intervention and make it possible.
We ourselves must create this occasion.
Unless our adversary provides us with one, as it seems to be doing now.
To all militants:
After two years of bitter struggle in the cities and in the mountains, the Algerian people have won a great victory.
On Monday, January 28, the United Nations will open debate on the Algerian question.
Our entire organization will mobilize to explain this event's importance.
Beginning Monday, the FLN is calling a week-long general strike.
During this period, all armed action will be suspended.
Le Monde! Week-long strike!
The money, please.
We did it!
People of Algeria, colonial powers, failing to block
UN debate on the Algerian question, will attempt to demonstrate that the FLN represents only a minority.
World opinion is with us.
Let us show our unity.
Support the strike proclaimed by the FLN.
During this entire week, stay away from European quarters.
Do not leave the Casbah.
Avoid gathering in closed places, as this will facilitate raids.
Give shelter to the poor and homeless.
Stock up on food and water for a week.
- They seem calm.
- But you can feel something's up.
Like rabbits in a cage.
Just as I hoped.
Think they'll obey the order to strike?
I think so.
- Is it going the way you wanted?
- I hope so.
What are you calling the operation?
Well, General...
DRINK CHAMPAGNE
- "Operation Champagne."
- Why not?
Operation Champagne it is.
The homeless, the unemployed, the beggars.
We've arranged for them to stay with families during the strike.
That way they'll be safe from police raids.
But I don't think they should have been brought here.
It's a mistake.
- Why?
You're here. We'd better move you somewhere else.
- Don't you trust them?
- I do, but you never know.
All right. You're in charge.
If I were in charge, you wouldn't be in Algiers now.
- Duty first?
- Caution is best.
Ali, take Ben M'Hidi to the Maison des Arbres.
Isn't he staying here?
No. Go with him.
I'll wait for you to come back.
What do you think?
How's this for a hideout?
Looks like a wall.
Take a look inside.
Not now. It's late.
Si Ben M'Hidi,
I'll be in touch tomorrow.
Ali, go first.
Cut through the mosque.
The coast is clear.
We can't do anything for a week.
What do you think of the strike?
I think it'll succeed.
I think so, too.
It's been well organized.
What will the French do?
Obviously, they'll try everything to break it.
They'll do more than that, because we've given them an opportunity.
You know what I mean?
Now they'll no longer be groping in the dark.
Every striker will be a recognizable enemy.
A certified criminal.
The French will take the offensive.
Understand what I mean?
- Yes.
Jaffar says you weren't in favor of the strike.
- No, I wasn't.
- Why not?
Because we were ordered not to use arms.
Acts of violence don't win wars.
Neither wars nor revolutions.
Terrorism is useful as a start.
But then, the people themselves must act.
That's the rationale behind this strike.
To mobilize all Algerians, to assess our strength.
To prove it to the UN?
Yes, to prove it to the UN.
It may not do any good, but at least the UN will be able to gauge our strength.
You know, Ali, it's hard enough to start a revolution, even harder to sustain it, and hardest of all to win it.
But it's only afterwards, once we've won, that the real difficulties begin.
In short, there's still much to do.
You're not tired, Ali?
No.
Wake up!
Everybody out!
You bastards!
We'll teach you to strike!
Attention all vehicles!
Load the requisitioned workers!
Truck No. 1 to El Biar.
No. 2, the gasworks.
No. 3, the docks.
Attention!
Dispatch all suspects to headquarters.
That one.
You, come here. Stop.
On strike, are you?
- I'm sick.
You're too scared to admit it.
Admit you're with the FLN.
You're one of them.
Take me for an idiot?
Think I can't tell?
The FLN wants you to strike and you won't talk? You dirty Arab!
Suit yourself.
Gérard, take him away.
- Come with me.
- Are you deaf?
Everyone back to work!
Get a move on!
Day four:
The general strike continues.
All activity has come to a halt.
No serious incident has been reported.
All is quiet in the Muslim quarter.
I'll call you back.
Mathieu's here.
- Some questions...
- I'm meeting with the prefect.
- What's going on?
- I'm just assessing the situation.
Go and see for yourselves.
You're free to move around.
- The strike seems successful.
- It missed its main target.
Insurrection?
That isn't the aim.
- You believe the FLN?
It's plausible this time.
A strike might convince the UN.
The UN is far away.
How can it gauge a strike's magnitude?
Bombs would be more practical.
That would be my choice.
What would armed insurrection mean now?
What it always means: An inevitable phase in revolutionary warfare.
After terrorism comes armed insurrection.
Just as guerrilla warfare leads to warfare proper.
Dien Bien Phu?
Exactly.
But in Indochina they won.
- And here?
- That depends on you.
On us?
You intend to sign us up?
God forbid! Just do your reporting and do it well.
It's not warriors we need.
- Then what?
Political will, which is sometimes there and sometimes isn't.
Sometimes it's not enough.
What did Paris say yesterday?
Nothing. Another article by Sartre.
Why are the Sartres always born on the other side?
Then you like Sartre?
No, but I like him even less as a foe.
Come with me.
Move it.
- What's that?
- The dance hall.
Let's get it over with.
Repeat what you said and you can go.
Name?
- Smain.
- First name?
- Ahmed.
- Section?
- Second section.
- Be more precise.
- Second section.
Casbah, Algiers West.
- Which group?
- Third group.
- What was your role?
- Head of the sixth cell.
That'll do.
DAY SIX OF THE STRIKE
People of the Casbah, the FLN wants to stop you from working.
The FLN is forcing you to close your shops.
The FLN wants to starve you and condemn you to poverty.
The FLN wants to stop you from working.
People of the Casbah,
France is your motherland.
Mohammed! Mohammed!
Have you seen him?
The FLN wants to starve you and condemn you to poverty.
People of the Casbah, resist the FLN's orders.
Thank God you're home.
God bless you, my children.
Have you seen my brother Said?
Algerians! Brothers! Take heart!
The FLN tells you not to be afraid!
Don't worry, we're winning.
The FLN is on your side.
Long live Algeria!
FEBRUARY 5, 1957
FINAL DAY OF THE STRIKE
Open the shop.
Go on!
Faster!
The UN General Assembly, all motions having failed to obtain a majority, has passed a resolution ruling out any direct intervention in Algeria.
The UN, however, hopes that in a spirit of cooperation, a peaceful, democratic and fair solution will be found in keeping with the principles of the UN charter.
Good. Well done.
Now we can go turn in.
The end of the strike changes nothing.
Instructions remain the same.
Give your boys the usual orders.
We must occupy the Casbah
24 hours a day.
We must continue our work here, without respite.
Any of you ever suffer from tapeworm?
It's a worm that can grow infinitely.
You can destroy its thousands of segments but as long as the head remains, it rebuilds and proliferates.
The FLN is similarly organized.
The head is the Executive Bureau.
Several persons.
As long as they're not eliminated, we're back to zero.
Here are four of them.
I found these in the police records.
I had the snapshots blown up.
Si Murad.
Ramel.
Jaffar.
Ali La Pointe.
Print up a thousand copies and distribute them to our men.
Who else lives here?
I told you. My daughter upstairs, and my husband, who's at work.
Okay, Pierre. Let's go.
They're gone.
There were ten this time.
- Paratroopers?
- Yes.
Did a traitor bring them here?
They came alone.
They asked questions.
They didn't hurt anyone.
Jibela Malika has been arrested.
Sheik Abdullah has been arrested...
People of the Casbah, the FLN has lost the battle.
Stand up to its dying authority.
Work with us to build a new Algeria.
Mujid Ben Ali has been arrested.
- What's wrong?
- They arrested him.
Take courage.
We'll split up.
We must change our hideouts.
We must reestablish our contacts.
We must replace those arrested and killed and reorganize our groups.
We have to make our presence felt.
That'll come later.
No. Right now.
Leave it to me.
No. None of us will do anything.
We have to resist as much as we can, without giving the enemy a chance to catch us. Agreed?
We have to do something.
That's why we must reestablish our contacts first.
- How do we move?
- I'll take care of that.
I'll be out in three months.
Hey, look!
Quick, hide us!
We're being followed.
Where? On the terrace?
Come in, brothers.
God protect you.
Hide in the well.
God be with you.
They're gone. Wait until I call.
Then you can come up.
Thank you.
The first section's dead.
There's no one left.
We lost contact with the second.
The third is reorganizing.
All that's left is the fourth.
It's enough to start over with.
FEBRUARY 25, 1957
Bastard!
You'll pay for the others!
Keep calm! Get back!
MARCH 4, 1957
No more photographs.
Mr. Ben M'Hidi, isn't it cowardly to use your women's baskets to carry bombs, which have taken so many innocent lives?
Isn't it even more cowardly to attack defenseless villages with napalm bombs that kill many thousands of times more?
Obviously, planes would make things easier for us.
Give us your bombers, sir, and you can have our baskets.
The FLN has more of a chance of defeating the French army than the French have of changing the course of history.
According to a declaration by Colonel Mathieu, you were arrested by chance.
Practically by mistake.
The paratroopers were looking for someone less important than you.
Can you tell us why you were in that apartment on rue Debussy?
All I can say is
I wish I'd never set foot there.
That'll be all.
It's late and we have work to do.
So the show's over?
Yes, it's over.
Before it has the opposite effect.
People of the Casbah, the rebellion is dying out.
Ali Mohammed, head of
FLN Section 2, was killed this morning.
People of Algiers, turn in the agitators.
Disassociate yourselves from the rebel organization.
The army is protecting you.
Trust in it.
Colonel Mathieu, the spokesman for the Resident Minister, Mr. Gorlin, states that Larbi Ben M'Hidi hanged himself in his cell using strips of his shirt that he made into a rope and tied to the bars of his window.
Given his stated intention to escape at the first opportunity, it was thought necessary to keep the prisoner bound hand and foot at all times.
In your opinion, Colonel, in such a condition, can a man tear his shirt up, make a rope out of it, and hang himself from a window?
Ask the spokesman about that.
I didn't make such a statement.
For my part, I had the chance to appreciate the moral fiber, courage and commitment of Ben M'Hidi to his own ideals.
And so, notwithstanding the great danger he represented,
I pay tribute to his memory.
There's been a lot of talk, not only of the paratroopers' success, but also of the methods they're said to use.
Can you comment on this?
Their success is the result of these methods.
One depends on the other.
Excuse me, Colonel.
It seems to be that, perhaps out of an excess of caution, my colleagues keep asking you indirect questions to which you can only reply in a roundabout way.
It would be better to call... a spade a spade.
So let's talk about torture.
I understand.
And you? Have you no question?
They've all been asked.
I'd just like more precise answers.
Let's try to be precise.
The word "torture" isn't used in our orders.
We use interrogation as the only valid police method against clandestine activity.
The FLN asks all its members, in case of capture, to remain silent for 24 hours.
Then they may talk.
This gives the FLN time to render any information useless.
And us? What form of questioning must we adopt?
Civil law procedures, which take months for a mere misdemeanor?
Legality can be inconvenient.
Is it legal to set off bombs in public places?
Remember Ben M'Hidi's answer when you asked him the question.
No, gentlemen, believe me.
It's a vicious circle.
We could talk for hours to no avail, because that isn't the problem.
The problem is this:
The FLN wants to throw us out of Algeria, and we want to stay.
Even with slight shades of opinion, you all agree that we must stay.
When the FLN rebellion began, there were no shades at all.
Every paper, the communist press included, wanted it crushed.
We're here for that reason alone.
We're neither madmen nor sadists.
Those who call us fascists forget the role many of us played in the Resistance.
Those who call us Nazis don't know that some of us survived
Dachau and Buchenwald.
We are soldiers.
Our duty is to win.
Therefore, to be precise, it's my turn to ask a question.
Should France stay in Algeria?
If your answer is still yes, then you must accept all the consequences.
A doctor!
He's been stabbed!
I'm out of ammo!
Look there!
Run them down!
AUGUST 26, 1957
Make way for the colonel.
There's no point playing the hero.
Hand me the megaphone.
Ramel. Si Murad.
Listen:
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes when you're captured.
You know we'll get you.
Surrender and you won't be harmed.
You'll get a fair trial.
Do you hear?
- Who's speaking?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We don't trust you.
Come closer.
Let us see you.
Why don't you trust me?
Stand up so that we can see you.
Keep your hands still and in sight.
But we want the promise of a fair trial in writing.
Give us a written promise.
Then we'll surrender.
How do I get it to you?
We'll lower our guns in a basket.
Fair enough.
I'm make this statement in writing.
Finished?
Yes, finished.
- Ready, Mathieu?
- Yes, but let's see you first.
We can see them now.
Go ahead.
Here.
You know that when I give my word,
I keep it.
The bastard! He got away!
Faster, dirty Arab!
Take this, you dog!
Burn all the papers.
SEPTEMBER 24, 1957
Don't leave a trace.
Which of you is Zakia?
You?
Go tell Jaffar to surrender or we'll blow up the house and everyone in it.
Try to convince him if you want to keep your house.
Got that?
Wait. You'll get yourself killed.
Jaffar!
Zakia's coming up.
I wouldn't shoot if I were you.
Go on now.
Jaffar.
Listen to me.
They say if you don't come down, they'll blow up the house.
You can tell them to blow up whatever they want.
Go tell them!
He says he won't surrender, that you can blow it all up.
All right. Join the others.
Prepare the explosives.
Get as close as possible, but don't take risks.
Use a long fuse, then cut it.
Give them cover while they work.
You, keep your eyes open.
Anything can happen, as we know.
It's really pointless to die like this.
Mathieu! If you give me your word not to hurt anyone in this house, we'll come down.
I'd have hated to blow you all up.
Why?
Your picture and your file have been on my desk for months.
I have the feeling I know you a bit.
You don't strike me as the kind for empty gestures.
You seem satisfied to have me alive.
Yes, I am.
I thought you'd regret it.
I gave you an unexpected advantage.
No, only the satisfaction of having had the right hunch.
Technically speaking, we can't talk about advantages.
The game's over.
Monster! Hypocrite! You're wrong.
Ali La Pointe is still in the Casbah.
What's she saying?
She says Ali La Pointe is still free.
- Come in.
- I'm coming.
You're tired. Go rest.
Omar, go to bed.
We have a job tomorrow.
Myself, Mahmud, Hassiba... and you.
There's no one else left.
Sadek will drive.
You get out, plant the bomb, and come back fast.
Be sure they don't follow you.
Then we'll get out.
Hassiba first, then Mahmud.
I'll see to the rest.
Wake up.
Sleep well?
Get ready to go.
- Is it time?
- Almost.
Hassiba!
- I'm ready.
I heard a truck.
So did I. But if it was Sadek, he'd be here by now.
- How's your wife?
- She's fine.
Inside!
Outside!
On your feet!
Well?
All ready.
I had the house evacuated.
- Has he answered?
- Absolute silence.
I thought as much.
Ali La Pointe!
At least let the others out, or you'll all be blown up.
The boy will just go to the reformatory for a while.
Why let him die?
He's still here?
Take him away.
Ali... Ali La Pointe!
You have another 30 seconds.
What are you hoping for?
Anyway, you've lost.
Think hard. Thirty seconds.
Thirty seconds from now.
Whoever wants to can go.
- What'll you do?
- I don't trust them.
You four stay here.
Come down when I give the signal.
- Everything ready?
- All ready, sir.
Stand back.
You two cover him and be careful.
You never know.
The tapeworm's headless now.
Satisfied, Mathieu?
- Yes, sir.
- The FLN is decapitated in Algiers.
- We'll hear no more of it.
At least for the time being.
- Forever, let's hope.
They're basically decent people.
We got on fine for 130 years.
Why shouldn't it continue?
- But Algiers isn't all of Algeria.
No, Algiers isn't all Algeria.
True, but for now let's settle for Algiers.
Things are much easier in the mountains.
Good-bye, sir.
Good-bye, Mathieu.
I'll see you this afternoon.
Yes, sir.
DECEMBER 11, 1960
For some unknown reason, due to some obscure motive, after two years of relative quiet, with the war contained mostly in the mountains, disturbances broke out again without warning, and nobody knows why or how.
I phoned Tunis.
I spoke to an exiled FLN chief, but he knows nothing either.
Long live Algeria!
This morning, for the first time, out came flags with crescent and star.
Thousands of flags, probably made overnight.
"Flags" is hardly the word.
More like torn sheets, shirts, rags - but flags nevertheless.
We're marching for freedom!
The situation is more tense today.
Despite pressure from the most rigid colonialists, the government had given orders not to open fire except as a last resort.
Attempts were made this afternoon to descend into the European quarter.
There were several casualties, but things seem to have calmed down.
The Muslim quarters still echo with those unintelligible and frightening rhythmic cries.
The surprising unity of these demonstrations has made a deep impression on French public opinion.
According to Paris, a significant segment of the political class is in favor of seeking a new relationship with Algeria.
DECEMBER 21, 1960
LAST DAY OF DEMONSTRATIONS
Listen to me!
Return to your homes!
What do you want?
Independence!
Our pride!
We want our freedom!
Two more years of struggle still lay ahead.
Then, on July 2, 1962, with its independence, the Algerian nation was born.
Based on a True Story by
SAADI YACEF
My name is Karl Glocken, and this is a ship of fools. l'm a fool. And you'll meet more fools as we go along.
This tub is packed with them.
Emancipated ladies. Ball players.
Lovers. Dog lovers.
Ladies of joy. Tolerant Jews.
Dwarfs. All kinds.
And who knows, if you look closely enough..
..you may even find yourself on board.
Good morning, doctor.
Good morning. l'm glad to get out of Veracruz.
The whole damn country is ready to explode.
Well, did you get a look at them?
Anything interesting?
Anything interesting at all?
There's a dwarf, that high.
A couple of young American painters.
And a Jewish salesman with an infectious sense of humor.
Women, Willie. Women.
Well, a rather attractive middle-aged American woman.
But l'm afraid she's too far from the cradle for you.
Those are the kind that can sometime appreciate what they are getting.
There's a Spanish dancing troupe, interesting, but maybe professional.
They've had those Spanish dance troupes on board before.
And the usual assortment of our countrywomen.
Professors' wives? Saleswomen putting on airs?
- l'm afraid so. - Governesses?
- Maybe you shouldn't.
- That's all right.
You're really getting off at Bremerhaven, huh? lt wasn't a very long career.
Three voyages.
Long enough. l don't know what the hell l'm going to do without you.
You'll manage.
You want to know the sentimental, disgusting truth? l've become fonder of you than of most people in my life.
We just got used to each other, that's all.
Who am l to play chess with?
Who am l to talk to?
You've seen the kind of characters we get on this ship. l get a cold shudder every time l have to go to the captain's table. l must be in my dotage.
After my.. l was looking for something. l thought l could learn something new by being a ship's doctor.
But l've seen all this before. l've seen all these people before.
Never on a ship, that's all.
Come in.
- Lunch is served, captain.
- Thank you.
Please?
- What should l tell them this time? - Tell them anything you like.
Tell them l had to fix the toilets.
1933 will be a good year. l am optimistic.
At any rate, it is starting out most auspiciously.
Ah it is good to be on a German boat with German people, going home.
Say what you will, there is a feeling when German people get together. l cannot explain it. 'Gemutliche
Kameraderie..'
..which exists among no other people.
At least l have found it nowhere else.
You know what they say in Mexico?
Mexicans loathe the Americans, hate the Spaniards..
..distrust the English, admire the French and love the Germans.
That is all very nice. l am glad that they say those things.
But as far as l am concerned, after a few weeks in Mexico..
..you can keep the Mexicans too.
How long has it been since you have been home, Herr Freytag?
- Four months. - You must be glad to be going home too.
Yes, my wife is there.
Why is it that every charming man l meet is married?
Fraulein Spockenkieker, you have wounded to me the quick.
Excepting you, Herr Rieber. l'm sorry.
That little dog is so sweet.
He has shared so much of the professor's life and mine..
..l feel sometimes he is like our son.
Do you think it's correct to bring a dog to the table?
Bebe goes with us everywhere.
We have taken him to some of the best restaurants.
Nobody seems to mind.
You know, it's gonna be a wonderful trip, David. l still feel funny about you picking up the tab.
Look, we weren't gonna talk about that.
Did l ever tell you these have been the best three months of my life?
Did l ever tell you that l care for you so much it's very upsetting?
What? What's the matter?
Twenty-six days in separate beds. lt's probably a very good thing.
We'll get to know each other.
We'll find out whether we have anything going for us besides sex. l give you one more time to hang yourself. l know you got more money from the Swede.
- l gave you what l got. - The barman told me different.
He is a liar. lf you're holding out on me, l swear l'll rip your lying tongue out.
Rip my guts out. l don't have any more money. l asked for a table alone. l'm sorry, madame, there is no room for a table alone.
Please don't bother getting up.
You're an American?
- And my name's Bill Tenny.
- Mary Treadwell.
Yes, madam? l'll have the pate and the
Rheinischer Sauerbraten.
- You, sir? - You got a steak?
- Yes, sir. - Thick?
We will do our best. l'd better stick to the simple stuff.
You know l was in Veracruz trying..
..to teach them greasers how to play the ball.
Man, they tried to poison me.
You know, l had the runs for three weeks.
How interesting. l'd like to hear more about it.
Herr Rieber, l hear that you publish a national magazine..
..with certain intellectual features.
A garment trade magazine, but modern. Modern.
Good afternoon. l'm Willie
Schumann, the ship's doctor.
The captain sends his regrets.
He's unable to come to lunch, because of ship's business.
Doctor, l am Siegfried Rieber.
This is Professor Hutten,
Frau Hutten.
- Please. - No, no allow me.
And their dog, Bebe.
This charming young lady is
Fraulein Spockenkieker.
Herr Freytag, Frau Schmitt, Herr
Graf and his nephew Johann.
Please don't let me interrupt your conversations.
We were just discussing
Herr Rieber's magazine.
Yes l have invited talented writers from all over the nation..
..to contribute on one topic:
How we can expunge foreign influences..
..and restore Germany to its national greatness.
What foreign influences? lf you need any attendance, l'll be at your disposal.
Thank you.
On my part, doctor, you need have no concern for me. l do not believe in
'materia medica.'
Really?
Have you found something better to replace it?
- Faith. - Faith. l see. Very well.
A toast. A toast to the German woman, the most beautiful in the world.
- Delicious. - Herr Rieber.
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.
- Karl Glocken. - Julius Lowenthal.
The herring is very good. l'll have that and a couple of hard-boiled eggs. l beg your pardon.
You aren't Jewish, are you?
No. l have my own minority group.
They usually give a Jew a table of his own on a boat like this.
Why do you think they put us together? lt's their way of being friendly.
Perhaps they thought we might hit it off.
You are sure you are not Jewish?
Reasonably sure.
You resemble a brother-in-law of mine in Stuttgart.
That's the way it is.
People are always mistaking me for someone else.
- Spot of wine? - Just a touch.
My God. Where are we going to put them?
We'll have to manage.
Professor, what is it?
What's happening? Who are all those people?
There's nothing to be concerned about Frau Schmitt.
- l have spoken to one of the officials. - But what is it? lt has to do with the price of sugar on the world market.
- Sugar? - Yeah. You see..
..the sugar planters have been unable to get their price..
..so they burned their crops..
..in the fields rather than let the prices go down.
Something had to be done about the Spanish laborers..
..so the Cuban government hit upon a humanitarian plan of action.
They're sending them home.
- How do you feel? - 'Bien.'
Good. l come to see you later, yes?
Please put her there in the corner.
- Where can they wash?
-There are two spigots.
- What?! - lt is not my fault.
Stop talking to me in this way.
You just don't put 600 people..
..on a deck like this with only two outlets to wash!
You don't know them.
They wouldn't wash if they could.
You don't know what pigs they are.
The deck has to be cleaned.
Bring the hoses out.
- The hoses? - Bring the hoses out, l said! l cannot turn hoses on them. lt's better to turn the hoses on them..
..than for them to live this way, no?
- Break out the hoses.
- Turn on those hoses. l take it you are not exactly pleased..
..that we are cabin mates on this voyage. l have already requested a change in the accommodations.
You may take it from me..
..that l'm not exactly overwhelmed with the prospect either.
However, pending changes..
..since we are captives of each other's company for 26 days..
..l think it is best if we reach an understanding.
Our cosmetics, for instance..
..l will keep mine on this side of the sink.
And you keep yours on that side. That's right?
Which bunk do you prefer?
The lower or the upper? l was assured the lower. lt is yours.
What are your habits? l, myself, rise very early in the morning. l take it that if this evening is an example, you are a late bird. lf you sleep late, l will see that l do not disturb you.
And l hope you, in turn, will try your best not to disturb me.
One other thing.
One other thing.
My wife has informed me in the most sarcastic terms possible..
..l snore.
Good night.
- You a painter, huh? - Yeah.
- What was you doing in Mexico?
- l was a timekeeper in a mine. l thought you said you was a painter. l am a painter, but l was a timekeeper in a mine.
- Why? - To support myself as a painter.
- What's the matter? Don't you make any money painting? - No.
Oh now, wait a minute.
Come on. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me you work at something you can't make a living off..
..so you gotta take a job to make enough money..
..to go on working at work you can't live on?
But that is the heroic life.
That is the way men who trust themselves can afford to live.
- A strange neck of the woods.
- What do you mean?
Strange neck of the woods.
Look, l run into all kinds of people, you know, but..
Did l tell you what happened to a guy in Veracruz..
..when l was coming through immigration?
Well l'm standing in line see.
So l see this clerk..
..and l holler, Hey, Pancho, get over here.
Just being friendly-like..
..like back home you call a taxi driver Mac
..or a Pullman porter George.
Well this little Negro..
You know these coast..
..Mexicans got mostly Negro blood in them, l'm told.
Well, he just looks up and stares at me.
The next thing l know, everybody's going ahead of me in this line.
Then l realize that this little Negro resented it.
- l think l'll turn in. - Me too.
Come in.
- Good evening. - Good evening. l'm the doctor. You wanted to see me?
Yes. l need something to help me sleep.
- Are you ill? - No, no. l just want something to help me sleep.
- Do you often have trouble sleeping? - Yes. Always.
- Does your doctor help you to sleep? - Yes. Occasionally.
Take off your robe.
- You're sure you're the ship's doctor? - Oh l am the ship's doctor.
Lean forward, please.
- What is it? - Your hands are cold. l'm sorry.
Breathe deeply.
When was your period?
- Look, is it necessary to..?
- Yes, it is necessary.
All right. Last week. l'm sure you'd never have any trouble sleeping.
No, never.
Tell me your secret.
A clear conscience, of course.
That's a neat trick, having a clear conscience..
..when you work as a doctor on a ship..
..which has 600 people living on an open deck.
You know, you just can't take pills every time you can't sleep..
..or anytime you want to be stimulated or sedated. lt has its effect.
What are you laughing at?
My house has been burned. They've taken everything l had.
Now l'm being taken to prison, to an island l know nothing about.
And you're giving me a
Sunday school sermon.
- You can put your robe back on now. - Thank you.
You've got a gentle touch.
Maybe you're not as stuffy as you pretend to be.
No. l hope not.
You gonna help me?
Your doctor may have helped you too often. l'm very helpless at this moment.
You can leave me without any help.
That's your prerogative.
This is for tonight only.
- How old are you? - l'm old enough, as you can see.
Much too old.
- Forty-five? - Not that old.
- How old are you? - Forty-two.
- How old are you? - Forty-one.
- You're joking. - Thank you.
Lie back, please.
You will feel it in a moment.
- Yes. - Talk.
- l beg your pardon? - Talk until the drug takes effect.
This boat smells of cabbage.
Why does every German boat smell of cabbage?
Keep talking.
What do you want me to talk about?
Anything you like. Just talk.
What's your name?
- Schumann. - No. Your first name.
Wilhelm.
Wilhelm.
Wilhelm. lt's perfect.
Perfect.
Stop that now!
- Have you made this trip before?
-Oh l make it at least twice a year.
- Are you in some sort of business?
- l'm in the jewelry business.
A special part. l sell religious trinkets.
Any religion. You name it, l got it. l sell neck chains, bracelets, anklets. lt sounds like good business. lt's a very good business.
People feel better when they wear these things. l feel good too.
With all this stuff on me, l feel like an African l met in Paris.
He bought from me a crucifix,
Buddha and mezuzah. All on one chain.
Do you know what he said?
He said, lt may not help, but it can't hurt.
You seem to get along very well with people.
Oh l like people. lf you look for it, you can find something good in anybody. lt must be difficult sometimes.
For instance, doesn't it bother you that you and that little man..
..are the only two Germans who aren't at the captain's table?
Do you think that bothers me?
Besides, l like that little man.
What kind of a salesman do you think l would be..
..if l couldn't deal with a situation like that?
A salesman is supposed to deal with..
..a difficult situation and overcome it.
Listen. lt's not a new story.
White men hate black men.
Moslems hate Buddhists.
That's the way it goes. There's prejudice everywhere. lt does no good to give it back.
You have got to use your noggin.
There now, you must not mind not winning against me.
After all, l was Ping-Pong champion of the Sportsverein in Frankfurt..
..three times over.
- Morning.
- Morning. - Morning.
Herr Freytag picks some bizarre company.
Ja, l suspect they are birds of a feather.
Well, shall we play again?
Or perhaps l might suggest another game.
- What game? - Any game.
One which you might win.
- What game do you mean?
- You have no idea? l will not let you talk that way to me.
- l'm sorry. - How dare you! l could not resist. l couldn't resist either.
What do your parents feel about you going to Europe?
My mother's thrilled. lt's something she's always wanted to do. l think my father gave me up for lost a long time ago.
- What do your parents do?
- My father owns a store. lt's a good store.
A furniture store.
My mother's never been satisfied with it.
She taught me that a woman had..
..to have something of her very own outside of her husband..
..otherwise, it was bridge games and one day a week at the hospital.
What about that young man you're traveling with?
David. David's an artist.
A wonderful one.
He's a bit caught up with social consciousness right now..
..but he'll get over that. ls it serious? l never felt about anybody the way l do about David. l think that David thinks a woman..
..should follow three paces behind with slippers.
Men usually do.
My husband certainly did. No, thank you. l have a whiskey sour.
- What did your husband do?
-He was in the diplomatic corps.
Oh.. we put up a wonderful front in public.
We were everybody's favorite couple. ln private, it was something else again.
He was jealous of me.
He was so jealous of me that he hit me.
He hit me till l bled at the nose. l was wondering whether
David would beat me.
We quarrel sometimes. lt seems to come out of nothing..
.. and then it grows into such ugliness and bitterness. lt surprises both of us. l guess a relationship between a man..
..and a woman is very difficult these days, isn't it?
Practically impossible.
Put on your beret, Carlos.
Now we can hang in The Prado.
We will hang somewhere, Carlos.
The place is uncertain.
- That's enough for today.
Thank you. - Anytime. l just can't tell you how much l admire you.
Why?
You create. l'm not even sure about that. l've never been given a penny for any of this.
Still, l envy you. l envy you your struggle. l envy you your doubts and floundering, even.
And Fraulein Brown. l envy you that too.
She's an attractive girl, isn't she?
Are you two going to be married? l am sorry. l don't mean to pry.
You know, the distasteful curiosity of the non participant.
That's all right. l don't honestly know whether we'll get married. l told you how uncertain my life is.
Look l need all the help l can get. l need someone who can believe in a man who hasn't proved himself yet.
Someone to be there. Be for me.
Couldn't Fraulein Brown be that?
Fraulein Brown is a modern woman.
Their needs are a lot more complicated than our mothers' were. l'm crazy about Jenny. l really am. l.. l've never felt this way about anybody, the way l feel about her. l guess l'm afraid to find out how apart we really might be. l see. l see, l suppose one of the saddest things in the world must be..
..to see two people who feel so much for each other..
..and who feel that they belong together..
..and yet they really don't belong together at all.
- Hello. - Hello.
What are you doing? l'm making one of these.
- How many of these do you have? - Many.
Here is a bull.
A dog.
Do you think anyone in first class would be interested to buy them? l would.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- How long have you been here?
- About a half an hour.
No, no, don't get up. Lie back.
Did you put this over me?
Of course. l'm glad to see you are on deck. lt was a wonderful drug you gave me, whatever it was.
What was it, incidentally?
You don't expect me to tell you, do you?
Oh you can actually laugh.
Did l startle you very much? lt's good to hear you laugh too.
Did you ever have all the worst possible..
..things that can happen to you happen?
Well, it gives you the most irresponsible feeling.
Nothing more can happen.
Hey!
Are you all right? lt takes a great deal of courage to tangle with those two. l have a certain security with them.
They are the only characters on the boat smaller than l am.
Such a charming lady makes a charming morning even more charming.
Thank you.
He's wonderful.
He certainly is.
The one thing about these children..
..they seem to have a better time than anyone on the boat. lf you expect me to speak a word in defense..
..of those two little monsters, you're much mistaken.
My prescription for them is to throw them overboard in a leaky lifeboat.
You didn't have a childhood at all?
Nothing like theirs.
At least, l hope not.
Well.. when l was 4, l persuaded my little brother to drink lye water.
- Lye water? - Yeah, l told him it was milk.
So he went to screaming about the house. His mouth was scrubbed out. l was beaten black-and-blue. l meant him no harm. l was only curious to know whether it would kill him.
And what about your childhood?
Did nothing gay ever happen to you at all?
No. l was the perfect dupe. l believed anything anybody ever told me. l was full of the highest hopes and the most unbelievable innocence.
However it's true, at the age of 12
..l did have an experience with the housekeeper..
..that left an indelible impression on me..
..shocked my mother no end and cost the poor girl her job.
Well, there is hope for you after all.
Oh.. the toreros are having a fiesta tonight.
- l know. - Are you coming? l wasn't planning to. l thought we might have a dance if you did.
Of course, you probably don't dance.
- Exactly how dull do you think l am? - You are dull.
You're dull..
..stolid..
..unimaginative..
..helpless..
..and charming.
Yes, charming.
Oh you're blushing.
That's the most charming thing l've ever seen in my whole life. l've never seen a man blush before. l'm not blushing. l must have a temperature.
Well anyway, l'll wear my.. my only dress..
..and l'll give you the choice of any dance you like.
And l have a feeling it's gonna be a slow waltz. l happen to excel in the flamenco. l was an intellectual. l was a philosopher and teacher of philosophy.
Until three years ago, l learned l was going to die.
Then my wisdom dropped from me like soiled rags. l was naked as the day l was born. l heard a voice.
The most loving voice l've ever heard. The voice of God!
And God said to me..
God speaks to him. He speaks to him personally.
Be quiet, Gregorio! You have to spit on everything. l asked myself, why was l afraid?
What are my personal sufferings..
..but a divine grace that can be made useful to others?
- The miracle is.. - Miracle?
What miracle? Can you make us a miracle?
Can you get us out of this slop and..
..into the upper decks, where we a man can breathe?
- That is a miracle.
-You blasphemous pig!
You are the pig. We are all pigs.
Look at the way we live!
Listen! Listen to me!
- God's mercy is in.. - God?
There is no God down here!
Do you know what l would do if God were here? l would curse him to his face.
- Yeah! l would spit in his face!
- Yeah! l would send him down into his own hell! - Yeah!
- Get him out of here! - Yeah!
Wait! Wait! You can't!
The hoses. And give them more than a bath this time.
Yes, sir. The hoses!
- A toast to 'el capitan.'
- A toast to 'el capitan'!
'El Capitan', with the hope that this beautiful occasion..
..may serve to bring those two great countries..
..Spain and Germany, closer together.
The Spanish heritage, the German empire in all its glory.
- 'El Capitan', - 'El Capitan',
Good God.
Looking for someone?
What do you mean?
Dr. Schumann is a very charming man, isn't he?
He's in steerage.
People say there are only three reasons..
..why a man would be a ship's doctor:
He wants to travel. Or his health is not good.
Or he's escaping from the law.
Which is it with Dr. Schumann?
Dr. Schumann has a quite serious case of heart trouble.
Will you excuse me?
- What is your name?
- My name is Johann.
Why were you staring at me, Johann?
- How is your father?
- He's my uncle.
He's sleeping in the cabin.
The doctor gave him something to quiet him down.
- Dance with me. - l don't dance. l will show you.
Do you feel that?
Only Spanish women move like that. lt is called the 'meneo.'
Feel? l am not a gypsy, you know. l am real Spanish, and this is the sign.
- You're doing it on purpose.
- Oh, no. l was born this way.
Do you hear what they say?
My hip bones.
They say, 'Meneo..'
.. 'meneo'..
..all by themselves.
- Will you buy me a bottle of champagne? - l can't.
Just a small bottle. l don't have anything.
Not a pfennig.
Excuse me.
- Shall we sit down?
- Oh, yes. Of course.
Here we are.
- You're doing your job very well. - My job? lsn't it the duty of the ship's personnel..
..to see that unescorted women don't get too unhappy?
- l am here because l want to be.
-Now you really are doing very well.
Don't you believe me?
Does it matter whether l do or not?
Well perhaps you would prefer to remain alone.
Oh, no. No. Please stay and have a drink with me. lt's my birthday. ls it really your birthday?
Forty-six. Me, 46. l can't believe it, 46.
Well we Europeans are not as conscious of age as you are.
Besides, when one looks as you do and arouses in people..
..the feeling you do, does it really matter?
You're very kind.
There's a time when hearts grow cold and hard.
Women lose their grace and become shrill.
They run to fat or turn to beanpoles.
Take to secret drinking.
They marry men too young for them and get just what they deserve. lt's enough to scare anyone..
..waiting for fear and loneliness to do their work.
Mrs. Treadwell, you are a very exciting woman, and you know it.
Tell me.
Wouldn't it unnerve you to have an affair with me?
Good evening. Are you enjoying yourselves? You're not dancing.
Captain, do you have a second?
- Yes.
There's a man in steerage. One of your men took his carving knife away.
He needs his knife for his work.
This is the kind of thing he does.
Very nice. Very nice indeed.
The man's an artist. He's not gonna do anybody any harm.
- You are absolutely certain of that? - l'm certain.
Unfortunately, l have to be answerable not only for your safety..
..but for the safety of the ship.
Captain, the man is an artist. He needs his knife for his work. l'm sorry.
Enjoy the party. l feel sorry for him.
You feel sorry for him?
He's a nice man. He doesn't like doing this.
But he's doing it. That's the point, isn't it?
David, you're gonna hate me for this..
..but l'm glad those people in steerage don't have knives.
What's the matter? Afraid they'll come up over the sides and murder us..
..in our nice, clean, white beds?
Maybe they should.
You're so unattractive when you get like this.
So violent and myopic. lt's exactly the kind of thing that infects your work.
What about my work? l told you no one would dance with me.
Elsa, dance with your father.
- Mama, please. - Dance with your father.
Elsa.
When you go to a dance, you first dance with your escort.
Now, l am your escort, so you will first dance with me.
Then, when you're seen dancing, someone else will invite you.
Besides, you haven't danced with your papa since your last birthday.
Papa, please. l don't want to dance. l'm sorry. l didn't know anyone was here.
Don't be ashamed. What's the matter?
Come here. Sit down.
Sit down. Come here. Come here.
Tears are good. You know what they say in Turkey?
They say tears wash the eyes and one can see better.
At least l think they say it in Turkey.
Turkey.
Now tell us, what is the reason for this great emotional outburst?
Why isn't a charming young lady like you inside..
..enjoying the music and dancing?
Because no one wants to dance with me. And l'm not charming.
You are telling me you are not charming?
An expert who has been to lstanbul,
Hamburg and Paris?
You are telling me?
And l am telling you that anybody with eyes in his head..
..can see that you are charming.
Ask anybody with any intelligence.
Ask Glocken. ls this young lady charming or isn't she?
- Charming. - There. l told you.
And how old are you?
Sixteen.
Adolescence.
What is adolescence?
Adolescence is a time when people worry about things..
..there's no need to worry about.
Sixteen. l promise you, at 1 7, you will be even more charming than you are now.
At 21 , you will be gorgeous.
And at 25, devastating.
And l won't stand any arguments.
'Tales from the Vienna Woods.'
David, 'Tales from the Vienna Woods.'
Dance with me.
You never like to dance. l think l've been happiest when l was dancing.
Sometimes l wish..
..that l'd tied a tape measure to my ankle when l danced all my life.
Then l could tell you how many miles l've traveled when l was happiest.
David, dance with me.
Well.. l'm gonna enjoy this party in spite of you, David..
..so if you'll excuse me..
..l'm gonna dance with the first man who asks me.
And here he comes.
- May l have this dance?
- Delighted.
Good evening.
Good evening. You seem in good spirits.
- l am. l delivered a baby tonight.
- How wonderful.
- What was it, a boy or a girl? - Boy.
- What about our celebration?
- What do you mean?
- Our dance. - You intimidated me. l really don't dance. l thought so. Well, this is a waltz, and even you can manage a waltz.
- l doubt it. - l don't.
Just follow me and then follow the music.
How do you feel? l can't seem to get over this cold.
But l guess l'll be better if l can get another night's sleep.
- You have to help me again.
- lt's not helping you.
Oh, Willie. Don't lecture me.
You'll lose count. l'm trying to tell you how serious it is.
Why are you trying to tell me?
Are you trying to tell me l'm an addict?
As a publisher, my aim is to direct the minds of the readers..
..to the vital issues of our society. l have lately got a doctor to begin a series of articles advocating..
..the extermination of all the unfit at birth.
That's the way it's with Herr
Rieber. He's thinking all the time.
All this will be accomplished painlessly, of course. Painlessly.
Not only defective or useless children, but the old too.
Old persons over 60 or 65, perhaps.
The same measures will be taken with Jews, of course..
..and any illegitimate mixtures of race.
White with colored of any kind,
Chinese, Negroes..
..and for any white man convicted of a serious crime..
..well, as for him..
There is only one problem with all this. Who will be left?
That is the difficulty. No one is ever willing to accept a new idea.
Shall we dance? l like to listen to Herr Rieber.
Every time l listen to him, l feel reassured. l know no one could ever take him or his party seriously.
Pardon me.
May l?
How do you feel?
Try a little longer. l promise to help you when the time comes. l want to sit down. lt's a nice party. Are you enjoying it?
Can l have a cigarette, please?
May l get you something?
Thank you.
Excuse me, please. l feel like l'm gonna die. l know.
- What the hell's the matter with you? - You are selfish, boorish.. l don't know why l can't get you out of my system.
You're not even really pretty.
- Thank you.
Your head is filled with such garbage! l wish l could just empty it out.
Take your hands off me! David, stop it. l'll call for the purser.
- Leave me alone. - Jenny, Jenny..
What? What do you want from me? What? l wish l knew.
Oh, Jenny. Jenny, what's the matter? l'm crying. That's what's the matter, l'm crying.
The sweetest face. The sweetest face in the world.
David. David, what's gonna happen to us?
You never were any good at that. lt has a zipper, remember?
What a wonderful sky. l'm sure you and your wife watch clouds together. l wish there was someone to watch clouds with me.
You're an extremely romantic woman,
Mrs. Treadwell, aren't you? lt's been the handicap of my life. l can't settle for things. Bernard
Shaw said it, didn't he? lf you can't get what you want..
..you better damn well settle for what you can get.
What did you want, Mrs. Treadwell?
A useful life.
Someone to love me. Forever.
Ridiculous of me, wasn't it?
And what happened? l chose the wrong man.
How many times have you heard that said, l wonder.
He was the most promising.
The most handsome.
He had the most glorious facade.
The facade was all there was.
He made me the best-known wife of the best-known skirt-chaser..
..in the community. l made life hell for him. lt ended in the divorce courts.
We met one day in the corridor outside the courtroom.
He struck me. l took every penny he had.
So you must forgive me if l'm not exactly receptive to the idea..
..of other people's happiness in marriage. l'm envious.
You and your wife probably have the closest thing..
..to a perfect life as one can get.
Nothing is perfect, Mrs. Treadwell. l just wanted to tell you that l would have bought the champagne. l would have bought it if l had the money.
Come in.
- How old are you? - Nineteen.
You're one year older than l am.
Can you give me something? l'm not asking for much, but l must have something.
Pepe would beat me within an inch of my life..
..if l don't give him something.
But aren't you a dancer?
You better go.
Good. More dollars.
Let's see, there was the student and the sailor..
- What about him? - He did not have anything.
- What was he doing here?
- He wanted to see me.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might just want to see me?
Did it ever occur to you that..
..l might want to be with someone my own age? l am a human being too Pepe, whether you think so or not.
Who told you? Who told you you were a human being? lf it were up to you, l would spend the whole voyage on my back. l'll tell you what you are.
What you are is something l picked up on the street..
..when you were 14 with dirty underpants.
Trying to stop men for a few 'centavitos'
..for you and your dirty family.
Lowenthal! You're snoring!
That's what my wife says.
Why are they doing this to you? l lived with a man who controlled the lives of 5000 people. l mean controlled. l didn't want to, but l became entangled with those people's lives. l came to know that every piece of food l ate..
..every piece of clothing l had..
..was coming out of their lives.
One day, l entered one of their houses. l'll never forget it.
The woman who lived there saw..
..the shock in my eyes at the way they lived.
And she said, Pardon me. l said, Pardon you for what?
So she said, Pardon me for my house, pardon me for the way it looks..
..pardon me for everything.
And then she said, But, of course, you must understand that..
..most of this place is a garbage dump..
..and l'm just a piece of garbage. l began by hiding agitators in the chapel of the house..
..and l ended by helping them get arms.
You don't say anything. l don't know what to say. l haven't met many people in my life..
..who have committed themselves to anything.
You never talk about yourself.
There's not very much to tell. l came from a Hamburg worker's family, l worked hard to become a doctor.
- l tried to be a man, l got this. - lt is formidable. lt's idiotic. Marked for life like cattle.
Are you married?
Children?
Two sons.
Are you happy?
Who is happy?
Why isn't she here with you now?
There was no reason in dragging her halfway across the world with me.
What about you? Are you married?
- Three times. - What happened?
Never found the right one.
Maybe l was waiting for someone like you..
..someone l could teach the waltz. l'm sure.
Just think. lsn't it wonderful?
Two strangers on a ship.
We will never meet again.
And we can talk.
We can talk like friends.
Or even lovers.
We can talk like two people who meet on the other side of the grave.
Keep talking.
Do you have any feeling for me?
No, of course not.
Of course not. lt's funny.
You know what l thought you might be? l thought you might be the innocent, romantic love..
..l should have had in my girlhood.
Of course, nobody ever loved me innocently.
And how l would have laughed at him if he had. l never could hit a curve ball on the outside corner. l beg your pardon? l never could hit a curve ball on the outside corner.
That's very interesting.
What does it mean?
You wouldn't know if l told you.
All right, l'll tell you.
You're at bat, see? At bat.
Bat! Bat!
Okay, now you're at bat. The pitcher, he's out there.
Now he's winding up, and he turns her loose and..
Just as it gets to you, it dips down and away.
And that is a curve ball on the outside corner. l could never hit that pitch with a paddle.
- l see. - No, you don't see.
You don't see at all.
You don't know what it's like to be out there..
..crowd's yelling for you to deliver.
And they start talking.
The pitchers, they talk.
He can't hit a curve ball on the outside corner.
And from then on out, that's all you see..
..is curve balls on the outside corner.
So you've had your big chance.
And you have muffed it. l can still hear my old man yelling at me from the stands..
..even though he wasn't there.
Big Will. You are a bum!
You are a bum, just like me. l think you're being a bit harsh on yourself, Herr Tenny.
A bum.
You know, l travel a lot.
My folks give me some money.
Not much, but some.
They are more comfortable when l'm not around.
You know what l find? l find the most amusing things about people..
..are their guilt's that they drum up for themselves.
For instance, l estimate that there must be at least..
..873 million people in the world who don't even know..
..what a curve ball on the outside corner is.
So l think it a bit excessive for you to think that you have..
..muffed your whole life just..
..because you couldn't hit it, paddle or no paddle.
Do you understand what l mean, Herr Tenny?
No.
You know what l think?
- No. - l think..
..that you are a sawed-off intellectual.
Bottoms up, shorty.
The purser, from whom l learn what little l know about this ship..
..has informed me that you were seen leaving La Condesa's cabin..
..at a highly unrespectable hour.
No comment, Willie? l think that's one of the reasons l like you.
You don't have my vulgarity. l wonder if it's really true that life is as stupid and meaningless..
..as it seems to be on this ship.
The Lutzes and their daughter, the
Huttens and their blessed dog.
And that gross little Rieber..
..who thinks of himself as the wave of the future. l suppose a great case could be made for my own foolishness.
Will your wife be there to meet you at Bremerhaven?
She's a wonderful woman.
We've been polite to each other for a good many years.
Well, your sons will be glad to see you.
We hardly know each other anymore.
What will you do, go back to your practice? l'm the kind of doctor l hate.
The hack general practitioner.
What would you have liked to have been?
- A good doctor. - Don't you think you are?
Fair to middling.
What do you think happens to a woman like La Condesa..
..when she's deported under such circumstances?
How long are you going to keep me a penniless beggar?
Do l have to ask you for change to go to the barber?
- Remember the agreement, Johann?
- The agreement.
You are to receive everything after my death.
Your mother was so pleased for you.
She was so pleased for your opportunity.
My mother was pleased for a chance for money for herself.
How can you keep me a penniless beggar? How can you do that?
Don't you have a heart at all? l have a heart. That's why l can do it.
What would you do with the money, Johann? l have seen you watch that gypsy dancer's buttocks..
..as she walks on the deck. l will not nourish your lust.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
- Good morning. l have been trying to persuade Mrs.
Treadwell to have some breakfast.
There's nothing like it, you know.
Especially the morning after.
At home, we always used to have it English-style:
Kidneys, sausages, kippers, things like that.
How elegant.
Well, l think l'll look in on the bar before dinner.
What a hard-trying race they are.
English-style for breakfast,
French-style for dinner.
And every now and again, a comfortable lapse back..
..to sauerbraten, sauerkraut and beer.
He seems very attentive; l'll say that for him.
Did you ever see such a collection of bores?
The attentive Lt. Huebner, the happily-married man Herr Freytag.
And here comes the ape.
Morning.
'Espece de type'!
How's the painting? l haven't been able to do much onboard, but..
..here's something l've been doodling with.
You can see l'm in love.
Of course. Everybody on this ship is in love.
Love me whether or not l love you.
Love me whether l am fit to love.
Love me whether l am able to love.
Even if there is no such thing as love.
Love me.
- Where've you been? - l've been talking to that Mrs. Treadwell.
You know, she's so bitter.
She frightens me sometimes.
Well, what do you think? lt's interesting. l think it's good.
Well, of course it's good.
You couldn't do anything that wouldn't be good.
- lt's wonderful. - But?
Does it have to be the same thing all the time?
Just what do you mean?
You know; the exploitation of the masses.
Well, it's true, isn't it?
Well, it's just that.. No matter how well these things are done..
..they always turn out to be posters after all, don't they?
You hate my work, don't you, Jenny? l think it's good.
- Here he comes. Now, watch.
- What is it? l told the steward. Just watch.
- lf you will come this way, sir.
- l'm going to have lunch.
Yes. Another table has been arranged for you.
- Arranged? Who arranged it?
- Right over here, sir.
Now he will see how we feel.
Dr. Schumann, they have placed
Herr Freytag at another table.
Herr Rieber, you are a real anti-Semite. l don't know any Jews. l don't know anything about them at all. l'm not an anti-Semite.
How can you say that? l'm very fond of the Arabs. l lived among them for a while and found them to be very good people.
You have not said a word, Dr.
Schumann.
What do you think about..?
- Excuse me.
Doctor has heart trouble.
Do you suppose we should send to inquire after him?
Schumann.
Schumann. ls that not a Jewish name?
My wife is Jewish. l told that American woman.
- She must have told them.
- Now come, have some wine. lt's Niersteiner Domtal.
Why be upset? The company is much better at this table..
..l can assure you.
When Glocken isn't smoking one of his foul-smelling cigars.
You know l don't mind not being seated at the captain's table.
Perhaps because l was never invited in the first place.
Those pious hypocrites.
- Why do you take it? - l have been taking it for a long time.
Oh, yes, he has. He has 2000 years of suffering behind him.
Well, l'm not going to take it.
A little patience. A little understanding.
The world's getting better all the time.
As my Aunt Rebecca used to say.. l don't give a damn what your
Aunt Rebecca used to say.
Do you think any of you are any better Germans than l am?
Do you?
Yes. Yes, l have a Jewish wife.
She's Jewish. Let me tell you about her.
She'd never hurt anyone in her life.
Anyone.
You.. You good, middling people.
You aren't fit to be in the same world as her. l saw some of you in the chapel this morning. You kneel there and pray.
You pretend that you are good people.
Good people?
You can't even exist without your prejudices.
And the worst thing about you is..
..that you don't even recognize what you are.
You..
Sometimes l think, in spite of how much you understand..
..it's enough already.
What's going on?
They moved Herr Freytag from the captain's table..
..because his wife is Jewish.
And it's my fault. l had to tell that dreadful Brunhilda to stop her from chattering on so.
So stupid of me. He's such a nice man. l'd no idea this was going to happen.
- You're not gonna cry, are you? - Of course not. l never cry.
What do they got against the Jews?
Back home, we don't have anything against the Jews.
Hell, l never even saw a Jew till l was 15.
Maybe you were too busy lynching
Negroes to take time out for the Jews.
Why don't you ring for the steward?
He might give you something. l have been ringing! Ringing!
Ringing! Ringing!
A fellow gave these pills to me in Tangiers.
He had a theory that seasickness has something to do with the eardrums.
You know, Lowenthal?
Yes?
You are really not such a bad fellow.
You think so?
These statements that l make, you mustn't take them personally.
No, of course not. lt is the march of history. History is beyond us, Lowenthal.
Feel better?
- A little. - Good.
You know, the thing l can't understand is why you want to go back to Germany. l would not want to be where l was not wanted.
Why don't you go back to your own country?
Germany is my country. My father was born in Germany.
And my grandfather was born in Germany.
As a matter of fact, where are you from? l can't place your accent.
You speak German like no one l have ever heard.
The last 20 years of my life were spent in Germany.
Austria?
Near the border.
That's what l thought.
Lowenthal, you know it is a historical fact that..
..the Jews are the basis of our misfortunes.
- Of course. - You agree?
Of course. The Jews and the bicycle riders.
Bicycle riders? Why the bicycle riders?
Why the Jews?
- Hey, what's going on?
- Man overboard!
Man overboard!
Man overboard!
Hey, man overboard!
- Get her out of here! - Take her to our cabin, please.
Turn him over.
Can you understand it?
A man jumps from a moving ship at night, in the middle of the ocean.
And is drowned to save the life of a dog.
Yes, l can understand.
Who was he?
He was a woodcarver. He carved little animals with his pocketknife.
Come in, please.
Doctor, what can we do?
Well, you're doing all that can be done.
- How did it happen? - Yeah.
How did it happen?
- He was thrown overboard.
-Who would do such a thing?
But look at him. He knows that someone tried to drown him!
- His heart is broken. - Doctor!
You are not leaving?
Perhaps we could get him some broth. Some hot broth.
Yes. You can give him some broth. lt won't do any harm. ls that all?
Yes, that's all.
The man who saved him is dead.
Did he say a man is dead? l know how you feel.
No. You don't. You're like the others.
You thought the captain was justified in taking his knife away.
That's what you thought, wasn't it?
You were the one who felt sorry for the captain.
That was you, wasn't it?
Why can't we be honest with each other? l don't know.
- Maybe we're afraid to be.
- Well, let's try.
Maybe we'd better try.
You say l hate your painting.
Well, l do.
Oh, God help me, but l do. l don't know why.
You've said it. Maybe it's because l'm not very good at it myself.
Or maybe.. just maybe it's because it means so much to you..
..more than anything, more than even me.
That's being honest, isn't it?
Yes, that's honest.
Well, l'll tell you something that's even more sad. l can't be what you want me to be.
And l know what you need. You need someone just to be there..
..to deny herself for you.
David, l wish l could be like that, but l can't.
- l just can't. - Jenny, l know you can.
Well, it means leaving me with nothing.
You know? Nothing.
Jenny, do you know what l need? l need something very simple. l need a woman. But that's so difficult for you, isn't it?
You're so full of competition.
Do you know how empty it is, how frustrating it is..
..to reach out for something and then you find it isn't there?
To feel that someone is with you.
David, don't you think that l am?
Don't you think that l am in spite of myself?
- Haven't l tried everything? - Yes, you have tried. You've split a gut. lt's so hard for you. l know. lt's so hard for both of us.
All right, you say my work is..
..the most important thing in my life. lt is.
But that's the way l am. l can't help it.
And whoever shares my life is just going to have to put up with that.
She's going to have to live a life for me.
Jenny, l know this sounds selfish, but it's true.
We're not gonna go on together, are we?
Are we?
David?
Come in. l would have come to you.
Well, they said you weren't feeling well. l'm just tired, that's all.
- Were you sleeping? - No.
Don't you know it's very unhealthy to sleep with your clothes on?
- Where are they? - What?
- Where are they? - What are you looking for? - Where are..
Stop rifling through my things.
Here they are. Put them on.
Come on. Put them on.
And l'll read to you until you sleep.
Some pretty risqu? literature you've got here.
'Natural Resistance' and
'Clinical Medicine.'
'Researches on Rheumatism.'
'Diseases.. ' l don't know why l'm so tired.
Why, yes, of course. Well, that's the way it is sometimes.
The woodcarver died.
Yes, l know. l have been unable to accept death. Never.
No matter how many times l've seen it. l always feel as though l'm responsible.
Now..
..let's see what we've got here.
The dissolute Lady Chatterley sat waiting for the gardener to enter.
He entered, stopping for a moment, sensing someone in the room.
His muscles sinewy in the moonlight.
She spoke his name softly. The gardener went over to her.
He kissed Lady Chatterley..
..with a kiss such as she had never been given before.
Her arms were waiting for him, both resisting and demanding.
'Jonathan, ' she said, 'Jonathan, darling, you are violating me.'
Where did you get that?
You're so strange.
Sometimes you're so bitter. Then you're soft and warm, like a child. l'm just a woman.
Lie back.
There's three days to Tenerife. l know.
What will your treatment be like for you there? Do you know?
Will you be imprisoned? lt will be some kind of an imprisonment, l imagine.
But you mustn't think of me sleeping on a stone floor..
..and living on bread and water.
This is not my style.
Now..
Now l'm going to read to you..
..from this book exactly the way it's written. lf this doesn't put you to sleep, nothing ever will.
The liver is a large, glandular organ..
..irregularly shaped and of reddish-brown color.
Come on.
- Please come with me to the table.
- No. l've done enough.
You just have to take it from here on by yourself.
- Are you sure l look all right?
- You look lovely.
Now, go on.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Hello.
Hello.
Waiter. l would like one bottle of champagne, please.
Would you like to join me?
Why not? What are we celebrating?
Quarrel? lt's over. l'm sorry.
Will you excuse me? l have to go to the bridge.
Do you want to dance?
No.
No, not this time.
Thank you. l think l'm going to go to my cabin..
..because for me, a little
German music goes a long way.
Don't be embarrassed.
Nobody is watching.
Will l see you later?
Later.
Herr Freytag?
Herr Freytag! l want to tell you how sorry l am. l wanted to tell you that with all my heart.
Heart?
You have no hearts. Any of you. l'm sorry. l've no right to be rude to you. l have no right to be rude to anybody.
You must be very much in love..
..with your wife to stand up for her that way.
My wife and l are separated.
Yes.
Yes! l.. l thought l could face what we had to go through after we were married. l couldn't. l wasn't ready to give up my position..
..because of my employer's prejudices.
My family talked to me about it.
My friends.
My dear friends.
So l panicked.
Panicked! l asked my firm to transfer me to Mexico.
And you'll never believe what l did. l wrote a letter.
Dear Marianne:
We can't go on together. l've imagined her face a thousand times when she got the letter.
That face has followed me everywhere.
Now l'm going back. l don't even know where she is.
But l've got to find her.
Plead with her to understand.
To forgive me. lf she cares for you, she'll understand.
Don't you see?
Even if she does, l know l'll never forget. l wrote that letter.
Listen to that music, Glocken.
Now try to tell me you don't react to that music.
Schmaltz.
Tell me, Glocken, now honestly.
When you hear that music wherever you are..
..don't you have a special feeling about being a German? l'll tell you now
Lowenthal honestly.
When l hear that music wherever l am..
..l have a special feeling about being a dwarf. l remember being thousands of miles from home in a theater in New York.
They put on a picture of the funeral of the Kaiserin Viktoria.
That good woman. How much she meant to all of us.
You are German, aren't you?
You are the most German person l have ever met. l want to show you something. l take it out every once in a while..
..and look at it when l want to feel good.
Why, the Order of the lron Cross!
Second class.
And a war hero, besides.
You may be the biggest fool on this whole boat.
Why do you say that?
Where have you been during this voyage?
Do you think this boat is a cross section of the German people?
No!
You don't know the average
German the way l know him.
The people that produced a Goethe, a Beethoven and a Bach..
..are not to be sneezed at, you know?
50% of the people who produced a
Goethe, a Beethoven and a Bach..
..voted for Rieber's party last week. - Forty-four percent.
Lowenthal, you are blind!
You're absolutely blind!
You can't see what's going on in front of your own face.
What do you mean?
You mean this business about the
Jews? You don't understand us.
The German Jew is something special.
We are Germans first and Jews second.
We have done so much for Germany.
Germany has done so much for us.
A little patience. A little goodwill. lt works itself out.
Listen, there are nearly a million Jews in Germany.
What are they going to do? Kill all of us?
Karl, if you will excuse me. l want to dance with a most charming lady.
Might l have the honor of this dance?
- l want you to give me some money or l will kill you.
Are you out of your mind?
- l will kill you. - Johann!
That's God's judgment. l don't want to hear that anymore.
Don't you think l know how you've treated me?
Don't you think l know how you've cheated me?
Where is it? Where's the money?
Top drawer.
Come in. l have money.
Come here.
Come on.
Put out my cigarette.
Tell me..
..am l your very first girl?
You are shaking. There is nothing to be afraid of.
No.
The first time..
The first time is very important.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! l'm just teaching the young lady flamenco.
You keep your hands off her, you pimp.
Big hero. l'm sorry. l don't believe you're quite sober, Mrs. Treadwell.
What could give you that impression?
God. He stalks them like a mountain lion.
Did you see the makeup on those girls?
- Do men really find that attractive? - Some apparently do. l would think that men would like to know..
..what they were kissing. l would like to know what it is like to kiss you. l have been looking at you, thinking about you for a long time.
You never notice me. Why not?
Now you will not kiss me? Why not?
Do you want me to say l love you? l never knew what people meant by that word.
Say, don't say it. l can't bear the sound of it.
Then why did you lead me on during the trip?
You never considered my feelings at all, did you?
No.
And l'm sorry for that.
Mrs. Treadwell, l'm only a third-grade officer on a second-rate ship.
But it has given me an opportunity to observe people. l've seen women like you before.
Forty-six-year-old women who are still coquettes.
They travel on boats often. Always searching for something.
Do you know where that searching ends Mrs. Treadwell? lt ends by sitting in a nightclub with a paid escort..
..who tells you the lies you must hear.
You are a most mundane, ordinary man.
How extraordinary that a man like you..
..should be saying things like this to me.
Probably true. l think this evening's festivities have come to an end.
- l shall be happy to see you to your door. - lt's quite unnecessary. l'll find my own way.
- Darling? - Yeah Leiben. l didn't know there was a Frau Rieber.
What do you mean, a Frau Rieber?
The purser told me you sent a cable to Frankfurt..
..addressed to a Frau Rieber. l did not mention it before, because l could not bear the humiliation. lt is the tragedy of my life.
She will not let me go. l must go on supporting her and the three children.
There are three children?
Well they have no understanding of me.
And l have no understanding of them.
They hang on. They hang on. They suck the life's blood out of me.
They will not let go.
They will not let go. l am a vital, passionate man. l need love. l must have love.
Say you understand.
You must understand. l understand.
Now, look, l bought you a bottle of champagne, right?
A pack of them Sultana cigarettes..
..or whatever they are called and two margaritas.
When are we gonna get together?
You have been drinking too much. l think l will go now.
- Tonight. - Not tonight.
Tonight l am tired.
Tonight.
Very well. Just let go of my arm.
Hey. What's your cabin number?
Number 14. l thought you weren't bothering with that cheapskate. l have planned something very interesting for that cheapskate. l gave him the cabin of that snotty
American bitch, Mrs. Treadwell. l think you are mad. l made some inquiries. They would let me stay on the island. l would be able to take care of her. l understand your feeling about her, her helplessness.
- But to give up everything.
- What would l be giving up?
- What would l be giving up? - Your life!
My life. My life is obligations.
Obligation to nothing that's real to me.
This woman.. this woman over there in the cabin, she's real to me. l know it sounds strange.
But she's the only real thing that has happened to me.
Willy you have heard of shipboard romances, haven't you?
She's sold you a bill of goods, and you've fallen for it.
My god. l can see it if you can't.
She wants her precious needle.
- She doesn't want you.
- This may be true. lf this is true..
When l had my heart attack, there was a dream l had.
You can talk about death. l've seen it many times as a doctor.
But you never know what it's like until it almost happens to you. l dreamed l had already died. l dreamed l was in a box. The sweat broke out all over my body. l wanted to cry out, l can't be dead, l haven't lived!
Who has?
Do you think this woman is the answer, Willie?
A woman like this. All she's been through.
She has seen everything. There are no surprises left for her.
Even if it's love, Willie, l hope we can deny the myth that love lasts.
You are not young, Mrs. Treadwell.
You have not been young for years.
Behind those old eyes, you hide a 16-year-old heart.
Poor fool. ls that what men really find attractive?
Baby..
You just haven't managed to grow up.
Mrs. Treadwell of Murray
Hill, Virginia.
Now!
You can paint your toenails green.
You know how it ends, don't you?
Alone.
Sitting in a cafe..
..with a paid escort.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Mrs. Treadwell.
Excuse me. That greaser told me Cabin 14. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
You know l'm sorry, l truly am sorry. l didn't know it l was just..
- Pig! - Hey, what the hell?
Go on. Get out. Get out. Get out!
Get out!
Get out. Get out. No! No!
- You were sleeping. - l know.
You cried out again.
Did l?
What is it? lt's nothing.
- lt had to be something.
- lt was ridiculous.
Tell me.
Promise you won't laugh. l won't laugh. lt's something l saw the time l went to Taxco. lt was just a flash passing by on the bus. lt was a man and a woman. A crowd had gathered around them.
They were staggering and swaying. l thought they were dancing.
The man had his hand raised and there was a long knife in it.
The woman's breast and stomach were pierced.
The blood was so thick her skirt was sticking to her legs.
She was beating him with a stone. l'll never forget the look on their faces. lt wasn't all hatred. lt was like there was some great bond between them in that hatred.
And then they struck again. l always dream about it in some grotesque variation.
Tonight l was one of the watchers, as if l were at a play.
Then something happened.
- What happened? - The features changed.
Yeah?
David, the faces were yours and mine.
Good evening, doctor.
Night, doctor.
Thank you for bringing us home, 'capitan. '
The cuisine and the accommodations were superb.
Yeah!
They've come for me?
For me, the voyage is over. l have here an order..
..for something that will help you. Any doctor will accept it.
Willie.. you try so hard.
My darling. My love.
For once, let's kiss in broad daylight.
Bye. l think we ought to be able to reach Bremerhaven by Thursday morning.
Willie, you're drinking up my best cognac.
Not that l mind, but that isn't the thing you should be doing, is it?
You shouldn't be doing this. l know you're still thinking about her. She'll be all right.
By now l.. l'll guarantee she's found someone to help her.
- Woman like that always finds someone. - Shut up!
Willie.
That's a hell of a way to waste good brandy, Willie.
When l think of the things l've seen on this ship..
The stupid cruelties. The vanities.
We talk about values?
There's no values.
The dung we base our lives on.
She looked into the garbage dump.
She did something about it.
And we are the intelligent, civilized people..
..who carry out orders we are given.
No matter what they may be.
Our biggest mission in life is to avoid being fools.
And we wind up being the biggest fools of all.
Why didn't l go?
Come in.
Herr doctor, Frau Lutz wants to see you.
She say's her daughter Elsa is not feeling well. l'm coming.
To hell with them, Willie.
You rest here.
You don't look well. You should see the way you look.
That is exactly what l mean.
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- Good evening.
- You called me? - Doctor, can you give Elsa a purge?
Take two of those before you retire.
Doctor, aren't you going to take her temperature? l think he's been drinking. l can just hear you saying, What has all this to do with us?
Nothing.

My name is Milos Hrma.
They often laughed at my name.
But otherwise,
we were a happy family.
Our great-grandfather Lukas
as a tambour
fought on the Charles Bridge
of Prague
and when the students threw
cobblestones at the soldiers
they hit great-grandfather
with such aim
that he was getting a pension
ever since. One gulden per day.
He didn't do anything after that,
except buy a bottle of rum
and a pack of tobacco
every day.
Such luck, Milos, imagine you've got a uniform.
Once again, somebody in the family that made good.
My grandfather William was
a hypnotist
and the whole town believed
his hypnotism was prompted
by a desire to go through life
without any effort.
You must be careful not to have the trains crash.
The whole town would envy us.
My father, an engine driver,
has been retired
since the age of forty eight
and people are mad with envy
since dad is healthy
and will draw his pension
for twenty,
maybe thirty years...
without doing a thing.
When you come to the platform for the first time everybody will realize what a famous family we are.
Gee, you look nice, Milos.
Great-grandfather Lukas
bought a bottle of rum
and two packs of tobacco
every day.
Instead of staying home
he went to see the workers
and made fun
of the hard-working men.
So every year grandpa Lukas
would get beaten somewhere.
And in 1930 great-grandfather
boasted in front of stone cutters
whose quarry had just
been closed
and they beat him
so badly he died.
And when the Germans crossed
the frontiers in March
and proceeded towards Prague,
grandfather William decided
to face the Germans on his own
with hypnosis and stop
the advancing tanks
by the force of his thoughts.
With outstretched hands and eyes
glued to the Germans,
he tried to get them
to turn around and go back.
Actually the first tank stopped
and the entire army stopped,
but then the tank started
forward again
and grandfather wouldn't move -
so the tank went right over him,
cutting off his head
and nothing more stood in the way
of the Reich's army.
SHOEMAKER
And I went through
a preparation course
and I'm going to be
a train-dispatcher
and the entire town knows I want
to be a train-dispatcher
for the simple reason that
I don't want to do anything
just like my ancestors except
to stand on the platform
with a signal disc and avoid
any hard work,
while others have to drudge
and toil.
BASED ON THE NOVEL
BY BOHUMIL HRABAL
CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS
My little loves, my babies.
My little dears...
My May children, here this is for you.
My winged kiddies, take a grain,
This is from the Countess, does it taste nice?
Eat up my little ones.
You like it?
Here have some more, go ahead.
There... there...
Apprentice Hrma Milos reporting to work.
Welcome Milos. At ease.
Your Dad was the best engine driver in the district.
He once threw out the stoker while the train was in motion.
There my little chicks.
Come here, pigeons fly.
Take a grain, here boys.
What a station, son, that's a farm in itself.
Double gates that open and close.
Otherwise, we are closed.
We have arrivals and departures.
Otherwise we are closed.
So, why do you have it half open?
Mr. Novak, I thought you would settle it.
That clock has such a beautiful sound.
Hiya Milos.
Hiya Masa.
You look sharp.
You look nice too, Masa.
Quite a girl.
What sort of girl is she?
A nice one.
Nice, nice, they all are, but what else?
Countess, the station-master at your service.
I need two freight cars to take the cattle to the slaughterhouse, we are getting short on fodder so
I'll have to sell a few heifers.
The moral in our district is getting worse and worse.
In Kostelni Lhota the church has to be consecrated all over again.
Fornication behind the altar.
What a woman, look at those legs.
She's more like a dream than a real woman.
If she bent over me, the whole world would become dim.
One car, but with good rings.
I must sell some bulls too.
- You're not afraid of horses?
- Me, afraid of horses, Countess?
I used to serve under Count
Chotek and Prince Silva el Tores.
Bon. Next time when you come up to the castle,
I'll send you this stallion instead of the carriage.
Milos, I had the most wonderful dream.
Woman, that's nature's jewel.
Now all the Countess ever sends is two cases of beer and a bottle of liquor...
I dreamt that I turned into a carriage and the Countess held me by the shaft-bar and guided me to the store-room.
You should have all this before the war, when the lord master himself went somewhere.
The station-master had the carpet unfurled from the carriage to the platform, all the pensioners came in their uniforms.
Everybody saluted and in the afternoon a whole carriage full of liquor, beer, wine and food was sent down from the castle.
And what about your girlfriend, tell us.
How's it going?
That clock has a beautiful sound.
It's a bit tight here.
A railroad inspector like you'll be, is like a major in the army during the Austrian monarchy.
Exactly. But don't forget the shoulders.
One of my shoulders is shorter.
The golden ornaments, the star and sequins with the gold braid must be sewn on with gold thread.
Come in.
Sir, what about the
Countess' cattle, are we going to load it on track five?
On five, but first of all the cattle for the Countess, secondly polish your shoes and finally don't talk with the conductor on the platform.
You must consider your position, man, you'll be a train-dispatcher
Don't take after Hubicka, he won't get a promotion for ten years.
Why? Those women of his.
Better take your example from me.
Good morning, friends.
The situation of our armies fighting for the welfare of all the nations of Europe, whether willing or unwilling, is favorable.
We were forced to withdraw here somewhat, but here our armies tactically withdrew from the Baltic area.
Here's a beautiful tactical withdrawal from the Dniepr to the Danube, here we have tactically withdrawn from the Americans as far as Belgium. And here this masterful stroke in Italy?
But why?
Precisely, why? Because the enemies are crawling into a trap, can't you see it?
Look carefully.
Here we'll disembark to the back lines of the enemy.
Here for the Russians in the
Caucasus from Turkey and to Petrograd from Sweden, here we'll avoid the enemy and disembark from Sicily and here in the back lines of the Americans in France.
And here they are trapped and we'll chase them from two sides.
Why?
So that everyone can live happily, that's why I came.
Here, sign this proclamation stating that you understand if one neglects his duties at the station he'll be in for it for at least ten years, also for life or the death penalty.
That's all there is to it, only a few Czech chauvinists think that they can turn back the course of history, but the Fuhrer means well, even with the good Czechs and believes in providence which will not abandon us...
Where is...
Where is the station stamp?
Special attention must be devoted to carefully watching the trains.
Yes? There.
Maybe I should get dressed, this way...
No, no, no, no, no, when fighting for final victory clothes are not important.
Let us leave fashion for peace time.
Why?
Stop asking such silly questions.
Why shouldn't he ask, he's young.
Why? To save humanity.
Why?
Because that's what the Fuhrer wants.
But we must like each other, because we are all in the same boat.
Is that clear?
So long friends.
Cousin, train dispatcher's cousin, what beautiful little ears you have.
All they need are nice earrings.
Really?
Why don't you do something about it?
Do you know any other anecdotes?
Max, dinner.
One butcher used to carry udders out of the slaughter house and since they usually had an inspection at the gate he carried it in his pants.
In his fly? You're killing me.
Yes and he took the streetcar.
A lady sitting next to him looks at him and says
Mister, something is showing... the man then takes a knife, cuts off the udder and says, never mind I've got three more.
And what did the lady do?
She fainted.
Mr. Station-master, this joke sounds different now.
Everything is alright, the butcher managed to carry out the udder, takes the tram, sits down, the lady also points out that something is showing... and the butcher takes a knife... cuts... the lady turns pale...
Well, not so much the lady as the butcher, who screams,
Christ, that was the real one.
Mr. Station-master this is really a score for my cousin.
No, no, this really happened.
- Have a drink.
- Thanks.
A necklace would look real nice on this beautiful neck.
Hurry, Max, your food will
get cold.
Coming. Or a little cross.
Max...
I'm coming.
Max, if you don't come this
very minute,
I'm not going to warm your food.
I have to go down.
I have to work on a report for the management.
This is for a sweater for Countess.
Who is that laughing out there?
The dispatcher's cousin.
Such terrible morals these days.
The Countess told me in secret that they will have to consecrate the church in Kosteln Lhtota all over again.
But that's what you get when there is no power over people.
Mr. Dispatcher...
I don't know how to tell you.
But did you always get along so well with women the way you do now with the cousin?
Oh God no, I was no good with women at all.
How long is it going to take?
Two hours.
Nothing is sacred to this guy.
Terrible downfall.
Was the soup too salty?
No. But today the church stands on clay feet...
I could fry the rabbit, what do you think?
I'd be better if God called everyone to the Last Judgment
and put an end to everything.
Armageddon.
Armageddon.
Sodom and Gomorrah -
what morals.
Milos, we can relax now, only a few freight trains in both directions.
Just like streetcars.
Take over and serve me well.
My ears will be with you.
The curse of an erotic century.
Armageddon.
Condemn the authors of pornography.
Away with the monstrosity of young people's imagination.
I can hear you Milos, you're doing well, but you forgot the telegraph.
Remember next time.
Hi Milos.
Hello.
I'm on my way from work,
so I stopped to see you.
Yes.
Well, I'll be on my way.
Masa.
I have to go now.
They tore the sofa.
My official Austrian sofa.
In two parts.
That disgusting guy sees nothing but nasty things. Bleh.
At least if he'd show his low nature.
Whatever he does with those bitches in the hall, he can't do it on his boss's sofa!
I'll show you how wonderful she was.
Good morning boys.
Everything alright?
Station the way it should be?
Fun, fun, that's all very well, but duty comes first, do you understand?
Fun, fun, so what?
What about your girl?
She's nice.
Wait, that's not everything.
How is she in bed?
This carriage with the nurses will have to stay.
The depot does not have an engine.
Nurses. Merciful bitches that's what they are.
Terrible the way the Germans carry cattle.
Half of it is dead.
I saw one cow with a dead calf hanging from its rear, already rotting.
The Germans are pigs.
The cattle feels it.
Once we loaded a bull on the train, he put up some fight.
I thought he was going to break the sides off, so I took a knife and cut his eyes out.
The bull was quiet as a lamb.
Last time they carried three carloads of nearly dead sheep.
They were so hungry, they chewed each other's fur.
The Germans are pigs.
Is this place Milovice?
No, no, this is Kostomlat.
Is it far to Milovice?
- Five kilometers.
- How do I get there?
- Straight on.
- Thanks. Let's go.
Milos, let's go and see my uncle. I'm off.
Sure, Masa, but I'm not off until this evening.
That doesn't matter, we'll go in the evening and stay the night.
Get closer to each other and give her a nice kiss, there.
That was a beautiful kiss, and now smile, look over here, that's right.
Smile, one second, there, wave and that's all. Thank you.
Next please.
Next please.
Put your foot this way a little bit.
That's nice, straighten your back.
That's it. Yes, that's it.
Smile please. There.
Watch that tail, it is fragile.
That's fine, smile please. Yes.
Smile and stick out your chest.
That's it. Thank you. Fine.
Let's go then.
Next one please, there, watch it over the steps, don't break a leg.
Go in, I'll arrange it, all the way to the end please, watch your head, that's good.
Your hair a bit this way, put the bag away and your pretty teeth, your teeth.
Yes, that's nice.
Now we can focus.
Quiet, please.
Don't move.
The one in green should smile a bit, yes miss,
- would you be so kind...
- Uncle.
Milos, come along.
The one in purple a bit to the right, that's it, yes.
That's all then. Thank you.
Now I know why mother didn't want you to be a photographer.
Uncle is crude but kind.
What if he comes in?
Wait, they can hear everything here.
So what?
Where is the girl?
What for?
For God's sake - you really don't have a girl with you?
No.
And do you want one?
No.
You've got to be gone in an hour.
Oh my god!
You'll get me really mad and
I'll spank you.
Eleven, twelve...
I told you I'd spank you.
For christsakes...
So you see doctor, I am not a real man and I don't even want to be one.
Everything is so difficult in life, for me.
While for others it's all child's play.
In other words, when I was to act, I flopped.
You are healthy as can be, maybe too healthy.
When a young person is too healthy he can suffer from premature ejaculation.
That has happened to me too, you're just overly sensitive.
You need to realize that this is natural, normal and that it has to be faced as such.
Morning, Inspector, look how she came home from work.
Look, show him your behind.
Write a protocol.
Look what this Hubicka did to her and on duty too.
Look what he did to her.
This, can you imagine,
I could hit that stupid girl for letting him do it.
You must write a protocol.
I won't let it go. Look!
This color is produced by the Pelikan Company and won't wash off for a week.
Mother, this will go to to the district court.
Don't think about it too much, think of something else, Milos.
Football for instance, think of football and then choose an older, experienced woman to initiate love making.
And I took her under the neck, pressed a bit and no sound out of her after that. I didn't want to kill her,
I don't usually steal geese.
And then the neighbor came.
Come here. Look here, Sir, how the girl looked when she came home from work.
She is a telegraphist at the station, where Milos Hrma cut his veins.
And this is how she came home.
Her behind full of rubber stamp imprints, look at it, nice isn't it?
I've never seen anything like it.
Is that some sort of new game,
Miss?
- Was it a new social game?
- Yes.
He deserves to be locked up.
Say, that's no issue for court.
You can go and complain to the railroad management.
That's a case for the disciplinary commission.
Good God, look at that - if that isn't a clear cut criminal case...
Look at him.
How do you do, I'm Milos Hrma from the station.
Out!
Hookie player Milos Hrma from
Kostomlaty station... reporting.
Yes, yes young man...
Sorry for having shouted but you should know how to report. What is it?
Premature ejaculation is what doctor Brabec said.
Nice schweinerei.
But dear Hrma, look here, young people hardly cut of the Hitlerjugend are fighting for a new Europe, for a better future and what is your family doing for Europe?
Your father has been lying on a sofa for a number of years although he could have gone on serving the Reich, your grandfather hypnotized our tanks, liberating Prague.
The youth of Germany is shedding blood on the battlegrounds and hookie player Milos Hrma sheds it in the bathtub of a bordello.
But I'll show you. Do you realize that I can charge you for self mutilation in order to avoid service in the defense of the Reich?
It could also be qualified as sabotage. There.
What should I put in the report on your case?
With your permission...
But I'm not here to procure females for such things,
I have other duties.
But I...
Out!
Welcome Milos, welcome.
You've really made our little station famous. Nice.
This is bad business for your boss.
Milos, let me see, what's happened to you?
Let me see.
And Doctor Brabec said that an older woman should teach me at first, so I was wondering whether you wouldn't know of one?
No, I don't Milos, you'll have to find one yourself.
That's hilarious.
What about your wife?
Oh no, she's all mine.
I didn't mean that.
I was just wondering whether she'd know of someone.
I know and then it ends by stamping.
And doctor Brabec also said to find one of ill repute to teach me, you wouldn't know of one, would you?
Teach what?
At certain moments they are all alike.
But it just has to happen gradually, you can't ask straight out that way, even one of ill repute may scare away like that.
Don't you have a sister?
Milos...
I know...
That's something you two will never understand...
Reverend, consider this a confession, I wanted...
Come to the vicarage, the church can solve everything.
Everything will be fine, if you believe in it.
The church has mastered psychoanalysis for 600 years.
Only they will beat the burden.
Never mind, I'll consider it a Christian duty.
What are you doing? Painting?
Painting?
Painting, yes, painting.
What are you painting now?
I am painting the sea from a postcard.
I am copying it, but somehow my rheumatic hand hurts and I can't get the waves in properly, the sway of the sea.
I'll tell you what sir.
Place the postcard close to this cover, see?
And then take the brush and do this over the waves.
Over the waves like this until you get the swing in hand.
Then make them bigger and bigger, the way you need them and put them right on the cover.
That's perfect.
So what?
Last night, partisans threw a closely watched train in the air so smart - that the train and the bridge were destroyed.
The main track is blocked and trains going to the front will pass by here.
Tomorrow an ammunition train will pass by here.
You'll get everything in time.
The password is Viktoria Freie.
That idea with the sway of the sea is wonderful.
Run, run. The SS train stopped.
The partisans took out the rails and threw them into the forest.
Run, run.
Now they are assembling the track, they'll be here any minute now.
They sprayed everything at the station with their bullets.
I must report it, we must cover ourselves.
This is no laughing matter.
Milos, you took over for me.
I'll be grateful until death.
Come here.
Look Milos.
Tomorrow a freight train will pass through our station.
So what?
We'll blow up the train.
Sure, but how?
Don't worry, we'll get everything in time.
Do you get it, twenty eight carloads of ammunition in boxes blowing up behind our station right into space.
Now we'll follow our closely watched train again.
The best thing would be to stand on the platform and throw it at the middle car.
But then somebody can see us.
Look.
You'll slow down the train.
Once it comes close to the signal, let it come to a stop and give it the go-ahead signal.
What time is dinner at the Countess?
At eight thirty, sir.
At least I had the chance to try a horse from the other side.
I'm not angry with you, I know everything. I understand.
When will you come to see us? Tomorrow?
Maybe the day after tomorrow!
The day after tomorrow.
Don't be afraid, madam, that's me Milos.
What do you want?
Well you see...
Sit down.
Well you see madam, I came to see you.
The day after tomorrow I want to go see my girl - the conductor, you know?
And she's sure to want - you know what?
No, I don't.
Sure you do, don't pretend you don't when I know you do.
You see I am a man, but whenever
I'm trying to prove that I'm a man
I no longer am.
Doctor Brabec said that I suffer from premature ejaculation.
So I came to you.
But Milos.
Well, now for instance
I am a man.
Are you angry with me, madame?
No.
And you won't tell the station-master? Please? No?
No.
And you aren't angry at me?
Look, the Viennese professor doctor Otto Gruner said that potatoes contain many harmful substances dangerous to health.
That's interesting.
My name is Viktoria Freie.
In the morning, 28 ammunition carloads will pass the station.
Be careful.
Can I take a nap somewhere?
You wouldn't leave me alone, would you?
No, I wouldn't, but I'm on duty.
But I'll go and ask.
Sit down.
I'm Viktoria Freie.
A German? What do you do?
Circus artist. Before the war we had a whole program of air acrobatics. And you?
I'm Milos Hrma, I've tried to commit suicide because apparently I'm suffering from premature ejaculation, but that's really not so, even though all the time
I just can't do a thing, but I'm a real man.
What are you thinking of now?
Of football. Doctor Brabec told me to think of football.
Our club is playing an important league game right now.
Shut the light, will you please.
So you've never had a girl before?
Really and truly not?
It came through Podebrady so it should be here in half an hour.
Look, this is how you set it.
Are you afraid?
No, I've never been so calm as I am today.
I cut myself off from the past entirely. Just like that.
Here you can rest at least.
The sofa's cut in two places, animals behave better than that.
There my little chicks...
It should be here in seven minutes.
- Who's driving the trolley?
- Probably the trackman.
The disciplinary commission is opening its investigation against train dispatcher
Ladislav Hubicka.
Where is the station master?
Here.
Station-master reporting.
Good. Enough.
I've got a new uniform in the closet.
So you want to become an inspector?
Yes.
Wouldn't you prefer breeding geese?
No.
I should go and change, I've got a new uniform in the closet.
- You'll take the minutes.
- Yes.
Attention. The situation of our armies fighting for the welfare of all the nations of Europe is extremely favorable.
Holy Zdenka, is that your behind?
Yes.
And who stamped you?
Dispatcher Hubicka.
How did it happen?
We were both on night duty.
I read until midnight.
There were no trains so we were bored.
Then Mr. Hubicka said we ought to play games for tokens...
So we played...
Everything flies that has wings.
Raven flies.
Child flies.
Time flies...
Train flies...
Soldier flies...
Second flies...
Death flies.
Everything flies.
Masa, dear, wait a minute.
I'll be right back.
And I kept losing, first my shoes, then stockings... then blouse, slip and finally my panties.
And who took them off?
Mr. Hubicka.
And now Zdena listen carefully.
Before the dispatcher put you on the table, did he use force?
Did he threaten you?
Not really. I lay down myself.
I wanted to wait and see what would happen.
Wait and see what would happen.
He really didn't threaten you?
Did use any force? No?
No.
Well, then, this is no crime restricting personal freedom, but abuse and disgrace of the German national language.
The most noble blood of Europe goes to the front to fight for peace.
Risking their lives, their blood.
And your gratitude to the Reich?
One stamping imprints on the behind of the telegraphist and the other one cuts his veins because of some girl.
Do you know what Czechs are?
Laughing animals.
Max.
The inspector's garden is all shot to hell.
After Hitler occupied
Czechoslovakia and declared the area Slovakstatt, the persecution policy was adopted by Tis' regime.
On the eve of 1942
Tony!
Tony!
Tony, are you at home?
Tony! Where are you?
Did you take the trough to Mrs. Firic?
Do you know how many tons of ships the British sunk today?
1What?
Or were British ships sunk?
And did she pay you?
Well, I told her: Mrs. Firic, you can be sure that a trough made by me is waterproof.
And the money?!
Is that all?
- She gave me a pair of pigeons.
- What a bargain!
Do you think I can pay my bill at the grocer's with the pigeons?
Put your tools away!
Are you asleep, or what?
Are you listening?
Tony! What are you gawking at over there?
I'm putting the tools away.
Did you see the lovely structure going up on the square?
The height of it! And so many people around it.
The whole town talks of nothing else.
Even Little Tibie is working at the site,
I even saw old lame Frank there, even Dzurilla, and Kamenicky.
That's nonsense... you don't understand anything.
I don't understand?
Didn't I tell you: they are building the monument without even Mr. Brtko's help?
And there it is!
The hell they are! I wonder where they got the money from.
The money? Just go and see for yourself!
I'll go when I feel like going.
Of course, you know best.
You are too stuck-up to go and see your own brother-in-law.
Tell Mark, others are fighting at the front.
Let me help.
You'll make lots of money.
- We could live well.
- To hell with Mark!
You'd be sick to use the Fascist greeting, what?
I am not a parrot.
You think your arm would go numb if you raised it in greeting?
At your service, madam!
Everybody else is smarter than you!
- Shut up!
- What?
The workshop!
It's a waste of time talking to you! As if you were deaf...
Essenc! Come on!
Where are you going now?
Dress myself to look real smart, for my beloved, my sweetheart
To hell with her... she keeps ordering me about.
Go to town - go!
Go to the workshop - go!
Nothing but go, go, go!
Look who's here!
Run away, Essenc, no!
Gloria in excelsis Deo!
Amen
Hello, Mr. Blumenfeld!
Good day to you!
Essenc! Where's your master?
Hey, Tony! Now what's wrong?
Are you cross with me?
- I'm in a hurry.
- You're always in a hurry!
Come... I want to have a word with you!
That wooden monument won't run away!
You know what I mean.
It's a dirty job...
I have only one arm and one soul - but I advise you, most sincerely, keep your hands off that dirty business! Fascist politics.
Geza, I left my money at home.
Essenc! Beg nicely!
Well, that's nice! Here.
Slowly! Slowly!
Over to the right!
Welcome, Brtko!
Hey, boss! Did you come to give us a hand?
You can do your work alone!
Have you come to inspect the work, Tony?
Just a little... good afternoon,
Mr. Kuchar!
And what do you think of our wooden "Tower of Babylon?"
Nice job! You won't find another one like it.
By tomorrow, we'll be able to stretch our hands out and touch the stars!
You are joking, Mr. Kuchar!
I am not... I don't want to risk my pension.
There's nothing new under the sun, my friend.
There were Pharaohs - and pyramids before.
- Who?
- Pharaohs!
But it's all ashes now... and only shame is left.
These are serious things,
Mr. Kuchar.
Yes, very serious, very.
Take 50 cubic meters of wood at 1500 crowns that is three times five.
Yes, but people get good wages!
Don't you?... You are a skilled carpenter, aren't you?
Yes... but I have a nagging wife.
Remember, Mr. Kuchar, when
I made that gate for you?
What I need right now are some good materials.
His Excellency is coming! Have you been waiting for him, Tony?
I'd better go now!
What are you running away for?
Wait.
Are you scared of your own brother-in-law?
He can go to the devil - my own brother-in-law.
Hold on! If you wait long enough, you may see the day!
Look how fat he's grown.
All those pig-slaughters and the good wine!
He's as fat as a bishop!
Never mind a bishop?
An archbishop!
The local god.
To me he is the same as ever.
A good-for-nothing loafer - the bigshot commander!
If I had a brother-in-law like him,
I'd get a cushy job myself.
Well, smile at him!
Smile, will you?
Well - what is it?
Laudatur!
Essenc!
We are going!
What have I ever done to deserve such a husband?
Move off, you beast - you are as bad as your master!
Shut up!
Good evening!
What - cat got your tongue?
Rosie!
Here you are, Tony!
Some medicine for you! Catch!
Oh, God!
- Just look at him!
Help! Help! The deluge!
Save your souls!
Now look what he's done... just like a baby.
So what? Splashing about like a child, splashing.
You do have funny ideas, Mark!
Forgive this mess -
I'll clean it up right away.
Don't stand like a statue in the puddle!
Let's have a rag and a broom, hurry up! A rag!
I don't want you to do that!
I told him not to soak his feet in the kitchen but in the yard but he just won't listen.
Here! And wipe it well!
Rosie, my dear.
All this work is our fault.
Of course not! That's nothing.
I always said to Tony: Watch out, blood is thicker than water.
What's all the fuss about!
Look what I've got! Look!
You've never seen so much food in your life.
Like in the delicatessen's shopwindow!
But that's nothing, Evelyn.
Mark came home from the office and said:
Hurry up, Rosie, we're going out to visit people.
I said, visit whom?
Tony and Evelyn, he said.
We can't put it off any longer.
Of course he didn't have to ask me twice!
Hell and damnation, we forgot the caviar at home!
Rum!
Hurry up, Tony, get the glasses!
From the sideboard!
We shouldn't have come without the caviar!
What a thing to do!
We shouldn't have!
Let me see your hat.
Did you buy it at the Modiste's on main street?
So beautiful!
Hey, look! It's a fire!
Christ! Water... get water, quickly!
Tony, don't just dance around!
Bravo, Tony, bravo... you'll make a fine fireman!
Well, my dears...
Our time has come at last!
We've got good times, plenty of food and drink, thank God, and our freedom too.
Let's live in peace and unity, as befits an honorable and decent family!
Let's drink to that!
Isn't he sweet?
Well said, Mark!
Long live our wives!
Well, Tony? Shall we drink another glass?
Pour it out and let's drink to your carpenter Patron Saint!
There's an old saying that two glasses help you sing, three help you to embrace and five help you to quarrel.
Let's forget it, Tony!
What's past is past, let's drown it in rum, sliwowitz or terkelitz...
Whatever you want!
And we'll be happier than we ever were! Cheers!
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
Tony, do we have to beg you on our knees?
Aren't you drinking, Tony?
Drink it up, or you'll make me cross...
I am all right...
I even feel like drinking.
What did you say that old saying was... with the... glasses?
I can't even remember.
- Three glasses help you what?
- To sing.
Yes... well, let's drink the way our fathers did before us.
Only I guess they didn't have much. They were poor but we are rich and get richer!
Bottoms up!
I keep blowing my whistle... dad has a right to squeeze mum.
I keep blowing my whistle...
I'll squeeze you too when we are wed
Rosie, my dear, how are we ever going to pay you back?
Sit down, stop showing off!
Stop showing off!
Wait! Now I'm going to tell you.
Why don't you leave him?
Let him talk, he's charming!
Come on, Tony, say it, don't mind her!
We are a free country now.
You can speak!
I won't if you order me to!
Stop it, Tony!
But my dear Tony, say what you've got to say, that's what we are here for!
You have the floor! Speak!
I have the floor - whether you want to or not, you know?
It's true, you've pleased us with so many presents.
You've no reason to complain!
Only... what I'd like to know... you devil, my benefactor who will reimburse me for my inheritance?
That's what I've been waiting for!
Yes, that's what I had on my mind.
Who's going to make up for the garden?
Silence!
Who bribed the lawyer?
Who paid the notary to ignore the register?
Just tell me that if you are so clever! Just tell me that!
And when I came to see you and said: Commander, wouldn't there be a job for me on that Babylon tower of yours now called "a monument", what did you tell me?
What... what... did you... tell me?
Just answer me!
What did you tell me then!
You showed me the door, threw me out like a dog, that's what you've done, just like a dog!
That's enough! Quiet!
Listen, you... in the name of your carpenter
Patron Saint, damn him - do you realize where I could have been today if you, too, had joined the Fascist Guard?
Listen, you!
Because of you they are calling me an alibist. You... you... you Ali Baba!
To hell with that garden of yours, do you understand?
To hell with your farm!
Today things are different!
You martyred carpenter!
I'll show you the kind of brother-in-law you've got!
Look! Take it! You'll soon know who I am! Here, you coward!
Take it and read it aloud!
Aloud, so that everyone can hear you!... Read it!
Court-Order: According to # 1 ordinance No. 31, 40 the Jewish business, namely the textile shop of the widow
H. Lautmann, Hlinka Square 69, is taken over for temporary administration.
The administrator of this business until further notice is Antony Brtko.
What do you say now?
You'll take over Lautmann's
Jewish shop - for good!
Na straz.
Na straz! Yesterday, poor, tomorrow, rich!
You can throw your carpenter's tools out the window.
I knew it... I swear I did.
Rosie, Rosie, my dear,
I knew it.
You see now?
Tony! My dear brother-in-law... my dear.
I have a good looking girl... she keeps a market-stall selling potatoes on mainstreet
No, no, not potatoes!
We'll sell better products.
Why are you looking so sad?
We'll drink up and that's that!
Give me a kiss, sweetie!
I have a good looking girl...
Wait, Tony! Here, have one of these!
Take one! Do you like the case?
Take it! Take it!
I'm not in the habit to owe anything, understand?
Let me see! Look, this is the way... it opens.
Leave him alone! He'll learn to be a proper gentleman!
Take it, Tony, it's yours!
Do you have anymore salad?
For you? Always, Mark!
Tony, don't you lose it!
You'll see - I'll make a classy gentleman of him yet!
Let me tell you, my boy, if one pulled to the left and the other to the right, things would be in a mess.
That's a fact!
Well, as I've been telling you: have you ever seen a cock that didn't crow at dawn?
That goes for us too, my friend!
Let's get going while the going's good.
Cocka doodle doo!
You dope, are you drunk? Now you've woken up the whole yard!
Now remember what I tell you... we are one family, understand?
And if we don't get rich now, as
God and the Fuhrer want us to, we'll never do it! That's serving our country! Remember that!
I don't believe it... it shines!
It actually shines!
It shines.
It's a flash-light, so why shouldn't it shine?
It has to shine, a flash-light...
A flash-light.
That's nice, hum?
Three!
Five!
You won't last.
Five! Five!
We'll see who lasts longer.
Tony, Tony, don't be mad!
Six!
Seven!
No, this is the sixth!
No, this is the sixth.
Leave me alone, will you?
I counted them... six... seven!
And eight!
Eight! Here you are!
Don't, don't drink!
Eight... nine!
Let him be... Wait!
The last one! Now the last one.
And...
Ten! This is the tenth!
Bravo!
He's a real man!
I swear, I'd have never believed you can do it!
A czardas!
I am just as good as you are.
I am just as good as you, good as you... 2my girl.
Come on, Tony, dance!
Climb on the stool.
You'll fall off!
I want to speak!
Oh, be quiet!
Quiet, Quiet!
The Fuhrer is speaking:
Excellent! Go on, Tony!
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!
He's sick.
Didn't I tell everyone he's a coward and not a man?
Just watch him! He'll be sick all over the kitchen!
Tony! Tony!
He can't take it.
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!
Let's go home.
Get up, Tony, get up!
Get up, my dear... it's late already.
I saw a white butterfly in my dream.
A white butterfly.
A white butterfly... a white flag... love thy neighbor.
Here is a clean handkerchief, if you need it.
I ironed your Sunday shirt.
Get up, Tony!
It's morning already, and you should have been in the shop already!
Look how I polished your shoes!
What a lovely day!
Here's your cigarette-case.
The Court order concerning the Jewish shop is in your right-hand pocket.
Don't lose it!
You have to look clean and tidy!
God grant us a good morning, neighbors!
Good morning!
The guests stayed late, what?
Yes, very late.
You didn't get much sleep.
Yes.
Go to hell! You, too!
Don't trust anybody, Tony!
You've got to put out a sign:
We don't sell on credit - if you've no money, don't buy.
Don't forget!
Essenc! Come - you'll stay at home!
Here I am... a rich man before I realize it.
Beliansky is a rich man too...
Vincenc!
This doesn't look as high as
I thought it was yesterday.
Good morning!
Good morning!
What is it you need, young man?
- Safety pins?
- What? No, no.
Well, what?
We've got everything.
This?
As you wish.
No, no... thank you!
You don't have to worry, young man.
You don't suffer from rheumatism yet...
I can't sleep from pain.
My hands are like ice... like ants crawling all over them.
The doctor says: gout! No,
I say, doctor, that isn't gout, it's my years... the old age.
Did you know Mr. Sekerak?
Not the ice-cream vendor, but his brother - the one who worked in Laborec, in the forest the gout twisted his hands... he is a sick man now.
The poor lady... who did you say it was?
Not a lady...
Sekerak, the carter... poor man ate fish all his life.
I mean on Sundays - week days they had porridge or potatoes.
On Sabbath, a fish is the best thing.
I don't know.
It's easy to make: you need trout, an onion, carrots.
Mrs. Lautmann, I didn't come for recipes...
I... for heaven's sake, where did I put it?
Here! Read it!
I was afraid I had lost it.
Please, forgive me... I don't see well enough to read.
You don't see well enough?
Well.
I have been appointed Aryan manager of your shop.
Excuse me?
Your shop.
Oh, you want buttons!
We've got them.
We've got cotton buttons, steel buttons, big ones, small ones for shirt...
A nice selection.
Listen, Mrs. Lautmann!
I'll try to explain.
You are Jewish, right?
Well, and I am an Aryan.
The Jewish shops are all gone!
That's the law.
Now only Aryans can keep shops.
That's what they call
"Aryanization". Understand?
I don't.
You don't understand.
Yes, here it is, all in black and white.
I am your Aryan... and you are my Jewess.
3Do you understand?
You are the rent-collector!
Or are you the bailiff?
No, I am not... I am your Aryan!
Just as I thought... such a solid man.
Do forgive me, young man.
I don't hear well.
What's your name, young man?
Brtko. Tony Brtko.
Krtko?
No, Mrs. Lautmann... not Krtko -
B... B...
Krtko... an interesting name...
I know... I know.
My Heinrich.
My beloved dead husband, used to say: Rosalie, Rosalie.
I'd rather you starved but the taxes have to be paid!
The old bills are in the pantry.
A shop-keeper must think of his honor first, right?
Well, am I right, Mr. Krtko... am I right?
This is what I brought from the Waldes-factory.
Here! And this is... wait... am I right?
Am I right?
Yes... you are right... you are right.
Good day!
Oh, Imre! Imre!
Brtko! What are you doing here? Buying buttons for Evelyn?
Imre - I've been waiting for you since morning.
Don't be angry...
I've brought you a fish for Sabbath.
A fish you've never had before!
You'll have enough to invite even Brtko.
Mr. Brtko has been waiting quite long already.
I thought he was a bailiff from the court in Brno.
Brtke the bailiff?
You are all dressed up, that's why the poor old soul thought...
Well... I'll come another time.
- Wait, Tony, wait!
- Yes.
Don't worry... there's nothing to worry about.
Everything's all right...
Look, Rosalie, make us a cup of tea.
- Tea?
- Tea!
Tea... yes...
It won't take a minute.
A nice cup of tea... the way you always do.
We'll join you in a second.
Well...
Well? What?
Well, I say.
I swear to God I didn't do anything to get it.
You didn't do anything and yet you've been appointed manager of her shop?
If I didn't take it, someone else would.
Fool!
Now that's enough! Don't be rude!
I am no fool.
If I tell you
I've got the decree.
Look, Tony, if I hadn't known you all your life
I'd say you are a gangster!
But you are only an old fool they've cheated.
- Who?
- Your own brother-in-law!
Why would he cheat me?
Just watch closely!
Watch...
Don't you know that they've already divided all the good Jewish shops among themselves!?
You've been cheated, friend!
Kolkocky threw a bone to you - a bone sucked dry and cleaned before!
You think she was living on the profits from the shop?
She lives on the alms the Jews collect for her.
Well, look.
See for yourself!
I see it...
I get it now, Mr. Kuchar.
Wait! Tony, where are you going?
Home, Mr. Kuchar...
I don't give a damn about all this.
Actually, I am quite pleased.
I'll go up to the town-hall and tell them what they can do with their decree trying to cheat decent people.
You are just like a little boy.
What will you, tell them?
That Kolkocky cheated you that this is no gold mine but a broken down, dilapidated hole?
They'll show you the door!
No one is going to make a fool of me!
Let them try their tricks on others.
Look Tony, I'd much rather you took over the shop than another stupid lout.
We can reach an agreement.
Mrs. Lautmann hasn't died of starvation yet and you won't regret it either.
- What am I supposed to do?
- You? Nothing.
We can arrange things to work both ways.
You never know when you will need it.
I could have been looking down from that picture and old Lautmann could have been standing here with you.
I still remember the day in the trenches bullets whistling past my head.
One of us had to stick his head out.
Lautmann did - and I am here.
A bullet hit him in the head.
My mother always bought buttons from Mrs. Lautmann.
Oh, tea! Tea, tea, tea!
Thank you. No one makes such good tea as you do, Rosalie!
Jasmine tea.
Tony, come and sit down.
Sit down, make yourself at home, sit down.
Do you know who this gentleman is, Rosalie? You don't?
That's the one I told you about -
Lilly's cousin
I've told you often enough.
He said he'd come to help you with the store.
For a month or two... maybe even longer -
Yes, Lilly's cousin.
Don't you remember?
Is that him?
But Mr. Kuchar, what are you talking about?
I am the "Arisator", not some "help".
Don't interfere.
I know what I'm doing!
She doesn't know anything about the "Arisation".
Maybe she doesn't even know there's a war.
What did the young man say?
But what are you going to do,
Mr. Kuchar?
He said he will come, but tomorrow and as often as you need him.
Sure! May God bless you for being so good.
I am not as alone as I often think.
What's the young man's name?
His name is Tony! Tony!
You'll be like my own son,
Tony!
Oh, oh! I forgot to get the vinegar for your fish!
See, Tony? Everything can be arranged.
Tony, have you ever heard the German saying
"To live and let live?" " To feed the wolf and keep the sheep?"
Andrew took over Weinstein's saw-mill who still works there.
I am going to see him now and tell him:
Mr. Weinstein, that's why you've got to raise your taxes to save the widow Lautmann.
And what if he doesn't pay?
If Weinstein won't,
I'll go to Hartmann, see?
They still have money. Or I'll go and see Lowy, Roth.
- Do you know Katz?
- The barber?
Yes.
Yes... well... it's nothing...
- What have I been saying?
- About the barber.
Yes... look Katz the barber is the cashier.
You'll get your "wages" from him every week.
Wages?
Don't you understand?
You are the Aryan administrator of Mrs. Lautmann's shop, aren't you?
Thus, you become an employee of the Jewish Community!
Do you understand?
With a regular monthly wage.
You don't say.
Don't I? You'll do that.
You'll get it, let's see six or seven hundred Crowns a month.
You never make that much in your own trade.
Yes, Mr. Kuchar...
Did you know Cutka, the one that stuck his hand into the circular saw?
It's a hard job... taking over a Jewish shop.
Tell me... what did she say?
The old lady was surprised, then said she doesn't care whether the shop is managed by Tom, Dick or Harry.
So she doesn't care whether it's me or someone else.
And I said: "You have nothing to worry about, Mrs. Lautmann".
"I am not going to eat you".
And she said: "I've been dreaming of you.
"You are a nice Arisator".
She'd been dreaming of me.
The old woman! She can help me in the beginning, work as my assistant.
Don't let her cheat you!
Why would she? I told her,
I said: "Mrs. Lautmann, watch it!
"I won't stand for any... trick or such".
And the keys?
Did she give you the keys?
- The keys?
- Yes.
- I will get them tomorrow.
- What?
She'll give me the keys tomorrow!
She won't eat them!
You left her the keys?
I have to go slow...
I'd scare her... she is rather old.
Is she? Wait, Tony!...
Look what I've bought for you!
What is it?
In this you'll make notes of everything in the shop, what's lying, what's standing, and remember, she doesn't keep her wealth in the shop, but hidden under the floor.
- Good day!
- Good day!
- Excuse me!
- That's all right.
Good day! I'll be with you in a minute... Good day!
Good day.
Mrs. Lautmann!
Mrs. Lautmann!
You have to knock harder - she is quite deaf!
She needs her ears cleaned.
- Good day, Mrs. Andric.
- Good day!
Mrs. Lautmann!
Oh, it's Krtko?
What are you doing here?
My name is Brtko! Tony!
Don't mind me... come in, nice of you to have come!
Mrs. Lautmann... we have to open the shop!
I am sorry I haven't tidied up.
I didn't know you were coming.
Did you have breakfast?
I overslept.
I said to myself: "it's Sabbath today, there's plenty of time".
Mrs. Lautmann, people are wondering why we haven't opened the shop yet.
It's almost eight... bim... bim... eight! It's late!
Do tell me - did you have breakfast?
I did... I did.
Do sit down!
Mrs. Lautmann... we can't go on this way.
We have to open up!
The key! The lock!
The shutters!
We want to sell buttons, don't we?
No, my boy - it's Sabbath today. I never open on Sabbath.
Never sell buttons.
Sabbath or not - business is business!
No, no... do sit down, do!
No, I won't! Listen, you!
Where are you going!
That isn't the right door!
The toilet is in the yard!
Do you have the key?
Tony! Tony! Krtko!
I'll be right back!
Have you seen Mr. Kuchar?
He's next door!
Mr. Kuchar! Mr. Kuchar!
What is it, Tony?
The old lady is being difficult.
No one told me about Sabbath.
What?
She refuses to open the shop.
She says it's Sabbath.
Oh, Sabbath! Sabbath!
Sit down, Tony, sit down.
Sabbath... sa...
I'll fix this.
Well... Aladar!
God bless...
CLOSED FOR INVENTORY
That is my Rosie... and Clara.
Yes... they are in America.
About three years after the war - my brother Josl came on a visit.
They call him Joe now... he is a rich man, very rich.
He has a factory - makes soda-water.
So he said to me: "Heinrich did not come back from the war.
"You'll have a hard time".
Rosie was 16 at the time... and Clara... Look!
Very nice.
Yes, Mrs. Lautmann, but this chair is badly in need of a carpenter.
I think everything is broken here.
My Rosie is gone...
My Clara is gone.
My Heinrich is dead.
Joe doesn't write...
This is nice furniture... decent stuff but no longer fashionable.
It needs smoothing down, new polish, paint, glazing.
It could be as good as new!
Why am I keeping these suits,
I ask you? What's the use?
Do you know what I'll do,
Mrs. Lautmann?
I'll bring my tools on Monday and start working!
We'll have things ship-shape soon.
The bed will look like new.
I promise, dear Mrs. Lautmann!
Look, a dog - that's all I needed!
Essenc!
What are you doing here?
Throw him out!
Don't worry... it's my dog.
Don't be afraid, Mrs. Lautmann... he doesn't bite.
I see! Is he yours?
I opened the gate and he slipped between my legs!
Slipped straight in.
Mrs. Lautmann, come here.
I'll tell you something!
Don't be afraid - he'll even shake, if you'd like.
They are selling white beans.
I am going to the market on
Monday, I could get some for you.
I've got the shopping list ready.
Is that all?
I'll come in later to make a fire.
It can't be helped - you have to go!
And you stay there!
You are not to come in!
I've sent him away, as you are afraid of him.
She helps me on Sabbath-days.
A very nice lady - a good soul.
Look... Henrich didn't have a chance to wear it out.
The best English cloth...
Take it! Try it on!
Jesus - Mrs. Lautmann!
Wear it, wear it - what am I going to do with it?
I think it will be a good fit.
Mr. Lautmann must have had the same figure as I.
Am I right, Mrs. Lautmann?
A hat marked "Huckel" - elegant and practical for Sundays or any other day.
Look how well it suits you!
As if Fischmann the tailor had sewn that suit for you!
Here - take it!
And look at yourself in the mirror! Look! Well?
I look like Charlie Chaplin.
Good day!
Who's that?
Good day!
- I kiss your hand, ladies!
- Hello, Marian!
Meet my sister - introduce yourself.
- My brother-in-law.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Marian, weren't you a tailor?
- I was.
You can help us choose.
Mark, we'll catch up with you in a minute! Let's go.
- Don't stand there gossiping.
- And don't you go to the pub!
Good day!
My most sincere greetings, gentlemen!
God bless you, Mr. Andric!
Listen, you... come here!
Come here.
Can you tell us where you got that hat?
That hat... wasn't given to me.
I bought it from Kuchar - the poor man has to sell his things.
He's broke. It cost nothing.
Nice hat, isn't it?
I'll have him arrested!
I'm going to clean this town of all Jew-lovers!
Jew-lovers?!
Yes, he is a dirty Jew-lover, your Mr. Kuchar.
I know all about him!
We're keeping an eye on him!
I'll give you an advice.
Don't be too close with him!
A Jew-lover is worse than a regular Jew, since he isn't a Jew himself but helps Jews.
That's interesting.
Interesting? You bloody fool!
It's downright dangerous!
What's that there?
Listen to me, my friend - that Jewish sign must disappear from our main street, understand?
Citizens, hear this public announcement:
All owners of dogs, whether
Alsatians, German shepherds,
St. Bernards or any other breed must pay a dog-tax within ten days.
Those who disobey this order will be punished!
Their dogs will be put away without further notice.
- How much?
-30 Tallers a piece.
That's much too expensive.
Things are getting dearer every day.
Well, how much?
Wait a minute,
I am in a hurry.
I was first.
And the princess said to the shepherd
"Don't go back to your sheep.
Come with me to the castle".
Uncle, what is glue made of?
Of horses' hooves.
Of horses' hooves?
As I told you.
Uncle... and what's that you are putting on now?
Shellack, my boy.
Is it? And what is shellack made of, uncle?
From bird droppings.
Erika!
What is it?
Where's mother?
In town.
Hello, Danko!
I see you are busy?
I am. Well, are you back from work or going to work?
Is that old stuff worth the trouble?
I like to put things together.
Selling buttons isn't a man's job.
Tony!
Has someone been calling me?
I have to.
- Uncle, your cigarette.
- You finish it.
What do you need it for?
- For a swathing-band.
- A swathing-band?
We sell everything.
We've got everything, ladies.
Seven, eight, nine, ten... twelve. Exactly twelve.
How much does this cost?
How much... wait a minute... how much is it?
10 Hellers.
10 Hellers, that is one crown and twenty.
- Give me eight.
- Yes? Six... eight.
- What about these buttons?
- Of course.
We have so many. We could pave the town with them!
You can put them on the whole family's clothing.
Do we have such buttons?
- What?
- Do we?
- We do... we do.
- We do!
But where do we have them?
Well, where?
Where? Right here!
Go away.
Do you have cross-stitch patterns?
With proverbs? Of course!
We have some.
I'll get them...
I'll get them right away.
Do we have cross-stitch patterns?
Of course, we do...
Do we have cross-stitch patterns?
Do we have any?
Cross-stitch patterns?
- Where?
- Up there.
I'll get them for you right away.
You can do your cross-stitch till your fingers hurt!
Whoever trusts in God need not fear evil!
We have that saying too.
Tony, Tony... not there... here!
Do you have them or don't you?
Tony! Tony!
Down there!
Come later, Evelyn!
You see how busy I am!
Don't bother... it's nothing.
You slow poke, at the bottom.
Mrs. Lautmann... what kind of work is this?
Don't stand there like Lot's wife! Serve the customers!
Come later, Evelyn!

My name is Sakura Nishi,
I left Japan for China in May, 1939
I was assigned to the
Tienstin Army Hospital
Nurse Taniguchi and you four, surgery.
Nurse Nishi and you three, general medicine.
Nishi.
Half of your patients are serious.
The rest are not.
They're mainly TB and mentally ill patients.
Some aren't sick at all.
Be careful.
Many can demonstrate a fever by agitating the thermometer.
Mental patients who've recovered pretend their sick.
They prefer being here to manning the front lines.
Seeing through their lies is your job.
You'll be with them every day.
Understand?
Outwardly it's just like a military hospital in Japan.
But in fact it's a field hospital.
You're new here?
Where was your last post?
After graduating I spent three years a Tokyo Army Hospital.
Born in Tokyo?
Me too.
From the Kiba area.
So, your family is in the lumber trade?
Grandfather was,
I don't remember.
Why not?
Father died before
I was born.
Mother also, when I was two.
An aunt raised me.
How old are you?
I'm 24.
I'm Pvt. Sakamoto, also from
Tokyo. Be good to me.
Tokyo, eh?
Damn it!
I wish I was back there.
Nishi, time to make your rounds.
Stop it!
I'll scream!
Go ahead.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No use fighting back.
Everyone's bored.
They'll enjoy the show.
I reported everything the next night.
I see.
Pvt. Sakamoto again?
You're his third victim.
He isn't fully recovered, but this can't go on!
Hello, Nurse.
I'm being sent back to the front line.
A death sentence.
Congratulate me.
Thanks for everything.
Good luck.
I really enjoyed it.
Next time it's my turn.
Stuck here all day.
A man needs a woman.
My next posting, two months later, was even worse.
Hell couldn't be much worse.
It was a front line hospital.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Bullet wound.
He's dead.
Surgery.
Bury this one.
Amputation.
Dead.
Put my foot back on!
Forget it, son.
Amputation.
All right, son.
We'll stop the pain.
No saving him.
Surgery.
Help me!
Please!
Control yourself!
Separate the dead.
Amputation.
At the thigh.
Anesthetic?
Just local.
He's a kicker, hold him down.
Idiot!
Get back here!
Mother!
All right, he's ready.
I'll sew him up.
Get me a bandage.
200 operations over three days and three nights.
Lt. Okabe, the surgeon, the medics and nurse, all went without sleep.
Arm next.
Hold him down.
More and more men were brought in.
Many died before surgery.
Some died during surgery.
Others died after the operation.
They all went to the morgue.
Get their tags or we won't know who is who.
There was a mountain of tags.
It was the end of the third day.
His pulse is strong.
He's lost too much blood.
He's a goner.
Nurse Nishi.
It's me, Sakamoto...
Save me, please!
I'm sorry about what happened.
I don't want to die!
I want to live!
I'm begging you!
Don't leave me!
Nurse Nishi!
Please don't let me die!
Don't kill me...
Doctor.
He needs a transfusion.
Anesthetic.
Only colonels and above get blood transfusions.
I know this man.
Please, Doctor.
How do you know him?
He was my patient in Tienstin for a while.
He's not kin, or even a friend?
No, sir.
We're swamped. These others have a better chance.
If you come to my quarters tonight, I'll do it for you.
Thank you, sir.
Just this once!
I didn't want him to die.
I didn't want him to think that was my revenge.
That I'd deliberately kill him.
The transfusion didn't work.
By the end of the shift he was dead.
What's up?
No pulse.
His pupils are dilated.
He's been gut shot, it kills them every time.
What a waste of precious blood.
We'll take him out.
Throw him in the pile.
One more dead!
Who is it?
Nurse Nishi.
Excuse me.
So, you really came?
Were you joking?
No, I meant it.
Pour me some wine.
The spoils of war.
The man we gave the transfusion to died.
That's no surprise.
It would've been a miracle.
I'm sorry I caused you trouble.
Don't play favorites with the patients.
Soldiers aren't human beings!
They're just weapons.
Why did you operate if you knew he'd die?
Before I was drafted,
I was a specialist surgeon.
But here I'm no doctor.
I have to decide who will live.
Whether I can save them or not.
Sometimes I long to be a doctor again.
I knew he'd die but
I did my best anyway.
The last vestiges of my professional pride made me go through the motions.
Have a drink.
You'll sleep better.
Yes, sir, I will.
How can I save truckloads of them?
Ruptured blood vessels, smashed bones...
Loss of blood or gangrene gets most of them.
We've no blood and very little medicine.
So I cut off their arms and their legs...
Even those who don't need it...
They say that I'm an expert at it.
I've cut off hundred of limbs.
I've crippled hundreds of men.
God knows how many.
But you had to save their lives.
You think they believe that?
They'd be better off dead.
What I'm doing is wicked.
I either let them die, or I cripple them. That's all.
Am I a doctor?
It's a wonder I don't go mad.
The war's to blame.
Not you. the war, eh?
As we attack, our lines get longer.
The enemy turns around and attacks our rear, where our defense are weak.
China's too big.
It's a stupid war.
But that's the Army's problem, not mine.
Get undressed.
I can't get drunk in front of a nurse.
That's an order!
Yes, sir.
There's no tomorrow on the battlefield.
We live from day to day.
What happens today, whatever we do, fades tomorrow.
You need not worry.
Now come here!
What's your first name, Nishi?
Sakura.
Sakura?
Cherry blossom?
Just think, if you live long enough, you will become a 60 or 70 year-old Sakura.
Cherry blossoms only last a few brief days.
I love my name.
I'd like to live up to my name.
Who named you?
My father.
He died before I was born.
In photographs, he looks like you.
Enough wine.
I need a shot now.
It's all in that drawer.
What kind of injection?
Never mind.
Just do as I say.
Yes, sir.
It's morphine, sir.
Hurry up. It's almost dawn.
There's no time.
I just want to sleep, to just forget everything.
Nishi, will you stay here until
I fall asleep?
Summer nights are cold here.
If you're cold, you can share my blanket.
I was exhausted.
I only wanted to sleep.
Next!
Awake?
It's noon.
You've slept for ten hours straight.
Get some more.
I must go.
They'll manage without you.
I said you're exhausted.
Doctor!
What?
Did anything happen?
You think that I took advantage of you?
You undressed me.
I didn't touch you...
Not that it matters.
What does that mean?
You wouldn't understand.
I'll go back.
We nurses went back to Tientsin in a truck with the sick and wounded.
By that time, I couldn't get
Dr. Okabe out of my mind.
Perhaps I had begun to love him.
"TIENTSIN MILITARY HOSPITAL"
How was the front line?
Do I smell?
What of?
Blood and gore. I almost scrubbed my skin off but...
Your imagination. That's how you become a real nurse.
Matron, what is Dr. Okabe really like?
He's a fine officer, an excellent surgeon.
You're in charge of surgery this time.
Nurse, can you help me urinate?
In a moment.
Why were both of your arms amputated?
The left one was blown off.
Gangrene set in on the right one, so the doctor...
Thank you.
Which doctor?
Dr. Okabe. He caught the tetanus in time. I survived.
How long have you been here?
Six months. My wounds have healed, but...
You can't return to fighting.
Going home? Have you a wife?
I shipped out two months after we married.
You want to go home, then?
Yes.
But, for some reason, I can't.
I only bother the others here.
Home will be better.
Pvt. Orihara's almost fully recovered.
He hardly feels any pain.
Why wasn't he sent home?
I wonder. But that is not our problem.
We're short of beds as it is.
It's best for him, and for us, that he goes home.
Nishi, that's quite enough!
It's not your place to make those kind of decisions.
Yes, ma'am.
I just feel sorry for him.
Nurses do not have feelings.
It's your duty to keep quiet and do your work.
I've given up.
I don't think I'll ever go home.
Never?
Thanks.
Not that I think that the war will last forever.
Why can't you go home?
A soldier who'd lost both legs was finally sent back.
They kept him hidden.
He can't even see his family.
They'll probably keep him institutionalized forever.
That's my fate, too.
But why?
If people saw me...
...they'd know how terrible war is, and hate it.
Some would think we're losing the war.
The Army brass wouldn't like that at all.
From time to time,
I wish I was dead.
You poor man.
It must be agony.
But I'm used to it now.
The one unbearable thing...
What is it?
It's...
No, never mind.
It's nothing.
Let's wipe you down.
Nurse Nishi, would you mind doing it at night?
Why? I can't show you any special favors.
I don't want the others to see me.
Tonight, after taps.
Please.
Let's do it now.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Nurse Nishi...
Can you come every night from now on?
If you want me to.
Please. I'd like you to.
You nurses...
...take care of our meals and everything.
With never a frown.
It's our duty.
But there's one thing that no one does for me.
Do you follow me?
Nurse Nishi,
I'm a man too.
I'm crippled but
I'm still healthy.
The others all can manage somehow... but I have no hands.
I'm helpless.
It's starting to drive me mad.
Do you understand?
Yes, I learned about that at nursing school.
Nurse Nishi, please save me.
Touch my body.
I beg you.
Have you asked the other nurses such a thing?
No, ma'am I've never asked anyone before.
Only you.
Nurse Nishi, I'm just filth.
I'm a hateful man.
I'm going to die without ever seeing my wife again.
Nurse Nishi, please help me!
Medicine, everything was scarce.
Poor Dr. Okabe could only amputate arms and legs.
However trivial, I decided I'd try to ease his burden...
...in my own way.
Nurse Nishi, am I asking too much?
Not at all.
Thank you.
You're the only one who cared to save me.
You poor, unfortunate man.
Nurse Nishi, please let me kiss you.
Just once is enough.
Sakura
I want to touch your body.
I don't mind, but...
Since I lost my hands...
...my toes have become very sensitive.
I can feel with them just like my hands.
So...
So?
Please.
Let me put my foot between your legs.
Please!
Alright.
I'm glad.
I'm very happy.
Go out for a walk?
Yes, he can manage.
I think it will be good for him.
But all alone?
I'll escort him.
I'm off today.
I see.
All right, then.
We can't do much else for him.
Have him wear a coat...
...so his arms won't be too obvious.
Treat him to something nice.
What is it?
Where are we going?
Let's find a hotel.
Just leave everything to me.
Let's take a bath together.
Together?
I'll wash you.
You can look at me all you want to.
Do anything you like.
Tell me anything you want me to do for you.
Why are you doing this for me?
No particular reason.
I have no arms...
...but I can do things to make up for it.
But this won't happen again.
It's the last time.
Yes.
Probably.
Remember it.
I'll never forget what happened today.
I'm truly very happy.
Nishi, Private Orihara committed suicide.
How?
He has no arms!
He jumped from the roof.
Fractured skull.
He died instantly.
I can't believe it.
This was found under his pillow.
Used his mouth to write it, I guess.
It's to you.
I haven't told anyone else.
Sakura, I'll never meet anyone like you again.
So, there's no point in living.
Thank you and good-bye, Orihara.
Will you inform his family?
He'll be listed as killed in action.
And receive a promotion to
Private First Class.
I believe I killed him.
I tried to help him, but
I tortured him instead.
It does not concern you!
In war it's each for himself or there's no surviving it!
Forget him as soon as you can.
There's too much to forget.
I can never forget.
Pvt. Sakamuto and then Pvt. Orihara.
I killed them both.
A month later...
...we five nurses were transferred back to the front lines.
I'm back again.
Been keeping well, sir?
Again?
It seems you and I are fated.
You've been promoted.
Congratulations.
The more people we kill...
...the more stars they give us.
It's a strange life.
Is there a major battle
Yes, Chang Kai-shek and his allies made an attack.
Our Army is stretched very thin.
They were cut to pieces.
The wounded are arriving in droves.
You have experience.
I'll have you removing bullets.
Can we manage?
We have to!
A handful of Japanese soldiers are pitted against all of China.
It's no easy war.
The wounded will increase...
...we're badly undermanned here.
You'll have to work twice as hard.
If not, good men will die.
Yes, sir!
We will, sir!
The wounded are arriving, sir!
Be right there.
Water!
Give me water!
Be careful!
No dead in here!
The bullet is still in there.
Remove it.
We began operating...
...and did so for two days and two nights.
I, alone, removed 160 bullets.
Can't save him.
He's cut to pieces.
He's lost too much blood.
Do you know why the enemy did this?
No, sir.
He swallowed this.
It's a secret code.
A communications man.
No time to burn it, so he swallowed it.
They cut him open to get it.
While he was still alive?
Yes.
A fine soldier.
You did your duty well.
A hero's death.
He's dead. Sew him up and ship him out.
Shrapnel in the lower back.
I'll have to operate.
Anesthetic.
I've changed my mind.
Close him up.
Next patient.
Why did he stop?
A waste of anesthetic.
Something different about him today.
The third night, after all of the soldiers had been treated.
Nishi?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Yes, sir.
Sit and have a drink.
May I ask a question, sir?
What is it?
Why didn't you operate after the anesthetic?
Officers need not explain to lower ranks.
I'll explain, though you probably won't understand.
Why's that, sir?
You're a woman, but you have no marital experience, right?
What's marriage got to do with it?
He was wounded in the sacrum.
Here.
All the sensitive nerves...
...that govern sex are located there.
If I operated on those damaged nerves...
...what would be the result?
He'd lose his masculinity.
Forever!
It made me think.
If it doesn't fester, he has a chance to live.
If a good doctor operates back home...
...he may leave the nerves intact.
So, I changed my mind.
I see.
I have no confidence in the work I'm doing here.
It's all wrong.
I kill those who'd recover, men better off dead, live as cripples.
But... to men, becoming impotent...
...is worse than being crippled.
I'm tired. Give me a morphine shot.
I want some sleep.
Stay until I fall asleep...
...like you did last time.
Hold me, if you want to.
Yes, if I'll do, sir.
I wouldn't ask anyone else.
Will you stay 'till morning?
Don't worry.
You'll be safe with me.
I won't even touch you.
Why not?
These days, I have no interest in women at all.
We're in different worlds.
I only want to sleep.
But why, sir?
You really want to know?
Yes, I do.
Alright, then.
I'll tell you.
Since I started using morphine...
...I'm not a man any more.
I haven't been for a long time.
You have a wife, don't you?
She died three years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Please stop using morphine.
Why?
I want to be in your arms.
What?
I think I love you.
I want you to touch me.
You love me?
What a strange girl.
You resemble my father.
A substitute, am I?
No! I really love you.
Sorry, I can't give up the morphine.
Why not?
I'm a doctor.
But I can't do anything here.
Without the drugs,
I can't go on living.
It's the same for soldiers.
They kill and pass it off as patriotism. That helps...
There are so many things that I'd like to forget.
Nishi, it's no use talking.
Just give me the shot.
Then get into bed.
Yes, sir.
I missed you.
I really did.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
You swine!
Letting maggots hatch!
What's the matter?
He removed a bandage and let flies settle on it.
Now it's festered!
Why did you do that?
He was afraid of being sent back.
He wants to be sent home!
What if you lose your leg?
It's better than dying!
My wife gave birth after I shipped out.
I've never seen my son!
Dr. Okabe wants to see you immediately.
I'm off to the front lines.
One doctor, two nurses...
...and three medics.
We leave tomorrow morning.
Were you ordered to?
Yes.
It's a tough battle.
Only one doctor there...
He can't cope alone.
It's an emergency.
So, it's goodbye for a while.
Please take me with you.
It's too dangerous.
You could be killed.
No! I don't want to leave you!
Why not?
I love you!
Love?
Do as you like.
But don't expect a life together.
This is war.
We could die any day.
I wonder.
The only way is to regard everyone as strangers.
So stay.
Matron said that too.
But I refuse.
It's an order!
I refuse!
You disobey orders?
I do.
A traitor to Japan.
I'm afraid of one thing more than anything.
That is working and dying apart from you.
Don't worry. I'll be back.
Wait for me.
No, please take me with you.
You're stubborn.
Who else, then?
Nurse Tsuruzaki.
She's new and inexperienced.
I'll take care of her.
Even further from Japan.
It doesn't bother me.
Ever nearer to death.
I don't care.
Are you ready to die?
The cherry blossom has such a short life.
The sooner the better.
Halt!
Is Dr. Okabe here?
Yes. What is it?
Your new orders, sir.
Go ahead.
You're to stay with us until further orders.
We're in your hands.
We'll escort you there, sir.
Good man.
We're here, sir.
Excuse the men, ma'am.
It's their first sight of
Japanese nurses.
They're ecstatic.
Time to head back.
I'm Lt. Ishida, in command of this outpost.
Please be seated.
Our headquarters are fifty kilometers from here.
The enemy has begun a massive attack.
They broke through our lines.
We've been cut off.
I see. So that's why our journey was cut short.
Yes, sir.
The enemy are better equipped and outnumber us.
We're unable to break through.
We're surrounded?
Yes, they've attacked twice.
A mobile squad helped fight them off.
Just one platoon here?
Yes, equipped with four light machine guns.
That's all we have.
Any civilian Chinese?
A handful of children and the elderly.
Doctor!
A 'comfort woman' has diarrhea.
I suspect cholera.
Please examine her.
Attention!
It's cholera all right.
She's badly dehydrated.
Quarantine her and give warm water for 48 hours.
She may pull through.
How many comfort women here?
Two more, sir.
They may have it, too.
Isolate them.
Disinfect this hut thoroughly.
It's off limits to the men!
Cholera?
That's one more enemy.
Is there nothing we can do?
No drug beats cholera.
Just isolation and disinfection.
Ideally, raze the village and withdraw.
That's impossible.
This is a strategic point.
We're ordered to...
...hold it at any cost.
In any case, the cholera must be contained.
Otherwise we all die.
Issue the men an acid gargle before meals.
The soldiers want the women who aren't sick.
Here they are.
Back to your cribs.
No! They're in quarantine.
How about you, then?
Much more fun!
Stop it! Nurses aren't comfort women!
You're hungry, aren't you?
Hungry for a man!
I'll pleasure you.
You animal.
This is the front. We either kill men, screw women...
...or eat rations. That's all!
We get what we can while we're still alive.
You idiots!
You want to die of cholera?
Get out!
You doctors get your pick of nurses. We don't!
Twelve men and two comfort women are infected now.
That's seven dead.
How does it look?
There will be more.
The problem is that we lost half of our fighting strength.
If they attack, we'll be wiped out.
Sir, all of the remaining
Chinese civilians have slipped away.
Afraid of the cholera?
No doubt some spies too.
Spies?
They must have introduced the cholera virus.
They fed something to her.
So the enemy knows out exact disposition?
Yes. Expect an attack any time.
Contact HQ.
Ask for reinforcements.
We can't, sir.
Our radio gear is down.
Send a courier.
To certain death?
We're surrounded.
No one could through alive.
We're expecting a truck tomorrow morning.
We'll just have to wait.
What's the matter, sir?
I've caught it.
Sergeant, a signal!
That's bad.
They'll attack tonight.
The doctor's asking for you.
Go at once.
Take a break, nurse.
You've worked all night.
We'll take over.
Nurse Tsuruzaki.
Nishi?
Yes, sir.
Enter.
Nurse Nishi reporting for duty, sir.
What's the latest count?
Four new cases, sir.
If I catch it,
I'll give it to you.
Same thing if you get it.
Why did you summon me, sir?
It's time for my shot.
I refuse.
But I need it.
Nishi, that's an order!
Morphine is only for the most critical of patients.
I'm starting to suffer from withdrawal symptoms.
Soon the fits will come.
I don't want the others to see me half-crazed.
Please.
Go get the morphine!
If you don't quit now, it will effect your brain.
Your heart will weaken, and you'll die.
I'm better off dead.
It's also the drugs that are keeping us apart.
Please give it up.
What would I gain?
You'd gain me.
You're a woman.
Yes, the woman who loves you.
How do I quit?
Please do as I say...
...as if I were a superior officer.
You're ordering me to quit?
I'll tie you up and do what I have to do.
Tie me up?
Yes.
We're caught between cholera and the enemy.
This could be our last night.
Be my superior officer tonight.
Do what you must.
But don't let anyone in.
The Captain is down with cholera.
I'll take over the command.
I expect an attack tonight.
Man your positions!
Just tonight...
They'll attack tonight.
The truck comes tomorrow.
We must not surrender the village!
Nurse Nishi...
Nishi.
You had it tough...
I'm over it now.
Untie me.
How long was I thrashing?
Five hours.
Two more have got it!
Please love me as a woman.
Please love me.
I can't.
I want to be a real woman.
Not just a doll.
Make love to me.
I can't.
I'm not a man any more.
No! That's all in your mind.
Without the morphine, you can.
Nishi, touch me.
That's what I am.
Do you understand now?
I can't love you.
No, you're all right.
Hold me close, as tight as you can.
It's no use.
Don't give up.
You can do it.
No. I'll never return to my old self.
You can.
I know you can.
It's Oh-One Hundred Hours.
Not long until dawn.
Hold out till then!
Their small arms don't frighten me.
But, if they bring in mortars, we're all dead.
I can hardly believe it,
Nishi.
Nurse Nishi has won.
I'm myself again.
It's like a miracle.
Please say that you love your
Sakura cherry blossom.
You want me to say that I love you?
I want you all to myself.
You already have.
Your heart, too.
Not in wartime, no.
There's only fleeting pleasure.
Not for me.
I don't want to be a passing fancy.
I want to be your true lover.
I have no heart to offer you now.
Then I'll look for it.
It's Oh-Two Hundred Hours, already.
Another three hours and we'll be safe.
They like to attack at dawn!
Be alert!
Sakura.
I love you. Now I can say it truthfully.
I'll never let you go.
Tonight we reached our greatest ecstasy.
Though by tomorrow, we may be dead.
You don't mind that?
This is all that's important to me now.
Get me the wine.
It's my last bottle.
Let's drink a toast.
I didn't know that military women were so sweet.
Military women?
I mean you nurses.
Put on my uniform.
Becoming?
Yes, wonderful.
A fine officer!
The boots.
Would they salute me if I went out?
First, they'd laugh.
The sword and gun.
I'm afraid not.
Dr. Okabe, pour wine for your superior.
Here, Major.
Sergeant!
What is it?
The enemy!
I prefer being a woman.
Then let me give you some pleasure.
I can hear your heart thumping.
It's the wine.
Nishi.
I wish we'd met in
Japan in peacetime.
They're attacking.
The enemy.
There's no escape.
Will you die with me?
Yes!
By your side.
I'm 40 years old.
A long life, yet short too.
I guess this is the end.
I can die happy.
Because I love you.
Your mark, Sakura?
I'll give you one.
Where?
The same place as yours.
Thanks to you,
I can die like a soldier.
Don't cry for me.
Enemy attack, sir!
Follow me!
Stay here!
Head down!
Hold your fire!
It's still too dark.
Don't waste ammo!
Wait 'till they're close.
What's the situation?
We're surrounded, sir.
They're using mortars to soften us up.
Before they attack.
It doesn't look good.
But it's an hour 'till dawn.
There's a slim chance!
Good!
We're soldiers, too!
Orderlies and nurses will fight!
Fire!
Give 'em all you've got!
Pull yourself together, nurse!
Protect your patients!
Here they come!
Dig in!
Sergeant’s dead, sir!
I'll take command.
Fight! Fire at least one shot before you die!
I'm scared!
You'll fight!
I'm too scared!
Come back!
Go get her!
She's gone crazy!
No, that'd be suicide.
I've killed yet again.
She's my third victim.
Nogami!
Somehow, I survived.
Not even a scratch.
Anybody still alive?
Halt!
Who goes there?
Army nurse!
We're reinforcements.
We routed them. You're safe now.
Stay back!
We have a cholera epidemic.
Cholera!
Send medical personnel immediately.
Any other survivors?
I don't know.
The cholera and the fighting took most of them.
I understand.
Wait here.
Nurse Tsuruzaki!
Forgive me.
This is how I will end up, too.
The bodies were stripped of their clothing.
Weapons, clothing, boots...
They took everything that they could possibly use.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Dr. Okabe!
The End.
The Secretary of State for War has today received the following dispatch from Lord Chelmsford,
Commander in Chief of Her Majesty's forces in Natal colony, South Africa.
"I regret to report a very disastrous engagement
"which took place on the morning of the 22nd January
"between the armies of the Zulu king Cetshwayo
"and our own Number 3 Column, consisting of Five Companies
"of the 1 st Battalion,
24th Regiment of Foot,
"and one company of the 2nd Battalion,
"a total of nearly 1,500 men, officers and other ranks.
"The Zulus, in overwhelming numbers, launched a highly disciplined attack
"on the slopes of the mountain of Isandhlwana,
"and in spite of gallant resistance..."
What did he ask, Father?
Whether a man of God like myself was pleased to see so many warriors married to so many maidens at one time.
How can he imagine it would please anyone?
Do you think I said it pleased me, daughter?
I told him I was unhappy to see so many brides who may soon become widows.
That was a very good answer, Father.
Why do they have those little spears?
The girls, I mean?
It's a symbol of their chastity, daughter.
It's splendid, I know, but it's quite horrible too, isn't it?
The Book says, "What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
- "A man clothed in soft raiment?"
- Yes, Father.
You must understand these things if you're going to stay in Africa,
Margareta.
That's why I brought you here.
They are a great people, daughter.
But how can they let themselves be married in droves like this?
Young girls to old men.
In Europe, young women accept arranged marriages with rich men.
Perhaps the Zulu girls are luckier getting a brave man.
Margareta.
Wait.
- All right.
- Father!
Wait. Wait, Margareta.
- Dear Lord in Heaven!
- What is it? Father?
One thousand British soldiers have been massacred.
While I stood here talking peace, a war has started.
Ishiwan! Ishiwan!
Ishiwan? Didn't you say that Ishiwan...
Yes. It's their name for our mission station at Rorke's Drift.
- They're going to destroy it.
- Why?
Because there are British soldiers at Rorke's Drift.
- But it's only a handful.
- Come.
- It is a hospital. Father, tell him.
- Do you think he will listen?
We must get there.
There'll be a massacre.
Father! Father!
- All right, Corporal Allen.
- Sir. Corp? Let go.
Right turn.
Quick march.
Colour Sergeant Bourne, what's that shooting?
A rifle, Hughes.
If you're sick in hospital,
I suggest you go and lie down.
Yes, Colour Sergeant.
Hey, Hookie, who's doing all that shooting?
- Who do you think?
- Who do you think?
Mr Flaming Bromhead is shooting flaming defenceless animals for the flaming officers' flaming dinner.
I wish he'd bring us some fresh meat.
I wonder what they're cooking for supper.
Same as usual.
Horse meat and axle grease.
Which one has got the bullet?
She was as beautiful as a butterfly.
She was as beautiful as a buttertly and as proud as a queen
Was pretty little Polly Perkins of Paddington Green
Shut up, you cripple!
She was as beautiful as a buttertly and as...
Come on, make your mind up.
It's turning blue.
Yeah, yeah, very pretty, lovely.
Which one?
It's under that one.
The boy's clever. The boy's good.
How about putting some money on?
Five rounds!
Independent! Fire!
Stuff me with green apples.
You know, if a dog was as sick as him, they'd shoot him.
Five rounds! Independent!
Fire!
Shut up, you rotten, sick...
Why don't you leave him alone?
He's sick enough. You'll kill him!
Wouldn't bother Hookie, would it, Hookie?
Wouldn't bother, Hookie, it wouldn't matter if Maxfield was dead.
I don't care if you were all dead. Blimey!
Rorke's Drift.
It'd take an Irishman to give his name to a rotten, stinking middle-of-nowhere hole like this.
Hold that pont!
- Corporal Allen?
- Sir?
- Get some men in the water!
- Sir.
Hey!
You heard that Officer of Engineers.
Get it.
Heave! Put a bit more weight on that rope, you men.
- He's even got a voice like a corporal.
- Yeah.
Sort of like a female hippopotamus in labour.
- Hot work?
- Damned hot work.
Still, the river cools you off a bit, though?
- Who are you?
- John Chard. Royal Engineers.
Bromhead. 24th.
That's my post, up there.
You've come down from the column?
That's right.
They want a bridge across the river.
Who said you could use my men?
They were sitting around on their backsides doing nothing.
Rather you asked first, old boy.
I was told their officer was out hunting.
Yes.
I'll tell my man to clean your kit.
- Don't bother.
- No bother.
I'm not offering to clean it myself.
Still, a chap ought to look smart in front of the men.
Don't you think?
Well, chin-chin.
Do carry on with your mud pies.
You.
- What's your name?
- Owen.
Sir.
- Are you supposed to be here?
- Yes, sir.
Well, not exactly. You see, sir, only, you've got my solo tenor out there.
- I've got your what?
- 612 Williams, sir.
We were going to practise this afternoon with the company choir.
But you've got my only solo tenor working out there in the cold water.
Well, I hope he sings better than he works.
Oh, indeed, sir. He does.
Every piece of wood in this blistering country's eaten by ants.
The heat and the dust, sir.
Very nasty on the larynx.
Mr Bromhead lets you have a choir, does he?
Well, every Welsh regiment has a choir, sir.
Mr Bromhead is English, but he is a proper gentleman.
There's no doubt of that.
- And what do you sing?
- Me, sir? Baritone, sir.
Good.
I can find work for baritones as well as tenors.
See what you make of that, over there, below the escarpment.
- Two riders.
- Gallopers from the column, sir?
Very wonderful things, these, sir, aren't they?
- Corporal Allen?
- Sir?
- Get your party ashore at the double.
- Sir.
All right, you heard that Officer of Engineers.
Make fast and back to the bank. Move.
Come on, lad. Hop on it.
- Trouble, sir?
- Could be.
I can anchor the ponts midstream, sir.
With six riflemen I could...
This is a situation you think an Engineer
Officer can't handle, Corporal?
- No, sir. Beg your pardon, sir.
- Fall them in.
We ain't finished the bridge, sir.
- Fall them in, Corporal.
- Sir.
Get fell in, you men. Squad.
Squad, 'shun.
Left turn.
Left wheel. By the left. Quick march.
Left, left.
Left, left, left, right, left. Left, left.
Hey! Hey, you!
What's going on down there?
They're building barricades or something.
What's that?
Ride like hell.
Tell them they can't get here too soon.
- Corporal.
- Sir.
I want all these people out of here.
Douse these cooking fires and turn the boilers over.
- But they've got soup in them, sir.
- Pour it on the fires.
- And get yourself a rifle.
- A rifle, sir? But I don't...
Mr Chard? Mr Chard?
- Commissary Dalton, is it?
- That is correct.
But Mr Chard, you've just asked this man...
To pour the soup on the fires.
See that he does it.
All these bags of maize inside the perimeter.
And I don't want these tents providing cover for the enemy.
Does he know what it's like to make soup for 100 men in this flaming heat, Mr Dalton, does he, sir?
Oh, now, don't distress yourself, my dear fellow.
There's your own officer over there.
- You go and speak with him.
- Yes, sir.
Chard?
This is Adendorff, Natal Native
Contingent from Isandhlwana.
Bromhead, 24th Foot.
You've come from there?
All right, man, is it true?
Beg your pardon, sir.
About the soup, sir.
- What about the soup?
- Well, this gentleman, sir, said to put it on the fire.
He did?
We have thatched roofs here,
Bromhead.
No need to make the Zulus a present of fire.
Yes.
Then get on with it.
- There's a good fellow.
- Well, am I to take a rifle, too, sir?
The entire column.
- It's damned impossible. 800 men?
- 1,200 men.
There were 400 native levies also.
Damn the levies, man.
More cowardly blacks.
What the hell do you mean, cowardly blacks?
They died on your side, didn't they?
And who the hell do you think is coming to wipe out your little command, the Grenadier Guards?
What the deuce is the matter with him?
- Adendorff? Are you staying?
- Is there anywhere else to go?
Talk to our levies, will you?
Tell them whose side they're on.
Did the runner bring orders?
He brought orders to the commander of this post.
- To do what?
- To hold our ground.
To hold our ground?
What military genius thought up that one?
Somebody's son and heir who got a commission before he learnt to shave?
I rather fancy that he's nobody's son and heir now.
- Who are they?
- The Witts.
- Witts?
- The Swedish missionaries here.
This is their station.
They've chosen a damned odd time for a prayer meeting.
I think you better get them out of here.
Are you giving me an order, old boy?
Bromhead?
Let's get one thing clear.
I'm no line officer. I'm an engineer.
- I came here to build a bridge.
- Jolly lucky for you.
I mean, otherwise, you would've been chopped with the rest of the column, wouldn't you?
All right.
What's the date of your commission?
Now don't tell me.
I suppose you have seniority.
1872. May.
1872. February.
Oh, well. I suppose there are such things as gifted amateurs. If I may...
Are you questioning my right to command?
Oh, not your right, old boy. Never mind.
We can cooperate, as they say.
- I'll be here, won't I?
- Bromhead?
Have you been here long enough to put a lookout on that hill?
Not since we've been chatting, no.
I've started the barricades, though.
I managed to think of that.
Who's the sergeant with the muscles?
Sgt Windridge. Good man.
Not you again?
Yes, sir, Surgeon Reynolds.
It's me arm, sir.
The only trouble with your arm is you never do any work with it.
Pretty terrible pain, sir.
All right. Off with your vest.
- Now, sir?
- Now, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's cruel to bend, sir.
You know what you've got there, my malingering Hector?
No, sir. Hook's the name, sir.
You've got a fine, handsome boil, my friend.
There's one glistening boil for every soldier in Africa.
You may not win many medals on this campaign, Hook, but you'll certainly get more boils.
For every gunshot wound I probe,
I expect to lance three boils.
Spot of medicinal brandy would set me up, sir.
Brandy's for heroes, Mr Hook.
The rest of you will make do with boils in your skin, flies in your meat and dysentery in your bellies.
Now, then, this is going to hurt you a lot more than it will me,
I'm happy to say.
Mr Bromhead? Cetshwayo is coming with two impis to destroy you.
You must talk to Lt Chard, Mr Witt.
He commands here. Margareta.
Mr Chard, I am ready to take away your sick and wounded.
Please supply the wagons. Daughter, tell the men in the hospital to get ready.
One moment, Miss Margareta. Mr Witt?
I don't suppose you hold the Queen's Commission?
I am a man of peace, sir.
Then allow a Queen's officer to give orders to her soldiers.
Now, how do you know what Cetshwayo is doing?
We have just come from his kraal, sir.
He's a member of my parish.
Your parish? Are you sure you're on the right side of the river, Mr Witt?
I am here to do my duty.
I expect your cooperation.
What's our strength?
Seven officers, including surgeon, commissaries and so on.
Oh, and Adendorff now, I suppose.
Wounded and sick, 36.
Fit for duty, 97.
And about 40 native levies.
Not much of an army for you.
There are 4,000 Zulus coming against you.
You must abandon this mission.
Mr Chard?
Adendorff sent his trooper to Helpmekaar.
There's a relief column there, isn't there? A cavalry?
There was three days ago.
Mr Bromhead, issue all our walking wounded with arms and ammunition.
You will all be killed like those this morning.
And now the sick in their beds.
All of you.
I don't think so, Mr Witt.
The army doesn't like more than one disaster in a day.
It looks bad in the newspapers and upsets civilians at their breakfast.
Sir, the Book says,
"There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of a host,
"neither is any man..."
Mr Witt?
When I have the impertinence to climb into your pulpit and deliver a sermon, then you may tell me my duty.
It is not your duty to sacrifice the sick.
Are you a student of tactics too,
Miss Witt?
Are you a Christian?
Sgt Windridge?
It is your duty to let us take those men away.
Not that way, Miss Witt.
- Sir.
- Come, daughter.
Sergeant, put two good men on that hill and tell them to keep their eyes peeled.
- Mr Bromhead, sir?
- Double up, damn it!
Carry on, Sgt Windridge, there's a good fellow.
Sir.
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Sir.
Mr Bromhead?
You know, I had a calf like you once, back home in Merioneth.
I'll get you some milk.
I'll make you strong.
Would you like that, then?
What the hell do you think you're doing at a time like this? Shut up!
Owen!
Yes, Sergeant?
- You've got a voice, haven't you?
- Yes, baritone, Sergeant.
Well, get up on that hill and sing out if you see anything.
You, too.
And take your bandook, you dozy Welshman!
The classical attack of the Zulus is in the shape of a bull buffelo like this.
The head, the horns and the loins.
First, the head moves forward and the enemy naturally moves in to meet it, but it's only a feint.
The warriors in the head then disperse to form the encircling horns and the enemy is drawn in on the loins.
And the horns close in on the back and sides.
Finish.
It looks jolly simple, doesn't it?
Though it's jolly deadly, old boy.
Well done, Adendorff.
We'll make an Englishman of you yet.
No, thanks. I'm a Boer.
The Zulus are the enemies of my blood.
What are you doing here?
You don't object to our help, I hope?
It all depends what you damned English want for it afterwards.
All right. Hospital. Church.
Cattle kraal. Stables.
An outside perimeter joining the buildings here and here.
Now, we don't move out to meet the feint of the buffelo head.
We hold the outside perimeter.
If and when that collapses, we move back into this area here.
How high can you build a wall there,
Bromhead?
Well, it should be about shoulder high.
But if the fuzzies moved out of Isandhlwana immediately, they could be here, well, now.
It's just a matter of time.
Now, we'll have to make the time.
You mean your only plan is to stand behind a few feet of mealie bags, and wait for the attack?
That's right. We wait.
If 1,200 men couldn't hold a defensive position this morning, what chance have we with 100?
Listen, old boy,
I'll take the company up into the hills.
I know exactly how to disperse them.
Ambush, you see?
We cut them down in the passes.
Bromhead?
I want that line of boxes across here, from the cattle kraal to the outside perimeter.
And if they get over this, redoubt.
And a final redoubt here.
That, put it in the middle.
What are you doing in here?
This is a church!
Don't you realise, this is an altar table?
I'm sorry. There's nothing larger.
We need it now.
And there's no chloroform.
Go to the hospital.
Tell the sick to be ready to leave.
I want water, cold water, lots of it, a probe, a saw, some nitric acid.
Don't take it too badly, Mr Witt.
Isn't this as good a place as any for a man to be when he's in pain?
Excuse me, sir.
Tuck your heads in afore they fall off.
Sorry, sir. I have orders to get some of these bags outside.
All right, get on with it.
I was praying that your officer may turn to God's word.
That's right, sir. A prayer's as good as a bayonet on a day like this.
- Have you prayed?
- There'll be a time for it, sir.
What will you say?
Pick it up.
Bit of the Psalms, I suppose, sir.
My father was a lay preacher.
A great one for the Psalms, he was.
There was one that might have been written for a soldier.
Say it, man. Lift your voice to God.
- Now, sir?
- Yes. Let them hear your voice.
They know my voice when they hear it, sir.
Let them hear it now in praise of the Lord.
Call upon him.
Call upon him, man, for your salvation.
Well, as far as I can remember, sir, it goes something like this.
"He maketh wars to cease in all the world,
"he breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder."
Do you know it, sir?
"I shall be exalted among the heathen,
"I shall be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us."
That's it, sir.
All right.
Nobody told you to stop working.
You lead-backsided. Get sweating.
I've been sitting there thinking.
I've got it all sorted out.
Company!
What are you doing here, Miss?
He doesn't need any help.
I'll look after him.
Won't I?
You are all to be evacuated soon in the wagons.
- Who says?
- My father.
That's nice, isn't it? Your father.
You and me, Hookie.
Mr Chard's orders. In this room.
Here we are.
Hey, what are you talking about?
I'm sick. I'm excused duty.
What are you doing?
I'm making a loophole, see?
Me and Hookie's gonna fight in here.
Aren't we, Hookie?
You're joking! I'm sick.
Nobody's got any right to ask me to muck around in a flaming battle.
I'm getting out.
- Private Hook!
- Yes?
Yes, Sergeant.
I know you, Hook.
Yeah, you ought to.
You're no good, Hook.
They gave us you because you are no good to anyone except the Queen and Sgt Maxfield.
Thank you very much, the both of you.
Take this rifle, Hook, and get to it!
I'll make a soldier of you yet.
And what for? Did I ever see a Zulu walk down the City Road? No!
So what am I doing here?
- You are here because you were a thief.
- Yeah.
- And you still are one...
- Certainly.
...Hook, my lad.
And now, you can be a soldier, like what they pay you for.
Look, you got me 28 days' field punishment in Brecon.
Isn't that enough?
Pick up the bayonet and help Williams.
And put your tunic on!
28 days' field punishment. No pay.
You know what he did?
Sent money to my missus.
What did you do that for?
You hate him for it?
What do you want me to do?
Cry me heart out?
Give him a big kiss?
I thought you might pray for him.
Oh, she's a dry one. Very cool.
You know what she needs.
Play your cards right, and it could be you.
Can I help anyone?
There will be wagons soon to take you away.
He's dying. There's nothing you can do.
Nothing?
There must be.
- 'Shun!
- Now pay attention.
Is there any walking sick without rifles?
Me.
You, Dutchy?
You couldn't walk to the latrine.
This is not my first action. Come on.
Are you expecting sick men to fight?
What's he going to do, 593?
Oh, I think he wants to be a hero, 716.
Haven't you red necks got names instead of numbers?
This is a Welsh regiment, man.
Though there are some foreigners from England in it, mind.
I am Jones from Bwlchgwyn.
He is Jones from Builth Wells.
There are four more Joneses in C Company.
Confusing, isn't it, Dutchy?
What's your name, then?
It's Schiess. And I'm not Dutch.
I'm Swiss.
Well, there's a silly man, by damn.
He's got himself into a private war.
I belong to Natal Mounted Police.
Is that true, then? He's a peeler, 716.
Come to arrest the Zulus.
What do you know about Zulus?
Bunch of savages, isn't it?
All right, how far can you red necks march in a day?
Oh, 15, 20 miles, is it?
A Zulu regiment can run, run, 50 miles and fight a battle at the end of it.
Well, there's daft, it is then.
I don't see no sense in running to fight a battle.
What are you doing here in such a time like this? Why don't you go?
No. Not until you have gone.
You know Cetshwayo has a regiment of young girls, warriors, called Ripen At Noon.
There's pretty.
Hey, come on. Come on. Here.
Here! Here! Give us... Come on.
Come on. Just a little kiss?
Hey! Yeah! Come on!
Hey. Hey, boys! Take a look at this.
- What is it, boyo?
- Flaming dust. What else?
No, by damn, it's horses!
The cavalry!
Yeah. It's a relief column, you long-range sniper, you.
Colour Sergeant?
Sir?
Stephenson, Durnford's Horse.
- Thank God you're here.
- I'm surprised you're still here.
You know there are 4,000 Zulus coming this way?
We know. Can you throw out your men in a screen to the south of here?
You know how the Zulus feel about cavalry.
I know how my men feel about Zulus.
We've only just got through them.
- Stephenson.
- Bromhead. What price, this?
I know your whole regiment's gone.
Bromhead? You know this man.
Tell him we need him.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look at my men.
Stand fast. Stand fast, all of you!
Where the hell are they going?
Get them back here!
- Let go of my bridle!
- Get them back here!
If they're going to die, they'll die on their own farms.
You're the professionals.
You fight here if you want to.
We need you! Don't go! Don't go! Stay!
We need you, damn you! We need you!
You didn't say a single word to help, Bromhead.
Oh, when you take command, old boy, you're on your own.
The first lesson the General, my grandfather, ever taught me.
All right, then.
Nobody told you to stop working.
Brothers! Oh, brothers!
The way of the Lord has been shown to us.
"Thou shalt not kill," saith the Lord.
Brothers! Oh, brothers!
God's love is peace.
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Go in peace!
Stay not to kill and be killed. Go, I say.
The sin of Cain will be upon you.
"Am I my brother's keeper?" asked Cain.
Yea, we are all our brother's keeper.
"The nations are but a drop of a bucket,
"and are counted as the small dust of the balance."
Bring him along.
Mr Witt, I'm getting you off this post.
Sir, they've all hopped it. All of them.
Give me those wagons and I will save the sick.
You want the wagons?
Mr Bourne? Windridge?
Get those wagons in.
Sir.
God loves a sinner come to his understanding.
Hey, we're in luck.
Hey, looks like the old parson got Chard to let us go.
Heave!
Right, lads. Heave.
Heave.
Oh, Lord, God, give me strength!
Oh, God! God forgive me.
I have the strength of thousands while the spirit of God is with me.
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Sir.
Oh, God, forgive me.
Get him away from here.
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!
Miss Witt!
Animals! All of you! Animals!
- Sgt Woodridge.
- Sir!
We shall not go. If you send us away, we shall come back.
Lock him up. Lock him in the storeroom.
- Put a man on the door.
- Sir.
All right, you men, get back to work.
And you.
Put Miss Witt in the church with Surgeon Reynolds.
Sir.
It was sad, you know. And sick.
Had a battle coming, see?
Animals are very sensitive to noise, you know.
Why worry about a calf?
I thought I was tired of farming.
No adventure in it.
But when you look at it, this country's not a bit as good as Bala and the lake there.
Not really green, like.
And the soil.
There's no moisture in it.
Nothing to hold a man in his grave.
Chard? One of my men, Hook.
- Do you know him?
- No.
In the hospital, malingering, under arrest.
He's a thief, a coward and an insubordinate barrack-room lawyer.
- And you've given him a rifle.
- What?
In Queen's regulations, it specifically states...
Damn funny.
Like a... Like a train in the distance.
You were saying about Hook?
Mr Bromhead, sir? Sentries come in from the hill. They say...
- Colour Sergeant?
- Sir.
- You have something to report?
- Sir?
Then tell me.
Very good, sir.
The sentries report Zulus to the southwest, thousands of them.
All right, Colour Sergeant, stand to.
Stand to!
Look to your front. Mark the orders.
Mark the target when it comes.
Look to your front.
Mark your target when it comes.
Look to your front.
Look to your front.
Mark your target when it comes.
Mark your target. Look to your front.
- Hitch, do your tunic up.
- My tunic?
Do it up.
Where do you think you are, man?
Look to your front.
Mark your target when it comes.
To your front.
- Mark your target when it comes.
- Look to your front.
Mark the orders.
Mark your target when it comes.
- Look to your front.
- Mark your target when it comes.
Boy? You hear me, boy?
Will you be Cain and kill your brother?
"Thou shalt not kill," saith the Lord.
You believe in the Lord's word, don't you?
Obey the word, boy. Obey the Lord.
Go to the others.
Boy, go to the others.
He's...
- Mr Witt says...
- Never mind him, boy.
Now, you get along back to the ramparts with your mates.
Yes, sir.
Mr Witt, sir? Be quiet now, will you?
There's a good gentleman.
You'll upset the lads.
- You know my father was at Waterloo.
- He was?
He got his colonelcy after that.
Did he?
And my great-grandfather, he was the Johnny who knelt beside Wolfe at Quebec.
Did they make him a colonel too?
No, you don't see what I'm driving at.
You're telling me you're the professional, I'm the amateur.
No. What I mean is...
I mean, I wish right now,
I were a damned ranker, like Hook or Hitch.
You're not, are you?
You're an officer and a gentleman.
Listen.
That damned train again.
"He breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder!"
"I will be exalted among the heathen.
"I will be exalted in the earth.
"The Lord of hosts is with us."
I hope so. As I live and die, I hope so.
Company will fix bayonets!
Fix!
Bayonets!
Attention!
You slovenly soldier, Hitch.
Load!
North rampart, stand fast!
South rampart at 100 yards!
Volley fire!
Present!
Fire!
Reload!
Fire!
Reload!
Independent, fire at will!
That's very nice of him.
They're just standing there asking for it.
Keep firing, soldier.
Mark your targets before you fire.
Adendorff, what's wrong with them?
- Why don't they fight?
- They're counting your guns.
What?
Can't you see that old boy up on the hill?
He's counting your guns.
Testing your firing power with the lives of his warriors.
Cease firing!
- Well?
- They'll be back.
Stand fast!
Sixty. We dropped at least 60, wouldn't you say?
That leaves only 3,940.
"Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
"Behold, thou art fair, my love!"
How long?
Ten, 15 minutes. Maybe less.
As soon as they've regrouped.
"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,
"and thy speech is comely."
He can't be!
He is. Drunk as a Lord.
- Fifteen minutes.
- If we're lucky.
Colour Sergeant Bourne?
"Many waters cannot quench love,
"neither can the floods drown it."
Yes, sir, the gentleman has a bottle.
Then get him out of here.
Put him on his cart.
Tie him on if necessary.
The sooner we get rid of them the better.
Sir.
Chard. They won't stand a chance with the Zulus.
They're Witt's parishioners, aren't they?
But the woman, do you want to see her killed?
Do you, Bromhead?
Because you will if we don't get them out of here.
Come along, sir.
There's a good gentleman.
All right, pick him up.
"I have sinned against heaven, and before thee."
Oh, no!
Father!
"Peace be within thy walls..."
Father!
Keep driving with the sun at your back.
You should make it safely.
Sergeant!
- Father!
- Leave me alone!
Try to understand him, Miss Witt.
Death awaits you!
You have made a covenant with death and with hell you are in agreement!
You're all going to die!
Don't you realise?
Can't you see?
You're all going to die!
Die!
- Death awaits you all!
- He's right.
Die!
Why is it us?
- Die!
- Why us?
Because we're here, lad, and nobody else.
Just us.
Colour Sergeant.
Right, now get back to your posts.
At the double.
Here they come again!
Volley!
Fire!
- I can't see a bloody one now.
- They've gone to ground.
Reload!
There they go!
Eyes front. Look to the front!
What the devil's going on?
Well, tell me what's happening.
I've got to know.
They're on both sides!
We haven't enough men at the north wall.
Can't you take some from the south?
How will we hold that if we do?
Damn it, Adendorff, you're supposed to know.
Are they going to hit us everywhere at once?
I told you, remember.
The horns of the buffelo.
The south could have been a feint.
We can't man the whole perimeter.
We've got to outgun them somewhere.
Right?
All right, Bromhead, take men from the south, one section in three.
Reinforce the north wall.
But if they do come from the south again?
Get on with it, Mr Bromhead.
At the double.
Colour Sergeant Bourne,
I want every other man from sections one, three and five over at the north wall.
Come on, then, at the double.
First two.
Follow me.
Where would you like me?
You pick your own ground.
It's your country, isn't it?
Hey, who left the door open?
Blazes!
Where the deuce did they get those?
I'd say, off the bodies of your regiment at Isandhlwana.
Now, that's a bitter pill, our own damn rifles!
Keep your heads down.
- Corporal Allen!
- Sir.
- This is your section now.
- Sir.
Well, see, if you can keep the heads of those marksmen down.
Can't see none of them, sir.
You should know, Corporal Allen, fire at the smoke.
- Keep them pinned down, not us.
- Sir.
Fire at the smoke.
Mr Bromhead!
- Not the best of shots, are they?
- Get a platoon together.
I'll need more than one, old boy, if I'm going up there after them.
You're not going up there after them.
Get a platoon of good bayonet men.
Take them head on at anything that breaks through where our lines weaken.
- It's still a holding action, is it?
- That's right.
Your job is to plug the gaps from the inside.
- And get yourself a good sergeant.
- Yes, sir!
Hitch! Get down from there!
How can I shoot them if I can't see them?
- Hitch!
- My leg! Corp!
Corp?
Can I undo my tunic buttons now, can I, Corp?
Stretcher bearers!
Come on, attack, damn you!
Here they come!
North wall, volley fire! Present!
At 100 yards!
Fire!
Reload!
Independent, fire at will!
- Bromhead!
- Follow me!
Bromhead!
Mr Chard, I'll get you help.
Keep our squad on the wall, Sergeant.
Chard! Are you all right?
Take command.
Corporal!
You're the professional.
- Take command.
- Lance Corporal!
Now, listen, old boy, you're not badly hurt.
We need you!
Damn you, we need you. Understand?
Get him to Surgeon Reynolds.
Take command. You want it, don't you?
- Sergeant Windridge!
- Sir!
Scalpel.
Orderly, damn it!
Will you keep the flies away!
Fan it!
Damn you, Chard!
Damn all you butchers!
Why? Why?
Why?
- Why?
- It's all right, boy, you sleep.
I'm damned if I can tell you why.
You know this boy?
Name of Cole, sir.
He was a paperhanger.
He's a dead paperhanger now.
Orderlies!
Are you all right?
There they go, boys. After them!
Stand fast! They're retiring, sir.
North wall, hold your fire.
Down!
What is it now? Another blasted trick?
They're forming up on the south plain again, sir.
I knew it! I knew it! They're going to attack both walls at once.
I doubt it, not unless they have no other choice anyhow.
It could mean the old general couldn't use his rifles on the hill side for fear of hitting down to his own men.
This way, he keeps probing for weaknesses on the one wall while he keeps the other one pinned down.
Oh, yes.
They're on the move, sir!
North wall, keep those riflemen on the hill side pinned down.
South wall, volley fire!
Present!
Fire!
Reload!
- Hookie, come on, boy, do something!
- I'm excused duty.
- Well, I haven't excused you, have I?
- You want some help.
Well, why didn't you say so?
This rifle! Honestly, I can't manage it.
Now, now, you heard what the officer said. Come on.
But if it really came down to it, sir,
I couldn't really shoot anyone.
Careful! Pop that chap, somebody!
Good fellow. Good fellow. You see?
Sir!
Sir.
Now, you're doing fine.
Where...
You want to rest here a bit?
Watch it!
Can you move your leg?
- If you want me to dance.
- I want you to crawl.
Come on, you slovenly soldier, we've got work to do.
It's all right, sir, we'll do that for you.
I'm all right.
You better get along to the surgeon, sir.
I'll try to get someone to help you, sir.
I can manage.
Here.
Hold them! Hold them!
Hey, Noel, Tommy, look!
Oh, my God!
Bromhead, reorganise your flying platoon with Sgt Windridge.
But I... Yes, sir, of course.
Sir.
- Well done, Corporal. Stand by.
- Sir.
Colour Sergeant Bourne!
Sir? Are you all right, sir?
Thank you, Mr Bourne.
The men on the church roof, have them support your fire against the hillside.
- Corporal?
- Sir.
Section on the roof, bring your rifles about on the hillside.
Fire at the smoke.
- The men on the hospital loopholes...
- Sir.
...they've nothing to fire at.
Bring them to the front windows to support the north wall.
Sir.
Colour Sergeant?
- Sir.
- I want half your men now.
An even number, sir?
- Form two lines on the double.
- Sir!
Company!
Fall back! Clear the line of fire!
Front rank! Fire!
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!
Rear rank!
Fire! Advance!
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!
Rear rank!
Fire! Advance!
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!
Rear rank!
Fire! Advance!
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!
Rear rank!
Fire! Advance!
Independent, fire at will!
Cease firing!
- Hey, Thomas. There's some water.
- Oh, thank God!
- Hey, 470 Davies was hit, you know.
- No!
Aye, in the throat.
What a pity.
The man is a great bass baritone.
In the throat, is it?
Aye.
Hey, where are you going?
I'm going to see that calf, man.
Hey, come back, you fool!
What are you doing?
Tommy!
Mr Bourne, there should be 12 more men working on this redoubt.
They're very tired, sir.
I don't give a damn.
I want this nine foot high, firing steps inside.
Form details to clear away the Zulu bodies.
Rebuild the south ramparts.
Keep them moving.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
All right, lads, keep it moving.
We're next, boys. This is the blind spot.
Even if those flaming officers ain't seen it, I bet the Zulus have.
- Come on, Howarth, put your money up.
- Have you gone stupid?
What bloody good you think it will do you if you do win?
We're all goners!
Well, it don't matter if you lose, does it?
Hey, Hookie.
Hughsie.
There's some brandy in Reynolds' medical cabinet, go and borrow some.
- It's locked up down that end.
- Kick it down, then.
Hey, that's company punishment.
Company punishment.
On the right.
Form close columns of platoons.
- By the right!
- You lucky bastard!
Oh dear. Oh dear.
Well, your mum will need somebody to milk her now, won't she?
Stand to!
All right, all right, I can hear you.
Out you get, Hookie, you've done your bit.
Quick! Thousands of them! 612!
Knock a hole in that wall!
Better get down now, sir.
Sir!
Get down now, sir!
No! Jones, it's me!
Come on, get through, you bloody Englishman!
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Jonesy!
Come on up!
Get to Surgeon Reynolds.
Right, get on the wall.
Hook!
I know you!
What about the money you sent my old woman?
Hook!
That's it, Hook, my lad!
That's it, soldier!
Hookie!
Stay where you are, Maxfield!
Hookie! Hookie!
Get out! Get out, man.
That's my boy, Hook!
You're a soldier now!
I've made a soldier of you!
Where's my bloody sergeant?
Get out! Come on!
- Is everybody out?
- Yes, sir.
On the wall.
Hookie? Where's Hookie? Hookie?
Come down, Hookie! Hookie!
Hookie! That's a flogging offence!
Get out, for God's sake, man!
- Everybody out?
- Everybody that will get out.
- Abandon the outside ramparts.
- Bugler! Retire to this wall!
- Colour Sergeant.
- Sir.
- Carry on building the inner redoubt.
- Sir!
All right, nobody told you to stop working!
Look at that.
- Do you think he wanted it that way?
- Look at it burn!
Any more in there?
Then we'll have to take them from the outside walls.
- Colour Sergeant Bourne.
- Sir?
Hey, Owen?
- Are you awake, man?
- What is it?
I didn't think it was going to die though.
- Can you see something?
- No, the calf, I'm talking about.
There's sorry I am.
Aye.
Seems a pity, doesn't it?
How many times have they come since sunset do you reckon?
I don't know.
Do you reckon they'll come again?
I think they've got more guts than we have, boyo.
Soldiers!
All right, back to your posts.
You, hold there.
Orderly, see to these men.
Colour Sergeant.
Put a third of our men in the redoubt.
Send the bugler to me.
I was asleep, sir.
You let me sleep?
You shouldn't have done that.
Is there any water?
I sent what was left to Reynolds.
Yes, of course.
It's fear dries the mouth, isn't it?
When a man's as thirsty as this.
I could have drunk a river.
Thank you for what you said.
Oh, you mean about our needing you?
Yes. Don't bother, old boy, it's true.
Sir?
Come with me.
Get in the redoubt, my lucky lads.
Make a move.
Come on. Come on.
All right, lads, take up your positions on the firing step.
Keep your heads down.
- How old are you, boy?
- Sir?
It doesn't matter.
You know how to sound?
Yes, sir.
Stay by me.
Do you think the Welsh can't do better than that, Owen?
Well, they've got a very good bass section, mind, but no top tenors, that's for sure.
Men of Harlech stop your dreaming
Can't you see their spear points gleaming
See their warrior pennants streaming
To this battlefield
Sing!
Men of Harlech stand ye steady
Come on, sing!
It cannot be ever said ye
For the battle were not ready
Welshmen never yield
The mighty force surrounding
Men of Harlech on to glory
This will ever be your story
Keep these burning words before ye
Welshmen will not yield
At 100 yards!
Volley fire! Present!
Aim! Fire!
Right, stand by. Lips dry?
- Sergeant!
- Prepare!
Now!
Spit, boy, spit!
Redoubt party!
Fire!
Volley by ranks!
Front rank, fire!
Second rank, fire!
Third rank, fire!
First rank, fire!
Second rank, fire!
Third rank, fire!
First rank, fire!
Second rank, fire!
Third rank, fire!
Fire! Fire!
Cease firing!
Three hours and they haven't come again.
Mr Chard, sir.
The patrol's come back.
The Zulus have gone. All of them.
It's a miracle!
If it's a miracle, Colour Sergeant, it's a short chamber
Boxer-Henry.45 calibre miracle.
And a bayonet, sir, with some guts behind it.
- Fall them in. Call the roll.
- Sir.
Well, you did it.
Me?
- Abel?
- Sir.
Adams?
Adam?
- Barry?
- Sir.
- Beckett?
- He's wounded, sir.
- He's dying, sir.
- It's sad.
Keep your voices down.
Byrne?
- Camp?
- Sir.
Chick?
Cole?
- Colin.
- Sir.
- Who was left in here?
- I don't know.
They had names, they had faces.
They were our men.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Chard!
All right.
470 Davies?
- 363 Davies?
- Sir.
Well, you've fought your first action.
Does everyone feel like this afterwards?
How do you feel?
Sick.
Well, you have to be alive to feel sick.
You asked me, I told you.
There's something else.
I feel ashamed.
Was that how it was for you?
The first time?
The first time?
You think I could stand this butcher's yard more than once?
I didn't know.
I told you.
I came up here to build a bridge.
Fagan?
Green, 459?
Sir.
- Hughes?
- Excused duty.
No comedians, please.
- Hughes?
- Yes, Colour Sergeant.
Say "sir." Officer on parade.
Sir!
Hayden?
Hitch?
Hitch, I saw you. You're alive.
I am? Oh, thanks very much.
- Answer the roll. Say "sir."
- Sir!
All right. Now get off into the sickbay where you belong.
- Hook?
- Yes, sir, me too, sir.
Stay where you are, Hook!
Well, we haven't done too badly.
Oh, my God!
Adendorff, why have they stopped?
God damn you!
- I want an answer!
- Haven't you had enough?
Both of you!
My God, can't you see it's all over!
Your bloody egos don't matter any more!
We're dead!
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Come on.
Those bastards!
They're taunting us!
No.
No. You couldn't be more wrong.
They're... They're saluting you.
They're saluting fellow braves.
They're saluting you.
Oh, my eye! Oh, my eye! Will you look!

He dies for a rifle.
¿Murió bien, eh?
¿Pero para qué?
¿Para esto?
¡Para nada! ¡Para nada!
Whoa.
Let's go, men.
¡Alto!
¡Chica! Vàmonos!
Good morning, amigo.
Maybe you can help me.
No hablo inglés.
Esto es Mexico.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Español.
Can I help you?
- What was he saying?
- That you're in Mexico now.
That anyone coming to Mexico ought to be speaking Spanish.
You, uh, in command here?
No, but I speak English.
Seen this man?
Hey, Joe.
- Mornin', darlin'.
- Where you going, Joe?
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm on my way.
You say all day, all night.
All night, all day?
Did I say that?
- You say.
- Ah.
Well, uh, things is different now.
The soldiers.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
Why don't you try this hotel.
He may be in there.
You mean they let Indians in there?
Anyone who can pay, sir.
One moment, please.
What is your name?
I am Lieutenant Franz Von Klemme from the Imperial German Army.
I'm what you'd call an adviser.
I'm Lyedecker.
Policeman.
You got some money?
Money?
What the hell for?
Get out of the window!
For me, yes?
Some dollars for me?
I saw you got dollars.
- I thought you said you loved me.
- Sure.
You give me money?
Yeah, well, later, maybe, huh?
I yell pretty loud.
Then the sergeant come up.
You want to talk to them?
What do you want to do with them?
Well...
Well, what do you mean?
They were pulling out the railroad track.
Your track.
Oh, my company's.
Not mine.
Why do they do that?
Damn it!
Why?
Why have they been fighting us for 400 years?
Because they're Yaqui Indians, that's why.
They call them los tigres de la rocas... the tigers of the rocks.
They say your track is on their land.
What shall we do about it?
Oh, whatever's customary.
Whatever you think is right.
Of course.
Muy bien.
Verdugo...
Verdugo...
I'm no part of this.
Do what you like... a trial.
I'm no part of this.
Look.
I know the value of things.
Bullets are valuable.
These are not.
No.
Listen.
Don't be like that.
You can give me money... or I'll make you some trouble.
Come here.
- Sargento Paletes!
- Señor.
Run! Run!
Run, Indians!
Run, Indians! Run!
Run!
Hey!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
¡Cabrón!
Mi general.
He is our prisoner.
Too bad I had to interrupt your entertainment up there.
Yes, you distracted my soldiers...
disbanded the Indians...
Very clever.
But now I got you.
Yeah.
Well, you wouldn't have me if that hotel had a back door.
Very clever.
Very clever.
Now, General, you don't wanna do that.
He's a very valuable man.
If you got to kill him, why don't you let me have him?
Perhaps I will kill you too.
That won't get you very much either.
- He's your friend?
- He's no friend of mine.
Well, then, what is he to you?
Bank robber.
He stole $6,000 from the Citizen's Bank in Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr. Lyedecker... how much did you say he stole?
Six thousand dollars.
- Uh-huh. When?
- Twelve days ago.
Twelve days, huh?
I see.
Fifty dollars.
Where is the rest?
You look Mexican, but you don't talk Mexican.
- What the hell are you?
- Well, I sure as hell ain't no damn Mexican.
My mama was a Yaqui Indian... and my daddy was from Alabama.
I see.
Well, I hope you know how to die.
I admire a man who dies well.
Now, tell me... where is the money? Hmm?
The money.
All those dollars you speak of.
Where are they?
Women and whiskey.
That's what I'd do if I was him.
Oh?
Six thousand dollars in 12 days?
Oh!
You could be the biggest stallion in the world...
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
Now...
No.
No, it was not spent on women or on whiskey.
Now, for the last time, where is the money?
Just like he said, jefe.
Half of it I spent on whiskey and women... and the other half I wasted.
Excuse me, sir, but if he spent the entire night in the hotel... don't you...
Yes.
Yes, let's go and take a look.
Where is the money?
Hey, friend, I hear your mama sells it on the street.
I don't think he understands English.
All that's fine.
But where's the money?
You really the honest-to-God law?
Somethin' wrong with that?
No! No.
You caught me, didn't ya?
That's right.
Now I gotta see about gettin' you out of here.
See, you bein' the Yankee law don't cut no ice with the Mexican army.
They ain't gonna let you get out of here.
Well, why don't you buy us out?
The money ain't worth gettin' killed for, now, is it?
I ain't got no money.
- Bank says different.
- Oh, I took it, all right.
But I spent it two days later.
- What did you spend it on?
- Rifles.
Rifles?
One hundred rifles for the Yaqui Indians.
Them poor devils hangin' on them telephone poles out there... them's Yaqui Indians... my people.
Well, if you tellin' the truth... that general's gonna kill you real slow.
Well, let me tell you about that general.
They told him to get rid of the Yaquis any way he could... and he took the easy way.
He's just killin' everybody.
Well, you've spent enough time in the States. You as American as me.
And you know you just can't go around stickin' up banks.
Yeah.
But I ain't goin' back.
Yes, you are.
On foot, on horseback, or hangin' across a saddle, you're goin' back.
How is it over there?
It's crowded over here.
How about out there?
Well, I think, with a little bit of luck, we might be able to get out of this.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna jump right out that window behind you.
Go ahead.
¡Sargento Paletes!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
Yaqui!
Mi caballo.
¡Sargento! ¡Vamos!
Well, I think we lost 'em.
All of'em.
Well, do you bring the rifles?
You damn betcha.
Romero send you?
Where are the rifles, Joe?
How come he sent a woman?
- They're expecting a man.
- Oh.
Now, uh, where are the rifles, Joe?
On the Chilina trail, not too far from here.
Well, I hope so.
They're there.
And where is the profit for you, Joe?
There ain't none, Sarita.
Look, you told me to get the rifles, and I got 'em.
- What are you bein'so tough on me for?
- Because I know you.
Boy, you sure have soured up in the last few years, ain't ya?
Yes. I have changed.
I watched them hang my father... and I helped him to die.
You hear that?
I helped my father to die.
You say the Chilina trail?
Yeah.
We'll see.
Mara.
Oh, shoot.
Now, why'd you do that?
I wasn't gonna do nothin'
I couldn't have done before.
You're pretty good, Joe.
I can't take any chances with you.
- Let's go.
- Where we goin'?
Back to Phoenix.
How come them to give you a badge in the first place?
Well, I guess I took a job that nobody else wanted.
Even at that, it took me a whole year to get it.
- How much they gon' give you for takin' me back?
- Two hundred dollars.
And the job permanent-like.
Shoot, that ain't even hardly worth botherin' about.
Well, Joe, that depends on what you got in the first place.
Yeah.
I ain't never been worth a damn in my whole damn life.
Ain't never been worth nothin' to talk about.
I never even had a job permanent-like.
But now I finally done somethin' for somebody... me.
I finally amounted to somethin'.
Yeah.
You robbed a bank.
Let's go.
I should have known.
You lied to me.
There's no sign of tracks.
No people. No guns.
What are you talkin' about?
They're there. Come on. I'll show you.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
- Where do you find him?
- I didn't find him! He found me!
Will he help us?
- Señor, will you help?
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You ain't got nothin' better to do.
- It ain't my party.
Come on.
So, we meet again, huh?
You murderer!
You assassin!
Too bad I don't have enough time for you right now.
Lopez!
Now you...
Mr. Sheriff.
Mr. Half-breed.
By the time
I'm through with you... you'll be ready to tell me everything I want to know.
I'm not afraid.
Damn it!
Stay on your feet!
Go to hell!
Damn you, you big son of a...
Muy bien.
Ay. Look what the rurales found.
Rifles.
Two Indians with these mules.
Now, how would two Indians... find 100 rifles, huh?
They were skinned alive.
Slowly.
But they wouldn't say.
Tsk tsk.
Nice day, Verdugo.
Indeed it is, Mr. Grimes.
Hello.
My name's Grimes.
Steven Grimes.
Oh, that's... that's nice.
Mighty nice.
Well...
You know, fellow Americans.
And, uh, what's a nice fellow like you doing in a place like this?
I'm with Southern Pacific.
We run the railroads here.
Then, uh, you're really all right with that general, ain't you?
Look, Lyedecker, what's the point of all this?
If you don't tell him what he wants to know, he'll have you killed.
Well, maybe put a good word in for us.
- Why don't you get the hell outta here?
- Tell him something.
Anything.
Six thousand dollars is not worth dying for.
And he's just gonna let us go.
Is that right?
Why don't you go away and stop botherin' us?
Look.
If he has you shot, it'll create terrible problems.
- It'll be a terrible thing for all of us.
- Sure as hell will.
- For us or for the railroad?
- For both.
The way relations are between the United
States and Mexico...Well, you know.
Look... we don't wanna talk to you.
You understand?
We don't wanna talk to you.
Hey, wait a minute, Joe.
Wait a minute.
He's got the rifles, and he's got us too.
What do we got to lose?
Tell you what you do.
You go tell that general I wanna see him.
What about my men?
How are they progressing?
Well, sir, they fight well, they train well.
They don't seem to take too naturally to the drill.
Well, the parades will come later.
As long as they can fight.
Sit down.
Sit down.
What disturbs you?
The rifles, sir.
Someone is arming the Yaquis.
If they get hold of any more guns, you're going to have the tiger by its tail.
The Yaquis do not have the rifles.
I do.
Yes, sir, at the moment you do.
Von Klemme, you worry me.
That was my intent, sir.
No. I mean, you worry me.
- Oh?
- Yes.
You...You seem afraid.
Of what?
I don't know.
Perhaps if you would return to Mexico City...
I would prefer nothing more than that, sir, if my orders could be changed.
You know that I don't need you.
But, you see, sir... we Germans are here to advise, so we advise.
Oh, yes.
Now, tell me, what perfect piece of advice have you this time?
Finish off the Yaquis as quickly as possible before more guns come through.
I know that, don't I?
Of course you do. Then send them south and sell them to the wood merchants.
No. It isn't worth it.
The prices are too low.
I have to feed them, send some of my men with them.
By the time we sell one, the price will be lower than the price of a cow.
Then kill them all.
That is your advice?
That is my advice, sir.
Very good.
So, all the time, eh?
All the time the $6,000 was right there in my front yard, huh?
Incredible.
- I'll take him back now, General.
That's the deal. Right?
- Now wait.
Wait.
Tell me something.
Where are the other rifles?
I don't know what you're talking about.
When do they arrive?
Answer the question, Indian.
- You got 'em all.
- That is not the answer!
- There ain't no more guns!
- How do you know that?
You know, Lyedecker, as I told you before,
I think you're part of it.
I ain't a part of anything!
This man stole $6,000. For that amount of money, there can't be no more guns.
You refuse to answer, eh?
Look, there ain't no more damn guns.
Very well.
Too bad, gentlemen.
¡Sargento Paletes!
What did all that mean?
Look like they're gonna shoot us.
Verdugo, I suggested that if they told you about the money... you'd let them go.
Grimes, you run the railroad.
I'll run the state of Sonora.
And don't you ever forget it.
- Por favor, General...
- ¡No, señor!
¡Alto!
You know somethin'?
What?
I think our string has done run out.
The hell it has.
We're gonna get out of this.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Well, there's nothin' to it.
A big, giant hand is gonna reach in here, pick us up... take us away and put us down someplace... right in the middle of a whole bunch of women and whiskey.
That ain't funny.
Well, I ain't laughin' neither.
That ain't funny at all!
Stay out of other people's business.
That's what I always said and that's what I always done.
But look at me now.
Smart Lyedecker.
Hung up on a fence with a bunch of scruffy Indians.
Well, that's too bad about you.
Your number's comin' up over there, and it's just too damn bad.
- You know why?
- No, I don't know why. Why?
- 'Cause you'd have been a hell of a lawman.
- You damn right!
'Cause you don't care about nothin' or nobody... just like all them big boys with their badges.
What do you know about badges?
You're just a pissant border half-breed.
I know a lot about it.
I know all about them small-town, barbershop, hair-cuttin' sheriffs.
And I know all about them big-town, big-bellied... billy club-swingin' policemen from St. Louis.
- You don't know nothin'!
- The hell I don't!
They look you up and down, and you're guilty!
You don't get no trial, just like we ain't gonna get one now!
'Cause them guys over there don't care about nothin' or nobody, just like you!
That's why you'd have been so good with a badge.
Washington's going to react very badly to this.
What are they going to do?
Send a note saying,
"Where is our black policeman?"
- And then what?
- They'll ask questions.
They're going to ask my company a great many questions.
And they will get answers,
I'm sure.
Your company cares for its trains... not for two gringos that disappear in Mexico.
¡Fuego!
Hold it, gentlemen.
Padre.
My sons, allow me to help you...
We ain't no damn sons of yours.
There's probably more than one scattered around here someplace.
Fear and despair are human failings.
Yet we are human.
Make yourselves ready to die in peace and love.
Why don't you talk to Verdugo about some of that peace and love... instead of tryin' to get somebody ready to die.
That's right.
Ain't no man ever died ready for it.
I want you to go with love in your hearts.
I want you to go to hell.
Allow me to hear your confession.
Whatever you got in that book, just put me down for it.
- Lyedecker.
- What?
I'm sorry you got mixed up in this.
You ain't half as sorry as me.
¡Ataque!
What the hell?
Goddamn it!
Come on! Come on!
¡Rapido!
¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!
Hyah! Hyah!
I want their heads.
Some kind of woman, ain't she?
Yeah. Kinda stout.
Now that you got them rifles...
what are you gonna do with 'em?
- Take 'em to General Romero.
- General.
Why every time four Mexicans get together, one of'em makes himself a general?
Look, you.
Romero can call himself anything he wants.
I knew him when he was young... when he brought the people together to fight.
Good or bad, he's all we have.
It's a good thing you have him,
'cause me and that one there, we goin' north.
We are, huh?
Yeah.
What do you say we wait till we get them rifles to General Romero?
Then I'll go easy-like.
Uh-uh. No good.
Lyedecker, you're a mule-headed son of a bitch.
You saw all them Indians hung up like a side of beef.
- After all the trouble we went through to get them rifles...
- We?
Yeah, we!
Look, I spent 15 years in the 9th Cavalry... keepin' the law and chasin' bad Indians.
But this one ain't my business, it ain't my fight and it ain't my job!
And besides...
I don't much like Indians anyway.
We should have killed him!
Yeah.
I think she's right.
You know your trouble, big man?
You're dumb.
Just plain ol'black-ass dumb!
Now who's dumb, you half-breed?
Huh?
I am!
Let me up!
Come on!
Thank you.
Don't shoot him!
And let him kill you?
The rifles, they are more important.
I don't wanna drag his big ass all over Mexico.
- What's it gon' be?
- I guess I ain't got much of a choice, have I?
We split up here.
You take the guns upriver.
I'll meet you in Delgado.
I'm glad to meet you.
Ah.
Woman, what are they looking at?
It's the first time they've seen a black man before.
Well, if they wait a while, they'll see this one turn into a chili bean.
I sure wish I had myself a fried steak.
Well, two or three times now, you could've killed me.
Sí.
That is true.
- I need you.
- What for?
Mira.
Those rifles, they are what keeps Joe here.
He is what keeps you here.
I want you to help us.
No, I won't do that.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. Yeah, I reckon I am.
Oh, not of being shot at.
That's happened plenty before.
Lyedecker, if... if you would join with us... for just a little while...
I won't worry about YaquiJoe.
Afterwards, you can have him.
You ain't, uh, partial to him?
No.
I don't trust him.
He's a bad man.
But he's smart... and he's important for us now.
Nothing else?
No.
Nothing.
No deals. I'm gonna take him back, and there ain't gonna be no deals.
We got problems. Verdugo's about one mile behind us, but I don't think he saw us.
Get the rifles. Let's get out of here.
¡Vámonos!
Adios.
Gracias, kid.
Keep goin'!
Go on!
- ¡ Sargento!
- Mi general.
Collect all the children and take them to the rancho.
With the general's permission, the time might be better spent collecting the rifles.
Von Klemme, I'm gonna tell you something once and for all...
and let it be a lesson for your future.
I never do anything without a purpose, and remember that.
Humara.
Los niños. Los niños.
El rancho.
El rancho.
Yaqui.
The children.
They've taken all of the children... and holding them for the rifles.
They're holding 'em for us too, you can bet.
Well, we have to go back.
Look, Sarita, I think we ought to go on to Romero... give 'em the guns, and get some more men, huh?
No. We have to get those children.
We will.
We'd better make this quick and quiet.
Shh!
Well, I wonder if he died ready for it.
Get them kids out of here!
Hey, big fella.
How you doin', man?
Where's Joe?
Where's the whiskey?
I guess you never can tell where they might go to drink, huh?
Don't-Don't shoot, Lyedecker!
For God's sake, don't shoot!
- I didn't know it was you.
- Obviously!
Hey, Joe, look what I found.
Hey, Big Ben.
You ain't still thinking about taking me to Phoenix with you, are ya?
You'd better believe it, hombre.
Well, you're a stubborn, son of a...
Damn.
Well, what's you gonna do with him?
Well, uh, whatever's customary and whatever you think is right.
I'll-I'll be glad to take care of him for you.
Lyedecker, this is silly.
There's no need for...
Keep him alive.
We might be able to use him later.
I'll do it.
Didn't turn out to be much, did it?
Hmm?
Pretty fancy, huh?
For me?
Too fancy for me?
She had one like it when my father worked here a long time ago.
She's dead now...
Verdugo's wife.
I always wanted one like it.
It looks like you were born for it.
It's a lie. But you're a pretty good man after all, Lyedecker.
I guess I know that.
I know what I am.
I don't have to go looking for it.
Then why are you a policeman?
It's a job.
Everybody has to do something.
What the job is ain't important.
It's how you do it.
Are you good at what you do?
Well, it ain't much different than the cavalry. I do the best I can.
Well, that is a hard thing to do.
For all the bad things
I have said to you...
I give you this.
No. No! No!
No! No!
Please, not like this!
Not with you.
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
Lyedecker.
He died yesterday.
Ah, sí. The black gringo.
We have heard of you.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Good day for travelin', and we're gonna travel.
Hey.
What is this stuff?
What is this "mi general"?
- You mean you don't know?
- No, I don't know.
Well, it seems that you have been elected the new general.
I ain't no damn general.
That's just...
That's the dumbest...
That's just plumb crazy! Come on!
Buenos días, general.
Look, you tell them to get out of here.
Tell them I don't want 'em following me.
Tell 'em to go away.
Tell 'em I ain't no general.
Not for no bad-ass Indians.
Not for nobody.
You tell 'em.
It looks to me like... you're back in the cavalry business...
mi general.
I'm sure the rifles are somewhere up there.
I can promise you that, with Romero.
No.
If he gets the guns and the ammunition... he will probably come down that mountain, and we'll have war.
I know Romero.
He's a dying tiger.
He wouldn't come downhill with an army of 10,000 cannons.
No.
Lyedecker is the one.
I want his head on a stick in the middle of the plaza for everyone to see.
Lyedecker and the others.
Sir, I personally think we ought to be going after Romero.
Now, listen to me, Von Klemme.
I know Romero.
I know these mountains.
I know my country, and you don't!
So shut up.
Shut up and follow my orders.
I want Lyedecker.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
Buenos noches, mi general.
Lyedecker?
Oh. Your supper is almost ready.
- Tortillas?
- No.
Look what I found.
You said fried steak.
Is that, um, the way it is?
If that's the way you want it.
No.
Let me get that.
Here?
Lyedecker, you are my man.
You know, you gotta be, uh, careful about a thing like that.
I don't have to be careful.
I am your woman for as long as you want it.
Do you want me?
What does Verdugo use that train for?
- What are you going to do?
- Answer the question.
Now, look, you can't be...
You're not going to wreck the train?
In one minute, I'm gonna pinch off your head... and mail it back to the home office.
The train carries troops and supplies from Nogales to Hermosillo.
It's well-guarded.
Does it make any stops along the way?
No.
- No stops.
- There is a water tower...
in the plano, the flat part.
He stops there.
Now, look, you're not going to wreck the train.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Lyedecker...
God!
Dear God!
He ain't gonna help you.
¡ Hey, muchachos!
¡Una muchacha!
No, no, no, no.
He ain't here.
Well, must be he didn't make the trip then...
'cause I've been watchin' this car all the time.
- How many did we lose?
- I don't know for sure.
Hey. You did a real fine job.
You seen Grimes?
No.
Last time I saw him, we were diggin' in.
I saw him.
He had a horse.
I guarantee you, he's almost to Nogales by now.
What the hell are we gonna do now?
Load the train up.
We're still goin' in.
- Uh, hello. Buenos días.
- Buenos días.
¿ Verdugo aquí?
Well, is he here?
Grimes, I should have you shot.
What are you trying to do, become an adventurer?
Well, that's good, because the role does not suit you.
Tell me, Mr. Grimes... how did you happen to be with them in the first place?
I was taken at the point of a gun.
I was a prisoner.
- For so long?
- All right.
He did return... finally.
- You escaped, huh?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
They're going to attack the town.
Really?
- How?
- They've taken the train.
Are you sure?
You saw it?
I heard the plans.
- There was nothing I could do.
- Of course not.
Look.
Let them come in.
And after they've gotten off the train... we can catch them in the streets.
Mr. Grimes, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.
First, you have them nicely trapped on the train... and then you allow them to get into the streets and houses?
Grimes... your train will be a small sacrifice to our cause.
- Go check up there... the machine gun.
- Yes, sir.
¡Alto!
¡ Fuego!
Sarita!
We did all right, didn't we?
Yeah, I guess we did.
I mean, we won, didn't we?
Well.
We won, huh?
Yep.
I think I can put the train back into running order. I thought you'd like to know that.
It'll take time, and I'll need men for the labor.
Yeah.
It's important that, uh... we know where we stand, huh?
What the hell for?
Well, look out there.
You're their leader now.
You should think about that.
- I ain't no dadgum such thing.
- They think you are.
They do?
This place is yours, and you have an army.
With them, you can control the entire area for good or bad.
You're ready to say no to that?
Damn right I am.
Oh, no, you're not.
A man like you... with your intelligence?
The whole state can be yours.
All of Sonora.
- No. Hell, no.
- You have to.
The choice isn't yours.
The decision's been taken out of your hands.
Do you know what'll happen if you walk away from all this? There'll be anarchy.
- What...
- These people...
Your people, they'll drift apart without a leader.
And then another general will come from Mexico City... with another army, and these streets'll run with blood again.
You'll need to move men and supplies.
You'll need the railroad.
I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
Lyedecker!
- Hey, you ain't leavin' are you?
- Yep.
You can't do that.
I mean, I ain't goin' with ya.
What are you gonna tell 'em?
What are you gonna say?
Well, I'll tell 'em I just didn't bring you back, Joe.
Of course, they'll be able to see that for themselves anyway, won't they?
Yeah, but you're the leader.
I mean, if you go, there could be anarchy.
There could be blood in the streets.
Look, Joe, they'll follow you now.
In fact, it could be a good deal for you.
Yeah, but, Lyedecker, what do you got to go back to?
You came down here with nothin', not even a job permanent.
- After all them years, nothin'.
- Yeah, I thought about that.
You did?
What'd you think?
I thought I oughta go back and give it one more shot.
Lyedecker, maybe
I oughta go back with ya.
You don't wanna do that, Joe.
You belong here, and I belong up north.
Like I said,
I wanna give it that one more shot.
And, Joe, good luck, amigo.
All right, dadgumit, let's get this dadgum army together!
All right!
All right!
Why don't you go back to bed?
I'll keep the kids quiet.
You know I never can get back to sleep.
- Is there any coffee?
- It's not finished yet.
Have some orange juice.
You'll feel better.
This house is damp.
Doesn't the dampness ever bother you?
Any house by the sea is bound to be damp.
No. This house is special.
It'll always be special.
It'll always be that damp summer place on Gloucester Island.
Two-and-a-half months here, it'll take two-and-a-half years for my bones to dry out.
Here, listen to my back.
There. Did you hear that?
- I don't hear anything.
- Listen! There!
Tomorrow, we'll be going home.
You'll be nice and dry.
Your back won't make a sound, and we'll never go anywhere again.
Ever.
We'll go.
Dad! Mom! There's some men outside!
- There are what?
- There are men outside! Lots of men!
- There are? What are they doing, Pete?
- I don't know. They're creeping!
- They're creeping, are they? Listen...
- I think they're creeping up on this house!
But, Dad!
Pete! Annie's asleep upstairs.
- They've got guns! I saw their guns!
- Maybe it's an ambush.
Why don't you go outside and play some tennis?
Okay.
I warned you.
I know.
- Bacon and eggs all right?
- No. I'll get dressed first.
It's too damp to eat.
Honey, I have to work today, I really do.
What's the plan? Do I have to pack?
Walt, you don't have to do a thing.
Alison's coming.
We're going to spend the day packing.
I'll keep the kids away, and you can work.
You know Larry's going to scream if I don't get that second act worked out.
I told him last Wednesday I already had it.
I don't even have an idea for it.
You will. You know you will.
You know how producers are.
He'll say it's a masterpiece.
And it probably will be.
You get dressed, eat a good breakfast, and just do it.
All right?
Yeah.
They're hiding out by the garage now.
And there's this great big one, like Uncle Harry.
Like Uncle Harry?
Okay, Pete. You keep an eye on them.
I'll never get any work done today.
People running around the house.
Hello, good morning.
Okay?
- How are you?
- Very good.
Annie was awake till 10:00.
I'll let her sleep.
The toast is burning.
This darn thing.
Why I ever let that agent talk me into $125 for the dampest house in the...
- I counted them. There are nine of them.
- Come on.
Two of them've got Tommy guns, and they're all talking some foreign language.
- They could be Russians or something!
- Sit down and eat your breakfast.
- You don't even believe me!
- Just eat.
Okay.
Someone at the door.
You always know everything.
- What? What do you mean?
- It's probably Alison.
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
Alison, this early in the morning?
No, I'll get it.
Good morning, sir.
A pleasant good morning to you.
Good morning.
Please permit me to apologize for this unusual disturbance, but we are hoping for some conversations, please.
Lady, and a young boy.
Good morning, also, my dear lady.
Good morning, young boy.
We are two strangers in this island, and we wish to speak with you about boats.
Boats?
- About boats?
- Yes, that is most exactly correct.
Boats.
I don't understand. I mean, who are you?
- I didn't hear a car. How did you...
- Please, not to be afraid. We are nobody.
We wish only to inquire where to find powerboat.
Motor-powerboat for private use for some brief little time, you understand?
Sorry, but I still don't understand.
There are no boats around here.
- No boats?
- No.
This is an island with no boats?
There are boats, some boats, but not around here. In town.
In the harbor in town, but there are none around here.
- Big boats?
- Yeah.
- Motor-powerboats?
- All different kinds of boats.
Ask them if they're Russians.
A nice little boy there.
Which way to harbor, please?
It's five miles down.
- Ask them if they're Russians!
- Peter, be quiet.
A clever little boy, very clever, to see that my friend and I are foreigners here.
But of course, not Russians, naturally.
What would the Russians be doing on United States of America island with so many animosities and hatreds between these two countries?
It is too funny idea, is it not?
No, we are, of course, Norwegians.
Norwegians?
On a small training exercise for the NATO countries...
- NATO.
- NATO countries, of course, yes.
To reach place of power motorboats is necessary to make borrowings of automobile for short time only, sir.
- May I ask you something?
- Yes, of course.
Are there nine of you out there?
Are you all Russians with machine guns?
And does one of you look like Uncle...
I mean, look like a wrestler?
I'm sorry to comply with your statement, but misfortunately all of the answers to these questions are yes.
He's got a gun!
- Please, to step inside the house.
- No, just wait a minute.
- You can't come in here.
- Lady, not to worry, for no harm is coming.
No harm. Absolutely no harm.
Don't be frightened. There's an explanation.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you, son.
- All to keeping calm.
- Yes.
I repeat, no harm is coming.
All now, please, being seated.
It's all right, just take it easy.
Pete, don't be scared.
- There's no need to be scared.
- I'm not scared.
Good boy.
Now, to answer some few questions very quickly, so that there is no necessity howsoever...
- Whatsoever.
- Whatsoever!
So that there is no necessity howsoever why everybody in such a nice American family should get shot to little pieces.
You understand? Yes. Good.
- What else people are in this house?
- What?
There's only our little girl.
She's asleep upstairs.
But she's only a little baby.
So. First is necessary to make borrowings of automobile.
Where are keys?
In my purse.
Bag.
If you don't mind, please.
Very good.
What is population of island, please?
- It's about 200 people.
- Honey, there's more than that.
In September?
You're thinking of the summer.
No, in West Village, all the farms.
You forgot to count the farms.
No matter! Not many people.
Please, you know of no boat except at boat place?
No boat close to where we are here?
No, there just aren't any boats.
Very few questions more.
Don't tell them anything!
We'd be traitors!
Pete, just keep quiet. Here.
There is no establishment of US Navy or Army or Coastal Guardians on island?
No US of Air Force?
No, there are no bases on Gloucester.
Gloucester.
Police constabulary? How many members of police department here? 20, 40?
No, there are not that many.
Maybe three or four.
Don't tell them anything.
He hasn't even tortured you yet!
- Pete.
- Listen. No one's going to be tortured.
Couldn't you at least give us some idea what this is all about?
I know it's none of...
None of my business, but...
It is necessary for you to remain in this house,
I hope, most vigorously, for short time only.
- We're not going anywhere, so that...
- Good.
Please, to remain absolutely good-behaved, so that this man here, a marksman of prize-winning caliber, will not have the necessity of shooting you to small pieces.
- I forgot. I meant to, but I forgot.
- Listen, there isn't much gas in the car.
The gas. Petrol.
- Gasoline.
- No time for stupid tricks.
Just to keep absolutely good-behaved, yes?
Madam, once more,
I apologize for all this.
Why'd you let him do that?
What'd you let him kiss your hand for?
- I didn't know what he was going to do.
- You could have pulled it away.
I didn't want to make him mad.
- Pete! Come back here!
- Walt!
I'll call the police, that's what!
It doesn't buzz.
They must've cut the telephone line.
Is true. Now, please to sit down with
Mama and Papa, all together, yes?
Listen to me. You're not to try anything like that again, do you hear?
- It's Annie!
- It's my sister!
Good morning, Mommy.
Good morning, darling.
I'm hungry. I want my breakfast.
All right, Annie.
All right, you'll have your breakfast.
Please, Mister and Missus.
I am most sinceriously sorry for incident with little girl.
Suddenness of noise...
What's your name?
Alexei Kolchin.
My name's Annie Whittaker.
I'm going to be four.
Where did you come from?
From Soviet Navy submarine boat.
A submarine? You're off a submarine?
Last night, captain of submarine boat is putting submarine boat too close to land, against orders.
He want to look at America.
What for?
He never saw it.
All of a suddenness, submarine boat is becoming fixed on this place,
Gloucester Island.
You went aground!
Honey, that's it!
Their sub has gone aground!
Well, if that's... Wait a minute!
You're looking for a big motorboat to try to pull the sub off the sandbar?
Da, is it!
Why did you come in here...
Anybody could go aground like that.
It happens all the time.
Please to disagree.
All are most sinceriously terrified of what will happen now.
Why? What will happen?
Unless Rozanov is finding power motorboat will be coming many US of American air machines and the war vessels.
Blow up.
No more Soviet Navy submarine boat.
But they wouldn't.
They couldn't.
- Please?
- Just because you've gone aground?
It wasn't deliberate.
It was only an accident, wasn't it?
- They'd simply have to be sympathetic.
- Honey.
When you get captured, you'll get shot.
And I hope you do.
- You know you don't mean that.
- I do mean it.
Listen to me, son.
I can't. You were the one who helped them!
What? What do you mean?
You told them everything they wanted to know, just like Arnold Benedict!
That's Benedict Arnold, not...
What are you saying?
Are you saying you think your father is a traitor?
Yes, I am.
I bet I'm the only guy in the fourth grade whose father is a famous trader.
That's "traitor."
Just stop it. You're being silly.
Might as well give her a hand.
Here, honey, let me help you with that.
I'm going to do something.
I'm going to get that gun from him.
Walt, you're crazy! Don't.
You heard what Pete said?
He's only a child.
Now you're behaving like a child.
He's bigger, younger and stronger than you are, and he's got the gun!
He's also just as frightened as I am.
Sailor, as long as you're here,
- how about a cup of hot, cold...
- Do not come close with that, please.
- It's just a little cold...
- Please.
I do not want to hurt anybody.
Not children, not parents, also.
Walt, I don't think he wants it. Really.
Who comes there? Who?
It's probably Alison, and all those men.
Come in, Alison.
Alison. Did your brother
Fred come with you?
- Hi, Fred, come on in! I've got him now!
- No! Look out!
I got him! Grab him! Stop yelling!
Pete, I got him!
Hit him!
Let him go!
I got the gun!
All right, stick them up.
No shoot! No!
Darn curtain!
He's getting away!
But, Mr. Whittaker...
I'll bet he's hiding somewhere.
Walt! Don't shoot! It's us!
What are you gonna do?
Nothing. He ran for it. It's all over.
Everybody all right?
- But who is he, Mr. Whittaker?
- A Russian sailor.
Careful, Walt.
If he's gone, where did he go?
- He's probably hiding right over there!
- I tell you, he's gone.
Would he be silly enough to come back when I've got the Tommy gun?
He'll be trying to get back to the submarine.
All right, everybody in the house.
Pete, I guess we showed him.
We handled that situation all right, wouldn't you say?
You just let him get away!
You didn't even shoot him!
You just let him get away!
Did you hear that? Did you?
- What are you raising, a delinquent?
- He's only a child.
- He's getting too much, just too much.
- He's a baby. Careful!
- He's eight-and-a-half years old.
- Nine-and-a-half.
There, you see?
If that's those high school kids...
Russians!
Brodsky.
Operator! Hurry up!
That Alice Foss? Call Chief Mattocks.
The Russians have landed!
They're here. Do you hear?
The Russians, in West Village.
And I'm being attacked!
Stop that! How dare you?
Help!
- Yeah?
- It's Alice Foss, Chief.
I'm sorry to bother you, Chief Mattocks, but I just had a call from Muriel Everett.
What'd she want?
She was shouting that I should call you, because according to her...
Muriel said the Russians have landed.
Wanna give me that again, Alice?
Muriel said the Russians have landed, whatever that means, Chief.
And she said they were attacking her personally.
Remember when she called about that peeping Tom?
You know who that was, don't you?
It was Luther Grilk's horse.
I remember that one, Chief.
You handle it, will you?
Just go ahead and call her.
If all those men are in town, they all have guns and they're desperate.
I mean, anything might happen.
Nobody's gonna do anything! Nobody!
- Tell the police they took our car.
- I will.
We have to find it before we go.
It doesn't belong to us.
I know.
- While you're there, call the plumber.
- All right.
- Tell him to turn off the water.
- Listen, if I'm not back in 20 minutes...
What? If you're not back in 20 minutes, what?
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, nothing!
I'll be back just as soon as...
I'll be right back!
Totally unbelievable.
I've got work to do today!
If I don't get that second act,
Larry's gonna scream!
You look silly on a girl's bicycle.
If you wanna hit him, it's all right with me.
You're riding for a fall, buster.
- You're riding for a fall.
- Hit him!
Get back! Just get in.
You change Annie, I'll start packing.
Muriel!
If that's the way she wants it, that's the way it's gonna be.
Fern, why don't you answer that telephone?
Mattocks here, who's that?
I'm awfully sorry to be bothering you again, but I think something really is happening.
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried, but Muriel's line is dead.
I ain't a repairman.
If you got trouble with the lines, you call up Ed Spooner or Art Pinkney, the guys that work for you.
But Chief, Muriel Everett said...
I know what she said.
She said that the Russians had landed.
She said the Russians landed in West Village.
Alice, come on, for the love of...
How could they land in West Village?
There's nothing out there but sandbars.
Couldn't they drop in parachutes?
- How many of the lines are out?
- The whole circuit. It's just dead.
All right, I'm up.
I said, I'm up.
Whatever is going on, I'm up.
While I'm getting dressed, you call up Norman, Charlie, Les and Oscar.
Oscar Maxwell.
Tell them I said to get over to the office right away.
Tell them I said they better bring their guns, all right?
Yes, Chief!
But should I call the State Police?
No. I don't want them bastards.
- Shall I call the Coast Guard?
- No, Alice, nobody. Just...
Let's find out what's going on first.
If there is something going on, before we start spreading around a lot of alarms.
Okay, Chief.
The Russians have landed.
The Russians have landed in West Village and are attacking the postmistress.
They're attacking Muriel Everett.
Fern!
Where the hell...
I'll get it. Will you eat?
Oscar Maxwell speaking.
Chief Mattocks wants you at the station, and bring your gun. That's an order.
Bring my gun?
Gun?
- What's happening? What's going on?
- Russians.
Russians?
Russian parachutists!
Muriel Everett reported that Russian parachutists...
A Russian parachutist on Gloucester Island?
Russians!
Get my gun!
- Where's my gun?
- I saw it when I moved your shirts.
You shouldn't have moved it!
Can't you understand, this is an emergency?
- And I can't even find my...
- It won't be there, those are my things.
You're a great help!
I can't get this thing on.
That isn't right. Here, I'll get it.
Just where did you put my badge?
- It's right here.
- Find that.
I can't get this thing fastened.
- Will you watch what you're doing?
- Sorry.
- What about me? What should I do?
- Just stay at home, in the house.
- But if you're gone...
- My cap!
The kids, why do they put things in my cap?
Kids, I want you to pay attention to me.
This is very serious.
There's an emergency.
Chief called me to the station.
Listen to your mother, too.
Pay attention to her.
I don't want you going outside.
Or near the windows, okay?
Better yet, all of you stay in the cellar. Understand?
Okay. Wonderful kid.
Norm, suppose they come here.
Suppose they start burning and looting.
- Suppose they start raping?
- Do what?
I don't know, Sarah.
The way I see it, you could kick up a fuss and get yourself killed.
Or you could clear out the minute you see them coming.
- Clear out?
- Yeah.
Clear out where?
The ferry isn't even running!
This is Sunday!
Norman. Where you going?
Morning, Norm. What's going on?
There's a report that the
Russians have landed out there.
Russians! Holy jumping!
They must be coming in at the airport.
It's the only way.
Will you get out of the way?
I said, will you get out of the way?
The chief called me down at the station.
I've gotta get there.
Will you get back in the house with the kids, like I told you?
That goes for you, too, Isaac!
Did he say they've captured the airport?
The Russians have captured the airport?
I don't know, but there's some kind of general alarm out.
Hey, Porter.
Do you know what's going on?
They've captured the airport!
There's a general alarm out!
Muriel?
Muriel!
Where are you?
What are you doing up there?
Holy Mackerel, girl!
What was it, a stickup?
Russians, Papa!
What are you doing, hanging up there on the wall?
Handel!
Tchaikovsky!
Wilbert, I want you to get hold of yourself. Calm down.
Chief's here. I'll talk to you later.
- Hey, Chief. What's going on?
- Is there any truth to it?
Take it easy. All I know is
Muriel Everett called up Alice Foss and told her the Russians had landed.
She said the Russians had landed, and they were attacking her personally.
Attacking Muriel Everett?
That's just plain crazy, Chief!
Anyway, she hollered to Alice about getting attacked and then her line went dead.
- What's going on?
- Who are you, boy?
- Walt Whittaker. We're staying out at the...
- Whoever you are, you better get moving.
This whole danged island's under attack by Russians!
We're getting out!
- You're what? Wait a minute.
- Can't wait! We're getting out!
Wait a minute. What happened here?
Those Russians are just ashore.
That's right, they're all over Gloucester Island.
Those Russians are not...
Hey, wait a second!
Hey, listen!
Those Russians are not...
Is anybody...
"Suppose," my foot!
There ain't any Russians anyplace.
But, I mean, just in case there are, what are we supposed to do, Chief?
I just got here. I don't know.
My wife is just about out of her mind!
I'll tell you what we do. We shoot them.
No. We're not gonna shoot anybody.
Will you call back, Fern?
What are you trying to do, start a panic here?
You talk about a panic.
There's people all over the streets, running, yelling, screaming!
That's right, Chief.
Some of them even got guns.
If we can just keep this thing quiet.
Look! Ed Spooner! He's carrying a.22!
There's Joe Monsell, he's got a shotgun!
We gotta do something.
We really gotta do something.
Those people are running around down there with guns!
That's great.
That's just great.
I thought all the nuts went home after Labor Day.
We've gotta have a definite plan of action, men.
That's what we need.
First off, we've gotta have ourselves a leader.
Yeah! That's right!
The democratic way, that's the way I'd be for.
Let's do it the Republican way!
Have nominations and a proper election.
But that might take time.
So I'm gonna suggest an alternate.
Anybody wants to be leader ought to step up here right now, and we'll put it to a voice vote.
You do it, Fendall!
You've got the sword.
Nobody else wants to do it,
I guess it'll have to be me.
So, if there are no objections,
I'll assume command.
One minute.
This may be it, men. This may be it!
All men with firearms, form a line across the street.
Come on, men! Keep out of the way!
If an armed man falls, an unarmed man will pick up his gun!
Don't fire until I give the order!
Men with shotguns, don't fire until you see the whites!
Get out of the way! It's Agnes Grilk.
Get out of the way!
- That was Muriel Everett with her.
- They said Muriel was dead.
Stop it, Muriel! What are you doing?
If we can take some prisoners without a fight, all the better.
But if they want war, men, let it begin here!
Make it lively, boys.
Step lively. On the double!
All right, the armed contingent here.
Attention.
Now, count off!
One, two...
Morning, Fendall.
What's cooking?
Holy jumping, haven't you even heard?
- Heard what?
- The Russians!
The Russians have captured the airport!
- Anybody seen them, Fendall?
- You got any witnesses?
Speak up!
Anybody actually see any Russians?
All right, everybody go on home!
Just get off the streets.
- Norm, break it up.
- You heard the chief. Break it up.
Listen, Mattocks!
What are you trying to do?
Lots of people have seen them.
Reports are coming in every minute!
All right, men, every fourth man, run and get your car!
- Hold it.
- Wait a minute.
- Just a minute there!
- Now what do you want?
I'm going out to the airport. You ain't.
- You're gonna stay right here.
- What?
You're gonna stay here until
I find out what the score is, and don't you do nothing till I tell you to, you got that?
Wait a minute, Mattocks!
You're gonna foul up the whole detail.
We've got a plan of operation all worked out.
That don't give you no right to tell the police what to do, Fendall.
We are governed by the laws of this town as authorized by the Commonwealth, and unless you got a federal warrant that supersedes that, you can keep your big fat mouth shut, or
I'll throw you in jail for disorderly conduct!
- Let's take him in, Link.
- Right, Chief. Let's take the slob in.
Take me in?
After I've been elected leader?
I'd like to see you try.
Norm.
Put that thing away, Fendall.
All right, I want all the unarmed men to stay here in town.
Norm Jonas is gonna be in charge of the town defense.
Norm, you stay here and get things organized.
- You promised...
- Don't argue with me, do like I tell you.
Why do you have to argue with me all the time?
All right, you can come along, Fendall.
Go on.
All right men, we're going!
Just keep your mouth shut, and stay behind this jeep.
Get your cars and follow me.
Let's go. Move that car, will you?
Come on, you guys.
Get that Volkswagen out of here.
Come on, will you get it out of here?
What are you doing, Tom?
Are you trying to back over me? Move it!
- Holy jumping! Muriel, you all right?
- I think so.
What happened?
Agnes, there's the Reverend Hawthorne and I'm still in my night things.
Are you all right? Why, it's Miss Everett.
You better come inside.
The telephone company says the Russians...
Had you heard about it?
Some kind of invasion.
- Anybody know where Arthur Carew is?
- He went to get his teeth fixed.
He took the Friday boat.
I want somebody to run up to Arthur's house and get Millie to lend you keys to the store.
Everett, you go up there. Listen.
Tell her to give you all the arms she's got in stock. We got to have more guns.
Slim, go over to Mr. Paladini's.
He's got a couple of guns over there.
Do as I tell you.
All right, on one condition, everybody pays cash.
Come on, they're opening up the bar.
We've just got to get organized.
Hey, Marvin, it's Luther Grilk.
That's the final...
Luther, how'd you get in there?
I didn't know you were there.
Morning, Marv.
Morning, fellows.
- What's going on?
- The Russians!
What?
I can't get anything but church services, and there's not even any news.
Maybe they captured all the radio stations.
What about that four-minute warning?
Did anybody get a four-minute warning?
Norm.
Double bourbon, coming up.
- Listen, Norm.
- Not now. Can't you see I'm busy?
Why don't you go sleep it off somewhere?
Leave that space clear there, in front of that door.
Wait a minute. I just got an idea.
What if they captured all the radio stations?
Ain't that the first place?
Luther, can't you see I'm busy?
- I'm trying to get something organized.
- But we're helping you.
Quiet!
You wanna do something to help?
You wanna do something important?
You know those people that live in those shacks past the dump?
They got no way of knowing about the alarm, and there's no way of going without a jeep, and we ain't got one.
- Why don't you get your horse...
- Beatrice?
Why don't you get Beatrice, and ride up there on horseback, and let those people know what's happening?
There are women and kids up there, and you could warn them.
I guess I could.
And I will!
Not that way. This way.
Clear that door. I told you guys.
- What are you...
- I got to get to my horse.
Norm! Where are you?
My things are packed.
Get the children's things, and we'll go.
- The ferry's not running.
- I don't care.
I'm not going to stay here with those Russians running around.
- You Miss Whittaker?
- Yes, could you...
- My name is Bell.
- Could you help me?
I live over in Corner Pocket Bay.
Is your phone out of order?
Yes, it is. They cut the lines, you see, some Russians from a submarine.
I can explain, but you wouldn't understand.
Are you driving to town or to West Village?
My husband went to the police and hasn't come back.
Did you say Russians?
Why don't you ride into West Village with him?
- I want to come!
- I don't think I ought to leave.
You go with him. We'll be all right.
All right. Pete, you stay here with Alison and Annie.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay. I'll get the Tommy gun.
- You'll get the what?
- Come on, you come with me!
Wait a minute!
If you could give us a lift, we'd be so grateful.
Take care of Annie. We'll be right back.
Come on, Gustav!
My name is Walt Whittaker.
I want to report that nine Russian sailors came to my house...
What? Norman, come over here.
- This fellow says nine Russian sailors...
- What?
Aren't you that Whittaker fellow from out there at Duck Head Point?
My brother was at your house last month, cleaning out a clogged drain.
I want to report that nine Russian sailors came to my house...
Sailors? You mean, their navy's landing, too?
My God!
- Listen, fellows, come here.
- No. They're off a submarine.
It's not just parachutists.
The Russian navy's landed.
That means they've captured the whole west half of the island.
Will you tell me, what's all this about parachutists?
There's a shore party of nine men off a Russian submarine, stranded.
My God. It's all over. It's finished.
We haven't got a chance, not a chance.
My God, how could such a thing happen?
Listen. All they...
We're surrounded! The navy's here!
You're in charge here, aren't you?
One of those Russians, he told us, he said the other eight are coming here to Gloucester Haven, to the harbor.
He said they wanted to get a boat.
Sam, we've got to do something.
You listen to me.
- Call Link and tell him what's happened.
- Link's out at the airport.
- We've just got to do something.
- What?
I'll tell you what.
We gotta call the President!
What?
The President of the United States.
He's got that there hot line.
- You've heard about that?
- Sure.
He'll either know what's happening, or he'll get on the hot line and find out.
The Russians are... Just a second!
Those Russians just told me...
You can't use a hot line.
That's not for us to...
Hello, yes?
It's true, Mr. Carmichael.
It seems that the Russians have landed.
One small noise, you are dead.
You believe me?
Yes, I believe you.
Hello, Beatrice.
Hello, beauty. We got a big job to do.
Come here, Beatrice.
Come here, sweetie. Take it easy now.
This way.
One small noise, and you are dead.
Where's Kolchin?
Who?
I don't know. He ran away.
We had a struggle, you see.
I took away his gun.
You took Kolchin's gun? You?
Kolchin would not run away.
He would stay near house.
This is what he was told.
He was?
You mean, he's still there?
He wouldn't do anything to hurt...
We have big problem here.
We cannot get boat except kill some men by boat place.
I don't care about your problem.
Would that kid do anything to harm my family?
- If he touches them...
- No, Kolchin is good boy.
Is doing nothing howsoever to hurt anybody.
Not to be worried, only listen.
Has Coastal Guardians or Navy of United States been told that we are here, yes or no?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Some men in a bar down the street, they were speaking about telephoning the President.
What is communications with mainland?
- You mean, the telephone office?
- Yes.
It's right upstairs.
- Is there a battle going on at the airport?
- Office of telephone is upstairs?
Are there are parachutists all over...
- There are parachutists on island?
- No. I mean Russian parachutists.
Everybody on the island is saying that...
Everybody on the island is crazy!
How many people in office of telephone?
I don't know.
Can I give you some advice?
You'll never make it down to the harbor.
Why don't you give yourselves up?
Either you'll kill somebody, or you'll get killed.
Either way, you could start a war.
- What is your name?
- Whittaker, Walt.
Pay mark to this, we must have boat.
Even now, may be too late.
This is your island,
I make your responsibility.
You help us get boat quickly, otherwise there is World War III, and everybody is blaming you.
Hello. He said they were trying to get a boat. Is that right?
They were trying to get a boat?
The fellow said the Russian said they're trying to get a boat.
Tell you what we gotta do.
We gotta post a dozen men there with guns to keep an eye on those boats.
That's right.
Will you put that drink down?
You've had enough of that stuff.
But, Norman, I've already paid for it.
Hello. Alice? Where the hell is she?
I don't know whether Chief Mattocks has alerted anybody, Mr. Nelson. Hold on.
Just a minute, please.
All I know is...
Mr. Nelson! You've got no right to address me in a tone like that!
You want the who? The President?
Mattocks.
Let's see what the butcher boy wants.
All right.
Well?
Hold on a minute. Look, the airport's only half a mile away.
We can't just barge in, like going to the ball park.
We gotta have a plan.
Let's leave the cars here, and sneak up there and surround them.
Old "Blood and Guts" Hawkins.
I thought you wanted to lead the charge, General.
What's the matter, you getting a little queasy now?
- You got no right to speak to me like that.
- Yes, I have.
- With my military experience?
- Come on, Charlie, let's get out of here.
Come on, what are we waiting for?
Let me get in here.
Fendall, will you stop poking me with that sword?
Come on, lady, just be nice and calm.
Not nice and calm.
You don't say a word, and we don't kill you, yes?
Nice and calm.
I think he means it, ma'am, so please don't scream or anything.
They're kind of desperate.
- But who are you?
- My name is Whittaker, they...
- Mr. Walter Whittaker?
- Yes.
- Didn't you rent the old Selwyn place?
- Yes.
I've put through some of your calls to New York City. I'm Miss Foss.
Lady!
You and Whittaker Walt, you have nice conversation some other day, yes?
You had some idea of getting men from boat place?
No!
Unless you create a diversion.
What kind of diversion, please?
Send some of your men out of town, and let them fire their guns in the air.
It's great idea.
I send my men 50 paces, and...
I congratulate you on extreme genius of this idea.
- Not if you all disguised yourself.
- What?
Like with those clothes downstairs at the cleaners.
You could sneak through town, and no one would notice.
Is good.
Are you really trying to help them?
Are you on their side?
Of course I'm not! How could you say...
I think it would be a whole lot pleasanter if a lot of people didn't get killed.
All they're trying to do is borrow a motorboat.
- What did they say?
- I don't know, I'm not with them.
Hi.
Excuse me, please. I am here still.
Please, you should not be frightened of me.
Here.
You see? You.
I give you gun.
I'm not frightened.
Your forehead's bleeding.
- Guns?
- Where are they?
Who? What do you mean?
- The parachutists.
- The Russians.
What? What are you?
The Russian parachutists.
We got reports that they were...
Quiet! Let's get to the bottom of this.
Stanley, we know that this whole island is under attack.
Where did they go?
I didn't see anybody.
Have you been sleeping, Stanley?
No.
Come on now, admit it.
No.
Are you trying to tell us that nothing at all has happened here?
Will you shut up?
Think, Stanley.
- There was one thing that happened.
- What happened?
My phone is out of order.
I just discovered it this morning.
His phone is out of order.
That could be significant.
All the phones on the whole west side of the island are out.
Where are you going?
We're going over to Muriel Everett's house and check her telephone line.
After that, we're gonna go home.
The rest of you go on home, too. Go on.
Wait a minute!
Don't shove that thing in my face, Fendall.
Go on home, like I told you to.
You're not giving orders to my detail.
We are going, too.
Stay behind this jeep. Just follow me.
To your cars.
We're moving to West Village.
Emergency. Everybody to get from street.
Emergency. Everybody to get from street.
Dear, kind lady.
Sincerest apologies for what we do here.
For you, your equipment, for all of this.
Whittaker Walt, if you're a man who makes prayers, this is time for special prayer that all is going well.
I say goodbye for second time, yes?
Miss Foss, can you hear me?
On the count of three, let's roll over to the wall.
When I say three, follow me. Here we go.
One, two, three. No, get off me!
Annie, go play in the sand.
You'll feel better when you eat something.
Here.
I'm sure you'll feel better.
What?
What will become with me?
I must be arrested, surely.
But will Americans place me in prison?
I am...
I confess to you,
I have much fear of what will happen with me.
A Russian seaman in America.
Don't be afraid.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
What's your name?
Kolchin. Alexei Kolchin.
- What is your name, please?
- Alison. Alison Palmer.
Can I call you Alexei?
I never met anyone called Alexei before.
Here. Eat.
When I say three, press forward.
We're going to stand up.
But whatever you do, don't fall over.
One, two... Don't fall over!
Emergency.
Everybody to get from street.
Hey, Mom!
Just take it easy, Beatrice.
Hop, that's it, Miss Foss.
No, not that way. That way.
Hold it! Please.
Let's try to turn around. We can hop better if we face each other, I think.
All right now, try turning around.
Here we go!
Courage.
All right now, let's start hopping.
Here we go.
Gloucester.
Gloucester Haven.
Hop. Good. Miss Foss, over here.
Don't pull that way.
We're not going over this way!
This way. Here we come.
Wonderful, Miss Foss.
You're doing fine. Just a moment.
We may have a problem here.
- A what?
- I said, we may have a problem here.
Wait, Miss Foss. Courage.
Let's try it, Miss Foss.
We're going to go down one step at a time.
When I say three, hop.
Hop?
One, two...
Come out, you guys.
Sorry.
- The Russians, they're out here.
- Come on, you guys, down to the jetty!
Walt!
We're fine, Miss Foss.
Over here. This way!
You're doing beautifully.
Come down to my step, only one step.
You're doing fine, but don't lean that way.
Miss Foss.
Come on, you guys, let's head on back to our cars.
Let's head back to the
East Shore Road. Hurry up.
- Come on, everybody. Back to your cars.
- That's East Shore Road, boys.
- Are you all right, Miss Foss?
- I think so.
I think I'm gonna faint.
- Don't faint until you roll off me.
- Yes.
You're squashing me!
Just roll over, lightly.
What's the matter?
Sounds like it's coming from the harbor.
It's your father! It's Daddy.
- Walt, are you all right? What happened?
- I'm all right.
- Who's she?
- Did the Russians do it, Dad?
What happened?
- Take the gag out, and I'll tell you!
- He's okay, he's alive!
Alice!
Take her gag out.
Alice, what did they do to you?
Out!
No boat in the harbor could catch that cruiser.
Don't you think I know that?
All of you armed men, follow me.
You unarmed men, clear off the streets.
We're gonna head out that East Shore Road.
Keep your eye on that cruiser.
A shell!
Go get some more, Annie.
Go find some shells.
In Union of Soviet, when I am only young boy, many are saying
Americans are bad people.
They will attack Russians.
So all mistrust American.
But I think that I do not mistrust American.
Not really sinceriously.
I wish not to hate anybody.
This makes good reason to you,
Alison Palmer?
Of course it does.
It doesn't make sense to hate people.
It's such a waste of time.
But it does not matter now.
Something has gone amiss.
Else otherwise Rozanov, he is my officer, he would have come back for me.
But I think now that everything is completed for me.
They tried to draw everybody away from the harbor so they could steal the boat.
They tied us up upstairs and...
Where's Annie?
She's home. She's at the house.
Don't worry, Walt. Alison's with her.
You shouldn't have left her there.
That boy's liable to do anything.
- What boy?
- That boy, Kolchin.
They'll stop at nothing.
There's no limit to what they'll do.
They'll be shooting people in the streets.
They'll be grabbing our kids and using them as hostages!
Hostages? Come on, we gotta get Annie.
Walt, Pete!
Get in the car!
- What are you doing?
- I've got to borrow your car. Give me that!
- It isn't even paid for!
- I'll explain later. You'll get your car back.
He took my car!
I can't figure out where they all went to.
Who?
The people in West Village.
Who do you think I mean?
Muriel Everett. All of them.
Where did they go?
Nobody there.
- Was that Matt Ferguson?
- Yeah, looked like his car.
Where's he think he's going? Who's that?
Looked a lot like that New Yorker fellow.
Took the old Selwyn place this summer.
- Name's Whittaker.
- That nut!
There's some bullets in the back.
Do you want me to load the gun?
Just sit still.
Take those bullets away from him.
- Just turn around.
- You shouldn't have left them alone.
You've no idea how desperate those men are.
- You said we'd be perfectly safe.
- Who knew they would...
- Walt!
- What?
- Not so fast.
- It's all right. Don't panic.
Everything's gonna be all right.
He might do anything.
- What do you mean?
- He...
Just don't panic!
Why didn't you stay in the house where you should've?
You just never listen!
Link, they were here!
They were shooting all over the place!
They stole the senator's cabin cruiser!
They wrecked the telephone office!
Nearly killed Alice Foss!
See, what did I tell you?
- Where are they now? Where's Norman?
- Up the East Shore Road!
Norm's chasing them!
They were here! Fendall! They were here!
Some of them are in disguise!
Some of them look like us!
Get them! Up the East Shore Road!
Gustav! Come back here!
If I am to be imprisoned, could you perhaps come and see me there?
If I could be a little with you, on some occasion,
I think I would say,
"Never mind,
I have my friend, Alison Palmer."
Is permitted to say that I have strong feeling of affection for you already?
Does this cause offensiveness to you?
You kissed me.
This mean the same as in
Union of Soviet Socialist Republic, yes?
Kolchin!
They must be all right.
Who'd want to harm them?
I'll get the gun.
Give me that gun, please.
Wait in the car, both of you.
Give me those...
Just stay behind me.
How do you load this darn thing?
Just get behind me, will you?
Stay back of me.
- I don't see anybody. I don't see Annie...
- In the house.
I'm frightened.
Stay back there.
- Be careful.
- Never mind.
- What are you gonna do?
- Annie!
Hey, where's my gun?
Come back! Stop or I'll fire.
He's in there.
Annie!
Come here. Here, take this.
They've got Annie!
You, stop.
Stop, or I'll fire. Where's my daughter?
I warn you to stop or I'll kill you!
Hello, Mommy!
Always I am saying goodbye to you, and always I am meeting you again.
Alison, where were you?
We looked all over for you.
You better surrender, 'cause my dad has a gun, so you just better surrender.
Are you hurt?
I am wounded in dignity only.
Please, I know everybody in this island is complete and total crazy.
But you, Whittaker Walt, you are crazy, too?
- I came back here only to get Kolchin.
- But I thought...
We saw this strange car here, don't you see?
We thought something happened to Annie, our daughter.
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to...
I was trying to kill you,
I'll admit that, but it wasn't...
I mean, it wasn't anything personal.
- Don't do it no more.
- I promise, I won't.
The last time I'll shoot anybody.
Peace.
You're wasting ammunition.
Knock it off. Cease fire.
It's no use.
You're wasting your ammunition.
We gotta head them off.
I tried to tell you, let's get the boat.
You tried to tell me nothing.
I finally got you.
We chased them out here.
They're going around the island.
Get in. Come on, Charlie, put that away.
We gotta get started.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.
- Get out of the way, Fendall.
Listen, Mattocks, I'm warning you.
This whole operation has been a foul-up.
- And it's your fault.
- What?
You brought us out here, and you let them get away.
- I'm warning you.
- You're warning me?
You big, incompetent flatfoot.
That does it. That did it.
I'll punch him in the jaw.
I'm holding you responsible.
As commander of the civilian forces in this emergency,
I'm charging you with treason.
Give me that thing.
You see that?
That's the Dexter F.
Meadows Memorial Sword.
Yeah.
You traitorous fink!
For God's sake, why is it we can't learn to live together?
You're right, Norman.
Let's get organized here.
You can do it, beauty.
Steady there. Come on.
Now we're going. Now we're swinging.
We ought to call the Coast Guard and the Navy.
This thing's too big for us.
If it was a sub, it'd be clear out to sea by now, Chief.
We've still gotta call them.
But the phones are out. They're all out.
- Then we'll radio.
- Ed Spooner's got a radio in his store.
Whittaker Walt, this is very bad.
This captain has bad temper.
These people should get away!
What am I supposed to do?
Tommy, let's go up to the steeple and see what's going on.
It's impossible.
Alison Palmer, listen.
This is dangerous situation.
- The boat never reached him.
- He wants all men on board.
- He thinks men have been captured.
- Men are missing.
In three minutes, he's going to destroy this town.
Tell him. He can't just...
Captain, sir.
Walt Whittaker.
And he's telling the truth.
You're making a mistake.
You can't go around shooting here.
- He wants to know if you're an official.
- No. I'm a writer.
What do you write?
- He writes musical comedy.
- I'm working on a musical.
Listen, you can't.
Don't you realize you could start a war?
You can't do that.
- Stop, you'll make him mad.
- So what?
Listen. You just... Have you gone crazy?
You get out of here. Tell him.
Reason with him. Talk to him.
- Honey, think of something.
- What am I gonna do?
Their submarine's in the port.
- What's happening?
- I think I can tell you what happened.
What's going on here?
One at a time, now.
The sub got free by itself.
That captain there thinks that somebody...
That captain there, he thinks somebody's holding his men.
Unless somebody produces them, he says, he's gonna open fire on the town.
- He does, does he? That right?
- That's what he says.
- Who's that one?
- He's all right.
- What?
- I mean, he's with me.
- What do you mean?
- He's been to my house.
To your what?
What did he say?
He says that you have one minute.
- I have one minute for what?
- Before he begins shooting.
It looks like we got a situation here.
That's what it looks like to me.
All right, you tell the captain he's under arrest.
Tell the captain he's under arrest.
Norman, get the women and kids out of here.
He says...
- He is angry, yes?
- Yeah.
He says, you stupid idiot, he will blow up the town.
I'm going over to Ed Spooner's.
I'll radio the Air Command.
Look out.
All right.
Let's have your name and address.
You.
Tell him this, and get it straight.
He's under arrest.
You're all under arrest.
You come in here, scaring people half to death.
You steal cars and motorboats.
You cause damage to private property.
Then you threaten the whole community with grievous bodily harm and maybe murder.
Now, we ain't gonna take no more of that. See?
We may be scared.
I am, anyway.
But maybe we ain't so scared as you think we are.
Now, you say you're gonna blow up the town?
Well, I say all right.
You start shooting and see what happens.
Watch out!
Mommy! Daddy! Help him!
Hang on, Jerry!
Get something to catch him in.
Get the fire truck.
No, it'd take too long. We need a rope.
- Get a ladder.
- We make ladder.
We make ladder of men.
What are we going to do?
Please, Mommy!
They're coming to get you, baby, it's all right.
Okay, get up.
You get on my shoulders.
Walt, hang on, honey.
Push it. Hold it.
Some more people, please.
Please don't move.
Careful!
Too slippery. We need more men.
Help. Get me down.
Mommy, Daddy, help me.
Get up, boy. Hold on. Tight.
Take boy.
- You okay, Norman?
- I'm fine.
My shoulder hurts a bit, but...
We got the kid, didn't we?
Look out. Let me through here.
Get out of the way!
Quiet!
Listen to me. Quiet!
I got them!
I got the Air Force, and they're calling the Coast Guard and the Navy.
The whole bunch will be here inside of five minutes.
Now you're gonna see something.
Say, what is this?
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I got through to them on Ed Spooner's radio.
They're on their way.
You better get going.
It's not possible.
It's not enough time.
I still have seven men on the boat.
It's not possible.
It isn't fair.
Think of something.
We could give them an escort.
I mean, we could use all the little boats out in the harbor.
A convoy.
An escort?
Could we do that, Link?
Go out with them.
Take them out of the harbor.
Can we help them get away, Dad, can we?
Anybody wants to go with them,
I ain't gonna stop them.
What?
Charlie, get over here, will you?
I must go.
But I promise my word to you that I see you again.
All right, get that thing out of here.
Come on.
Move it out.
You and I, Alison Palmer, we have, somehow, a long life of peaceful coexistence.
Hey, can you drive a big boat like this?
Turn boat around quickly.
Be careful and jump.
There they are.
- Tiny Tim control. Juliet Papa 3-8.
- Roger, 3-8.
It's a Russian, running on the surface.
Heading zero, niner, zero.
Must be the same one the Navy had alert on.
- Listen, the Russians are being escorted.
- Say again?
She's got an escort. There are
15 or 20 small boats down there.
There are 100 or more people on those boats.
Request instructions.
Juliet Papa 3-8.
Recalled and return to base.
We'll find out what it was about later.
Somebody ought to know.
Roger. How about that, Charlie Brown?
They didn't do anything!
The Russians are coming!
In 1936, a thousand years of history exploded in Spain.
The forces of nationalism joined together...
...against the forces of the Republic.
Soon the whole world found itself involved in this struggle.
The whole world looked toward Spain.
In 1939, the Spanish Civil War came to an end.
These were the men who lost...
...crossing the border into France...
...and exile.
Hey, Manuel.
Where are you going?
Come back!
Manuel Artiguez, it's no use!
There's nothing more we can do.
Manuel, the war's over.
Why don't you give up?
Come on.
My name is Paco Dages.
I'm an orphan.
My friend, Luis, is taking me to the French border.
I will live in a French city called Pau...
...with my Uncle Antonio...
...and with many other
Spanish exiles.
I hope to find someone else too:
The great leader of the guerrillas,
Manuel Artiguez.
This is called Verdoriz.
Over there, that's France.
Remember what I told you:
Stay away from the French police.
And don't run, running's noisy.
You don't wanna attract attention close to the border.
If a policeman finds out you don't speak French...
...and you can't explain where you live...
You see that village down there?
That one? That's Pedro's.
Wait till Pedro finds out you're José Dages' son.
He'll spread the purple carpet, believe me.
Good luck, Paco.
I hope I see you again someday.
- You forgot the cross.
- Don't tell me you started to believe...
...in priests and churches and crosses and stuff like that?
You don't wanna carry this around.
It belonged to my mother.
There. Now you've got your whole inheritance.
Goodbye.
Your father was a brave man.
Remember him.
I will.
And don't forget the man who killed him either.
Now, let's see if you can jump from Spain to France.
Pedro.
Pedro!
There's a boy outside.
There's a boy outside!
Oh, yes. Yes!
Hello! Hello!
You must be Paco!
Welcome! Welcome!
How long have you been waiting out here?
Not long, I hope.
Come in, come in.
Isabel, let's have some breakfast for the son of José Dages!
Do you know who this is?
- My father.
- And that's me.
My father was young.
Everybody was young in those days.
You know him?
Everyone who loves Spain and freedom should know who that is.
Manuel Artiguez, my father's friend.
Yes.
Do you know him?
Yes, I know him.
Do you know where he lives?
He lives near your uncle in Pau, in the Spanish street.
Why has he stopped making raids into Spain?
For 20 years he's gone over four, five times a year.
He's made a fool of Captain Vinolas and all his police.
How I wish he would come back one day...
...and kill Vinolas for murdering my father.
No.
No. He won't go again.
His heart has gone out of him.
They say at home, in San Martin...
...Manuel will always come back when he's needed.
- You didn't lose your uncle's address?
- No.
- Good luck, Paco.
- Goodbye.
Excuse me, sir, is this the Spanish street?
Hey! He's pretty good.
- Are you Spanish?
- Of course I'm Spanish.
- Do you want to play on my side?
- I can't. I have to find somebody.
Who?
- Manuel Artiguez.
- Who?
- Oh, you know, the bandit.
- He's not a bandit.
- He's a very important man.
- Why?
- Because he's a leader.
- A leader?
- Of what?
- What difference does it make?
Oh, that was a long time ago.
Come on, everybody, kick the ball!
Do you know him?
No, but I have to find him.
Do you know where he lives?
Over there. Number 17, on the top floor.
Why do you want to see him?
Come in.
What do you want?
Good morning, sir.
Does Senor Artiguez live here?
He does. Who are you?
Are you his father?
- Who sent you here?
- I'm Paco Dages.
- The son of José Dages?
- Yes.
- Who sent you to me?
- You? Are you Senor Artiguez?
What is it you want, boy?
Did you hear about my father?
Yes, I heard.
Now, why did you come here?
What did you hear?
Answer my question.
What is it you want?
I want you to kill Vinolas.
Kill Vinolas.
Go away, boy.
Thought I told you to get out of here.
Vinolas killed my father because of you.
What?
They beat him, but he would not talk about you.
In the hospital, Vinolas asked him questions every day...
...but he would not talk.
How would you know?
They wouldn't let you in the ward.
I found a way to get in.
And they let you stay?
Not every day.
Not the day he died.
If my father had told them about you, they would not have killed him.
What your father did was his business.
And what I do is mine.
Now, get out of here, boy. Get out!
Kill Vinolas.
What is it they want?
I've done enough!
Captain Vinolas, we are ready!
Captain Vinolas, we are ready!
Let him out.
Open up!
Hey, toro.
Where are you?
- I like your horse.
- Thank you, Captain Vinolas.
- What's his name?
- Nino.
Nino.
I would be very honored if you accept him as a gift.
You know I can't accept gifts.
Perhaps you'd like to buy him at a reasonable price, captain?
That's a possibility.
Your hands are very rough, darling.
You made me forget something.
What?
A promise.
About going to Lourdes.
I promised.
Not when.
I told you, as soon as I can.
When? When? When?
Oh, darling, you've been promising for so long.
Please, you know how important it is to me...
...my pilgrimage to Lourdes.
For your sins?
I'll take you. During my vacation.
Excuse me, senora...
Gala! Come back.
Gala!
- What is it?
- The telephone, senora.
- Who is it?
- For Captain Vinolas.
My office?
Your wife, sir.
What did you tell her?
I thought... I thought it was his office, so...
You didn't say he was here?
Hello, dear.
I'm sorry to bother you...
...but when something important happens...
...I think people should swallow their pride and do what must be done.
That's why I've called you, and for no other reason.
Well, Teresa, that's very nice of you.
You apparently told your office you were coming home.
Yeah, I did... I was, but... But I...
Well, it doesn't matter.
But they've called three times,
I thought it must be important.
That's the only reason
I've called you.
Thank you. I'm very grateful, dear.
How are you feeling? Any better?
It doesn't matter.
I don't want to keep you from your work with discussions of my health.
You better call your office now.
Goodbye.
Why did that fool, Zaganar, call there in the first place?
This is Captain Vinolas.
Get me Lieutenant Zaganar.
- Yes, captain?
- Why did you call my home?
I'm terribly sorry, captain, but there's a new man on the switchboard.
I hope it didn't cause you any inconvenience.
What did you want?
We made a routine check on Manuel Artiguez's mother.
- What about her?
- We found that she's seriously ill.
- How seriously?
- She's not expected to recover, sir.
I'll be there in five minutes.
What is it, darling?
Manuel Artiguez. His mother's sick, not expected to live.
- Does that mean he'll be coming here?
- I think so.
If his mother is sick, isn't it a point of honor?
You'll get him this time.
You'll be ready for him.
It'll be hard to set a trap around his mother's house.
The neighbors will tell her.
She'll send word for him not to come.
Her house?
She's not in the hospital?
Nobody likes to go to the hospital.
When it's time to die, what can a hospital do that...?
The woman doesn't want to go to the hospital.
We're not gonna ask her permission.
I'll send an ambulance for her, sir.
I sincerely believe she'll be more comfortable in a hospital, don't you?
Without a doubt, sir.
How's the old woman?
She hasn't eaten a thing since she's been here.
She refused a blood transfusion this morning.
She won't talk to anyone, not even to the priest.
Where is she?
I'd like to see her.
She's there, by the window.
But, captain, we have no room for our employees to stay here overnight.
- They'll have to sleep on the floor.
- We have some very sick patients.
I'm issuing a statement that a highly contagious case has been discovered.
And the hospital has had to be temporarily sealed off...
...to avoid an epidemic.
Surely you're not going to detain the doctors too?
The doctors can come and go as they please.
- And the priests?
- Also the priests.
I don't see how I can resist the Guardia Civil.
You can't, senora.
Sergeant, tell the special detachments to move into position...
...but to take every precaution to avoid attracting attention.
I'll make an inspection tour in 15 minutes.
- Yes, captain.
- Lieutenant.
Lieutenant...
...I don't want anybody to know why we're doing this.
Artiguez may have sympathizers in the hospital.
- Or even here.
- I hardly expect that, sir.
What we hardly expect, lieutenant, is what hurts us the most.
Any questions?
Yes, sir.
One.
What if Artiguez doesn't know his mother is in the hospital?
I'll see that he finds out.
Paco! Hey, Paco! Wait!
Paco, wait!
Hey, Paco, wait!
- I have to go to my French teacher.
- Senor Artiguez wants to see you.
- Why?
- I don't know.
- I don't like him.
- He says it's very important.
Tell me, Paco...
...how well do you remember the hospital in San Martin?
- Why?
- My mother is there.
They won't let her leave the country.
Even now, they keep a strict watch on her.
Is she very sick?
Yeah.
- Are you going to see her?
- That depends.
I remember the hospital well.
Thank you, Gusano.
Now, what's next door to the hospital?
Houses.
Oh, that's right.
What's across the street?
A bakery.
It has two delivery trucks.
They drive in from the other street.
You mean some of the buildings have entrances from two different streets?
The hospital is like that too.
They brought my father in from the other side.
Do you remember if the roofs are joined together?
Or is there a gap in between?
Joined together.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Celestina.
- Did Carlos come?
- He did...
...but he's already gone back.
You can look after the kitchen first, Celestina.
She likes Carlos.
He's the smuggler who brought the word about my mother.
Now, the hospital.
Is there much street lighting in front of it?
Yes, it's very bright.
When does the night porter take over?
At 9:00.
Where does he stay most of the time?
He has a...
Well, I could draw it for you.
Celestina! Bring some paper.
What about the stairs?
Are they wide or narrow?
Wide from the ground floor to the next floor.
After that, there are two narrow ones.
And which floor is the women's ward on?
Second.
This is the men's ward, here, on this side.
And this is the women's ward.
Women's ward, left.
Men's ward, right.
I've got to memorize all that.
Let me study this for a while.
Paco.
You've been a great help to me.
I want to give you a present.
Is there something you'd like?
Try to bump into Vinolas.
Celestina, why don't you stop fooling around with mere boys like Carlos...
...and get yourself a real man, like me?
I like a man who works for a living.
- He's only a smuggler.
- At least it's an honest job.
Majias, wait a minute.
Stop here.
- Are you getting out, sir?
- Yes.
Church?
- Lf there's word from Carlos, call me.
- Yes, sir.
Please help me to get Artiguez.
I wouldn't ask you this...
...but I've been after him all these years, and always he's escaped.
He's your enemy too.
He's killed my men and robbed this country.
If I don't get him, my superiors will think that I failed in my duty...
...and they'll replace me.
I'll go to Lourdes.
I won't take Rosana.
I'll give back the horse.
Please, God, it's been 20 years.
Let me have this victory.
There will be two plainclothes men just inside the main entrance.
Two on each floor.
And the bakery truck will be by the loading platform.
Don't put more than four riflemen in the back.
They won't have room to...
- What was that, Majias?
- No news of Carlos, sir.
If I don't hear from him in one hour,
I'm going to deploy the men.
So soon?
Excuse me, sir, but won't that give his friends a chance to warn him?
I can't help that.
It's 2:35 already.
Artiguez could conceivably be here by now.
- In daylight?
- Why not?
He might come in daylight just because we don't expect him.
Damn that Carlos.
Why this way?
You wouldn't want to be seen going through the front.
They might think you were the lady's client.
- Who pays her rent?
- She has a lot of uncles.
More than any girl in town.
This should be a good temporary office for you, sir.
Four windows overlooking the hospital.
I said we're expecting a burglary and need her apartment for surveillance.
- Where is it?
- The fourth floor.
She must be popular if she can make her clients climb four floors.
Hope we're not disturbing you too much.
Always glad to be of service to the Guardia Civil, captain.
Oh, thanks for the telephone.
I've tried to get one for a year.
- I told her she could keep it, sir.
- Good.
Good.
Must've been inconvenient without a phone.
Very.
They told you we'll have to keep you in custody till this is over?
I've been in custody before.
It's worth it, to meet so many new friends.
You don't need new friends, my dear.
You need better friends.
Quality, not quantity.
Who knows? I may even get some of that now that I have a telephone.
Very good, Sanchez.
Couldn't be better.
- Is the sniper on the hospital roof?
- Yes, sir.
I can't see him.
- But then that's good, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
But I can see the men in the porter's office.
- Tell them to close the curtains.
- Yes, sir.
- How soon will those be ready?
- The walkie-talkie's operating now.
- The telephone?
- Not yet.
- And the radio?
- In a few minutes.
Hurry the telephone.
I'm out of contact with the station.
- They say it'll be an hour.
- An hour?
They have to bring the lines from the street.
Go to my car, see if there's any report on Carlos.
Who, sir?
- Just ask Lt. Zaganar to come up here.
- Yes, sir.
See if you can talk to the gun stations.
Hello? Number two, porter's office, this is number one.
Come in, number two.
Come in, number three.
Number three, bakery truck, on station.
Come in, number four.
Number four, on station.
Good afternoon, senora.
Are you comfortable?
I'm Father Ramon.
Is there anything I can do?
Go bless the rifles of the firing squad, priest.
I'm afraid you've stopped by the wrong bed, Father.
I'm sorry. I'm new here.
I'm taking Father Francisco's place.
Oh, yes. I hear he's finally getting his trip to Lourdes.
That's all he's talked about for days.
It means a great deal to him, doesn't it?
Francisco.
Francisco.
You're wanted on the phone.
- Who is it?
- Father Ramon, at the hospital.
Thank you.
Father Esteban.
Father Esteban.
Are you packed and ready,
Father Esteban?
Bed 24? Are you sure?
Isn't that the old woman who...?
Why won't she speak to anyone but me?
But we're leaving the seminary in...
...59 minutes though.
I know it's a sacred duty, but surely if you explain to her...
I can't miss my train to Lourdes.
I've been waiting too long.
The hospital is 20 minutes from here.
How could I get there and back in time?
How much of the street can you control?
As far as I can see, sir, with this.
Sir. Sir, they've picked up Carlos!
Good.
Just a minute, Father.
Excuse me, Father.
Wait a minute, please.
Aren't you the day porter?
Why are you still here?
- Why another priest?
- This one is the regular Padre.
The one before was a replacement.
- Why does he need a replacement?
- Don't ask me.
Priests come and go all day here.
- You can go upstairs, Father.
- What's happening here?
They think there's an epidemic in one of the wards.
Be careful, Father.
What is the epidemic, matron?
Well, the tests, we haven't heard from the laboratory yet.
I hoped you'd already left.
Are you in pain?
Send her away.
No, I'm not in pain.
I'm about to die.
The Lord giveth and taketh.
Mostly taketh.
Do you know who I am?
It is not the custom to ask for names.
The mother of Manuel Artiguez.
We're all alike before God.
What about heathens?
Would your God grant the last wish of a heathen?
I've heard them say you're on your way to Lourdes.
You'll be passing through Pau.
My son is in Pau.
Seventeen Spanish street.
They know he will come to see me.
They want to kill him.
Let me give you the sacrament.
I don't want your sacrament.
I want you to save my son.
Vinolas' men will kill him.
I can't do anything against the police.
I can't break the law.
Whose laws do you priests follow...
...God's laws or Vinolas'?
You're a priest, have mercy on me.
Save my son.
Save...
Save my son.
I think she's going.
Call Dr. Riva.
I'm Lieutenant Zaganar of the Guardia Civil.
Will you come with me, please?
They're bringing Carlos in a jeep.
- Let me know when you see him.
- Yes, sir.
Father Francisco?
Captain Vinolas.
Won't you sit down, Father?
May I offer you a cigarette?
Thank you.
You were called in to the hospital to attend Pilar Artiguez...
...mother of Manuel Artiguez.
Yes.
You know who he is, Father.
The bandit who desecrated the holy church.
Yes, during the Civil War.
Yes, a long time ago, but desecrations nevertheless.
I want to confide in you, Father.
I've set a trap for him.
That's why we're keeping the hospital closed off.
Tell me, did she say anything about her son?
You know I can't tell you what she said.
We mustn't forget the clergy and
Guardia Civil are on the same side.
Both trying to serve our country. You by prayers, and I by enforcing the law.
I can't tell you.
Excuse me, sir.
They're on their way up with Carlos.
Tell them to bring him in.
Every citizen must help defeat the enemies of our nation, Father.
If you try to force me to tell you something my vows forbid me to tell...
...then you are also desecrating the church.
Father, I'm not forcing you to anything.
I only hope you know where your duty lies.
I hope so too.
- Well?
- He's not coming.
- What do you mean, he's not coming?
- Not tonight, anyway.
What happened?
He's turned into a cautious man.
He doesn't want to come unless it's necessary.
Now he wants me to come back again and bring him the latest news on Pilar.
- Can you get back to Pau tomorrow?
- I've crossed...
- Do you want the reward?
- Of course I do, but l...
Hello.
I'll be there in a minute.
Don't let anybody in or out.
And don't let anybody touch her.
She has died.
The old bitch.
Damn her.
What difference does it make if she's dead?
As long as Artiguez doesn't know it.
We'll keep the hospital sealed off.
No telephone service, nothing.
You've gotta get to Pau tomorrow morning.
- I have to get some sleep.
- You'll sleep when this is over.
You'll tell him the doctors only give her a couple of days to live.
She's asking to see her son.
Now, that's the most important.
She is trying to see him.
I'll convince him.
Lieutenant, relieve the men on special duty.
Sergeant, get him a car.
I'll have to issue a statement about the epidemic.
I'll talk to the matron, see the authorities.
- Good evening, Father.
- Good evening.
Father Francisco. Father Francisco.
Father Francisco, get in here quickly.
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?!
Get in.
What's the matter with you, Father?
Are you trying to make all of us miss our train to Lourdes?
I had to spend seminary funds to come after you in a taxi. A taxi.
You should remember your vows of poverty, Father.
Driver, back to the seminary.
Hurry up, Francisco.
- Hey.
- What?
Your bag is here, on the truck.
- I must speak to you, Father.
- You will miss your train, Francisco.
It's something urgent, a question of deathbed wishes against...
In other words, does the law take precedence, I suppose...
Francisco, we are going to leave you here if you don't come immediately.
Would you like to stay here and discuss it with me?
Francisco, come on.
No, Father, thank you.
Goodbye.
- Have a good trip.
- Goodbye.
- Why don't you sleep?
- I am too excited.
And I have a lot to think about.
I shall bathe in the holy spring so that I shall get better.
There is nothing the matter with you.
Oh, yes, there is.
We all know I am not right.
Ever since...
Ever since...
It was a bandit, wasn't it?
He knocked me down.
What was his name?
Stamp? Stamp for letter.
Stamp, please. Letter.
No, no. Pau.
Mailbox?
Please. Please take it.
It's very important.
It is for Pau. Please.
My ticket's on that train.
I have no money.
Don't run on the stairs.
Carlos is asleep.
Did you bring news?
- My mother is worse.
- You are going back?
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you came.
I need somebody to stay here while I go out for a few minutes.
I'm expecting Pedro.
Tell him I'll be right back.
- Don't let him wake up Carlos.
- I won't.
What would you like for a present, besides Vinolas' head?
You are not going to get it back this time.
Enough is enough.
You think these olives grow on trees?
Play somewhere else.
You think we have no defense from wild animals like you?
Stay away from here. Stay away.
Good morning.
Does Manuel Artiguez live here?
I'm Father Francisco.
I come from San Martin.
- I must speak to Senor Artiguez.
- He's out.
Can you tell me where I can find him?
It's very urgent.
His life depends on it.
Can you give him a message?
Will you give him this letter?
Please tell him he must not go to San Martin.
His mother is dead.
Will you please tell him that?
She is not dead.
She passed away at 8:00 last night.
I spoke to her before she died.
I beg you to find him and do as I tell you.
Please.
Give him this letter.
I can't stay any longer. I'm on my way to Lourdes and I must hurry.
Thank you.
Manuel.
Manuel.
Manuel.
Paco, I'm glad to see you.
You'll wake up Carlos.
He's already here?
- Where's Manuel?
- He'll be back in a few minutes.
My old woman sent you a cake.
It's in the car.
Pedro...
...is meeting a priest bad luck?
- Yes, it is.
For the priest.
Hey, Carlos, he'll have to wake up sooner or later.
Pedro, do priests ever tell the truth?
They might, in their dreams.
Hey, Manuel.
Thank you.
Why don't you go on out, give it a try?
I've got something to tell you.
First, I'll wake up Carlos.
- Is it yours?
- Yes.
- May I hold it?
- Bounce it.
Oh, look.
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?
They took your ball, huh?
Well, don't come to me. I'm busy.
If they took your ball, you'll have to get it back yourself.
You'll have to learn to do your own fighting.
Go ahead.
It's your football.
I thought he had more fight in him than that.
There are too many for him.
Come with me.
I'll help you get your football.
It's not that.
I know Carlos.
He's an informer.
Manuel.
What's the matter?
The boy says that Carlos is an informer.
What?
I saw him with a Guardia man in San Martin.
The night they beat my father.
Are you sure you saw him with the Guardia Civil?
An officer. The one who questioned my father and me about you.
Maybe he was under arrest.
No, they were friendly.
They went away in a car together.
- You're mistaken, Paco.
- No, I saw him!
He's an informer.
Listen to me.
You don't say things like that unless you know.
I do know!
You don't know.
You can't.
Carlos is my friend.
You've made a mistake.
I don't like him.
He's too eager to make you go.
- He spoke to Pilar only last night.
- How could he?
They don't allow people into hospitals late at night.
He knows a nurse in the women's ward.
He takes her perfume from here, and nylons.
He wouldn't inform on me.
He knows what I would do to him.
If you were trapped in San Martin...
...if you were dead...
...you couldn't do anything to anybody.
It took him such a short time to get here, unless he had a car.
Don't go, Manuel.
Carlos!
Ever seen this boy?
Who is he?
He says he's seen you with a Guardia officer in San Martin.
Me? With the Guardia?
Who the hell is this boy?
He's either mixing me up with someone, or he's just lying.
- Why should he be lying?
- I wouldn't know!
And I don't know why I'm taking all this trouble to bring messages from Pilar...
...if this is all the thanks I get for it!
Everything I took over,
I brought back!
Why?
Because I had no time to get it to my customer!
I had to waste my time with the nurses to get to Pilar!
Pilar is dead!
The boy is raving mad.
I spoke to Pilar at 10:00 last night.
How do you know she's dead, Paco?
The priest told me.
- What priest?
- He brought a letter for you.
- A priest brought Manuel a letter?
- Where's the letter?
I tore it up.
Maybe something's left.
There is nothing.
Pilar is dead. But Pilar has written a letter and asked a priest to deliver it.
What else?
- Where did the priest go?
- To Lourdes.
What made him come here?
He said Pilar had asked him.
Pilar asking a priest.
Did you hear that?
She asked him to warn you not to go.
Look at this.
If there really was a priest...
...and he really brought a letter, why did he tear it up?
If there was a priest, Paco, then why didn't you tell me?
I was afraid you would believe him.
All right!
If there was a priest...
...and he went to Lourdes, we'll go there!
- We'll find him.
- We can go in my car.
- I'll wait here?
- Oh, no!
You're going.
You won't need that.
We are looking for the priests from San Martin.
I think they are over there.
- Is that the one?
- Where?
The old one in front.
No, that's not the one.
Were there any others from San Martin?
- No, there were only five here.
- Are you sure?
That's correct.
There were only five.
I tell you, there was a priest and he said he was coming to Lourdes!
You've been lying to me, you little brat!
Come on, Paco, let's go back to the car.
- I didn't lie! I didn't lie!
- That kid deserves a broken neck.
Goodbye.
Look!
Is that him?
No.
There he is!
There he is!
- Get in, priest.
- Beg your pardon?
I said, get in, priest.
Oh, you're the boy!
Then you must be Artiguez.
You got my message.
- But where are you taking me?
- Back to Pau.
You can't do that! I must join up with my group in Lourdes.
You're going to Pau.
All right, priest. Now, what is this lie about my mother being dead?
It's true.
I'm sorry.
I spoke to her just before she died.
She wouldn't speak to a priest.
She asked me to tell you not to come to San Martin.
You know me.
You want me to believe that a priest would risk his hide to warn me?
Maybe you're not a priest.
Answer me!
You're gonna face Carlos.
- One of you is lying.
- Carlos is lying.
If Carlos is guilty, you won't see him again.
Oh, yes, I will.
He'll come back tonight...
...for his pack.
Well, you can't keep me for the night.
I told you, I must join my friends.
I'll keep you as long as I like...
...till I find out what I want to know.
Paco.
I'm sorry that I hit you.
I hope I'll get to see you again before I go.
You don't believe that I'll go.
There is no reason to go now.
Let's go, priest.
I'll take you home.
Hey, Paco!
Hey, Paco!
I was keeping it for Paco.
Sit down, priest.
All we can do is wait.
Oh, yeah.
He'll be back, all right.
This stuff is worth a fortune to him.
Must have had a few thoughts about those things in your young life, huh?
- What are you planning to do with me?
- Why? Think I might kill you?
Only two years ago one of our priests was in the bank in San Martin...
...when you robbed it.
It knocked him loose from his senses, and he has never recovered.
Priests should stay out of banks.
Thank you.
Why doesn't your god help you now?
Perhaps he is.
He's not feeding you, priest.
I am!
You know why I don't believe your story, priest?
Because it doesn't make sense.
Don't go to sleep.
No, it just doesn't make any sense...
...for a priest to risk his life to warn me.
Besides, if you really are keeping me out of a trap...
...Vinolas is going to find it out...
...and you're gonna be arrested.
What if Vinolas arrests you?
Aren't you scared?
No.
Yes. I'm not a criminal.
Not all the inmates of Spanish prisons are criminals, priest.
Am I a criminal because I raided all those places in Spain?
Look at the way I live. That's how much of the money I kept for myself.
Go ahead, priest, tell me
I'm a bandit.
You know what you are.
Don't feel sorry for me, priest.
There's nothing to feel sorry for.
You stay where you are, priest, until I call you.
And stay awake.
- Who is it?
- Carlos.
It's open.
I've come to pick up my rucksack.
I thought you'd be gone by now.
I was waiting for you.
I thought I'd go back with you.
All right, let's go.
I hope I can still keep up with you.
- Oh, you're probably faster than...
- Than I look.
Sit down.
Have a glass of wine.
I'll be ready in a minute.
All right.
Come on out, priest.
Is that why you feel sorry for me, priest?
Because I'm getting old...
...and it's made a coward out of me?
I knew my mother was sick.
I knew it for days.
And I wanted to go see her, but I kept putting it off.
I couldn't make myself go.
I was afraid to go.
Is that why you feel sorry for me, priest?
Do you feel sorry for yourself?
Aren't you sorry to be so full of violence?
You judge too much, priest.
Is that part of your job?
When you think of it, it's funny.
The informer got away.
The bandit can sit right here in Pau...
...if he wants to and be safe.
The only one who is going to suffer is the priest...
...the man of self-sacrifice and goodwill toward all.
Did the informer really get away?
Is the bandit really safe?
Go to sleep, priest.
Or you can go down to the station, catch your train.
I don't need you anymore.
If that's my train, how can I get to the station?
- Sit down.
- But l...
It's not your train. You've got a few minutes. This is important.
I've thought of a way for you to save your skin.
Just say Carlos is lying.
- It'll be your word against his.
- I'm not going to lie.
A little sin at the right time might save your life.
Get your priests to say you were with them.
Would they lie for you?
They would not, and I wouldn't let them.
Where do you come from, priest?
I was born in Lorca.
Lorca?
Do you know it?
When I was 6 years old,
I went to Lorca every day.
My mother and I used to load the donkey with firewood at dawn.
I'd drive it into Lorca, and I'd stay there until the wood was sold.
I never came back until night.
Then we were neighbors.
Neighbors.
Here, priest, have some wine.
You, born in Lorca.
Funny, I never think of priests being born at all.
Tell me something...
...how did it happen that a Lorca man turned into a priest?
It was during the Civil War.
I was 10 years old.
Some soldiers came to our farm one night and killed my father.
- Why did they kill him?
- We didn't know.
He didn't belong to either side.
Well, which side killed him?
We never found out. It was dark.
We didn't see them.
It wasn't our side.
What difference does it make?
Did either side have a right to take his life?
You'd better go, priest.
Goodbye.
A Lorca man.
Where's Pedro?
Hey.
Manuel.
- Manuel.
- We have to go and dig up the guns.
- Why?
- My mother has died.
I must go home to see her.
Your mother has died?
Then she won't know you're there.
Why are you going back?
- Why?
- Yes, why?
What else can I do?
Yes.
You're right.
Besides, they don't think that I can.
Manuel...
...Artiguez.
You go and get your car, and I'll pay the bill.
Make out Pedro's bill, please.
I'm sorry.
Is that enough?
Too much.
Thank you.
Manuel!
Manuel!
I'm on my way.
I'm ready.
You'll never make it.
You're too drunk.
I'm too drunk?
I'm too drunk?
Get me to San Martin, as fast as you can.
Yes, sir.
Listen very carefully.
When I get out, you drive off at a normal speed.
Don't stop anywhere.
Drive straight back to Elizondo and don't tell anyone you've seen me.
Yes, sir.
Whatever you say, Senor Artiguez.
Stop here.
Remember what I said.
Yes, sir.
Son of a bitch!
Turn off that light!
We've got him!
Can you hear me, sir?
We got him!
Shot dead!
- It's hard to realize, isn't it, sir?
- What?
It's all over, and you've won.
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations, sir.
- Congratulations, sir. This is your day.
- Thanks, lieutenant.
Now that your trap has worked so brilliantly, sir, what are your plans?
I plan to make a long-delayed visit to Lourdes.
To give thanks for this victory.
Then will Senora Vinolas accompany you to Lourdes, captain?
Unfortunately, no. Senora Vinolas is not able to travel at this time.
Sir, may I speak to you a moment?
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.
- We still have the priest.
- Captain, one more question.
Do you consider it significant that 20 years after the Civil War...
...a political enemy...
- Political enemy?
Artiguez was a common bandit, nothing more, nothing less.
But a desperate attack such as this...
It was not a political attack.
He came to kill an informer.
He could've done that without walking into a trap. He also fired at you.
- Isn't it just possible...?
- I don't deal in speculations.
Artiguez was a bandit, an enemy of the state.
And now he's dead.
- Who is that man?
- One of the foreign reporters, sir.
Sir, we still have the priest upstairs, under guard.
We're not gonna fight with the church.
Just forget to release him till the Father Superior comes to see us.
I want to be sure he understands my point of view. Oh, lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
Artiguez knew his mother was dead.
He knew we had a trap for him.
- He had to know.
- Yes, sir.
Why did he come back?
Greece and the islands
of the Aegean Sea...
...have given birth to many myths
and legends of war and adventure.
And these once-proud stones,
these ruined and shattered temples...
...bear witness to the civilization
that flourished and then died here.
And of the demigods and heroes
who inspired those legends...
...on this sea and these islands.
But though the stage is the same,
ours is a legend of our own times...
...and its heroes are not demigods,
but ordinary people.
In 1943, so the story goes...
...2000 British soldiers lay
marooned on the island of Kheros...
...exhausted and helpless.
They had exactly one week to live.
In Berlin, the Axis had determined...
...on a show of strength
in the Aegean Sea...
...to bully neutral Turkey into
coming into the war on their side.
The scene of that demonstration
was to be Kheros...
...itself of no military value,
but only miles off the coast of Turkey.
The cream of the German war machine,
rested and ready...
...was to spearhead the attack.
The men on Kheros were doomed...
...unless they could be evacuated
before the blitz.
But the only passage
to and from Kheros...
...was guarded and blocked
by two great...
...newly designed,
radar-controlled guns...
...on the nearby island of Navarone.
Guns too powerful and accurate...
...for any Allied ship then
in the Aegean to challenge.
Allied Intelligence learned
of the projected blitz...
...only one week before
the appointed date.
What took place in the next six days
became the legend of Navarone.
Yes?
I'm looking for
Commodore Jensen.
I'm Jensen.
Come in, Mallory.
You're late.
I'm sorry. Our plane was attacked an hour out of Crete.
- We got into Alex on one engine, sir.
- The Germans have a price on you...
...and Andrea Stavros of 10,000 pounds apiece.
How did you know that?
I should do. I'm your boss.
You've been working for me the past 18 months.
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.
Did they say you were going on leave?
Yes, sir. They did.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not true.
Not yet, at any rate.
Here's your old chum.
Come and say hello to him.
You haven't changed since Athens.
Hello, Roy.
Come along, gentlemen, will you?
Barnsby...
...these gentlemen have an interest in Navarone.
We've heard you on radio, but perhaps you'll be more specific now.
I'll be specific.
As you can plainly see, it was bloody awful!
Squadron Leader
Barnsby's Australian.
But we'd love to go back, wouldn't we boys?
- Sure! Right!
- Just as soon as we can! But...
...only on one condition.
We want the joker who thought of this to come with us...
...and when we get there...
...we're gonna shove him out at 10,000 feet...
...without a parachute.
Bloody right.
- It was bad as that?
- Bad?!
It can't be done.
Not from the air, anyway.
You're sure about that, squadron leader? This is important.
So's my life!
To me, anyway. And the lives of these jokers here...
...and the 18 men we lost tonight!
Look, sir...
...first...
...you've got that old fortress on top of that bloody cliff.
Then you've got the bloody cliff overhang.
You can't even see the bloody cave, let alone the guns.
And anyway, we haven't got a bloody bomb big enough...
...to smash that bloody rock.
And that's the bloody truth, sir.
I know how to hit those guns.
Yes?
Yes, sir.
You fill a plane full of TNT...
...and then you do a suicide dive right into that cave.
There's just one problem, sir:
Getting someone to pilot the plane.
I see. Perhaps you might consider it yourself.
Thank you, squadron leader, and all of you.
I know you've done your best, and nobody could have done more.
And I'm sorry.
As you've probably surmised, I'm the joker they'd heave out at 10,000 feet.
And I can't say I blame them.
I knew it was hopeless from the start, but it had to be tried.
Anyway, this is why you were hauled out of Crete.
And don't mislay this, will you?
No, sir.
We're pressed for time.
Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?
- Any questions?
- Only one.
Why me?
What you want is a seagoing taxi driver.
Other men know these waters as well as I do.
Yes, but you've got special qualifications.
Franklin'll explain it.
It's his idea, anyway.
First, you speak Greek and German.
Second, you've kept alive in occupied territory for a year and a half.
And before the war, you were the greatest mountain climber in the world.
"Keith Mallory, the human fly."
Come to the point, Roy.
The point is that our Resistance contacts on Navarone...
...say there's only one spot on the coast the Germans don't watch:
The South Cliff.
It's 400 feet straight up...
...and it can't be climbed by man or beast.
And that's where you come in.
That was your idea too?
That's right.
I want you to get me and my team over there and on top of that cliff.
When you've done that, you can take a richly deserved leave...
...and a long-overdue promotion.
I see.
Can you do it?
No.
With all due respect,
I think the operation is insane.
But that's not my business.
My business is to climb and I haven't climbed in five years.
That's a long time.
It's too long for this cliff.
And you're asking me to do it at night.
I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.
I'll have a go myself, then.
I've climbed a bit.
Don't be a fool. You'd get yourself killed and your team along with you.
- Then it's scrubbed?
- No, it's not scrubbed!
It can't be.
Not now.
Mallory...
...this is our last hope.
The Germans won't expect a team of saboteurs at this late date.
Those 2000 men on Kheros will die next Wednesday morning...
...unless somebody climbs the cliff.
There's nobody else we can get in time.
If there were, you wouldn't be here now.
I suppose it's too late to get
Andrea Stavros to help me.
On the contrary.
I think you'll find him waiting for you in your hotel.
You think of everything.
I have to. It's part of my job.
- Thanks, Keith.
- It's my pleasure.
Nothing I like better than a well-organized setup.
You'll want to know about the team.
Sydney, would you get us some more coffee, please?
Franklin considers it the best team in the business. I agree.
He himself is ideal for the job. He's experienced and extremely capable.
Don't blush, Roy.
And best of all, he's lucky.
Aren't you lucky?
- If you say so, sir.
- I do, indeed.
Napoleon said once, when somebody was up for promotion to general:
"Yes, I know he's brilliant.
But is he lucky?"
The emperor knew the value of luck.
Our Roy seems to have it.
- Then make me a general, sir.
- Patience, my dear boy, patience.
Now this is our Corporal Miller.
A chemistry professor in private life.
An absolute genius with high explosives.
He blew up Rommel's headquarters...
...with no damage to the orphanage next door.
They don't come any better. We tried to make him an officer. He refused.
This is "Butcher" Brown, our mechanical marvel.
He's a genius with engines, machinery, radios, et cetera.
And the best man with a knife
I've ever met.
He got his training in Spain. The boys call him the Butcher of Barcelona.
Private Spyro Pappadimos.
What's his particular genius?
He's a born killer. A useful man to have along on a job like this.
His father happens to be our chief resistance contact on Navarone.
The boy went to America to get an education.
I'm afraid he got the wrong kind.
Well, there's the team.
Pirates and cutthroats, every one of them.
And of course, there's Lucky here.
And the redoubtable Mr. Stavros and yourself.
With every one of us a genius, how can we fail?
You can't.
We're sending six destroyers through the Navarone Channel next Tuesday...
...to take the men off Kheros.
If those guns aren't spiked by then...
...there'll be six more ships at the bottom of the Aegean.
There's your car, gentlemen.
Surprised?
I didn't think I'd see you again so soon.
You thought you'd have to look for me?
When the time came,
I would find you.
What is this?
We have to ferry some operators to an island called Navarone.
- Do you know it?
- I know it.
I also know I have work to do on Crete.
- Who's responsible for this?
- A major I used to know.
Name of Franklin.
He's a man who still has to prove to himself he's a hero.
I'll speak to Franklin.
Where do I find him?
That's the man.
You can speak with him on the way.
Think they've got a chance?
Frankly, no.
Not a chance in the world.
I'll be surprised if they get halfway to Navarone.
It's just a waste of six good men.
However, it doesn't matter, considering how many have been wasted already.
I'm glad it's not my decision.
I'm only the middleman.
Still, they may get there and they may pull it off.
Anything can happen in a war.
In the middle of absolute insanity...
...people pull out extraordinary resources.
Ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.
Pity we can't beat the problems of peace in the same way.
It would be so much cheaper.
I never thought of it in just that way.
- You're a philosopher.
- No.
I'm just the man who has to send people out on jobs like this one.
Must have been delayed.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.
- Major Franklin?
- Right.
My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.
Come with me, please.
It's been so comfortable,
I hate to leave.
When you're all quite ready...
Charming.
Just like an English country hotel.
Where does everybody else sleep?
Nobody sleeps. On your feet, professor. We've got homework to do.
If you insist, major.
What are you doing, friend?
Looking for dust?
No, friend. Microphones.
This is the British Army Post.
Don't you trust anyone?
No. That is why I have lived so long.
Mr. Stavros is Colonel Stavros of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.
- He outranks us all.
- It is of no moment.
The 19th Regiment no longer exists, for the time being.
- I beg your pardon, colonel.
- Andrea.
Please continue.
Right. If you're ready, corporal.
Yes, sir. Ready, sir.
Ready, willing and able, sir.
Champing at the bit.
Captain Mallory and Andrea...
...are responsible for getting us to where we're going.
I'll tell you where it is, and why we're going.
That is, if you really want to know, professor.
I'm all ears, sir. All ears.
We must avoid the coast road.
That means a 12-mile trek...
...to St. Alexis, where Resistance people from the town of Mandrakos...
...will come and meet us if they can make it.
Any questions?
I have an alternative route to that place.
May I borrow your pencil, please?
Does the major think this is possible?
I see.
That's a thought, isn't it?
Well, let's re-examine the plan and see if we have any alternative.
Watch out!
- How long has he been there?
- I heard something 10 minutes ago.
I thought my ears were playing tricks.
Then I heard it again.
Ten minutes?
Brown, go and get Major Baker.
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
What are you doing here?
The major asked you a question!
Answer the major.
Sounds like Kurdish.
I don't understand it.
I'll try Greek.
- Translation, please.
- He doesn't speak English.
Why was he listening?
- What are you doing to that man?
- You know him?
That's Nicolai, our laundry boy.
Is he the reason I've been disturbed?
I've had a hard day!
Does his job involve listening at keyholes?
- I don't believe it.
- We caught him at it.
It was just idle curiosity.
He doesn't speak English.
Why does he listen?
And why did he try to stab this man?
I presume he was trying to defend himself.
In this part of the world, carrying a knife doesn't make you a criminal.
Let him go.
Major Baker, arrest this man and hold him incommunicado for a week.
After that, my advice is you kick him out of Castelrosso.
Who the hell are you to give me advice, major?
Then I'm asking you as a favor.
I'll consider it.
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
I said, let him go!
Pappadimos, have you got your silencer?
- Yes, sir.
- Then use it. Shoot the laundry boy!
Are you crazy?
And if the major gets in your way, shoot him too.
That's an order.
Captain, he's insane!
Surely you won't let him do this.
I can't stop him, he's in charge.
Anyway, I agree with him.
Of course, he doesn't have to shoot you.
He can just call our HQ and you'll be on a troopship home, as a private...
...unless you give him your word that you'll do exactly as he says.
All right.
If it means that much to you, you have my word.
Take him, sergeant!
Stupid theatricals.
You're entitled to your opinion...
...but I just saved your life.
I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.
Really, I am.
It's embarrassing.
Just look at it!
No, it's exactly what we want.
They said you wanted a boat no one would notice, but that's a disgrace!
Give me 36 hours, and I know I can lay my hands...
...on a German E-boat in absolutely perfect condition.
I promise you, only one careful owner.
I can pop over to Rhodes and get it for you.
Won't the Germans have something to say about that?
I suppose so, if they knew.
But I've got good connections there.
What do you say?
- No, thanks. We can't wait.
- Pity.
I'll get my chaps to help with your gear.
No, that's all right, thank you.
Right. I get it.
Special cargo and all that, what?
Well, good luck to you.
Brown?
Yes, sir?
What do you think?
Well, she's a bit of a monster, sir.
But I think I've got her worried.
- Comfortable, professor?
- Yes, thank you.
Matter of fact, the boys have almost finished.
Permission to speak?
- What about?
- Well, the condition of this vessel.
Talk to Captain Mallory.
He's in charge of transportation.
Very good, sir.
I've inspected this boat and I think you ought to know...
...I can't swim.
I'll keep it in mind.
Dead on 10, sir.
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.
Report my signal. Report my signal.
Hello, George-Mike-William.
George-Mike-William.
Strength three. Strength three, over.
Hello, Lucky.
High Flight reports Indians on warpath
in your territory.
So please be careful.
Also, severe storms expected
throughout your area tonight.
Repeat. High Flight reports
Indians on warpath...
Hey.
Ship ahoy!
Go on working.
They'll have glasses.
Lower your sails!
Lower your sails!
We are coming aboard!
It's knee-deep in the hold, but I think we'll manage.
You want a breather?
Wouldn't mind.
Funny the way that German officer spoke English to us back there...
...almost as if he knew who we were.
I had the same thought.
I think our friend Baker may have some explaining to do.
I shouldn't have done it.
What's that?
Dragged you into this.
I'm sorry.
Forget it. I was getting tired of Crete food anyway.
No, I'm stupid sometimes.
Even as a kid, I'd expect people to play the games I liked.
Then I'd get furious when they didn't.
Well, now they have to, so why worry?
Hot coffee!
That's good.
I'm sorry, captain.
There's a serious shortage of cups aboard this ship.
I pointed out deficiencies in this vessel.
I remember.
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.
Any time you want another chat, about this boat, I mean, I'm available.
All right.
And I still can't swim.
Don't mind him.
He doesn't mean anything.
I don't mind him as much as he seems to mind me.
Have you been together long?
Since the beginning out here.
He's the best friend I have in this part of the world.
That's a pretty good partner you've got there yourself.
Yes.
- We've been together a long time too.
- You're lucky.
He's going to kill me when the war's over.
- You're not serious.
- Yes, I am.
So's he.
About a year ago, I gave a German patrol a safe conduct...
...to get their wounded into hospital.
I still had some romantic notions about fighting a civilized war.
Anyway, they wanted Andrea pretty badly even then.
They shot their casualties, went to his house and blew it up.
He was out on a job, but his wife and three children were in the house.
They were all killed.
I helped him to bury them.
He didn't say a word to me.
Never looked at me.
But after it was over, he said that as far as he was concerned...
...it wasn't the Germans who were responsible, but me.
Me and my stupid
Anglo-Saxon decency.
He said what he was going to do, and when.
Do you think he still means to do it?
He's from Crete.
Those people don't make idle threats.
I thought I was getting leave.
I was going to ask for transfer to another area.
Take some time to think, get ready for him.
And I messed that up.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
It's gonna be a long war.
What makes you sure he's gonna wait that long?
I'm not. Not if he gets the right opportunity.
What I'm banking on is, that now all he wants to do is to kill Germans.
As long as I can be useful to him in that department...
...he'll do his best to keep me alive.
I hope.
That's nice of him.
Well, I can see his point.
The only way to win a war is to be just as nasty as the enemy.
I'm only worried we'll find out we're even nastier than they are.
I can't say that worries me.
Well, you're lucky.
Think I better have a look at the hold.
Before Miller tells me to!
Help!
We've saved the explosives...
...the guns...
...and most of the ammunition.
I'm afraid we've lost the food and the medical supplies.
But if we rendezvous with the Resistance...
...at St. Alexis, they'll supply us with both.
Let's get out of this place as quickly as we can.
Pappadimos and Miller, you'll have the first shift with the stretcher.
You're officially taking command, sir?
Yes, I suppose I am. Why?
Just for the record.
This afternoon on the boat...
...you fumbled your job.
How'd that happen?
I don't know, sir.
The man was a foot away from you.
You only wounded him.
How could you miss?
I must have hesitated, sir.
You hesitated?
A man of your experience?
The Butcher of Barcelona?
How could you hesitate?
Well, I was tired.
I'm tired and I'm fed up.
I've been fighting this war a long time.
I've been killing Germans since 1937.
There's no end to them.
Shoot a man at 200 yards, he's just a target.
You kill him with a knife...
...you're close enough to smell him.
I smell them in my sleep.
After the last time, I made a pact with myself: I'd do my job.
But I wouldn't do the other anymore.
Not if I could help it.
And who gave you the right to make a private peace?
You think you're the only one who's tired?
I do my job, sir!
Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.
There will, of course, be a code word.
If we don't answer, a patrol will be here in no time.
Let's pack and get out.
Let's go.
Well?
The major's leg is broken in two places.
He could be hurt inside too.
He needs medical attention.
What do you suggest?
- Leave him for the Germans.
- They'd get him to a hospital.
If he doesn't get sulphanilamide, he doesn't stand a chance.
Naturally, you all think a lot of Major Franklin. So do I.
We have two choices.
We can take him, and if he doesn't get help, he'll die.
Or we can leave him here, and he'll tell the Germans everything.
Roy? Never!
He might not be able to help himself.
They have other drugs besides sulpha.
All they have to do is use scopolamine, and he'll tell them our whole plan.
There is, of course, a third choice.
One bullet now. Better for him.
Better for us.
You take that man along, you endanger us all.
Why not drop him off the cliff and save a bullet?
And why don't you shut up?
Yes, there's a third choice.
We'll make it if necessary...
...when it's necessary...
...and not before!
Now let's move!
Brown, from now on your job is to look after Major Franklin.
I said, move!
Morning!
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. It's just bad luck.
Well, what do we do now?
Where are we?
We're on our way.
- I'm going to hold you up.
- No, you won't.
Anyway, the professor won the toss and he's dying to carry you.
That's right. You're not nearly as heavy as I thought.
Now look...
...you've got to leave me.
You're out of your mind.
It's radio time.
Well, it's all on your plate now.
You'll never be able to thank me enough.
I wanted the job all the time.
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.
Report my signal.
Hello, George-Mike-William.
George-Mike-William.
Strength four. Strength four, over.
Hello, Lucky. This is most urgent.
Paddington Station will close
at midnight, X minus one.
Do you understand?
X minus one, over.
We've lost a full day.
Germans are gonna hit Kheros a day ahead of time.
Gives us until midnight, the day after tomorrow.
Message understood.
Message understood. Over and out.
I'd like to be alone with the major.
Roy, that was foolish.
You almost ruined everything.
We've just heard, we're canceled out.
Scrubbed.
What?
They're going for an amphibious landing the day after tomorrow...
...on the east coast.
The Turkish side.
The Turkish side?
And they're coming in force.
As far as we're concerned, the pressure's off.
All we have to do is make as much trouble as we can.
By tonight, we'll have you in the hands of the underground.
We'll have you taken care of.
Try this again, I'll have Andrea break your other leg.
Good luck.
Do not worry.
I shall see you tonight at St. Alexis.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Obviously, this place has been used before.
Any food around?
I regret to say no.
Weren't you careless?
We might have been anyone.
I heard you coming five minutes ago.
No.
No!
Pappadimos, it's time to relieve Andrea.
I'll take it.
No.
Pappadimos...
...you go.
- Maybe he brought food.
- Hold it.
He might be faking.
Saved!
Don't move!
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands high!
All of you!
You there, with the food, speak!
You are not Germans.
Which of you is Major Franklin?
The man on the stretcher.
Who are you?
My name is Maria Pappadimos.
You may put your hands down now, gentlemen.
Pappadimos?
They said Pappadimos was a man.
My father.
He was taken two days ago.
He was taken?
He told them nothing.
He will die first.
- You have sisters or brothers?
- A brother, Spyro, in America.
Oh, he's not as far away as all that.
He's that handsome devil right over there.
Spyro!
Why did you do that for?
To remind you to write letters occasionally.
- There's a war on!
- I mean before the war!
I promised myself I would do this the first time I saw you again.
Well, I'm sorry, brother.
Which of you did this?
Well...
I'm afraid it was me.
- Who is she?
- My friend, Anna. She's one of us.
It's bad that this happened to her.
Before the Germans came, she was a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.
Last year, she was caught. They tortured her to make her betray us.
They whipped her until the white of her bones showed.
Some nights, we could hear her screaming.
Then they kept her in the fortress for six months.
When they let her go...
...she could not speak.
She has never spoken since.
Not even in her dreams.
Even I have never been allowed to see the scars on her back.
But she's a good fighter.
As good as any of you!
Like a ghost, she goes anywhere!
She got us these guns.
And she kills without mercy.
You are very lucky, brother.
No, they are the friends! Our friends!
It's gangrene, sir.
If the leg doesn't come off, he'll die.
Does he know?
I don't think so.
Sir...
...I beg your pardon, but I haven't had a chance to talk to you alone.
I don't want to be left out anymore.
I want to be part of the team again.
Please give me a chance.
You can trust me.
I'll think it over.
That's gangrene! What choice do we have now, captain?
- Who relieved you?
- She did.
- In future, take orders only from me.
- I asked you a question, sir!
And I heard you, corporal.
Get yourself something to eat.
That's an order.
Thank you, sir.
There's a lot of activity down there.
I can hear it.
They're turning Mandrakos inside out.
As soon as they move out, we'll move in.
We're gonna get you to a doctor.
Brown says that you are doing well.
Brown is a liar. And so are you.
I haven't lost my sense of smell, you know.
I just hope the doctor's a good surgeon.
I wonder what old Jensen would say?
My luck seems to have changed, doesn't it?
I don't suppose I'll ever be a general now.
This Franklin...
...he's not a bad fellow.
No, not bad at all.
- You're sure there's a tunnel there?
- They'll never find us.
Well, they found us here.
Let's go. Let's go!
Oh, excuse me.
- Where is this tunnel?
- Up here, sir.
Where does this lead to?
We'll come out just behind Mandrakos.
All right.
Let's keep going.
Anna?
Anna?
You're limping. Are you hurt?
Do you need help?
Thank you, old bean.
Get off your behinds.
Think there's a fire escape?
These are fine people.
Give up quietly, gentlemen.
Unless you want many innocent people killed, as well as yourselves.
Turn around, please.
Captain Mallory, you've made a remarkable effort.
Unfortunately, it was doomed from the beginning.
Will you tell me where you've hidden your explosives?
No.
As your commanding officer, Captain
Mallory must play a heroic role.
You needn't carry such a burden.
You've all suffered a great deal.
Why prolong that suffering?
For you, the war is over.
Another officer is coming to question you. A captain in the SS.
His methods, quite frankly, are most severe.
None of you are in uniform.
Therefore, you're considered spies.
You know the penalty for espionage.
But if any one of you has the courage to tell me where the explosives are...
...I promise, you will not only save your own life...
...but the lives of your comrades.
This will be your only chance.
I do advise you to take it.
Please, sir! I am no spy!
I am not one of them!
You yellow--
Go on.
Sir, I swear to you, sir...
...I'm just a poor fisherman.
Two days ago these men killed my sailors and stole my boat.
They forced me to join them.
Sir, I am their prisoner!
Where did you learn your English, fisherman?
In Cyprus, sir.
I swear to you, it's true.
Aren't you Andrea Stavros?
Colonel Stavros?
Oh, no. No, sir.
My name is Nondus Salonikus.
I told you,
I'm a fisherman from Cyprus.
Then how do you happen to wear a shoulder holster?
They forced me to wear it...
...and made it a kind of joke.
Where are the explosives?
I swear, sir...
...I would tell you if I knew.
But, see, they didn't say.
The truth is, sir, they don't trust me.
I don't blame them.
The commandant will telephone to congratulate you, Muesel.
Thank you.
I've questioned them about the explosives, but they refuse to answer.
The Greek claims he is not one of them.
Now you! You are not of this company, you say?
No, sir, I'm not.
You are a liar!
- But Your Excellency--
- A liar!
Come, come. That didn't hurt.
- Where are the explosives?
- I don't know, Your Excellency.
Your Excellency,
I swear I do not know!
I am not one of these men!
They forced me to join them.
As I explained to the captain...
...I'm just a...
...poor fisherman from Cyprus.
My name is...
...Nondus Salonikus.
I swear to you.
These men stole my boat and then they forced me to join them.
Your Excellency--
Your Excellency, I am their prisoner!
Where are the explosives?
I want an answer now, or I'll personally rearrange this officer's splints.
Very well.
I can't!
Please, I can't!
I can't!
- Get up!
- I'm sick! I'm sick!
- Get up!
- Please! Oh, I'm sick!
But I'm sick! No, please!
Please, I'm sick!
I'm sick! I'm sick!
Call the sentry in.
Now, Oberleutnant...
...get on the phone.
Tell them you're not to be disturbed until you give further orders.
Remember...
...I speak German...
...perfect.
Not very hygienic, I must say.
Shocking taste in undies too.
Ah, well...
Heil, everybody!
Roy...
...we're gonna leave you here.
I understand.
We're gonna let them chase us around for a while.
But the one thing they mustn't know...
...is about the landing tomorrow night.
Of course.
Don't worry.
Oh, thanks.
Good luck.
Hold it.
We'll leave Major Franklin behind.
He's a wounded officer.
I expect him to get medical attention.
We don't make war on wounded men.
We're not all like Hauptmann Sessler.
Now, where's the camp radio station?
I will not tell you.
You wouldn't hesitate to kill me for any number of reasons.
But not this one.
In any event, I will not tell you.
- So long, Roy.
- Good luck, Keith.
Well, Lucky, I shall miss you.
Try to be a bad patient, will you?
Keep on asking for bedpans.
Drives them mad.
I'll keep it in mind.
When this is over, you'll buy me a lunch.
Roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, a nice little red wine...
Steak and kidney pie.
Anything you say.
You'll be paying for it.
And you, colonel, what a performance.
All right.
I hope you were right to leave
Franklin with the Germans.
Sir?
- Yes?
- No, not you, sir. Mr. Stavros.
Tell me about yourself.
- What do you want to know?
- Are you married?
I have been married.
My wife and children were killed.
Have you killed many people?
Only Germans.
Oh, some Italians too.
- Captain Mallory?
- Yes?
You are a lucky man.
Yes, I know.
- Mr. Stavros?
- Yes?
I like you.
I like you too.
I don't know.
Well, baby face,
I never would have known you.
You better get rid of that fuzz under your nose.
No, I'm an officer, remember?
You just picked the wrong uniform.
Lights out in five minutes.
I want you as well-rested as possible.
Now, first thing in the morning...
...we'll ditch the truck and get hold of another car.
Then we'll pick up the explosives and go into Navarone.
We've got to be inside the fortress by 10:00 tomorrow night.
Might one inquire how?
We're gonna walk in.
Simply because of this masquerade?
No.
Because I told Franklin our orders had been changed.
That we weren't after the guns.
That we were just to create a diversion for an assault...
...tomorrow night on the Turkish side.
Now, if my hunch is right, the Germans will give him scopolamine...
...and that's what he'll tell them.
They may not believe it, but they'll be faced with the fact that he does.
Now I'm gambling that they'll clear out of Navarone...
...and take up positions on the coast.
Very clever.
But that still leaves the garrison inside the fortress...
...and we get them out by having
Andrea, Pappadimos and Brown...
...start up diversions all over Navarone.
If there's enough confusion going...
...Miller and I should have a chance to break in.
At the same time, the girls will steal the fastest boat they can find...
...so we all have a chance of getting out when this thing is over.
Very clever, indeed.
Suppose they don't have any scopolamine? What happens then?
Suppose they use the old-fashioned methods?
Suppose your ventriloquist's dummy just won't talk...
...because he's a good man?
He won't be easy to break!
He may take a lot of punishment before he tells them our plan!
He may even die on them and tell them nothing at all!
Have you considered that?
Yes, I have.
I'll bet you have!
I'll bet you've considered that as far back as the cliff!
You and your...
...three choices.
I'll bet that's why you dragged him around with us all this time!
If he lives, he'll never be the same again!
Do you know what you've done?
You've used up an important human being!
Oh, I misjudged you.
You're rather a ruthless character,
Captain Mallory.
I didn't think of it back on the cliff.
But if I had...
...I'd have done the same thing.
It's our only chance!
Well, right now I say to hell with the job!
I've been on 100 jobs, none of which altered the war.
There've been 1000 wars and there'll be 1000 more, until we're all dead.
I don't care about the war anymore.
I care about Roy!
And if Turkey enters on the wrong side?
So what? Let the world blow itself to pieces, as it deserves!
What about the 2000 men on Kheros?
I don't know them.
But I do know the man on Navarone!
Mr. Miller, the man was finished when he fell.
That's easy for you to say, sitting there, drinking coffee!
It's funny. I was grateful when you left him behind today.
I just hope before this job's over...
...that I get the chance to use you the way you've used him.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't think of any other way.
Everybody get a good night's sleep.
No matter how it goes tomorrow...
...you're gonna need it.
I'll take the first watch.
Hello.
Tell me, schoolteacher...
...from a purely moral point of view...
...bearing in mind that we represent goodness and civilization...
...do you think that what I did was a civilized thing to do?
Scopolamine.
They are burning Mandrakos...
...in punishment.
This part of town has been evacuated...
...because the guns' vibrations has weakened the houses.
Where will the attacks come?
On the Turkish side.
What time?
What time?
Is the timetable clear?
Any questions?
Good luck.
I won't be needing this. You take it.
Spyro.
Andrea.
Everybody stay where you are.
The party's over.
Somebody's stepped on the cake.
Exhibit A: A clockwork fuse.
Elementary and archaic, but they work.
This one won't work anymore.
Know why?
The clock's okay, but the contact arm's broken off.
It could tick until Christmas and not even set off a firecracker!
Exhibit B:
Exhibit B is missing.
All my slow burning fuses are gone.
Disappeared! Vanished!
Exhibit C: My time pencils.
75 grains of fulminate of mercury in each of them.
Enough to blow my hand off.
And very unstable, very delicate.
Which means there's a traitor in this room.
You're crazy.
It happened at base.
No, I'm not that crazy!
I checked it all before I left base.
No, here.
Here!
Someone here.
But who?
Who?
This stuff's only been out of my sight two times.
Once was when Andrea and Maria took it away to hide it.
But it was all right when we picked it up again.
The only other time was when we left it in the truck...
...and we scouted the gates.
All of us!
Except her.
We left her on guard in the truck...
...alone.
You are crazy, sir!
Let me just think for a moment.
Since we got here, we've jumped out of one frying pan into another.
Just think...
We were hiding in the carob grove...
...and she's up in a tree. Remember?
Anybody can signal an airplane with tin or a mirror.
And they found us there, didn't they?
And then in the tunnel.
In the tunnel she lagged far behind, with a shocking limp.
Seen her limping lately?
But being behind us, she could leave some messages.
So when you take Roy to the doctor, the Germans are waiting for you.
When she takes us to her place, they come there.
But she got us out.
Of course! That house would be a shambles and she'd be dead with us.
So, what does she do?
She disappears into the bedroom to change her clothes...
...and to leave a little note.
She takes us to the wedding and we're caught...
...because we can't get to our guns!
But even if we can, we slaughter half of Mandrakos!
You are an insane man!
Am I?
Maybe I am.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
We can settle this thing very easily.
Let's see those scars the Germans made on her back...
...those terrible scars.
How about it, Maria?
Don't you want to see those scars?
Q.E.D.
You cannot believe it?
Believe it.
I cannot stand pain.
It's easy to be brave when you're free, when you're with friends.
But I was caught.
The others were free but they didn't help me. I was alone.
I was alone in their hands.
They said they would put me into their brothels.
They said they would torture me.
I saw what they did to other people.
I'm sorry.
I cannot stand pain.
When we got here...
...why didn't you put in with us?
You could have come with us!
It was your only chance to get free of them!
There was never any chance.
You never had any chance!
It was hopeless from the beginning.
You'll never get out of here!
Never!
I tried to tell you last night.
Can you do anything at all?
I don't know.
There's always some way to blow up explosives.
The trick is not to be around when they go off.
But aren't you forgetting something, captain?
The lady.
As I see it, we have three choices:
One, we can leave her here.
But she might be found.
And in her case they won't need a truth drug.
Two, we take her with us.
But that makes things more difficult.
And three...
Well, that's Andrea's choice.
Remember?
You really want your pound of flesh.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I just couldn't manage to get to sleep last night.
- If you're anxious to kill her, do it!
- I'm not anxious to kill her.
I'm not anxious to kill anyone.
See, I'm not a born soldier.
I got trapped.
You may find me facetious...
...but if I didn't make some bad jokes,
I'd go out of my mind.
No, I prefer to leave the killing to you.
An officer and a gentleman.
A leader of men, a hero.
If you think I enjoy this, you're mad!
I never wanted it.
I was trapped like you, or anybody in uniform.
You wanted it.
You're an officer, aren't you?
I'll never want the responsibility of an officer.
Then you've had a free ride all this time.
Someone's got to be responsible.
Do you think it's easy?
I don't know!
I'm beginning to wonder who is responsible to do the dirty work.
Is the man who gives the orders guilty, or the one who has to do it?
- We've no time for this.
- Now just a minute!
If we're gonna get this job done, she has got to be killed!
And we all know how keen you are on getting the job done.
I've never killed a woman before, traitor or not...
...and I'm finicky.
So why don't you do it?
Why don't you let us off for once?
Come on, be a pal.
Be a father to your men.
Come down off your cross, close your eyes and pull the trigger!
What do you say, sir?
You all know what you have to do. Get started.
Brown, you go with Maria.
Now, you know when you put on a uniform and learn how to do it...
...it's not hard to kill anyone.
Sometimes it's harder not to.
You think you've been getting away with it all this time, standing by.
Well, son...
...your "bystanding" days are over.
You're in it now, up to your neck!
They say you're a genius with explosives. Start proving it!
You got me in the mood to use this thing...
...and by God, if you don't think of something, I'll use it on you!
I mean it.
Go on.
You stay here.
I'll call you if I need you.
Whatever you say, sir.
Spyro!
Spyro!
Detonators, sir, please.
I'll be finished here in about
30 seconds.
Miller?
Miller!
- Miller!
- Yes, what is it?
What are you doing?
They'll search those guns first and find my stuff.
They're not stupid.
But if they remove it carelessly, they could have the same result.
But I'm banking on this job being our insurance.
- What happens?
- Would you bring down the hoist?
Whoa, that's enough!
See this bottom runner?
When they send this hoist down for shells or charges, it'll come here.
It'll hit these two wires and we get a circuit...
...that'll send up all my plastic explosives here...
...plus this little item...
...that I borrowed here.
They won't see these wires under the grease.
Are you sure it'll work?
No guarantee, but the theory's perfectly feasible.
But if this stuff goes up...
...everything else in this place will go up with it.
Suppose you don't get a contact?
Then I'll be responsible for sinking one of the destroyers...
...maybe the whole lot of them.
I'm sorry, sir. it's the only way
I know to get the job done.
As you said, I'm in it now...
...up to my neck.
Hurry up.
- Go ahead.
- After you.
Remember? I can't swim.
You won't let me drown, will you?
I can't make it.
My arm...
Come on, man. Take it!
Grab it!
Spyro's dead, isn't he?
What happened?
He forgot why we came here.
And now you're going back to Crete?
Yes.
Come with us.
With us?
With me.
I must go back.
You saw what the Germans did to Mandrakos.
Navarone will pay heavily for your success tonight.
Come on,
I'll give you a hand.
I'm going back.
The job is finished.
Your job is finished.
What chance do you think you have of staying alive back there?
I'm not so easy to kill.
Hey.
Well, the boys on Kheros will be happy soon.
It'll be crowded, but there's nothing like an ocean voyage:
Fresh air, good food, deck sports, pretty girls...
I'd like to offer you my apologies...
...and my congratulations.
The truth is,
I didn't think we could do it.
To tell you the truth, neither did I.
You're crazy. He's too big. You'll get murdered.
What's the fight about?
Fatso talks too much.
What did he say?
What did he say?
Is Benson the reason why you have to go to the principal's office?
Guy, you in trouble again?
You'll get clobbered.
He's got his Jap friends with him.
You want us to take them, Benson?
Nah. Leave them alone.
You stink.
- Blabbing to the cops.
- Me?
Me tell the law you're the jerk that broke into the market...
...just to steal a few lousy potatoes?
Why, that kind of action ain't worth talking to nobody about.
Hey.
How'd it go in the principal's office?
Come on, grab him and get him!
Yeah, come on. Hit him in the face.
Hey, look. A fight.
- Hit him in the face.
- Get up, Guy.
Hit him. Hit him.
- Cut it out.
- I ought to murder you, you fat stoolie.
What's the matter with you two now? Go on, get out of here.
You and your Jap friends.
Beat it. All of you.
Why'd you let him get into this?
Me? I didn't do nothing.
I told him he'd get clobbered.
Go on home.
Holy cow. It wasn't my fault.
I'll see you at home. I want to talk to you.
There's nothing to talk about.
Look, wipe the blood off your face.
Come with me while I change my clothes and I'll drive you home.
I don't want no drive home.
I'll give you a choice, either home or juvenile hall.
I've seen juvenile hall before. It don't scare me.
It's a good start on something that can. San Quentin.
Now, come on.
Those your books?
Well, pick them up. They're city property.
Big deal.
I said, pick them up.
You can't tell me what to do.
Pick them up.
Thanks for the ride.
What's the trouble, Guy?
Fighting all the time.
And some worse things I've heard about.
I don't care what you've heard.
I don't care what anybody's heard.
These are rough times for a lot of people.
Not enough jobs, people on relief.
Everybody's got problems.
Is that why you broke in the market last night?
Things so bad you have to steal?
I didn't say I stole. Benson said it.
What are you doing?
I'm going in with you.
I've never met your folks.
I don't want you to go in.
I won't embarrass you.
I won't tell them anything about that market. Come on.
You stay out of my house.
Please, please. Don't go in.
Where's your mother?
In the hospital.
How long has she been there?
They took her away last Wednesday.
And your father?
I got no father. He's dead.
You living here all alone?
I can take care of myself. I do all right.
Come on.
You come with me.
You can't go on living this way.
Roaming around loose, stealing your food.
It's no good, Guy.
Go pack some clothes. You'll bunk up with George for a few days.
I'm not taking anything from anybody.
You won't be taking anything from my family they don't want to give you.
Now, come on, pack some clothes.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Guy's mother's in the county hospital.
- He'll stay with us until she gets well.
- Say, that's great.
- Can he sleep in my room?
- That's the idea.
Hey, we'll have a ball.
Except...
I'm real sorry about your mother.
Come on.
See you in a minute, Guy.
Mama?
You have come here well.
My mother means you're welcome.
Yes. Welcome.
Thank you, Mrs. Une. our parents don't speak much English.
You'll have to start learning Japanese, Guy.
Heck, I'm just barely getting by in 7th grade English.
Hey, come on, Guy. I'll show you our room.
Hey, hurry up. The breakfast is ready. oh, is that what she said?
She said "good morning" to you.
What do you usually have for breakfast?
Raw fish and rice.
Chilled pigeon eggs.
Raw?
Yesterday it was octopus.
If we're lucky, there'll be some left.
Delicious.
Especially with that sauce made from fish eyes.
Fish eyes?
What did you think we eat around here?
Even if Papa and Mama aren't citizens, Kaz and I are.
We're Americans. All of us.
Yeah, not as dumb as me.
oh, sugar is osato.
Make you all-America boy.
Already all-America boy.
No need cereal. oh, tell your Mom I didn't mean that.
I like this kind of cereal best of all.
Pop says he hopes you slept okay. oh, yes, sir. Just fine.
Automobile is jidousha?
Is that for taxi too?
- No, taxi is taxi.
- Taxi.
What'd you say?
That means you're doing very well. You're joto... okay. okay. I like that.
Broom is hoki.
A vacuum cleaner would be easier and better.
This is a carpet sweeper.
I know what it is in Japanese. you say it in English.
Carpet sweeper.
Carpet-a sweeper.
Yes, that's good.
Now, if we had a motor... Motah.
It would be a vacuum cleaner. vacu-um clean?
Er... vacuum cleaner.
Er? vacu-um cleaner.
Yes.
Now... This is...
In Japanese it's a hoki...
...but in English it's a broom.
A broom.
- Yes.
- You teach me.
That's a mado but in English it's a window.
Window.
Yes. Why didn't you ever help your mother learn English?
Gosh, I don't know.
This is a broom. oh, boy, you teach me.
George, the work's all done.
How about some basketball?
Sure. Let's go.
His mother?
She's... She's dying.
Can this be his home?
Yes, his home.
Come here.
I tell you a story. very old.
It is...
An ancient legend.
All Japanese boy know.
You learn too now. once upon a time...
...old woman go to river to wash clothes.
In river large peach come floating. old woman take peach home...
...and peach open up in two pieces.
out jump kawaii boy.
Beautiful boy. old woman and husband name him Peach Boy.
Peach Boy.
Soon, Peach Boy grow big and strong.
He want to go...
He wants to conquer Devil's Island.
Is there really such a place?
So the legend goes.
Soon...
...boy go to onigashima.
And he see big chief and fight.
And kill him.
They very scared. Give up.
And then Peach Boy bring all treasure back home.
Make old woman and old man very happy.
What was that treasure that made them so happy?
Love.
Yes, love.
I do love you, Mama-san.
I love you very much.
I've listened to that Peach Boy story a hundred times before...
...and never knew what the treasure really was.
Because, my brother, you've always had it.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, George.
- Hey, George.
- Coming.
Like, this thing's still loose.
Take it to the filling station...
...to let Mike fix it.
Why aren't you dressed? You'll be late.
Well, we'll skip coffee if we have to.
You told me this is a very important morning.
It is.
But darn it, Guy. I'm afraid she'll say no. oh, are you nuts?
All you have to do is take a look at her and it tells the whole story.
I wish I were that sure.
Well, all you're gonna do is ask her to go steady.
But I can't get the words out.
I've tried a hundred times. The words just stick in my throat.
Do me a favor?
Sure, I will. What do you want me to do? Take the car to Mike's...
No. You take Ester to coffee and church.
Find out how I really stand, will you?
Well, now, I just not might come back.
I might take her to the preacher myself.
- Thanks, pal.
- okay, here.
I'll wrap some wire around while you change.
Yeah.
Take a shave while you're at it.
oh, yeah. Gee, I can't go to bat for my brother looking like a nukka, can I?
So that's why I came to pick you up instead of George.
He hasn't got a headache.
And you want my answer?
Yeah.
George is a big boy. Why can't he speak for himself? oh, well, you know George. He's shy and he... oh, maybe you'll have a change of mind when I ask you in church, huh?
- Hey, how about a little breakfast? oh, fine.
Anything you want up to 40 cents.
You're really a big spender, aren't you?
Well, that date of mine last night cleaned me out, you know.
So suffer.
That's what you get for going out with girls like that.
Well, now that's a fine way for my future sister-in-law to talk to me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program...
...to bring you a special news bulletin.
Yeah, that's me honking. How about a little service, huh?
The Japanese have attacked
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, by air...
Hey, Jap lover.
How's it feel being out with the enemy?
Are you talking to us?
Come on. Leave them alone.
What do you mean, leave them alone? That's a Jap.
Hey, punk. What are you doing out with a Jap broad?
Well, well, now just a minute.
No, no, no, Guy. Don't. Please.
Let's just go someplace else.
Johnny, now, knock it off, will you?
Wait a minute, Johnny, wait a minute. oh, please.
- Come on, now. Take it easy, will you?
- What do you mean, take it easy?
- What do you expect after what's happened?
- That's what I mean.
- Making cracks at that girl for no reason.
-  Wait, listen to this.
At least 2000 Americans have been killed by Japan's sneak attack.
The great fear of the moment...
...is that more Jap bombers may be even now on their way.
If you got any sense, get that girl off the street and out of sight.
From what meager information we've been able to get...
...from radio reports...
...extensive damage has been wrought on Hickam Field.
No matter how long it may take us...
...to overcome this premeditated invasion...
...the American people in their righteous might...
...will win through to absolute victory.
I ask...
...that the congress declare...
...that since the unprovoked...
...and dastardly attack...
...by Japan...
...on Sunday, December 7th...
...1941...
...a state of war...
...has existed...
...between the United States...
...and the Japanese empire.
We're at war for sure, men.
What should we do about it?
We ought to join the army as fast as we can.
Are you guys crazy?
Crazy? Didn't you hear the president?
Well, sure I heard him. So what?
Enlisting is nuts. We'd be fighting our own people.
They're not our kind.
They might be coming here to L.A. next.
Sneak up on us, just like at Pearl Harbor.
- Freddy, where's the closest place to join?
- Fort MacArthur.
- Let's get going before the war's over.
- Yeah.
Coming with us, Guy?
You don't think I'm gonna let you go by yourselves, do you?
- Never passed up a good fight yet.
- George...
...do you know what you're doing?
She's asking if we know what we're doing.
Do we know what we're doing?
Have the coffee ready when we get back.
Yeah, we might be back in uniform.
- Come on, Kaz, let's take off.
- Where you going?
- We're going to Fort MacArthur to join up.
- You're wasting your time.
What do you mean?
I was there yesterday. I tried to enlist and they laughed at me.
You'd think we're spies or something.
They don't want any of us.
They might accept Guy, but not you two.
Well, if they don't want my brothers, than the hell with them.
I don't care what you say, it stinks. The whole thing stinks. oh, Guy, please don't. Don't blame them. They're only following orders.
They haven't told you where they're taking you?
To Santa Anita, the assembly center.
- Then a relocation camp.
- No. Concentration camp is what you mean.
Whatever or wherever it is we'll all be the same there.
And if they throw rocks in our window...
...or scream dirty names it won't be because we're Japanese.
You're not, you're Americans.
That's what I'm talking about. other Americans don't seem to think so.
Ester.
Goodbye, Guy.
Goodbye, Ester.
I don't want us to be lost, separated.
We may be sent to different camps.
We'll find each other.
We'll write.
- Here we come.
- okay.
There we are.
We look like those refugees in the newsreel, huh?
Well, so long, Guy.
I'll be seeing you.
In a couple of weeks or so.
It's been good bunking with you. You know that.
I know. Stay on the beam, buddy. okay. You too.
Well, this is it, Guy.
Hey, Kaz, let me ask you something.
The wheels running this war gotta needle everybody...
...who once maybe came from someplace else.
Now, how about all the Germans, all the Italians in America too?
I can't answer that, Guy.
Right or wrong, our government's doing what they think is right.
No one bats a thousand.
Well, good luck, kid.
Good luck to you, Kaz. oh, I carry it.
I will miss my home.
I'll miss it too, Mama-san.
All-America boy, you good son to me. oh, Mama-san, how can I ever thank you for all you've done for me?
Sayonara, my son.
Sayonara.
Sorry, son. You've got a perforated eardrum.
Dear buddy, by the time you read this...
...Kaz and I will be on our way to Fort Meade and overseas.
Address, A.P.O. 449, New York.
Kaz and I spent a couple of days with the folks before being shipped.
They miss you very much, Guy.
Because of Pop's health...
...the authorities are transferring them to Camp Manzanar, in California.
Everybody's on the move, huh?
You better write, you bum.
We want to hear that everything's okay with you.
Your brother, George.
P.S. Phoned Ester to say goodbye.
I started to propose to her over the phone but got cold feet.
Son Guy! oh, Mama-san. oh, and I'm sure glad to be here.
You look wonderful, Mama-san. Wonderful.
How is Papa? Is the
California sun helping him? oh, help much.
He work in field now. Soon be here.
- Did you see camp?
- Yeah, a little bit of it.
What I saw looked better than I expected.
Not so nice at first.
All dirt and mud.
No flowers.
We worried about you.
Not hear from you.
We wait and wait. For letter.
- For visit.
- Yeah. I...
Well, you know, I was traveling around here and there and...
Well, now that you're a lot closer, why, it's...
Hey.
Are these two heroes anybody I know? oh, they fight in Italy now.
But daijobu last we hear.
I wish to God it was over so they'd be safe.
Son Guy safe? oh, sure.
Sure, I'm safe.
You must miss them awful much, Mama-san. oh, heart cries at night.
But must be. To straighten out this mess.
Son George teach that word. It's good word?
That's a real good word. oh, it sure is a mess.
Sons.
All-America boys end mess. No more mess ever.
We live happy.
Happy?
How can you be happy? Everything you and Papa-san ever worked for is gone.
True. Gone. once before we sit so.
Yeah, I know. It was a long time ago, wasn't it?
Mother...
...father of Une family work hard all lives.
Want to build...
Good...
- Good...
- Foundation?
oh, hai, hai.
Good foundation.
For future.
Not many years left for old people to build again.
Sons must build.
Kaz, George, Guy.
Must build home again.
Must build world again.
Must end mess.
All papa-sans, mama-sans...
...all countries, all over the world is same.
This you believe?
What difference does it make what one man believes or does? one man must believe.
Must make difference.
Why else Kaz, George go far away across ocean...
...to kill men look like brother they love?
Mama-san...
...are you saying that it's all right for me to go to war against the Japanese? oh, you big fellow.
- oh, not so big, Pop.
- Guy, what you do all this time?
No, never mind about me.
I want to know about you.
- How do you feel? You look great.
- I feeling great.
- Eat like horse.
- Horse? oh, got plenty of hay around here, huh?
Horse, hay.
Mama-san eat a whole... Whole...
- Bale?
- So, so. Bale.
- What was that?
- Meal time.
Gong on every block hit same time.
Eating very punctual.
- Punctual.
- Punctual.
George teach. Good word? oh, that's a great word.
Come, we eat three bales hay.
Three bales.
- Captain.
- Yes.
There's a man outside, says he wants to enlist.
But he's been turned down by his own board.
What's he doing here?
Well, he says he speaks and understands Japanese.
Send him in. We need interpreters.
Yes, sir.
The captain will see you now.
Captain Salter, Mr. Gabaldon.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
Go left. Go left.
Right, back, ho!
Go left. Go left.
Step to the rear, ho!
Go left.
Go left, right, left.
Don't that joker know any orders besides that one?
Left. Halt.
To the rear. Halt.
Left oblique, halt.
Halt. Halt. order. Halt.
All right, let's fall in there on the double.
Move it. Gabaldon, front and center.
Gabaldon!
Now, can't you get it through your head what oblique means?
- Now, look, sarge...
- You're at attention.
I came into this outfit to talk to the enemy, not to footrace with them.
Now, let's go through it once more, boot.
In the Marines, it's
"sergeant," not "sarge. "
It is never sarge, you got it?
In the marines you fight. F-I-G-H-T.
I don't care if you're a cook or a typist or an interpreter.
I don't care if you got a busted back or a busted eardrum. You'll fight.
Take my word for it.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
Fall in!
Left.
These things don't weigh very much, do they?
You just kind of take it and throw it like a football, put it on the target.
Right, isn't it, sarge?
That's not bad, Gabaldon.
That's not bad at all.
But next time pull the pin.
The idea is to kill the Japs.
Next man.
What's the matter with you?
There will be times when you'll find that your hands are your only weapons.
Now, if I can have a volunteer, I'll demonstrate the first jujitsu holds.
Is he gonna be surprised.
This is the first basic position.
And now for the second position.
Well, I guess I really asked for that one, didn't I?
Hey, you want to try for the third position?
I don't know, I just don't know.
Three days and I get no place.
This filly won't post without a slip from the preacher.
I tell this babe I'm being shipped overseas just so I'll make out.
Didn't expect orders to break camp for us the minute we get back.
How'd you do, Mac? oh, mission accomplished.
Did you do all right, hero?
Are you kidding?
Got a different one every night.
It's a good thing the corps keep me in shape or I'd be up for another Purple Heart.
Next time, buddy, I'm taking my liberty with you.
Well, that's the way it goes.
Some guys got it.
Some guys ain't.
All right, saddle up, move out of here.
Anybody know where we're going?
Scuttlebutt has it
Hawaii. We're replacements.
- What for?
- You'll find out when the ship hits port.
Ship? I get seasick taking a bath.
Come on, let's move, let's get out of here. Come on, let's go. Move it.
Intelligence Section,
2nd Marines, 2nd Division.
Is that a good outfit to be with?
The 2nd is one of the "bleedingest. "
Hey, Bill, is that your old outfit?
Yeah, right from the beginning.
- You mean the "Canal" beginning?
- Yeah. Guadalcanal until I got it on Tarawa.
Where'd you get it, Pete?
Some eager boot like you thought I was a Jap and stuck his bayonet into me. oh, that is sort of a running gag, Guy.
Actually, junior here got it from a sniper on New Britain.
Where that hit, I don't think it'll ever stop itching.
Where did it hit?
Where the hell do you think you gotta get hit for a Purple Heart?
Well, I'm glad at least
I belong to something...
...even if it is an outfit with a couple of tin heroes.
Hey, I didn't know they had obstacle courses in the trucks.
This is it, you five.
Hey, are you sure this is the right place? This looks like a beach club to me.
It's a club, all right. very exclusive.
The members have fought in action in every island of the Pacific, Boot.
Come on, let's go.
That must be our replacements.
They're fresh. Wonder if they're seasoned, Lenny.
Two old men and three boots.
Kind of hard to know who to salute around here.
You can forget about that. I'm Sgt. Leonard.
Private Gabaldon.
Don't get the wrong idea about that either.
We earn our pay.
Come on, I'll take you to the skipper.
You can leave your gear outside, men.
Replacements are here, sir.
Good. Bring them in, sergeant.
Sergeant Hazen reporting as ordered, sir.
Corporal Lewis reporting, sir.
Private Gabaldon reporting as ordered, sir.
Sir, Private Polaski reporting as ordered.
Sir, Private Martini reporting as ordered, sir.
Stand at ease.
Glad to have you aboard, men.
Welcome back to the 2nd Division, Hazen.
- How was the vacation?
- Things got a little too quiet for me, sir.
I'm glad to be back.
Lewis? How's it going? Says here you were shot in the ashcan?
Not bad, sir. Could have been with a howitzer.
Gabaldon. Speak Japanese, eh?
I get only part of that, but my Japanese is just so-so.
- Where'd you learn the language?
- Well, I learned it from my family...
...and neighbors when I was growing up.
Polaski, Martini. Fine boot records, men. I need all the good men I can get.
Well, now, officially we're part of Regimental Headquarters...
...R2 on the organization charts.
But in action, we're so far out in front we don't have contact with headquarters.
Now...
...I make it loud and clear that I've got the best...
...and toughest collection of specialists in the whole corps.
Now, you make sure you don't let anybody think differently.
Sergeant Leonard will fix you up with 48 hours liberty.
Enjoy yourselves, men.
It might be your last time ashore.
- That'll be all, sir?
- Yeah, carry on.
Aye, aye, sir.
What a dirty slop joint that was.
It's worse than the last three.
Charge you a buck a drink and nothing happens.
- I don't think they put booze in it.
- Say we get a bottle someplace.
Where are the dames? There's got to be three broads in this town.
- Here chick, chick.
- Are you kidding?
There's 10 guys for every dame in Honolulu.
Now there's a gal who hopes the war will never end.
You know those swabbies.
They'll kiss a snake if somebody'll hold it for them.
That's what old daddy's been looking for.
- oh, shake it baby, shake it.
- visit a Genuine Authentic Hawaiian village.
- That bus doesn't leave for a couple hours.
- Let's take a taxi.
Yeah, let's take a taxi, there's one right there.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'll go make a deal with him. okay, all you pretty little babies, get your grass skirts on.
Hey, buddy, you want to take us to that
"Genuine Hawaiian village" over there?
Sure, Mac.
Where can I get some whiskey, good whiskey?
Whiskey's hard to come by.
That's a brand new. 45. I stole it off the base this morning.
Interested?
You can get plenty for it.
Now it's still got the Cosmoline and wax paper wrapped around it.
I'll trade it for three quarts, and I mean good, now...
...three quarts of good whiskey. okay? only don't tell them guys because they're square.
Hey.
Be my guests.
Hey...
You mean, this is the Hawaiian village?
Yeah. Look, you wait up there and I'll see what I can do.
You mean, this is the place?
What about with the hula dolls?
Where are the broads with Hawaiian skirts shaking their gazoombas?
Hey, we've been took.
- Hey, what's with the boot?
- Watch your language.
What's with the bright boot?
Bonded. Just like the officer's Club's.
Where's the pistol?
All right, you're both under arrest. I warned you about this.
- CID, Criminal Investigating Division.
- But look...
We finally caught you, huh, Mac?
You're trading booze for government property.
I didn't steal nothing.
You know what we do to runners?
They get years and years, that's if we don't shoot them first.
- This kind of guy we hang.
- I've got a wife and kids.
We got the information you're the top guy in this outfit...
...that's been receiving this stolen property.
No, I just drive a cab. Tell him.
Tell him it was your idea. Tell him.
Let him go. He don't know nothing about it. You got me. What more do you want?
Well...
...all right. I gotta keep this as evidence.
- Please let me go.
- All right, get out of here.
Look at all the beautiful booze.
You know, buddy, not only are you a good buddy...
...you're also an A-number one con man.
That's a very rare and valuable combination.
And now...
...for the broad department.
Permit me. Thank you.
- Beachhead established, sir.
- My toast, sir.
Well, here's looking at...
At...
Hello, there, Madame Butterfly.
How would you like to...
Sorry, no speak English.
- Don't let her get away.
- You talk her language.
See if she talks ours.
If he can handle the dames like he can get the liquor...
...we're going to have a ball.
Yeah, the Iron Petticoat.
Do you know her?
Yeah, I know her. Half the guys on the island know her.
Well, listen, I'm just passing through, but how about a little introduction, huh?
Pete, do you remember the football game we played with Navy back in...
- Don't change the subject, just introduce...
- Not changing the subject.
What was the score?
- Nothing to nothing. There was no score.
- That is my point.
She's a writer for a magazine back in the States.
She writes about how everyone should give their all to the servicemen.
She just doesn't practice what she preaches, that's all.
- What a waste.
- Yeah, forget it.
Half the guys got Purple Hearts from bumping against the old Iron Petticoat.
Maybe it's time for her to get a
Purple Heart. How about introducing me?
What do you say? Introduce me, come on.
No deal. I'm not wasting a good liberty on operation Petticoat.
Get her for me. old dad's got a technique that'll cut that iron like it was tissue paper. Come on.
Please. For your buddy. okay, buddy, I'll see what I can do.
Go, man.
For the last time, will you please keep your clammy hands to yourself?
- Baby, just one little...
- Hi.
Sheila.
My name's Bill Hazen.
You did a story on me about a year ago and then we went dancing.
And if I know our Sheila, that's all you did. oh, yes, of course. How are you?
Just fine. okay, Marine, I suppose you're gonna try to steal my date.
Ignore him, sergeant. He's drunk.
Well, I'm not gonna let you.
Look, mister.
I'm going to give her to you as a gift.
- You can't treat me as if I were...
- Temper.
What a horrible thing to do to one of our fighting men.
Iron Petticoat.
I'm so ashamed.
- Drink?
- Yes.
Honey!
So, what we plan to do is, when you get off work, then it'll be about a half hour...
That's my buddy.
What have you been doing, Sheila? oh, a great many things. But I'm leaving shortly for Australia.
Australia. Well, that's... That's nice.
That's very nice.
What did you guys ever do before I enlisted?
Listen, tell me, what's up?
She gets off in a half an hour, and you and Bill are gonna flip for the roommate.
- She got a roommate?
- Yeah. oh, great.
- Well, what's with the roommate?
- Well, sounds great.
She's a dancer from San Francisco.
They've got their own apartment.
- They've got their apartment?
- We'll meet them there.
We don't have to flip. Look,
Bill's got his own date.
I'll tell you what, you go tell him that you and I are cutting out.
No, you go tell him because Sono told me where to get some booze.
It looks like we're gonna really need it. See you later.
See you later.
Hey, Pete. Pete, this is Sheila Lincoln.
- Sheila, this is Pete Lewis.
- Hi.
- You've heard me speak of Sheila.
- I sure have.
Yeah, well, Sheila's magazine is sending her to Australia.
Well, that's if I can get a seat on the plane. I have a very low priority though.
- oh, I wouldn't say that.
- What he means to say is he's been...
...dying to meet you, haven't you?
- oh, yeah.
I'm sorry I can't stay and chat with you. Guy and I have a date...
...with a couple of Japanese chicks, huh? I'll see you later.
We're going over to their apartment.
- Well, I'll see you later, Bill.
- Yeah, Pete, stay a while.
Look, Sheila...
...why don't we go along? Be a lot more fun than a bar or restaurant.
What kind of fun can you have in an apartment?
She serious?
Look at it this way, Sheila.
You can get a lot of local color for your magazine, isn't that right? oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I can see it now. A
Sheila Lincoln exclusive:
"I Saw our Fighting Men in Action. "
No?
Hey, Pete, will you turn around?
I can look at yours any day.
Don't you think of anything else?
Not lately, honey.
Hey, Sono, you don't have to wait on us, honey.
I'm not. I just want everybody to have a good time.
- okay, honey.
- "Honey. "
Everybody is "honey" to you. oh, go, girls, go, go, go.
Don't you men realize all a girl wants is respect?
Well, excuse me, ma'am.
Hey, go, Pete. Go.
Hey, honey, go, go.
Hey, that's it, Pete. Go, honey.
Never run out of ice as long as that dame's around. oh, you're mean.
I don't get it. She's got all the standard equipment...
...she's got the extras. Comes off the line without a motor.
She's got the motor.
The man with the right key hasn't shown up yet.
I wouldn't mind.
Yeah, baby!
You'd leave little old Sono? oh, no, I wouldn't leave little old Sono.
I wouldn't want hara-kiri on my conscience.
Don't flatter yourself.
After all the trays I've carried tonight.
I want somebody as tired as me.
Like that one.
Let's go, soldier. oh, I've had it, honey.
What's the matter, Pete? Did you run out of:
I don't know, I don't know, honey.
If I've got anything left I'm gonna save it for something important. okay?
Let's catch our breath, huh?
You catch your breath.
I ain't quitting while I'm ahead.
Go, baby.
Hey, let's go, Famika. Go, honey. oh, yeah.
Now, that's what we're really fighting for. Not Ma's apple pie.
- Hey, she's the greatest, right, Gabby?
- Great.
She should be. She was the best stripper in San Francisco.
No kidding.
Stripper?
Hey, Peter.
Famika is a stripper.
- What?
- Famika's a stripper.
- A stripper?
- Yeah.
- For real, baby?
- Are you impressed?
I sure am, honey.
I'm glad.
Hey, Famika, honey, come on, come on, let's have a little show, huh?
Down, boy. It's my night off. Besides, it might offend your lady friend.
Who? Sheila? oh, Sheila wouldn't mind.
You wouldn't mind, would you? of course you wouldn't, I knew you wouldn't.
We're gonna have a strip...
You'll never attract a stripper that way. Here, let me show you.
And now, folks, may I present the Queen of Burlesque:
Famika!
Famika's going to shake it from the tips of her toes...
...to the tops of her tiny tassels.
Hey move it, honey. Move it for me.
Come on, Famika.
Fire one.
Come on, shake it, shake it.
Come on, Famika, move it.
Go, baby.
Now, that is not a boy.
Hey, go, Famika, go.
Attababy.
Go, baby, go.
Go, honey.
- Now, that's what I call art.
- I've seen better.
Well, evidently you've been around a lot more than we have.
If anybody asks you, I went thataway.
Hey, how about that? I've got a front row seat and I'm not even bald.
You gotta change your seat, buddy.
Your girl's getting lonesome.
Your girl's getting lonesome.
That's my girl. The one over there catching cold.
Now, buddy, you're forgetting. I remember:
"Get her for me, buddy. I'll cut through that like tissue paper. "
- I was only kidding.
- Yeah, well, I'm not.
So if you wanna be a buddy-buddy.
Change your seat, buddy.
Come on, honey, go.
Go.
Go.
Let's go, Famika, come on, honey.
Go, honey.
Hey, that's it, baby, come on, honey.
Go.
Hey, come on, honey.
Hey.
Easy, boy, you'll break our lease.
You're breaking my heart, honey.
Come on, take off a little more.
You're cute, honey, but the show is over.
Come on, honey, come over here.
Well, did you like the show?
You call that a show?
Well, yeah.
Come here.
Come here, honey.
Put on the record.
- Not bad for a girl without a motor.
- Yeah.
Hey, Marine.
Your mouth is open. It's watering too.
Yeah.
Want some advice from an old campaigner?
Deal the cards. oh, you're kidding.
You want that?
Then turn around and deal.
She can have anyone she wants, so she doesn't want them.
Show her someone she can't have.
Deal.
Come on.
She's coming.
- Ignore her.
- I'll try.
What's the matter? Too much for you, baby boy?
- Whose play?
- Yours.
Nobody turns their back on Sheila.
Why don't you go back and finish your minuet? I'm busy.
What a waste of good whiskey.
Why, you dirty...
Come on, Guy. Come on, Guy.
- Hey, go, Marine.
- Yeah, come on.
Hey, come on.
Come on, Guy. Pin her down.
Pin her down. Now you got her.
But...
She... She's...
Don't you think it's a little warm in here?
Yeah, well, I think it's a little warm in here.
Two down and one to go.
Gin rummy?
Gin rummy?
- While those guys are...
- There's a time and place for everything.
You're right. We've got the time and this must be the place.
The time, yes.
Gin rummy.
At least let's make it interesting.
What'll we play for?
I wish I was smart enough to cheat.
Don't worry.
I'm always unlucky.
Well, we're still dancing.
Don't you ever change the music?
Music. Great bunch of Marines. oh, boy.
Three gorgeous chicks and what do you got? one guy's dancing, other guy's playing gin rummy...
...and the other guy's out there picking flowers. oh, yes. Some picking, huh?
Hey, they got the right idea. oh, They sure have. Well, let's go back.
Sono.
- Guess what?
- What?
Gin.
I told you I was unlucky.
Still leave the dirty work for the slobs on the ground, huh?
You're hit?
What's the matter?
Who you feeling sorry for, your Jap friends...
...or your buddies out there getting slaughtered?
Look, boot, you're not the first one that ever cracked up hitting the beach.
Damn it, we're all scared.
We need a satchel charge.
- Gotta get close enough to use it first.
- That gun's gotta be knocked out.
It's you and me, Lewis.
Cover us.
Right flank.
What are you doing here, Gabaldon?
Gabaldon!
Go.
Scratch one pillbox.
They understood you just fine, Marine.
Go. Go.
Hey, I'm...
- I'm sure sorry about what happened.
- Forget it.
You can fight on my team any day.
I... You know... Sounds crazy, but
I don't know what happened to me. I...
You had a problem to solve, that's all.
Yeah, but I'm not sure it's solved yet.
My folks were...
Well, it's kill or be killed, I guess, huh?
Kill or be killed, that's all you have to remember. Just don't forget it.
Your turn to play spy, Gabby.
Looks like we're gonna have a rough night tonight. oh, Sono, why did I leave you in Honolulu? oh, yeah.
Yeah, I see something.
Please, not while I'm eating.
Nellie Bly. Go ahead.
Pass the word to the skipper.
Here they come. Two tanks...
...about half the Japanese army.
Sir, two tanks moving in on Hill 3-6-8.
Notify Black Jack Six. We're moving out.
We're moving out. on the double.
Black Jack?
Give me Black Jack Six.
All right, get the lead out of your pockets.
Man, they're really whooping it up.
Looks like they're loaded on sake.
Banzai attack for sure.
Yeah.
How we gonna see them?
Want to know something?
I had a real strange dream.
Do you know what I dreamed?
I dreamed we were back in the orchestra, sitting side by side, rehearsing the 4th Brandenburg
Concerto, the slow movement, and that everything we have now we had behind us.
We only remembered it like a nightmare.
I woke up crying.
I started to cry when we were playing.
It was the slow movement, you know...
Aren't you going to shave today?
Well, if you insist.
- Why are you so angry?
- I'm not angry.
You look angry.
You're always angry these days.
You better get dressed so we don't miss the ferry.
We have to be at the mayor's house before 9:00.
It isn't my fault.
I didn't start this damn war.
If there is any money left, we could buy a bottle of wine.
What do you think, Eva?
You're awful.
Go and dress now.
I think I'm getting a wisdom tooth.
- Do you think the dentist is in town?
- We'll find out.
Iùs awful with wisdom teeth.
Once I had one over here on the right side.
The dentist had to take it out piece by piece.
He went on for a whole day, without anesthesia.
I had a fever for weeks afterward.
I hope this one isn't that bad.
That would be awful.
Can you see anything?
No, nothing.
Touch here.
Iùs swollen, like a lump.
We better hurry up.
Did you pay the telephone bill?
Damn, I forgot.
Iùs not right paying for something you don't have.
The phone never works.
Either they'll have to repair it...
...or I shouldn't have to pay.
We need a phone, you know that.
Of course. Naturally.
But we don't get a lot of orders.
We need a phone, or we'll lose the whole business.
They can just as well call the Olssons.
We can pay them every time someone calls.
Do you hear the church bells?
Is it some kind of a holiday today?
No, iùs an ordinary Friday, isn't it?
- What do you suppose that means?
- Nothing. Hurry up.
We're already late.
It frightens me when the bells ring on an ordinary weekday.
- What time is it?
- Five past 6:00.
Yes?
Hello?
I think iùs going to rain.
Why don't you get your leather jacket?
Damn it!
Jan?
What is it now?
You can't be so sensitive.
I can't stand it.
Pull yourself together. I do.
Can't you ever shut up?
I'm sorry.
I forgot my jacket anyway.
There have been a lot of convoys lately.
I didn't mean to be so nasty to you.
- I just lost my temper.
- I can defend myself.
Listen...
Yes, tomorrow is exactly four years since we moved to the island.
Did you know that?
The day before yesterday was a year since Grandfather died.
We shouldn't forget to put flowers on his grave.
No.
Hi, Filip.
Hi.
What did you talk about?
He was listening to the radio about an hour ago.
Enemy troops might invade.
They have been talking about that for years now.
Our damned radio is always broken!
Our damned car is always broken.
If only you wouldn't try and repair it so often.
There we go.
Iùs better not to know anything.
I'm so fed up with your escapism.
No, I'm not going to argue with you.
We're going to have fish for dinner.
Sounds good!
When you stood there talking to Filip,
I felt really in love with you.
You were so beautiful.
From a distance, right?
- Good morning!
- How funny.
We were just on our way to see you.
Iùs so nice to see you.
- We brought the lingonberries.
- Really?
Good morning.
We have lingonberries for you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs. Rosenberg.
My wife and I just went out to look after our little summer house.
I told the mayor we were on our way with your lingonberries.
- Really?
- They're very nice.
- Really?
- I don't know if we can bring them.
- We're going to see our son.
- We'll bring them there for you.
- Sure it won't be any trouble for you?
- Oh, no.
- Of course not.
- Will someone be there?
Miss Almberg is home.
Knock on the door.
This was nice. Why don't you come over some evening?
We'll eat, then make music, like in the old days.
- That would be wonderful.
- Great.
I miss our musical gatherings.
- We both do.
- Yes, we do.
We haven't played any music since conductor Kreisler was drafted.
Can I ask you something?
These military convoys... what do they mean?
The situation has worsened a bit lately.
They say so much on the radio, you don't know what to believe.
And our radio is always broken.
I believe in living in hope.
You never know what will happen.
I got a letter from my sister, who has been evacuated.
She's in a refugee camp now, where they bomb almost every day.
- Thaùs awful.
- We're almost there now.
We have to say good-bye, but leùs meet some evening, okay?
- Yes, just call us.
- Yes, we'll give you a call.
- Good-bye.
- Bye. We'll see you soon.
- Our best regards to your son!
- Thank you. We'll tell him!
- Can we use the main entrance?
- Of course.
Okay, leùs go in.
I got ten kronors more than I asked for.
Leùs go to Fredrik's and buy some wine.
Careful... come on.
Hello?
Hello?
No, he's not home.
He's never out.
- Hi.
- Hi.
There you are.
So you've been drafted, too?
Yes, look how they've dressed me up.
I haven't handled a gun in over 20 years.
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
And I have nobody to look after the store.
But maybe that doesn't matter.
What can I do for you?
We would like to buy a bottle of wine.
I still have some left.
I want to show you something.
Look at this.
Iùs the finest thing I have.
Iùs an antique, right?
18th-century Meissen.
How did you get it?
I inherited it from my mother.
I'll never sell it.
Listen to it for a while, and I'll be right back.
Do you listen to the radio?
No, ours is broken all the time.
I've tried to fix it, but I can't get it to work.
Yesterday, they threatened the most horrible measures.
And this morning they congratulated us on our heading for disaster.
The same song we've heard for years.
We shouldn't listen to them.
Wait a minute.
This is not what we meant.
Just try this.
Iùs really good.
We were going to buy a bottle.
This one is not bad.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- This wine is so good.
- It really is.
What is it?
Can I have a look.
I have only five bottles left.
Look... '59.
- Can we afford this one?
- Oh, yes.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
You know, when I am sitting here alone among my things,
I feel so... sad.
I don't know why.
Maybe iùs because no one will miss me if I disappear, not even Mrs. Prins.
Mrs. Prins?
The one who cleans the house once a week.
She cleans up, and then she makes the coffee...
...and then we make love.
No, Mrs. Prins will probably not miss me very much.
Before you know it, you'll be home again.
- How much is the wine?
- You can have it for ten.
You would have gotten it for free, but I need some money to give Mrs. Prins.
Thank you very much!
Very kind of you!
She's going to look after my things while I'm gone.
We don't want to miss the ferry.
Yes, you see,
I have some pain in my foot.
Iùs really painful, actually.
I wonder if they pay consideration to a foot.
Maybe they can give me an administrative job...
They didn't want me.
- Maybe they'll send you back.
- Leùs not talk about you.
The most important thing is to show goodwill and not come running with a doctor's certificate.
Absolutely, you have to tell them.
Maybe they'll let you go.
See you again soon.
Bye, and thank you very much.
- See you soon.
- I hope so.
- Good-bye, then.
- Thanks again.
Bye.
I think we should drink a toast for Filip and for his fish.
- And my cooking.
- And for your cooking.
Eva, did you know the radio works?
Did you repair it?
- Yes, finally.
- You are so smart.
- Aren't I?
- When you want to, you are.
I'm always smart.
- Do you know what I'm going to do?
- No.
- I'm smart, too, you know.
- I know that.
I'm going to start learning Italian.
- Are you? Finally.
- Tonight.
- You've talked a lot about it.
- Yes, and we can help each other.
Every evening you've got to tell me to study my Italian.
I will time you and quiz you, and I'll be very strict.
You know what else we should do?
Each morning, after we've fed the chickens, we should play music.
You, up in the morning?
I want to see that.
I promise.
We could play for half an hour every day.
We have the instruments and we have lots of music.
We have to keep practicing.
Jan, I want to have babies.
Sometimes
I want to have a baby.
Now?
- No, not now.
- Why?
- I can't explain why.
- Please explain it to me.
Iùs a kind of feeling...
I mean...
- Can't you wait...
- No.
...until it calms down?
No, I think iùs important now.
Many of the things that might be bad between us depend on the fact that we have no children, that I as a woman don't have a child.
I mean, I'm 30, and iùs time I had a baby.
30 is not old.
You can wait till you're 40.
Women should have children when they're young.
I will have 3 children when I'm 40.
Then we'll be a family.
Listen, I'm serious now.
- Don't be angry.
- I'm not going to be angry.
Next time we go to the village, leùs see the doctor.
- What for?
- To be examined.
Since I don't have any children yet and...
I mean, I am healthy.
I know that.
Yes, but I'm healthy, too.
We are both healthy.
- Iùs just psychological.
- Jan, I'm serious.
If we go to the doctor, he can examine you.
Don't take it personally, but when we didn't live together, well... we both know what you were doing then.
- I didn't do anything.
- That could be important.
It could be the reason we don't have children.
Because you had a lot of women who...
No, I didn't.
Why talk about this now?
It was nothing.
I've always loved you.
You know that.
- What about the opera singer?
- That meant nothing.
It was nothing.
It only happened once.
I have always loved you, Eva, and I still love you.
You know, I don't think you know what love is.
Of course I know.
Love of yourself.
You know a lot about that.
No. I'm not as selfish as you think.
I think you're enormously selfish.
I'm going to be a better person next year, even next week.
- Are you?
- I promise.
I believe in a complete change of character, if you really want it.
You?
Yes. I'm not a determinist, you see.
- What?
- Determinist.
What is a determinist?
A determinist is a person...
...who...
I don't care if you're a determinist or not, as long as you fix the sink tomorrow.
Leùs not wash the dishes now.
We're not doing the dishes now?
So what are we going to do now, then?
- Where are you going?
- To help him. He might be injured.
- They might shoot you.
- You're a damned coward!
Stay here!
You're not going to help when someone's hurt?
Let me go!
Go, then!
I have to call an ambulance.
Was it one or two who jumped from the plance?
We just saw one, didn't we? Yes, one.
- Did you shoot the pilot?
- Why would I have done that?
No, I guess it wasn't you.
I advise you to get out of here.
They have dropped paratroopers only a few kilometers from here.
I know what we'll do.
I'll put it in first gear, then you give it a little push.
[Air Hissing]
She's probably too young to even remember what an American looks like.
Let's hope so.
She could set the Nips on our tail.
Are you suggesting that we hold her as a hostage?
No.just cut her tongue out.
Yeah, well, that sounds reasonable,
Sergeant Blood.
Let's knock off the chatter and get this sand straightened out.
[Man ♪7 ]
This is it.
You don't suppose that's Miguel?
[ Man ♪7 ]
Well, it isn't what I expected.
[ Man ♪2]
Maybe Miguels in that hut over there.
One way or another... we're gonna have to interrupt a pleasant little scene here.
Burnett, you cover us just in case.
[Clicks]
Off to his left.
Yeah, I see it.
Looks like a Nip soldier.
Hut! Another one!
Shoot, Lieutenant!
Shoot, damn it!
You moved into my line of fire.
- I couldn't get a shot off.
- I couldn't help it.
Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Let's check out that hut.
- Why didn't Craig fire?
- Ask him.
He disappeared.
Let's check inside the hut.
What are we gonna do with 'em?
Maybe we'd better wait until Miguel gets here and let him figure it out.
Why don't we just let 'em go?
Well, they've apparently collaborated on at least one level.
Maybe more.
I don't like it any better than you.
I know. lt just seems like, uh-
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
I'm Lieutenant Gary Craig,
U.S. Army Military Intelligence.
We have not seen
American equipment since I 942.
This is new.
- Very good.
- Are you Miguel?
- No.
- [Gunfire]
We were supposed to meet a man named Miguel here.
I know that.
Miguel is dead.
He died after being tortured.
The japanese torture him?
F tortured him.
I am Paco.
I lead this band of guerrilleros.
Come with me.
This man called Miguel said you come on a mission of great importance... that you would need guerrillo help.
Yes.
So the invasion is finally so near.
I think that's generally known, even by the japanese.
Tell me, why did you kill this man Miguel?
I have nothing to explain.
I told you a fact.
How did you want me to help you?
After you tell me you've killed an emissary from Manila underground... how can I trust you?
You cannot trust anybody.
Haven't you learned that yet?
I could not trust your Miguel.
I cannot trust you.
Let me tel! you, Lieutenant...
I can get answers from you one way or another.
If you have any hope of my helping your precious mission, you will volunteer the answers.
Now»...
how did you want me to help you?
I don't respect your threats, Paco.
I understand your position here, but you must understand mine.
War and understanding seldom mix.
Well, that's true. But we're not at war with each other, are we?
This is a map of the Lingayen Gulf coast... all the way from Dagupan to Ragong.
Now, General Yamashita knows... that a Luzon invasion is imminent... and will probably occur either at Lingayen Gulf or Batangas Bay.
And yet he's reduced his beach defenses in this area instead of reinforcing them.
He only has a few gun batteries that we know of
But also, he's pulled his troops out of there.
This can only mean he's got some sort of a trick up his sleeve.
We've been sent over here to find out what that trick is.
We need your help.
We need the help of guerrillas who know this area.
Also, General MacArthur needs this information as soon as possible.
I do not take orders from General MacArthur... and I do not take orders from you.
We have lived in the hills for three years only to kill the japanese... so don't try to shine your lieutenants bars in my eyes.
You and your men come with us to our camp.
Saddle up.
We're going with them.
Eduardo, Carlos.
[Speaking Filipino]
- Where are they being taken?
- Back to the village.
- What'll you do with them?
- It doesn't concern you.
[Filipino]
[ Craig]
Let it go, jersey.
[ Paco] I'!! take this equipment for the time being.
I know you would like to tell the good general everything... but I don't want radio signals giving the japanese an advantage in our game of hide and seek.
Why must General Yamashita be so certain the invasion will come at Lingayen?
For the same reason the japanese used it three years ago.
It's a direct route down the valley to Manila.
- I have a question for you.
- Yes?
Why did you go to the place Miguel said was the rendezvous if you felt it was a trap?
I thought I owed it to him to see if he spoke the truth. He seemed sincere.
He seemed sincere.
Then why did you kill him?
It is a time of suspicion.
Jersey, point of curiosity.
Are they our friends, or are we their prisoners?
- What difference does it make?
- What difference does it make?
Yeah. We're all gonna die anyway.
Tomorrow, next week,
30 years from now.
- Did that little thought ever penetrate your thick skull? - Once, when I was a boy.
But naturally, I dismissed it as being too outrageous.
I'm thinkin' about the radio.
We'll use a rope.
[Speaking Filipino]
Well, Jersey, old boy, here's your chance to become a funambulist!
- A what?
- A funambulist!
Surely you know what it is!
Yeah. It means some kind of an idiot.
In your case perhaps.
But usually it means a tightrope walker.
Burnett, your mind is a grab-bag of trivia.
Eon voyage, Sergeant Courage'.!
Sergeant Flaming Wild Bill Courage!
[Giggles]
Cold rice and camote cannot compare with the Waldorf Astoria.
This is one of our few luxuries- liberated japanese sake.
Do you get all your supplies from the japanese?
No. The towns and villages in this area offer us supplies.
You can? come and go in the towns as you please, can you?
Japs can't afford the men to keep a garrison in each town.
We need only to avoid the periodic patrols that come through.
Paco.
[Speaking Filipino]
You will stay.
Well, what's the story, Lieutenant?
I'm anxious to find out myself.
This man doesn't trust anyone.
That's how he's kept himself and the others alive for three years.
I suppose so. But we don't have time to wait around to let him make up his mind.
And we'll get nowhere if we try to push him.
Tolstoy. Nietzsche. Thomas Aquinas.
Are these books required reading for guerrilla leaders?
Before the war, Paco taught in the school in our village.
Is this before the war too?
He and his wife and their child.
She is dead.
When the japanese invaded... the Americans destroyed much of our town with mortar fire.
She and the child were killed.
I think maybe that explains a few things.
The man outside is a messenger from the town near here.
He says the japanese know you landed on the beach last night.
The kem peitai-secret police- have come to the town and demanded... that the guerrilla forces you contacted turn you in to them.
Or starting at 6:00, they will execute one child for every hour you remain free.
Mayor... what kind of men... are these guerrillas?
What? Oh, why, they're only men, just like everyone else.
You should relax.
Certainly they'll not permit
Filipino children to die... simply to save some Americans.
[ F Man ]
Mayor! Mayer;
[Speaking Filipino]
What was that?
He says the guerrillas have killed the three Americans.
I demand proof I
The children will die, one by one, unless I have proof.
[Speaking Filipino]
[Filipino]
He says Paco understands that.
He'll give you proof if you send three men under your surveillance... to the street approaching the church at 5:00.
He'll give you proof.
[Speaking japanese]
[Speaking Filipino]
Captain! You sent a very stubborn sergeant...
who cannot believe a fact when he sees it!
You should have sent a more reasonable man.

The only two still alive- the kempeitai captain and one soldier.
They have been taken to the house of my father.
I have decided we will go with you.
We will leave tomorrow morning.
You will understand, though, at all times, I am still in command.
We go with you...
but I cannot say how far we will help until I see what must be done,.
I will risk no more of my men to save American troops.
Because of you...
I have two men dead and one wounded.
As I said, I will not risk any more men to save American troops.
If you understand that, we can start in the morning.
I understand completely.
The captain and the soldier have been locked in the shed.
- Under guard?
- Of course.
I'd like to question the prisoners, Paco.
I will question them in the morning.
I'd like to question them now- the sooner the better.
In the morning.
They will stand under guard all night.
If they fall asleep or try to sit down, they will be beaten.
They will be ready for questioning in the morning.
Excuse me for being so poor a host.
I am Aming Pajarillo, mayor of this town.
You'll do me the honor of eating with us tonight and being my guests here.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I'm afraid I only have extra food for yourself.
Your men will have to eat with the others.
Please forgive these conditions and accept my invitation.
Do you know a man named Miguel from Manila underground?
He was here some days ago... trying to be placed in contact with the nearest guerrillo group.
But he had lost his letters of identification.
He had been stopped on the way here.
The japanese-
It is a reign of terror these past months.
The entire country rests in uncertainty.
20,000 executed in Manila alone.
So this Miguel is dead, yes?
Fear.
We eat each other to survive.
Everything is twisted.
Where will we stay tonight?
Stay home with your father.
He will wonder about you.
I do not live in my father's house.
I live with you.

You know how old this girl is?
Sixteen.
Sixteen years old.
Is that not incredible?
Astounding.
What's the matter?
I'm tired.
Well, it wasn't one of our easier days.
Naw, that's not it.
Just all these people we're sitting with-
I don't know what I'm supposed to feel about 'em.
I don't even know if I feel like feeling anything.
What was it?
The fight today?
[Laughs]
That whole thing was ridiculous.
It went so close to the way we planned it,
I hardly had time to feel the usual fear.
Well, look, we got a little time-out here.
Let's enjoy it.
There's music, some booze, girls.
Why don't you talk to that girl next to you? She's a nice girl.
What am I gonna talk to her about?
I hardly recognized you in that dress tonight.
I know.
You look like a different person.
Or maybe it's more that you look like another time... not now.
Yes, not now.
Would you like to go outside?
How did you wind up with the guerrillas, Maria?
My people hate being conquered.
I am with my people.
I was in love with Paco.
And the war-
The war seems to make everything right.
Besides, the towns aren't so safe.
Sol stay in the hills.
But I'm not a hero.
I am only a girl.
Will you excuse me?
We will be up early in the morning, and the march will be long.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute what?
You're not gonna pass out, are you?
You got something interesting to keep me not passing out?
[jersey]
I'm telling you about Craig.
[ Burnett]
I know what you're telling me.
I always know what you're telling me.
You know what you are, Jersey?
A cynic.
A cynic.
You're the kind of guy that'd call
Mahatma Gandhi a rabble-rouser.
An, Burnett, can you concentrate first "gust two seconds?
I mean, just long enough for me to tell you what I'm trying to tell you.
This Craig... he's a good soldier- damn good soldier.
But, on Leyte, he started wearing thin... just like at the rendezvous this morning.
He had a clear shot at this Nip coming at us.
He could have chopped him down
40 feet away, but he froze.
Just froze.
Two of our guys-
Spicer and Murphy.
They're good joes, Burnett...
and they'd be here today if he weren't cracking.
And he is cracking.
You know that, don? you?
Why, 'cause he started thinking about japs as human beings?
Is that what you call cracking?
That's the worst kind.
Listen, and don't give me that “human being“jazz.
What's so special about a human being?
It gets born. It stumbles around in life for a while. It dies.
That's all.
So you gotta kill a couple here and there along the way. What difference does it make?
What can I say?
In war, you can always find justification.
Wars are tailor-made for guys like you, jersey.
Sergeant War.

[ Footsteps Shuffling] interrogating a prisoner is like cooking a goose.
You must know when to take it out of the oven.
We will try the captain, but what we will get will come from the young soldier.
I cannot approve torture, Paco.
Lieutenant, your approval means nothing to me.
I am in command here... and I'm not chained by the rules of the Geneva Convention.
Well, let me talk to him first.
After that, you can do what you want.
Captain, I-
I want some information.
I want to know about the beach defenses at Lingayen... about the troop movements in that area.
Also anything you can tell me about Yamashita's strategies.
I cannot give you that information, Lieutenant.
Maybe you better know some facts.
We took Leyte and Mindoro in five weeks.
Now the whole Pacific is ours.
After Midway, Coral, Leyte Gulf... the lmperial japanese Navy has been completely crushed.
We'll be on Luzon in three weeks.
And we'll be on the island of japan before the year is out.
I'm not familiar with those facts, Lieutenant... because they do not exist.
Captain, I want you to reconsider.
If you don't, I cannot guarantee your safety.
I can tell you nothing.
Do you speak English?
- Burnett.
- Ho.
I'm gonna ask him a few questions.
I want you to translate for me.
I want to know about the beach defenses at Lingayen... and the troop movements in that area.
[Speaking japanese]

He says he knows nothing, and, if he did, he would tell you nothing.
Are you through?
Yeah, I guess so.

That's all he knows.
We shall find out.
Young soldier?
Get anything?
Yeah, we got somethin', I guess.
I'll let Paco tell you about it.
It's his victory.
He was very little help.
He says they're expecting a great invasion... and that many troops have gone through headed for the Lingayen area.
But he has a friend who writes him saying they're not setting up beach defenses... but rather building up in the mountains near Baguio.
Did he say how many troops?
No. No, that's all he knew.
- Hardly seems like it's-
- [Guns/vats]
What was that?
They have been executed.
For God sakes, Paco, why?
- The reasons are obvious.
- The reasons are not obvious.
They were through with the war.
What harm could they do?
It would seem that the issue is closed.
[Hisses]
[Speaking Filipino]
This is one of those
I told you about- those who pretend to be guerrilleros; but are only bandits.
[Speaking Filipino]
Paco!
[Laughing]
Have the Americans landed? Huh?
Soon. Tell me, Ramundo, why are you so far south?
Conditions.
Why are these Americans here?
- I will ask the questions.
- As k.
Why are you heading south?
The japanese are moving troops.
Ah. So, that's why the Americans are here- to find out about the troop movements, eh?
- [ Chuckling]
- What do you know?
[Laughing]
- This information is important, yes?
- What do you know, Ramundo?
Valuable “information?
Have to be bargained for.
Only pirates bargain over their country.
But I'm a good pirate, yes? Huh?
[Laughing]
You are an offensive pig.
[Chuckling]
What does a pig want?
- I want the radio.
- Impossible.
I want the radio.
Manila underground will pay well for it.
If the information that he has is valuable, and it checks out... he can have the radio after we're finished with it.
- What if it is not valuable?
- I know every move the japanese make.
These are my mountains. Eh? Eh?
If the information you have is valuable... you can have the radio after we're finished with it.
- I cannot wait long.
- You won't have to wait.
The radio will be mine.
After we send the message.
Now, where are the troops?
Where? Everywhere!
They crawl over the mountains like ants over honey.
Guns. Carts. Soldiers.
It is one big fortress. I show you.
There is a road that comes from the river.
It cuts through a steep valley towards Baguio.
Can this information be trusted?
He isn't smart enough to tell that elaborate a lie.
Well, there are many Filipino villages marked here.
If this information is somehow incorrect...
and those villages are not evacuated».
Those people will be bombed.
A supply road and a couple of emplacements are not too far off.
Some of the villages are along the way.
The two of us could check them out tonight.
If the information bears out, you could radio in the morning.
Good.
They are gone too long.
They'll be back. Relax.
I'm grim' south.
- I take the radio now.
- Not until we send the message.
The japanese “covers“ these hills.
It's too dangerous to wait.
Well, that's your problem.
I gave you the information you wanted.
Well, it's no good until we send it.
You can send it, but you don't trust me.
We have to be sure.
We can't take chances.
The information is true.
Send the message now.
We wait until Paco and the lieutenant get back.
Maybe they don't come back.
We wait and see.
- I don't like this.
- Then head south. No one's holding you.
- We made a bargain.
- You remember the conditions of that bargain.
You're gonna have to wait, and that's the end of it.
All right. All right.
You keep the radio.
We go.
- Garde? Did you hear that?
- Yes.
Have one of your men follow a ways to see that they keep going.
(Aka)'
[Gunfire]
[Gunfire]
[Laughing]
- Maria, are you all right?
- Yes.
- Burnett, how about you?
- Yeah.
The radio.
Damn!
Well, he got what he wanted, all right.
- What was all the shooting about?
- Ramundo left.
But before taking off, he peppered the radio.
What'd you find out?
Ramundo knew what he was talkin' about.
Everything we checked out was exact.
Yamashita's plan is pretty obvious now.
- Are you gonna be able to fix this thing?
- No chance.
Well, Lieutenant, it seems you've lost your voice.
How far to the nearest guerrilla radio set?
Malolos or San Fernando.
How long would it take us to get there?
A week, 1 O clays.
Oh, that's no good.
Ramundo pointed out a jap shortwave station... about half a day's march from here, right?
- About six hours.
- Burnett.
Would it take you long to learn how to operate a jap shortwave?
No. A radio's a radio.
What's your idea, Lieutenant?
I don't have one.
Maybe if we go over there and look around, we might come up with something.
Anyway, it's our only choice.
All right. We'll go with you.
But as you know, I won't promise support until I see the situation.
That's fair enough.
And we should leave now.
It'll be safer.
We'll get there before dawn.
Fine.
Their camp is about a half mile down the river.
Paco and I will go check it out.
- You want us to take this one?
- No. I'll do it.
Burnett, you break this message down into code.
It'll be tough to try it by the road.
Let's go check out the approach from the river.
[Whispering]
Kill him.
Kill him.
The other guard.
His boots. His boots.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I don't understand.
With some of his equipment gone, they'll think it was the work of bandits.
If they suspect the truth, there would be an alert... and you wouldn't have a chance of getting in.
That is, if you still want to.
I don't know.
Paco, what's it gonna be?
Your lieutenant must make a decision.
Then I will make mine.
Well, we got what we came after, but we haven't sent it back yet.
That's pretty obvious.
We need that radio down there.
We haven't got the stuff to take it by a frontal assault...
so there's only one other way.
If we can get in there before dawn... there's a good chance we can get to the radio, send a message... and get out before they know it.
What if they catch us at the radio?
We can use Paco and his men for diversion fire to cover us.
Look, anything can happen.
I'm not even sure it's worth a chance.
You could call it quits right now and be justified in doing so.
What do you think, Lieutenant?
I'd like to try it.
I don't know if it's right or wrong.
As a man, I think it's stupid.
As a soldier... what can I do?
You gonna be able to pull it off?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Once we get in there, that's no place to start comin' apart.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[No Audible Dialogue]
- [Taps Key]
- I think we're ready.
[Tapping Code]
[Speaking japanese]
[Speaking japanese]
[Shouting]
- [Craig Any action yet?
- No. Nobody's answering.
Fat's in the fire now.
Just keep sending the code.
Identify yourself.
No formality.
Don't worry.
[Speaking Filipino]
[Gunfire Continues ]
- [ Gunfire Continues]
- [ Filipino]
[Gunfire]
Can't divert enough of their fire.
They won't get out?
No.
- How is he?
- He's hit good.
That's gonna make it tough gettin' outta here.
Doesn't matter. With this kind of heat, we ain't goin' nowhere.
- Did he send the message?
- I don't know.
[Gunfire Continues ]
- Please.
- No. You stay.
Okay Jersey.
Paco's givin' us our chance.
Let's move.
[Gunfire Continues In Distance]
- Sergeant, he's dead.
- I know he's dead, for God's sake.
He was dead before we left the shack.
- Why?
- Why? I don't know why.
Why leave him there?
That's no place.
I'll take him back where we were by the river... and put him down there.
I don't know what difference it makes.
He doesn't know where he is.
But I know where he is, and that's why I'm takin' him.
It's a good place.
Where are the others?
Back there, dead.
- Paco?
- Dead.
- Paco dead too.
- What do we do now?
We'll figure somethin'.
What are they like, these girls?
They're very good.
Bit wild.
Spend their money quickly, work hard.
- Are they literate?
- Some of them.
In reformatories since being picked up.
Jobs like this. It's degrading.
You shouldn't use human beings to move earth.
- No.
- And it's not efficient.
If they'd give me two more excavators
I'd be a year ahead.
You're an impatient generation.
- Weren't you?
- Yes, we were.
Very.
Don't be too impatient, Comrade Engineer.
We've come very far, very fast.
I know, Comrade General.
Yes, but do you know what it cost?
There were children in those days who lived off human flesh.
Did you know that?
What is your interest in this girl,
Comrade General?
She may be my brother's child.
- Yuri Andreyevich?
- Yes.
My half brother, I should say.
If she is, she's also Lara's child.
The Lara?
The Lara, yes.
This is...
...a new edition of the Lara poems.
Yes, I know.
- We admire your brother very much.
- Yes. Everybody seems to, now.
We couldn't admire him when we weren't allowed to read him.
No.
Come in.
I sent for you, comrade.
You're not in any trouble.
I'm General Yevgraf
Andreyevich Zhivago.
I'm looking for someone.
Do you understand?
The person I'm looking for would be my niece.
Please sit down.
Your name is...?
Tonya Komarov, Comrade General.
They found you in Mongolia?
- Yes, Comrade General.
- What were you doing there?
- I was lost, Comrade General.
- How did you come to be lost?
- I've forgotten.
- Was Komarovsky your father's name?
I suppose so, Comrade General.
You suppose so?
It's a common name.
Do you remember your father?
No.
Do you remember your mother?
Yes, I remember my mother.
- What was her name?
- Mummy.
What was she like?
I mean, what did she look like?
Big.
Big?
I was little. She looked big.
- Can you read?
- Yes.
"Lara: A Cycle of Poems by Y.A. Zhivago. "
Not me. My half brother.
The person I'm looking for...
...would be this man's daughter.
This would be her mother.
"Lara. "
Did anybody ever call your mother Lara?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
She's nice.
I'm not your niece, Comrade General.
I'm nobody's idea of an uncle.
But if this man were my father,
I should want to know.
Did your mother ever tell you your father was a poet?
Comrade General, my father wasn't a poet.
What was your father?
Not a poet.
Did you like your father?
I've forgotten.
But you liked your mother.
Yes, of course.
Does the name Strelnikov mean anything to you? Strelnikov?
Varykino?
That's a place, not a person.
- Gromeko?
- Gromeko.
Yes.
You see...
...he lost his mother...
...at about the same age you were...
...when your mother...
...lost you.
And in the same part of the world.
"Now is life's artful triumph of vanities destroyed...
...for the spirit has vanished from its tabernacle.
Its clay groweth black.
The vessel is shattered, voiceless, emotionless...
...dead. Committing which unto the grave... "
Yuri!
You and your husband will dine with us, Madame Gromeko.
Thank you, Father.
Will you lie down then, Yuri?
Your mummy and I were great, great friends, you know.
So now we are going to look after you.
Thank you.
That's Mother's!
It's yours now.
Yes, Yuri, Mummy left it to you.
In her will.
Do you know what a will is, old chap?
Money.
No, Yuri, just this.
Your daddy has all...
Can you play it?
Thought all the people here could play the balalaika.
You don't live here, do you?
No, we live in Moscow.
That's a long way from here.
But you'll like Moscow.
- Won't he?
In a bit.
Takes time to get used to things, doesn't it?
Mother could play it.
Well, your mother was an artist, Yuri.
She could make this common little instrument sound like two guitars.
Your mother had a gift.
Perhaps Yuri's got a gift.
Would you like lessons?
I can't play it.
Say good night to Yuri, Tonya.
He's your brother now.
Good night, Yuri.
- Good night, old chap.
- Good night.
The Gromekos didn't know what to make of him.
He made his reputation as a poet while he was studying to be a doctor.
He said that poetry was no more a vocation than good health.
What he needed was a job.
Pretty?
Very.
It's their right to be pretty.
- What do you do next year, Zhivago?
- I thought of general practice.
Think about doing pure research.
It's exciting, important.
Can be beautiful.
General practice.
Life. He wants to see life.
Well, you'll find that pretty creatures do ugly things to people.
What's your name?
- Antipov.
- Address?
15 Petrovka.
- I'll have these.
- We have permission from the police.
Yes? Well, you claim them at the station.
- When?
- Now, if you like.
- Very well.
- Pasha! He's my brother.
Well, take him home, miss.
Before he gets into trouble.
Pasha, please.
It's got to be done.
Pasha, why has it got to be done?
For them. For the Revolution.
Pasha, they don't want a revolution.
They do. They don't know it yet, but that's what they want.
Give me some of those, comrade.
Pasha?
Are you a Bolshevik?
No, the Bolsheviks don't like me, and I don't like them.
They don't know right from wrong.
Pasha Antipov, you're an awful prig.
Why did you tell him
I was your brother?
What else could I have told him?
You could've told him
I was your fiancé.
Pasha, don't be silly. I'm...
Monsieur Komarovsky has come to see my mother on business.
People gossip round here.
It's the system, Lara.
People will be different after the Revolution.
Will you come?
No, Pasha.
I've got exams to take, Pasha.
I've got to get my scholarship.
Hello, Auntie.
There's a letter for you.
From Paris.
- Lovely writing.
- Lovely. She's coming home next month.
Tonya? Oh, that's good.
He does seem to be very well-informed.
And such a handsome figure of a...
Good evening, maman.
- Madame.
- Larissa.
You can work in there, dear.
Monsieur Komarovsky's here.
Good evening, Larissa.
Good evening, monsieur.
He advises some very important people.
Yes, I know.
I believe he has government connections.
I don't know, I'm sure.
Isn't he very expensive?
Monsieur Komarovsky advises me out of kindness, baroness.
He was a friend of my late husband's.
- Oh, I see.
- Allow me.
Tuesday, if I can, my dear. Bye.
Where did you get this?
Friend gave it to me, monsieur.
You're not to go to this
"peaceful" demonstration.
No, monsieur.
May not be as peaceful as they think.
That's all I have to say.
Tell your friend she's a silly creature.
Yes, monsieur.
How old are you now?
Seventeen, monsieur.
Hundred and three.
Oh, dear. And I was so looking forward to it.
Oh, never mind.
I'll be all right here.
You will take Lara, won't you,
Victor Ippolitovich?
So stupid of me.
It's her first long gown...
- I think you'd better call it right off.
- Yes, I'll stay with you.
Nonsense, I'll be perfectly all right. I've got a book.
So disappointing for her,
Victor Ippolitovich.
There's so little opportunity to mix with good society.
Very well, get your coat.
We're late, if we're going.
I want to avoid Kropotkin Street.
"Brotherhood and freedom. "
Yuri, what splendid words.
"Justice, equality and bread. "
Don't you think they're splendid?
Yes, I do.
"Brotherhood and freedom. "
Brotherhood and fiddlesticks, you're frozen through.
You've no right, Anushka.
It isn't fair.
Ah! We'd given you up, monsieur.
My niece. Coat, Lara?
Come, my dear.
How's the foie de veau Gascogne?
As always, monsieur.
- All right, not too much...
Not too much mustard, monsieur.
Oui, mademoiselle.
Wine, monsieur?
- A little light wine, yes.
Oui, monsieur. Mademoiselle?
This place must be dreadfully expensive,
Monsieur Komarovsky.
It is. Why not "Victor Ippolitovich"?
I can't.
Mother made this dress.
Very nice.
She's clever, isn't she?
Your mother? Yes. Fine little woman.
No doubt they'll sing in tune after the Revolution.
Prepare!
Mount!
Draw sabers.
Charge!
Mama!
What, what...?
What?
Good night, dear.
Good night, Victor Ippolitovich.
Go inside your houses, please.
All these people will be taken care of.
Go inside, please.
All these people will be taken care of.
Go inside, please.
Get inside.
Yuri, please. No trouble.
Take him inside, or I'll put him under arrest.
Yuri, I beg you.
Tonya's coming home tomorrow.
Yuri!
Tonya!
Yuri?
Well!
Daddy!
There, now. That's enough.
Your mother, your mother.
Mummy!
Mummy, how are you?
Me? Fit as a fiddle.
Turn round.
Well, they've taught her something.
- Oh-ho! Look at that.
- Isn’t Yuri looking well, Tonya?
Yes. Well, let's get along, dear.
Yes, run along, you two.
Oh, I bought you this.
It has a piece in it about young Russian poets.
Oh, good, thank you.
Does it mention me?
It begins with you. You're the best.
Very intelligent nation, the French.
They have their heads together.
Yes, they're looking at the paper.
They're head over heels.
Anushka, stop it!
Good marriages are made in heaven.
Or some such place.
- Victor Ippolitovich?
Pasha.
I want to talk to you.
No, Pasha.
It's important.
All right.
Pasha!
How did you do it?
I didn't.
A dragoon did.
Oh, Pasha, darling!
Come, come.
Where's your mother?
Asleep.
Pasha.
Pasha, I can't deal with this.
Have you got any iodine?
- Yes, but...
- Get it.
Pasha, darling!
Pasha, you must go to a hospital.
I daren't for a day or two.
- Will you do something for me?
- Oh, yes. What?
Hide this.
Oh, throw it away!
No. There'll be no more peaceful demonstrations.
There were women and children, Lara, and they rode them down.
Starving women, asking for bread.
Up on Tamskaya Avenue, the pigs were eating, drinking and dancing.
Hide it for me.
Thanks, comrade.
Oh, Pasha, darling,
I'm not your comrade.
Lara?
- Yes?
- Lara, who's there?
It's only Pasha.
- You came in very late last night, dear.
- The time went so quickly.
Good.
- Are you going to church?
- Yes.
You know what our Lord said to the woman taken in adultery?
Yes, Father.
He said, "Go and sin no more. "
And did she?
- I don't know, Father.
- Nobody does, child.
The flesh is not weak. It is strong.
Only the sacrament of marriage will contain it. Remember that.
Monsieur, it's number six this evening, sir.
The most important person here.
- Sorry I'm late.
- I've been waiting nearly an hour, Victor.
- Have you ordered?
- No.
Well, you should have done.
You chose it, Victor.
- You've grown up a lot, haven't you?
- Yes.
- What did you tell your mama tonight?
- Victor, don't.
Aww.
- May I smoke?
- Yes, of course.
You like it, don't you? Cigar smoke.
Come along, my dear.
Drink, drink, drink.
Up, up.
Up. Up, up, up.
Where did you tell her we were going, your mama?
She didn't ask.
- That's because she knows.
- No, she doesn't.
You'd both take an oath she doesn't, but she does. You both know she does.
- Victor, don't.
- What?
- Torment me.
- Torment?
What a little hypocrite it is.
I'm going now, Victor.
Well, if you like, dear.
You see, you'll always come back.
Stay, darling.
Stay.
Wake up! You take this and you show it to someone if you lose your way.
Professor Boris Kurt.
You find him! Now, go on.
Professor Boris Kurt!
But, Boris, this is genius.
Oh? I thought it was Rachmaninoff.
I'm going for a smoke.
How's the general practitioner?
- A bit scared of his finals.
- I don't think he need be.
How do you like the idea of marrying a general practitioner?
I like it very much.
But no general practitioner's asked me.
No? I thought you nomads were hot-blooded?
A slow lot, these general practitioners.
How do you fancy a professor of pathology?
- Does he write poetry?
- Alas, no.
Then I'm afraid it's out of the question. Excuse me.
- That's a marvelous girl, Zhivago.
- Yes, I'd noticed.
It's for you.
How'd the poet like to see a bit of general practice?
Boris, thank God you've come.
This is very good of you.
- Yes, I know it is. My assistant.
- How do you do?
- Come on, where is she?
- This way.
- When did she do it?
- About 8:00 this evening.
You know what it was?
- Why didn't you get a local doctor?
- I couldn't.
No, I suppose you couldn't.
Come on, then.
Let's turn her over.
Right.
Water.
Right, Yuri. Come on, my dear, pick up.
Now, Yuri.
Come on, dear.
- Oh, come on, Yuri.
- Sorry.
Well, my dear. That's it.
That's it. Good. Good.
Good.
Is she gonna live?
Water.
- She is, isn't she?
- Yes.
Funny thing. There's a man, speaks on public platforms.
In with the government, in with the Liberals, in with everybody.
And he risks it all. For that!
That's not how poets see them, is it?
That's how GPs see them.
- That's how they are.
- You know, from here, she looks beautiful.
Zhivago, I think you're a hard case.
Lara. Lara!
There's a child in the case, a child.
Her daughter.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Boris.
She might've thought about Lara before she did it.
Does the girl know?
I'm afraid she does.
- Is she here?
- Yes.
Well, tell her that her mother's going to live.
- Wait a minute, Victor. Yuri.
- Yes, of course.
- What are we gonna say about this?
- Must we say anything?
I'm afraid so. I'm taking her to the hospital.
We'll have to say something.
You know that needn't be difficult, Boris.
- What's the name of your assistant?
- Zhivago.
- Andreyevich?
- Yes, why? Do you know him?
- No, I knew his father slightly.
- Right.
Cheer up, Yuri. I'll have the poor bitch in hospital tonight.
What's his name?
That's Victor Komarovsky.
He says he knows you.
He executed my father's will.
Uncle Alex turned it down.
Komarovsky said there wasn't much in it, and what there was belonged to him.
He's a very good businessman.
But I doubt that he's crooked.
Very good company. Knows life.
He's had a bad scare tonight.
You don't mind coming here, do you, Victor?
No, no. It reminds me of my youth.
- I went to the hospital again.
- And?
She wants you to go and forgive her.
For her suspicions.
You can tell her the truth if you like, Larissa.
- Is this him?
- Yes.
- He knows nothing about...
- No!
Pasha, this is Monsieur Komarovsky.
Please.
- Will you eat?
- No, thank you.
I hope you don't think this is impertinent.
Not at all.
I have advised Larissa's mother for years.
I'm interested in what happens to her. something I have to tell you and that is this:
I am committed to the Revolution.
Nothing, not even Lara...
...has more importance for me.
You misunderstand.
Your political views do not concern me.
So far as that goes, I'm probably more in sympathy than you suppose.
I have a few contacts of my own which might surprise you.
- How do you propose to live?
- I've been offered a teaching post.
- May I know where?
- Gradov, it's in the Urals.
- I know it. Not much of a place.
- It's beautiful country, monsieur.
- Be a quiet life, won't it?
- That's what we want.
Well, you'll excuse me:
Will your salary be adequate?
Adequate, not more.
Pavel Pavlovich, my chief impression...
...and I mean no offense, is that you're very young.
Monsieur, I hope I don't offend you.
Do people improve with age?
- They grow a little more tolerant.
- To tolerate more in themselves.
If people don't marry young, what do they bring to their marriage?
A little experience.
I'm 26. My mother died needlessly when I was 8.
My father died in prison.
I have fended for myself.
I've worked my way through school and university.
I am familiar with things that you can hardly guess at.
This is an experience of a kind, certainly.
I've no amorous experience, if that's what you mean. None whatever.
Lara's 17. That speaks for itself.
You probably find this situation comic.
We don't.
We're going to be married next year.
I hope I haven't offended you by speaking plainly.
Not at all. Admirable.
A young crusader.
- He's...
- He's a very fine young man.
That's obvious.
You're very generous,
Monsieur Komarovsky.
Larissa, I want to talk to you.
Monsieur Komarovsky, have you...?
I beg you, drop this affectation of addressing me as "Monsieur Komarovsky. "
Under the circumstances,
I find it rather ridiculous.
Lara, I am determined to save you from a dreadful error.
There are two kinds of men, and only two.
That young man is one kind.
He is high-minded. He is pure.
He's the kind of man the world pretends to look up to, and in fact despises.
He is the kind of man who breeds unhappiness, particularly in women.
- Do you understand?
- No.
I think you do.
There's another kind.
Not high-minded. Not pure. But alive.
That your tastes should incline towards the juvenile is understandable.
But for you to marry that boy would be a disaster.
Because there's two kinds of women.
There are two kinds of women. And you, as we well know, are not the first kind.
You, my dear...
...are a slut.
I am not!
We'll see.
And don't delude yourself this was rape.
That would flatter us both.
- The master's not at home, Miss Lara.
- Not at home?
No. He went to the
Sventytskis' Christmas party.
Are you going there, miss?
Please don't say I told you.
- No. Thank you, Piotr!
- Merry Christmas, Miss Lara!
Thank you and merry Christmas to you.
Merry Christmas, Yuri Andreyevich.
Lara.
What's the matter?
We had an appointment this evening.
Where are you going?
- Haven't you read the letter? I left a letter.
- I've not been home. I'm going now.
Where are you going, Lara?
I've a right to know.
Lara, what's in this letter?
What's in this letter?
- Lara, are you breaking...?
- It's all in the letter.
- What is?
- Everything.
Don't!
Yuri, there's an extraordinary girl at this party.
I know. I'm dancing with her.
- You're keen tonight, Victor.
- I like to win.
Silence! Silence, everybody.
Silence, please.
I have a very delightful announcement to make.
- Oh, Madame Sventytski.
- Yes, why not?
Aha! I have to announce that
Dr. Yuri Zhivago, yes, Dr. Zhivago...
...he came third in all Moscow.
Now, listen. Please, please.
Dr. Zhivago is betrothed in marriage to...
My dear Victor!
My dear man.
- Get her out.
- What?
Get her out. Get her out!
- Yes, yes. I'll get the police.
- No!
- Don't get the police.
Leave me!
I do not want the police.
Just get her out!
Let her go.
Please. Quiet, friends.
Please give way, yes?
Please, would you mind?
Would you mind? Thank you. Thank you.
- Our destinies seem to be interwoven.
- Yes.
- I was a close friend of your father.
- I knew you were his business partner.
Rather more than that.
I was present at his death.
Also, I'm in contact with your brother.
Yevgraf?
I'm in contact with those in contact with him. I disagree with Bolshevism.
Thank you.
You seem to know your trade.
But I can still admire Bolsheviks as men.
Shall I tell you why?
Yes.
They may win.
I'd like to meet him. Yevgraf.
He sent me a marvelous letter.
- He likes my poetry.
- That would've pleased your father.
Your father was not a bad man, Yuri.
If I may call you Yuri.
I hardly knew him.
You, perhaps, may not credit this...
...but he was devoted to your mother.
I suppose I may continue to rely on your professional discretion?
You mean, will I tell anyone the truth about that girl?
That's what I mean, yes.
You may continue to rely on my professional... et cetera.
You are fastidious, aren't you?
What happens to a girl like that when a man like you has finished with her?
Interested? I give her to you.
You shouldn't smoke.
You've had a shock.
I give her to you, Yuri Andreyevich.
A wedding present.
Yuri?
Where have you seen that girl before?
- What makes you think I've seen her?
- Haven't you?
- Yes.
- Where?
I'm not supposed to say.
It was on a case. Her mother...
No, don't tell me if you're not supposed to say.
In bourgeois terms, it was a war between the Allies and Germany.
In Bolshevik terms, it was a war between the Allied and German upper classes.
And which of them won was a matter of indifference.
I was ordered by the Party to enlist.
I gave my name as Petrov.
They were shouting for victory all over Europe...
...praying for victory, to the same God.
My task, the Party's task, was to organize defeat.
From defeat would spring the Revolution.
And the Revolution would be victory for us.
The Party looked to the conscript peasants.
Most of them wearing their first good pair of boots.
When the boots wore out, they'd be ready to listen.
When the time came, I took three battalions with me out of the front line.
The best day's work I ever did.
But for the moment, there was nothing to be done.
There were too many volunteers, like me. Mostly it was mere hysteria.
But there were men with better motives, men who saw that times were critical...
...and wanted a man's part.
Good men, wasted.
Unhappy men too.
Unhappy in their jobs.
Unhappy with their wives.
Doubting themselves.
Happy men don't volunteer.
They wait their turn and thank God if their age or work delays it.
The ones who got back home at the price of an arm or an eye or a leg...
...these were the lucky ones.
Even Comrade Lenin underestimated...
...both the anguish of that 900-mile-long front...
...and our cursed capacity for suffering.
By the second winter of the war...
...the boots had worn out...
...but the line still held.
Their greatcoats fell to pieces on their backs.
Their rations were irregular.
Half of them went into action without arms, led by men they didn't trust.
Come on, you bastards!
And those they did trust...
Come on, comrades, come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Comrades! Earthshakers! Show them!
Charge them!
At last, they did what all the armies dreamed of doing.
They began to go home.
That was the beginning of the Revolution.
Deserters.
Replacements.
Tote...
...arms!
Come back!
Stick together!
Stick together and we'll be all right.
And be ready for them.
Turn round, lads.
Don't go any further.
Come on, turn around.
Pigs for the slaughter.
Turn round, lads!
Don't listen to them.
Get back in your ranks, I say!
Don't pay any attention to those cowards!
No more war! No more war!
Listen, lads. Ten miles up that road are the Germans!
- Rubbish!
- It's not rubbish. They're coming.
And they're coming fast.
You've let them in!
They're coming for your wives, your houses...
...your country.
- Your country, officer!
Yes, my country! And proud...
Get back in your ranks!
Get back in your ranks, I say!
Get back!
Get back in ranks!
- Are you a nurse?
- Yes.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Then help me.
I ought to tell you,
I'm not a trained nurse, I'm a volunteer.
I see, right. Why did you volunteer?
- I came here to find my husband.
- Very gently.
- Have you ever seen an operation?
- Yes.
We'll manage.
They're in the next village, brothers! The Germans.
- Your Honor...
- Keep still.
Did you find your husband?
No.
- Your Honor...
- Yes, we'd better be off.
You know, you often look at me as though you knew me.
I have seen you.
Four years ago, Christmas Eve.
Were you there?
No wonder you look at me.
- Did you know Victor Komarovsky?
- Yes, I did.
- That young man who took you away...
- My husband.
A lot of courage.
He made the rest of us look very feeble.
As a matter of fact, I thought you both did. Good man to shoot at.
I'd give anything never to have met him.
The Tsar's in prison.
Lenin's in Moscow!
- Civil war has started.
- Good!
Civil war, good?
Not good, Comrade Nurse. Inevitable.
But Lenin in Moscow!
This Lenin, will he be the new Tsar then?
Listen, Daddy, no more Tsars, no more masters!
Only workers in a workers' state!
How about that?
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.
Follow me, please.
I can't deal with this.
Order of the Provisional Government.
You'll have to try, friend.
"If you could see how hard we've been working here...
...I'm sure you'd forgive me for not writing more regularly. "
- When was that written?
- July 20th.
Eight weeks!
"But now the war seems really to have stopped.
The hospital is emptying, and I shall have more time.
I may even get time to write some verse, if I've not forgotten how to. "
Oh, I do hope so.
"Larissa Antipova is still here, and I admire her more and more.
She has that strange gift of healing, which doctors don't believe in.
She often does the wrong things, but it always seems to work out right.
How is Uncle Alex?
Can he still get his English tobacco?"
Would that he could.
"Can Sasha say his letters yet?
And how is Auntie Anna?"
He didn't get my letter.
"Most of all, my dearest, how are you?"
Strangely upsetting, he doesn't know she's dead.
Can't see what difference it makes.
They're at it again!
I wish they'd decide once and for all...
...which gang of hooligans constitutes the government of this country!
Cheer up, Sergei.
Don't you want to go home?
There's fighting at home, Your Honor.
I've had enough.
Red Guards and White Guards...
The old man's had enough.
Your Honor is a kind gentleman.
And the nurse is a kind lady!
- Finished?
- Just about.
- In a while, you'll be with your little girl.
- If I can get on a train.
I want to be with Katya more than anything in the world.
Yes, of course.
But now that we're going, I feel sad.
Sad. Really sad.
Well, we've been here some time.
This must have been a lovely house once. Don't you think?
What are you going to do?
- In Gradov?
- Yes.
- I'll be all right.
- I wish I could think so.
You could run a laundry.
What will you do?
I suppose I'll go back to the hospital.
It's funny to think of you there.
I used to pass it on my way to school.
- Do you ever come to Moscow?
- From Gradov?
If only there were someone to look after you.
Of course, if there were,
I'd be destroyed by jealousy.
Zhivago, don't.
My dear...
Don't, please.
Now, look what you've made me do.
Yuri, we've been together six months...
...on the road and here.
We've not done anything you'll have to lie about to Tonya.
I don't want you to have to lie about me.
You understand that, Yuri?
You understand everything.
Come on, comrades! I'm in a hurry!
Going home, Kirill?
Home, Your Excellency? Petrograd.
I'm joining the Red Guard.
What about your wife?
Sometimes, Comrade Nurse, women have to wait.
Right. Goodbye, honored doctor.
Want some advice?
- Said the millstone to the barley.
- That's right. Adapt yourself.
- Goodbye, Ivanov.
- Goodbye, Your Honor.
Goodbye, Andre.
Goodbye, Simeon.
I'll never forget Your Honor. Never.
Goodbye, Zhivago.
Goodbye. Thank you.
Pilenko.
Giddap!
- Goodbye, brothers!
Goodbye!
The doctor is a gentleman.
- Right. Written all over him.
- He's a good man.
God rot good men.
Yuri!
Yuri.
This is Comrade Yelkin, our local delegate. He lives here.
How do you do?
Welcome.
- Comrade Kaprugina.
- Welcome.
It's not for you to welcome us, comrade.
Comrade Kaprugina is the Chairman of the Residents' Committee.
- Yes, of course.
- Your discharge papers?
Oh, yes.
I signed them myself, I'm afraid.
Holy Cross? What?
- Holy Cross Hospital, it's on...
- The Second Reformed Hospital.
Good. It needed reforming.
Medicals report to their place of work at once.
Yes, I believe there's typhus.
You've been listening to rumormongers.
There is no typhus in our city.
Well, that's good news.
I'll report tomorrow.
When you've started work, you'll get a ration book.
I've always worked.
- Whatever is the matter?
- You are.
There was living space for 13 families in this one house.
Yes.
Yes, this is a better arrangement, comrades. More just.
But it is more just.
Why did it sound so funny?
Is it good to be home?
- Sasha?
- Who else?
This is your daddy, Sasha.
- Sasha.
Sasha!
- Naughty boy!
- No, don't say that.
May I come in?
Watch carefully.
I'm about to ignite the last half of the last cigar in Moscow.
- Good meal?
- Very.
Say something.
- That was very good, Tonya.
- That was nothing.
She saved that salami for three months.
- Have you, darling?
- I got it for a clock.
She's a marvel. Coffee, you observe.
Stop it, Daddy.
He knows I'm a marvel.
- Did you write any poetry?
- Quite a lot.
Is it good?
Yes. I think so.
- Can I see it?
- But of course.
What happened to Nurse Antipova?
Your letters were full of her.
Yes, I suppose they were.
The girl who shot friend Komarovsky, isn't it?
Yes, Daddy. You know it is.
She's gone home to her little girl.
- Oh, we shan't see her then?
- No.
What a pity.
Farewell, the pleasures of the flesh.
What I don't understand is how we're going to stay alive this winter.
You have no right whatever to call me from work.
- As a Soviet Deputy, I...
- That gives you the power, not the right.
It's noticed, you know.
Your attitude is noticed.
You should have called the area doctor.
I want this done quietly.
Why, what is it? Typhus?
I'll take him away.
Get me some transport.
It isn't typhus.
It's another disease we don't have in Moscow: starvation.
- That seems to give you satisfaction.
- It would satisfy me to hear you admit it.
- Would it? Why?
- Because it is so.
Your attitude is noticed, you know.
Oh, yes, it's been noticed.
- Yuri!
- Hello.
The stove's out.
Tonya, the stove's out.
What's the matter with you?
No wonder he's losing weight.
She lets it out as soon as you're gone and she lights it before you come home.
We haven't enough fuel.
I told myself it was beneath my dignity...
...to arrest a man for pilfering firewood.
But nothing ordered by the Party is beneath dignity...
...and the Party was right.
One man desperate for a bit of fuel is pathetic.
Five million people desperate for fuel will destroy a city.
That was the first time I ever saw my brother. But I knew him.
And I knew that I would disobey the Party.
Perhaps it was the tie of blood between us, but I doubt it.
We were only half-tied anyway.
And brothers will betray a brother.
As a policeman, I would say:
"Get hold of a man's brother, and you're halfway home. "
Nor was it admiration for a better man than me.
I did admire him, but I didn't think he was a better man.
Besides, I've executed better men than me with a small pistol.
You'll have to live like the rest of us, doctor.
Bring it back! Bring that back!
Oh, listen to His Excellency.
I want no anarchy!
I want this carried out correctly.
- What are you doing?
- Reallocation of living space.
Fifty square meters per family of less than five.
- Damn it, whose house is this anyway?
- Father, be quiet!
All right, 50 square meters!
What're you doing with my things?
- They're being stored.
- They're being stolen.
Yuri!
- Just a minute!
- And where did you get this?
- I pulled it out of a fence.
I told them who I was.
The old man was hostile.
The girl, cautious.
My brother...
...seemed very pleased.
I think the girl was the only one who guessed at their position.
You're just as I imagined you: you're my political conscience.
I asked him, hadn't he one of his own?
And so he talked about the Revolution.
You lay life on a table, and you cut out all the tumors of injustice. Marvelous.
I told him if he felt like that, he should join the Party.
But cutting out the tumors of injustice, that's a deep operation.
Someone must keep life alive while you do it, by living. Isn’t that right?
I thought, then, it was wrong.
He told me what he thought about the Party and I trembled for him.
He approved of us, but for reasons which were subtle, like his verse.
Approval such as his could vanish overnight. I told him so.
Well, I can't approve this evening something you may do tomorrow.
He was walking about with a noose round his neck and didn't know.
So I told him what
I had heard about his poems.
Not liked?
Not liked by whom?
Why not liked?
So I told him that.
Do you think it's "personal, petit-bourgeois and self-indulgent"?
I lied.
But he believed me.
It struck me through to see that my opinion mattered.
The girl knew what it meant, what it was going to mean.
They couldn't survive what was coming in the city.
I urged them to leave and live obscurely in the country...
...where they could keep themselves alive.
We have... Used to have an estate at Varykino near Yuryatin.
People know us there.
He didn't resist. I offered to obtain permits, passes, warrants.
Told them what to take and what to leave behind.
I had the impertinence to ask him for a volume of his poems.
And so we parted.
I think I even told him that we would meet again in better times.
But perhaps I didn't.
Fifty persons! Fifty persons only!
- Tonya!
- Yes!
Tonya! Here!
Fifty persons only! Get back!
Fifty persons only! Fifty persons only!
Fifty persons! Only 50 persons!
Charming accommodation.
"Charming accommodation. "
That's very good.
I'm an intellectual.
Shut up, you "intellectual. "
Shut up, you lickspittle.
Forced labor.
Attention, comrades, your train will leave tomorrow morning.
"Health regulations for the journey:
Night soil will be emptied every morning without fail.
Straw to be replaced at 10-day intervals, the old straw burned.
If fresh straw is unavailable, old straw will be turned. "
This is disinfectant. Use it.
- "This wagon is a unit of Voluntary Labor. "
- Liar.
"You're required by the
Military Committee to assist them.
One carriage is occupied by sailors of the heroic Kronstadt Sailors' Soviet. "
- So you'll be in good hands.
- They're idiots.
"Attention. In approximately 11 days' time, you'll pass through the Urals Province...
...where White Guard units, aided by foreign interventionists...
...and other criminal reactionary elements have recently been active.
The Military Committee assures you...
...the criminals have been routed in that area by Red Guard units...
...under the command of
People's Commander Strelnikov. "
There's a man. Clap him.
"The line is definitely clear.
Long live the Revolution. "
Long live anarchy! Lickspittle!
Bureaucrat!
Is that necessary?
Six volunteers I've signed for, and six I'll deliver.
I'm a free man, lickspittle.
There's nothing you can do about it.
I'm the only free man on this train.
The rest of you are cattle!
Help me, brothers, for the love of God!
Come on!
Yuri, the child is dead.
It wasn't my child, dear, and his little soul's in heaven now.
- Who did it, comrade, the Whites?
- The Whites?
No. Strelnikov.
Well, then, you must have done something.
It wasn't us. The commander said we'd sold horses to the Whites.
It wasn't us. It was those pigs in Kuniko.
We told him, but he didn't believe us.
- I expect you were lying.
- As God's my witness...
But he isn't.
Commander Strelnikov is a great man.
A commander, Sasha, and he lives on bread and water.
- Does he?
- I don't know. They say so.
It's true. No one knows where he comes from.
- And they never know where he is.
- He's back up the line.
Yes?
Now, someone's for it, eh?
Oh, really! Not again.
What this time?
Never mind, Father.
Get a good night's sleep.
I know what I'm going to do.
Look!
The Urals.
Look, Sasha, look!
That's where we're going, darling.
Through the mountains and into the forest.
Then keeping much warmer still.
Will there be wolves in the forest?
Strelnikov!
Yes.
That's Strelnikov.
Daddy?
What's that noise?
It's only a waterfall.
No, the other noise.
Guns, Sasha.
- Are they fighting?
- They must be.
It's a long way away.
Let's go to sleep.
Get him!
No!
Look.
- Is that all?
That's all.
Bring him.
Who sent you here, Zhivago?
No one sent me here, commander.
I'm with my wife and child.
They're on the train from Moscow.
- Yes, we've checked that.
- Then?
You put your knife with a fork and a spoon and it looks innocuous.
Perhaps you travel with a wife and child for the same reason.
No!
Yuryatin is occupied by White Guards.
Is that why you're going there?
No, we're going on to Varykino.
Not through Yuryatin.
It's under shellfire.
Commander, I'm not a White Agent.
No, I don't think you are.
All right, Kolya. Thank you, comrade.
Sit down, doctor.
Take it.
It's not as silly as it seems.
There have been one or two attempts.
Are you the poet?
Yes.
- I used to admire your poetry.
- Thank you.
I shouldn't admire it now.
I should find it absurdly personal, don't you agree?
Feelings, insights, affections.
It's suddenly trivial now.
You don't agree. You're wrong.
The personal life is dead in Russia.
History has killed it.
I can see how you might hate me.
I hate everything you say, but not enough to kill you for it.
You have a brother.
- Yevgraf?
- Yevgraf, yes. The policeman.
- I didn't know that.
- Perhaps not. A secret policeman.
- Did he send you here?
- Yevgraf?
No, Yevgraf's a Bolshevik.
I don't know anything about these things.
Oh, you know a great deal.
When you came in, you recognized me. How?
- Has someone shown you photographs?
- No.
I am certain that you recognized me.
I've seen you before.
When?
- Six years ago.
- Go on.
Christmas Eve, you...
You were there?
Or has someone told you this?
I attended to the man who was injured by your wife.
Why do you call her my wife?
I met her again. We served together on the Ukrainian front.
I'm sure she'd vouch for me.
I haven't seen her since the war.
She's in Yuryatin.
Yuryatin?
The private life is dead...
...for a man with any manhood.
We saw a sample of your manhood on the way, a place called Mink.
- They'd been selling horses to the Whites.
- No.
- It seems you burnt the wrong village.
- They always say that, does it matter?
A village betrays us, a village is burnt.
Point made.
Your point, their village.
Kolya!
What will you do with your wife and child in Varykino?
Just live.
Take him away. He's innocent.
You're lucky.
We've been diverted.
Do you know where we're going?
- Yes. Varykino Halt.
- Thank God.
Hello?
Hello?
How lovely.
Oh, how lovely!
Hello?
Hello?
- Alexander Maximovich?
- Yes.
It's me, Petya.
- Your Honor.
- Now, now, now.
That's all done with, you know.
How do we get to the house, Petya?
As you always did, Your Honor.
Look, Sasha.
What is it, Petya? Forest fire?
Forest fire, Your Honor?
That's Yuryatin.
Poor souls. First the Reds, then the Whites.
Now the Reds again.
That Strelnikov, his heart must be dead.
Go on.
We'll soon be there now, Sasha.
Another five miles.
Is it that far? One forgets.
How is the place?
Well enough, Your Honor.
It's all locked up, you know?
Varykino.
All locked up, you see.
A body, styling itself...
...the "Yuryatin Committee of Revolutionary Justice"...
...has expropriated my house in the name of the people.
Very well.
I'm one of the people too!
Don't, Your Honor!
They'd call it counterrevolution.
Father, don't. Petya brought us here, that makes him a counterrevolutionary too.
They shoot counterrevolutionaries.
It's not the Reds in the town, it's the Reds in the forest.
- Partisans.
- Here?
Who knows? They go where they want and they do what they want.
All we need is a roof, Petya.
And a bit of garden.
Is there nowhere?
They didn't lock the cottage.
Oh, yes, we can manage here.
The stove works.
- I'll find you a few sticks of furniture.
- And some seed potatoes?
I'm afraid the garden is dreadfully run back.
Yes, thank you.
Well done, my boy.
I must say, scratch a Russian and you'll find a peasant.
I've always said so.
Well, you're wrong. He works like a peasant but he isn't a peasant.
I don't mind, Tonya, really.
- It's a good life.
- It certainly is.
I wouldn't be surprised if you two looked back on this time as one of your best.
Awfully glad about the expected new arrival, Yuri.
Anna was born here, you know.
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, I'm terribly glad.
Aha! Here's winged Mercury.
Looks a bit down in the mouth.
Petya.
What news from Yuryatin?
No lard, no sugar.
Oil next week, perhaps.
Flour, salt, coffee...
...and nails.
Bad news?
- Oh, Lord, not another purge.
- No.
- Strelnikov's gone.
Well, that's not bad news.
No, he's in Manchuria, they say.
That's the news.
They've shot the Tsar.
And all his family.
Oh, that's a savage deed!
What's it for?
It's to show there's no going back.
Yuri, why don't you go to Yuryatin?
Yes, why don't you, my boy?
It'd do you good.
Why? What's in Yuryatin?
It isn't Petersburg.
Very decent little library there.
- If it's still there.
- I wish you would.
No, I don't think so.
Anyway, the roads are blocked.
Zhivago.
Yes.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
We're at Varykino.
Varykino?
Why Varykino?
Why not? We had to go somewhere.
But here?
I came here to find my husband.
The one who was reported killed.
Strelnikov.
I met him.
- Met him?
- Yes.
How long have you been living here?
About a year.
- Alone?
- With Katya.
- Where is Katya now?
- At school.
Is Tonya with you?
All of us.
- Sasha?
- Of course.
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.
Yuri?
It's awfully early, isn't it?
Half past 6.
What're you doing?
Nothing. Couldn't sleep.
- Is anything the matter?
- No.
Shall I get some tea?
Yes, do.
Hello. You are silly.
We called and called.
- Did you? I didn't hear.
- Well, we did.
- Hello, Lara.
- Hello.
- How's Olya Petrovna?
- She gets worse and worse.
She gave us C.I. and arithmetic all morning.
- C.I.?
- Civic Instruction.
Look.
- That's very good, Katya.
- Thank you.
It's the Tsar.
The Tsar's an enemy of the people.
Well, he didn't know he was an enemy of the people, you know.
Well, he should've known, shouldn't he?
Yes, he should.
Fancy not knowing C.I.
Doesn't your little boy go to school?
Lunch.
Good.
Come on, you.
Smell.
What?
This one's a prizefighter.
Yuri.
Wait a minute.
There.
- I'm going into Yuryatin, darling.
- What, now?
Yes, I want to get some morphine, disinfectant.
- I shan't need morphine.
- You never know.
I shan't need it today.
No, but it's pretty close.
I hadn't realized.
- You'll be back before it's dark?
- Long before.
Yes, yes, my darling, do what's best.
I am not coming back.
- I understand.
- But never, Lara!
You understand?
Do you believe me?
Comrade Doctor,
I need a medical officer.
Sorry, I have a wife and child in Varykino.
And a mistress in Yuryatin.
Comrade Medical Officer, we are
Red Partisans. And we shoot deserters.
- Where are you taking me?
- To the front.
- And where is the front?
- Good question, doctor.
It's wherever there are enemies of the Revolution.
Wherever there is one gang of White
Guards or foreign interventionists.
Wherever there's one resentful bourgeois, one unreliable schoolmaster...
...one dubious poet hugging his private life.
That too is the front.
- How long are you going to keep me?
- For as long as we need you.
Now!
Charge!
Well, that was easy.
Come on, doctor, let's see what we've done.
St. Michael's Military School.
You old bastard!
It doesn't matter.
Did you ever love a woman, Razin?
I once had a wife and four children.
He has been a good comrade.
And a good medic.
We took him from his wife, we took him from his child.
None of this matters.
What does matter, Comrade Commissar?
Tell me, I've forgotten.
- This is contemptible. The doctor stays.
- I command this unit!
We command jointly.
The Party bulletin expressly states...
I could have you taken out and shot.
And could you have the Party taken out and shot?
As the military struggle nears its close, the political struggle intensifies.
In victory, the military will have served its purpose.
All men will then be judged politically...
...regardless of their military record.
Meanwhile, there are still White Units in this area. The doctor stays.
That concludes the meeting.
Comrade, where are you going?
Are you running away, comrade?
- Soldiers.
- Red soldiers or White soldiers?
Soldiers.
Tonya?
Tonya! Sasha!
Tonya!
Tonya!
Tonya! Hey!
Tonya! Tonya!
- This is Yuryatin?
Yes, Yuryatin.
What's happened at Varykino?
- Moscow folks?
- Yes.
They've gone away. Gone away.
There's nobody at Varykino.
Lord, what happiness!
They say you're alive.
Someone saw you near the town.
I take it you've gone to Varykino, so I'm going there myself with Katya.
Just in case, I've left a little food.
Boiled potatoes mostly.
Put the lid back on the pan or the rats will get it.
I'm mad with joy!
Tonya.
Tonya!
- Yuri.
- Tonya!
- Yuri.
- Tonya.
Yuri, darling.
It's all right, Yuri.
They're safe. They're in Moscow.
- In Moscow?
- Yes.
- Tonya?
- All of them. They're safe.
Safe.
Firing squads!
Better.
What?
I've got a letter for you.
I've had it three months.
And it was three months getting here.
It's from Moscow.
I think it's from Tonya.
It's addressed to you, care of me.
She came into Yuryatin to find you when you vanished.
Someone sent her here.
You met?
She's very fine.
My dearest dear.
I'm sending this to Larissa Antipova's...
...because if you are alive, which God grant...
...I think that is where you will go.
We have a little daughter, Yuri.
Did you know?
Her name's Anna.
Father sends greetings.
Sasha has grown quite a lot.
He's quite big now.
Whenever we speak of you, he weeps and won't be comforted.
This is what I have to tell you:
We are being deported from Russia.
We can't make out if you'd be allowed to join us.
An organization in Paris, which I mustn't name, will know where we are.
But nothing is certain, and there's very little time.
I'm writing this in haste.
They're coming for us now.
God bless you.
I must honestly admit that Antipova is a good person.
Yuri, when they got away to Moscow, she left something here.
Yuri?
May I come in?
Yuri Andreyevich, you've changed, I think.
Oh, yes, decidedly.
Larissa...
...remarkably the same.
I came from Moscow.
I'm on the way to Vladivostok.
I'm here to offer you my help.
We don't want it.
- Speak for yourself.
- We don't want it.
Yuri Andreyevich, you spent two years with the Partisan's 5th Division.
You have no discharge, so you are a deserter.
Your family in Paris is involved in a dangerous émigré organization.
Now, all these are technicalities.
But your style of life...
...everything you say, your published writings, are all flagrantly subversive.
Your days are numbered...
...unless I help you.
- Do you want my help?
- No.
Wait, Yuri.
Larissa, three glasses.
No.
Yuri, you must see how serious this is.
Please don't underestimate me.
Practically or morally,
I'm not the man you take me for.
How do you know all this about Yuri?
How can you help?
I do and I can. Isn’t that sufficient?
No.
Our Eastern Seaboard is an undeveloped area.
The commissariat of foreign affairs wants to establish an independent state there.
It affords us a temporary channel of communication with the outside world.
I have good contacts in the Far East.
I've been appointed the Minister of Justice.
- The Bolsheviks trust you?
- They trust no one.
They found me useful.
Here's how I can help you.
You come with me as far as the Pacific Coast.
From there you can go where you like.
To Paris, or not.
I think you'd better go.
Your rarefied selfishness is intolerable.
Larissa's in danger too.
- By association with me?
- No.
Not by association with you.
You're a small fry.
By association with Strelnikov.
- I never met Strelnikov.
- You're married to him, they know that.
- I was married to Pasha Antipov.
- I understand, I understand.
But they don't.
You're being watched.
Do you know why?
A husband is a sticky commodity, my dear.
Go away.
More of your high-minded lunacy?
You have a child to think of!
Look here.
- That's sugar for the child.
- I don't want it.
You would refuse my sugar?
Who are you to refuse me anything?!
Now you go.
- I came...
- Go!
Go!
I came to you in good faith.
Stay here then, and get your desserts!
Your desserts, do you hear me?
Do you think you're immaculate?
You're not immaculate!
I know you!
Do you hear me?!
We're all made of the same clay, you know!
Clay!
Clay!
Lara?
He's rubbish, Lara.
Yes. Rubbish.
I wish he'd never happened.
Does it matter?
Doesn't it?
Not to me.
What shall we do?
Can we get on a train?
No, they'd arrest us on the spot.
- I don't want to stay here and wait.
- No.
Listen...
...we could go to...
- Varykino.
- They'd find out sooner or later.
- Yes, but later.
- If our days are really numbered, Yuri...
- Yes.
We'd better live them...
...before we are parted.
Yes.
Yo ho! Yo ho!
Father caught a flea! Ho, ho, ho
I love the snow
One, two, three
Anna taught me to write at this desk.
This isn't me, Yuri.
- Yes, it is.
- No.
It's you.
"Lara. "
Yuri!
- Yuri, there's a wolf howling!
- Oh, yes, I've...
I've seen them. They're frightened.
They won't harm us.
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry. It's...
Oh, Lord, this is an awful time to be alive!
- No.
- It is. It is!
No, no.
Wouldn't it have been lovely if we'd met before?
Before we did? Yes.
We'd have got married, had a house and children.
If we'd had children, Yuri, would you have liked a boy or a girl?
I think we may go mad if we think about all that.
I shall always think about it.
- Will you write today?
- No, not today.
Katya!
Come to me, darling.
They're here.
Victor!
We thought it was...
Quite.
I wonder if you'd mind, comrades?
My government has a train, standing in Yuryatin.
There's a carriage for myself and my assistants.
You will travel in comfort and safety.
No question. I'm not going with you.
I'm not going without you.
So there's an end to it.
Then I'll have to speak to Yuri Andreyevich in private.
Strelnikov is dead.
- What?
- Spare me your expressions of regret.
He was a murderous neurotic, and no loss to anyone.
Do you see how this affects Larissa?
You don't?
You're a fool.
She's Strelnikov's wife.
Why do you think they haven't arrested her?
Why do you think they had her watched?
They were waiting for Strelnikov.
If they thought he'd come running to his wife, they didn't know him.
They knew him well enough.
They caught him five miles from here.
He was arrested on the open road.
He didn't conceal his identity.
Throughout the entire interview...
...he insisted they call him
Pavel Antipov...
...and refused to answer to "Strelnikov. "
On his way to execution, he took a pistol and blew his own brains out.
Oh, my God!
Don't tell Lara this.
I think I know Lara at least as well as you.
But don't you see her position?
She's served her purpose.
These men who came to escort me today will come tomorrow as a firing squad.
Now I know exactly what you think of me, and why.
But if you're not coming with me, she's not coming.
So are you coming with me?
Do you accept the protection of this ignoble Caliban on any terms he makes?
Or is your delicacy so exorbitant...
...that you'd sacrifice a woman and a child to it?
There's some bags to carry, comrades.
Get in.
Come.
How many?
All of us.
Sorry, not enough room.
There's got to be room.
It's all right. I'll bring our sledge.
Hurry.
This train has important people on it.
You start. I'll catch you up.
Right, comrades!
We'll see you at...
Hurry!
I'm afraid that's it.
Your young man's not coming.
You fool.
Did you really think he would come with you?
The man's an idiot.
- From Mongolia he could've gone to China...
- He'll never leave Russia.
Let him stay.
You've come with me, haven't you?
Yes.
To be sure, it was your duty as a mother.
That's right, Victor.
I'm carrying Yuri's child.
I was born out there.
In the Far East somewhere.
I think it was Mongolia.
I don't remember.
You were born in Mongolia, that very year.
So were a lot of other children.
Not many called Tonya, bearing the name Komarov.
Komarov's a common name.
So is Tonya.
With fair hair, blue eyes, lost at age 8 when civil war broke out in the Far East?
There's something you haven't told me.
How did you come to be lost?
- I can't remember!
- You must remember something!
No!
I'll tell you how I first met your mother.
- If she was my mother, Comrade General.
- You judge.
I picked my brother up, literally, on a Moscow street.
He had a fourth-class ration book and he was undernourished.
He didn't seem to mind that or anything.
I thought he was a happier man than me.
He suffered me to buy him a new suit...
...and to get him a job at his old hospital.
I saw him off for his first day's work.
This was eight years after he and Lara parted.
So he never saw her again?
Thank you. You've been very kind to me.
He must've known how ill he was.
The walls of his heart were like paper.
But he kept it to himself.
He kept a lot to himself.
Please.
I was astonished at the extent of his reputation.
His work was unobtainable at the time.
It was disapproved of by the Party.
But if people love poetry, they love poets.
And nobody loves poetry like a Russian.
Excuse me, comrade.
Are you Yevgraf?
My name is Lara.
I knew her name from the Lara poems which I'd found among Yuri's manuscripts.
I knew your brother.
I need your help.
She'd come to Moscow to look for her child.
I helped her as far as I could.
But I knew it was hopeless.
I think I was a little in love with her.
One day she went away and didn't come back.
She died or vanished somewhere...
...in one of the labor camps.
A nameless number on a list that was afterwards mislaid.
That was quite common in those days.
Tonya.
How did you come to be lost?
- We were running in a street.
- We?
- My father.
- Not your father. Komarovsky.
I don't know!
The street was on fire.
There were explosions and houses were falling down.
He let go of my hand!
He let go of my hand.
And I was lost.
Would your father have done that?
Oh, yes. People will do anything.
It was Komarovsky.
This man was your father.
Why won't you believe it?
Don't you want to believe it?
Not if it isn't true.
That's inherited.
Comrade General, when I was a child,
I wanted parents.
You can imagine how I wanted parents.
I wanted to die when I was a child.
You know?
Now I don't know.
I can't be of any use to them now, can I?
I was hoping I might be of some use to you.
- Will you think about it?
- Yes.
It's all right, David.
You work here?
Yes, I'm an operator.
- And what do you operate?
- That.
You've promised to think about it.
Tonya!
Can you play the balalaika?
Can she play? She's an artist!
An artist? Who taught you?
No one taught her.
Then it's a gift.
- White wash.
- White wash!
White wash! One pace forward, march!
Left turn!
What did you clean your kit with, lad?
White wash, Staff.
The Commandant knows you used white wash. The RSM knows. I know.
But you don't have to be a dozy and own up to it.
Double march! Take over, Staff!
Left wheel!
Left, left, left, right, left. Left.
White wash, Roberts. You're too clever,
Roberts, that's your trouble.
Stevens' kit was dirty, Mac.
He was bound to get some stick anyway.
He's still too clever, Jacko.
Too damn clever by half.
When it dries out, look as good as new, lad. Better.
Broken the King's heart if the RSM phoned him and told him you'd been defacing his walls.
Would it, Staff?
Son, you shouldn't be in here, you know.
You shouldn't even be in the army.
- We'd a queer in here a few weeks back
- I'm not queer!
I know you're not.
Why don't you listen, eh?
That nanny had a way with her.
She sang and she laughed all day.
Put her over the hill and she went into a dance routine.
Better than those belly dancers in the cabarets, isn't it?
She wasn't any stronger than you, but she knew how to survive, and that's what you've got to learn in this army.
You've got to learn how to, you know...
How to survive, eh?
Seem to have smartened up the prisoners from Cell 8, Staff.
Thank you, sir.
And what about Stevens, eh?
Yes, sir. I missed that, sir.
Didn't think Stevens would try it on, sir.
He wouldn't. Somebody put him up to it.
I'll take them all out, sir, and we'll find the right man.
Oh, Christ!
You've knocked the rocks over, haven't you, lad? Pick them up again.
Very pretty, Roberts. Very pretty.
Roberts.
Cut it off! Cut it off!
King, double.
Right, King, you're on a charge.
I said double!
All right, Bartlett, up you go, lad.
Oh, yeah.
- I don't think I'll be able to do this, Staff.
- Of course you will, lad. Come along.
Well, you'll have to excuse me if I can't.
- No. No. No.
- Get up it, Bartlett.
Come on, Bartlett, let's have you get up it.
You see, Staff,
I'm kinda not built for this sort of...
- Get up it, Bartlett!
...thing, Staff.
- Bartlett, get up it!
- I can't, Staff.
- Get up it, Bartlett!
- I'm fat!
I'm fat.
- Get up it!
- You all know, don't you?
Halt! Still! Left turn!
Stevens, you're a dead bloody loss.
Put it on.
Hurry it up!
Double march!
I only wanted to go home.
I can't stand any more.
I can't take any more.
- God help me.
- Will you shut up?
Lay off.
Well, if he goes on like that, we'll have the padre in next, thinking he's got a new customer.
He can't take that hill.
- Stevens.
- No...
- Stevens.
- I don't want to do any more.
I just want... I just want to lay down.
Listen, Roberts, if he goes...
If he's sick, he goes on sick parade.
Or you get a screw's permission to bed him down.
- Yeah, you're not dropping us in it again.
- That's right, Joe.
Staff! Staff, we've got a sick man in here.
All right! That's enough.
Williams has had him on the hill, now you get the vet.
Staff.
I want out from these lunatics, Staff.
Bed the lad down, Roberts.
You want something, Staff?
Yes. I'd like a word with you.
- This is my cell. I'm responsible here.
- I'm not, thank God.
- Then leave it to me.
- You've got a sick man in here.
- I can deal with it.
- I've given instructions to bed him down.
If you don't get out sharp, Staff,
I'll put you on report and let the RSM decide what's right or not.
So I can organize something, a visit from the M.O.
We'll see what he's got to say.
McGrath, what's wrong with him?
I'm not a vet, Staff.
Right, get your towels.
You've all had a busy time, so I'm putting you under the showers to sweeten you up and smarten you up.
We're taking Stevens with us.
Yes, Staff.
Thank you very much indeed, Staff.
Well get him on his feet.
Get him up, Bartlett!
Yes, Staff.
Come on, Staff wants you up.
- No, no, please.
- Staff wants you upsy-daisy.
- On your feet!
- He's in no fit state to walk.
So he's in a terrible way, is he?
We'll soon see.
Double over here, Stevens.
Please, Joe, make him leave me alone.
Please help me.
- I can't take any more. I can't.
- It's all right.
Okay, Stevens.
Very touching.
I'll get the preacher into you two and get you married.
Right, double outside. Outside!
Drag that fairy out.
If I'd known you were on your honeymoon,
I'd have had you in a separate cell.
I don't hold with one of my staff complaining about a brother officer.
Listen, Bert, if Williams cripples Stevens, you'll take the can back, not Williams.
You telling me again how to run this place?
If I have any more complaints out of you,
I'll have you posted.
Sir, I suggest you let the M.O. Decide whether or not
Stevens is fit for punishment.
I make the decisions, me.
I'll see if he's fit or not. Now, get out!
Come on, Stevens, come on.
Come on, there.
All right, McGrath.
- Not that one.
- What?
That turns on the gas.
Quiet!
What's this I hear about Stevens,
Mr. Wilson?
Nothing to worry about, sir.
- Well, Staff Harris told me...
- Harris? He's like a dream walking.
If Stevens was sick he'd be here, wouldn't he now?
Oh, yes, I suppose so.
Well, since I'm here, I'd better see him.
I don't know my job, sir?
Think I don't know what's going on?
I never said that.
- I know what Staff Williams is doing.
- Staff Harris told me...
Harris!
He's sand-happy.
I'm still in charge here, sir.
I want to see Stevens.
You've seen him, sir.
What do you mean?
You passed him fit, fit for duty and punishment.
The hill, Sergeant Major, if one of the staff overdoes the good work...
I could take it, sir.
Any fit man could take it, sir.
Yes, well, as you say, if he were sick he'd be here, wouldn't he? Yes.
God, it's hot. It's like an oven in here.
- Lights out five minutes!
- Still no sign of the M.O., eh?
- Lights out five minutes!
- No.
Lights out five minutes!
- He looks better.
- Yeah.
- Five minutes.
- Maybe Harris will get the vet tomorrow.
It's a laugh.
- Lights out five minutes.
- What is?
All we ever get in this dump is medicine and duties.
One lunatic, you know, in Tunisia...
That was a right nick, that was.
He made his blankets up into a kind of nest, you see, and he sat there all night in the middle of them going,
"Cuckoo, cuckoo," all night long.
- He was trying to work his ticket.
- No. He was around the bend.
He'd been frightened by a hand grenade,
I think.
Anyway, the screw got the vet in, you see, and you know what the vet recommended?
- Medicine and duty.
- Medicine and duty.
Anyway, the vet had a bright idea, you see. He sort of fancied himself a bit of a trick cyclist, and he put this dummy hand grenade into the nest with the cuckoo.
- And you know what the cuckoo done?
- Aye, he tried to hatch it out.
You've heard it.
Anyway, you got to laugh, you know, because some of these screws are comics.
I mean, take Williams.
There's Stevens there on his chinstraps, all Williams can think of doing is giving him the old, "Attention! About turn!
"Double march!"
- He's off.
- About turn!
I wonder if he could hatch out a packet of Player's for Monty Bartlett.
Here, Stevens, that's it. You stick at it, kiddo. You're a cert for your ticket you are.
Left, right, left, right.
Keep 'em up, boy. Keep 'em up.
About turn more.
About turn. About turn.
Left turn, left turn, right turn.
Double it up. That's it, boy. Double it up.
Come on, boy.
He's dead.
The M.O.'ll have to write out a death certificate, won't he?
- What will he diagnose, carelessness?
- What's that?
Careless of Stevens to drop dead.
It's a bit late for your jokes, Charlie.
- Word got around yet?
- It will, Bert.
Might be some trouble.
We'd all better be on our toes.
- I'd like to make a suggestion.
- Yes?
Move Williams out of the block.
Put him on the gate where he can't do so much damage.
But that would be as good as admitting
I think Williams killed the lad.
Bert, I'd sooner have Williams doubling in here than anybody.
Listen, I ordered Williams to smarten up the prisoners in Cell 8.
- Yes, we all accept that...
- lf Stevens was fit, he'd still be here, wouldn't he?
The army judged him A-1.
The M.O. Passed him fit for punishment.
It looks like Stevens was only fit to drop.
That's not your worry, it's the M.O.'s.
Thank you, Bert.
You said you backed your staff.
We ain't celebrating a glorious victory, Williams.
We're patching up a bloody disaster.
You realize I'll have to make a full report?
We all will, sir.
Well, he was perfectly fit when I examined him.
- When you did what, sir?
- Oh, when I made...
When I examined him.
You only looked at his watch and chain.
Now look here, Sergeant Major...
You passed him fit.
So I handed him over to Staff Williams.
He was...
Well, he was kept out in the sun too long.
I've checked on his records.
Base job in an office.
Well, anybody could see that.
Suddenly, he's drilling for hour after hour in the blazing sunshine.
It was fatal in his case.
- Sounds like accidental death, sir.
- Yes.
The man was A-1, but to come from a base job to this place...
Well, you understand these things better than me, sir. Accidental death.
- That's what I thought, sir.
- Well, I hope so.
I've dented a few, sir, but I've never murdered any.
- I wasn't referring to you.
- That goes for my staff, too, sir.
Goodnight, sir.
Accidental death.
But if there's another accidental death, and you're in any way connected with it, Staff...
Waiting to find out what Williams is gonna pull next is like waiting to go into action.
You know the feeling?
I'm the fellow who refused to go in, remember me?
You beat up your officer because he ordered the boys in?
Yeah, that's right, because he ordered the boys in.
Was he going in hisself?
No, I took them in.
Right away we lost half our tanks.
So I pulled the boys out.
I put the major in the picture.
I told him the situation was hopeless.
If the mines didn't get us,
Jerry's anti-tank guns would.
What'd the major say?
"Get back in." He was very calm about it.
He said that he had his orders.
The next thing I knew, the boys were pulling me off him.
Man, there's too many people in this army giving the wrong orders.
Somebody got to have the guts to cancel some of them damn wrong orders.
We'd have no bloody army left if we didn't obey orders.
Joe.
You feel pretty bad about this, huh?
Look, it's not just disobeying orders.
It's rules, regulations, me.
But, man, you saved all them boys from getting killed for nothing.
The troop sergeant took them in.
I was put under close arrest.
None of them came back.
Bloody cockroaches.
As if we haven't got enough to suffer without you two talking half the night.
Can't you let a man sleep?
You ain't been sleeping much yourself, Joe.
- No.
- Another stinking hot day.
- You can practically hear it boiling already.
- Look at Monty, flat out!
Wake up!
- Who done that?
- I did.
You want to watch it, mate.
You just want to watch it.
Somebody ought to write to their MP about this dump.
- Yeah? Why don't you?
- What, him? I bet he can't even write.
What's so clever about being able to write, then?
The secret in this old world, mate, is to use your loaf. Maybe I can't read.
When it comes to knocking off stuff,
I'm away out in front on me own.
I'll bet you are.
You're a fair sample of the no-talent class.
Thieving three bottles of whisky, blimey.
I didn't thieve them, man, I drank them.
Bet he can't write, neither.
Monty, just because I'm black, do I have to be damn ignorant, too?
You blacks ain't got the brains of us whites.
- Listen to that man.
- You've got it downstairs, mate, but we've got it upstairs.
Live up trees, you blokes do.
I seen a film about his tribe once.
It's called Tarzan and the Ape Men.
When Charlie Bloggs found you lot, you was walking around starkers, living on monkey nuts.
So this is a member of the great white race, and there's plenty like Monty.
We just call them white trash.
Now, look, I don't go for that expression, white trash.
What's Staff Williams?
Belt up!
We don't want to hear about Williams.
That I can believe.
I'm making a report about Williams.
Now, listen, Roberts, we're all aware of what happened, but there's nothing we can do about it.
- Yeah.
- So.
- It's a pity about old Stevens...
- We're all in sympathy?
You had a rough deal.
So I can count on you when we go to see the Commandant?
- To enquire after his health, or what?
- But of course.
Then we'll slap a murder charge against Williams.
Wakey wakey! Rise and shine!
Let's have you.
Who killed Stevens?
Do you hear that?
Now, are you going to sit on your jacksies and do nothing?
Take over, Staff!
- Staff! What the hell's going on here?
- Sir, the prisoners.
Sounds like victory celebrations. Get every available staff here at the double.
Armed, sir?
Where the hell do you think you are,
Chicago?
Staffs! Let them out!
I said let them out!
- Stevens, Stevens.
- Stevens, Stevens.
What's your name? Oliver Twist?
Put that mess tin down.
It's too early for breakfast.
What's your name?
- Stevens!
- Staff Burton!
We've had a miracle.
Here's a man returned from the dead.
Take him back to the mortuary.
- Mortuary, sir?
- In the mortuary, via the hill.
Give him a last good run before we bury him.
Double him away!
Left, right, left, right, left...
- Staff!
- Sir.
Double away and get me a copy of the KRs.
Sir.
- Johnson!
- Sir.
- Did you start the mutiny?
- I didn't start anything.
Then what was all the noise in aid of?
Exercising your lungs?
Who killed Stevens?
- Staff.
- Sir!
Double this man out to the mortuary.
Show him the body. If he finds any marks, abrasions or bullet wounds on the body, take him over to the Commandant's office and stay with him while he writes out his statement.
Then let him see the Commandant on his own so he can speak freely.
- Yes, sir.
- Double out.
Double out!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.
Left wheel.
Now, you've all been making a hell of a racket.
There'll be no more of it, or I'll have the lot of you over the hill.
Every damn one of you.
Now, if you've any complaints, you're free to see the Commandant.
Any more trouble and I'll read you the Riot Act.
You know how long it takes.
And if that doesn't have any effect,
I'll charge the ring leaders with mutiny.
- Who's the ring leaders?
- Every fifth man!
Think that over.
I don't waste my breath on idle threats.
Now, let's have you looking like soldiers.
Prisoners, attention!
Stand at ease! Let's have that again.
Attention! Better.
Now, any man here got any complaints?
Anybody want to see the Commandant?
Anybody witnessed any murders recently?
Scared to open your traps or what?
Anybody wishing to see the Commandant, step forward.
Why do you want to see him?
I wish to report, sir, Staff Williams responsible for Stevens' death.
Witnesses?
All the men in my cell know what happened, sir.
Bartlett, double over here.
You saw Staff Williams murder
Private Stevens. Is that right?
No, sir.
I never saw nothing of the kind, sir.
Don't lie to me, lad.
You saw him with blood-stained hands, didn't you now?
No, sir. Never saw nothing, sir.
Request to be moved to another cell.
Request refused. Get back in the line.
McGrath, double over here.
Is it right you saw murder committed,
McGrath?
No, sir, but I'll be committing one if Roberts doesn't stop squawking.
Double back.
King, double over here.
Now let's hear from you, King.
Staff Williams murdered Stevens all right.
My only worry's how we're gonna prove it.
Double away, King.
- Staff Williams!
- Yes, sir.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, sir.
Serious allegation that is.
He's lying, sir.
I never laid a finger on Stevens.
- Staff Harris!
- Sir.
I want Roberts and King on
Commandant's parade, 0930 hours.
- Yes, sir.
- And notify the medical officer he's wanted at the Commandant's Office
0930 hours.
Seems Stevens didn't die of sunstroke.
He was murdered in cold blood.
- Is that right, sir?
- Tell him be sure to be there.
His professional reputation's at stake.
Our M.O., sir? I won't wear that.
It's well known he can make the lame walk, the blind see and the maimed dance over the hill.
What else can he do, Staff?
Ride a bicycle on the sea, no hands, and turn water into wine, sir.
But can he raise the dead, Staff?
No, sir. He can't raise them, but he can lower them.
Yes, I got your vocation placed now!
You should have been a music hall comic!
Yes, sir.
Permission to organize a smoking concert for the prisoners?
You've organized too bloody many all ready, Charlie!
Think I don't know?
Got a light, sir?
No, but I've got a pack to put on your back if I catch you smoking.
Bartlett and McGrath, stand by for a call.
You may be needed.
Now, you'll all be having cheese with your lunch today.
Now, get back into your cells, and look sharp about it.
You've all had a lovely time.
Staffs, take over.
- Trying to get at me, eh, Charlie?
- Who me?
As from now, you'll take your orders from Williams.
So that's the way it is.
I know you won't mind.
You're always bragging you don't seek promotion or favors.
I'd sooner be out of it, sir, well out of it.
You're getting passed over, Staff.
Inside, King.
- Think you can get away with this?
- I should be asking you that.
Thank you, Staff.
You know what the outcome will be?
There'll be a Court of Enquiry, and I'll be exonerated.
No, you're getting nervous, Williams.
You want me, don't you?
You fancy your chances?
You make a move and I'll drop you.
Not a bad idea. Just us two.
There's a solitary at the end.
Nobody can see into that.
I'll lock us inside, Roberts. Just us two.
- You're on.
- March over.
Me first.
Inside.
Hang up.
Go back to your duties, come on.
Double away!
I want no more trouble.
No more out of you.
You'll learn discipline.
Learn we mean business.
You'd better do some quick thinking, Roberts...
Staff.
I want to transfer out of here.
You're going out, Bartlett, you little runt.
Out over the hill.
Now, get your packs on, all of you.
Come on, and get Roberts up.
He's coming with us.
I'll be back for you.
You've got five minutes!
Joe's on Commandant's Orders.
How's Williams going to explain this?
You think the Commandant's never set eyes on a prisoner who's been done over before?
I've got something to say about this,
- and I'll make damn sure he listens.
- If not, I'm getting word outside.
You two are enough to drive a fellow up the wall.
Somebody's gonna find out what's going on in here, what's happening.
We're inside, Sergeant Major, inside, and the bloody world outside doesn't give a damn.
We're the horrible 2%, the dodgy boys, the spivs, the cowards, the thieves.
We're the weak chain in the system.
Oh, to hell with you.
Into your kit, Roberts.
No.
Not for you, Williams.
Right. Two volunteers to drag Roberts over the hill. You, Bartlett, you, McGrath.
Yes, Staff.
McGrath?
To hell with this.
I'm giving you an order, McGrath.
Listen, Williams, the army didn't buy me in a slave market.
I'll double over the hill for you, but I'll not drag another man with me.
All right, I'll get all the volunteers I want, and I'll have the lot of you out.
He's barmy. I've got to get out of this lot.
Shut up!
Well, what's the matter with you then?
Joe, tell them, go on.
I'll obey any order.
I'm not looking for no trouble.
Git!
Staff!
- Staff, I've got to get out of here.
- All right, cut it out!
- Staff, they're crucifying me.
- Move him, Staff.
Get your small kit and report to the M.O.
No, I'm on Commandant's orders.
I'm not missing that.
Let me see this.
King, McGrath, carry him over to the M.O.
I'll see you see the Commandant, don't worry. Come on, sharp, come here.
Easy with him, now. Easy.
All right, watch that going through the door.
Hold your head low.
Put me in another cell, Staff.
I've had a bellyful of this lot.
Buckle it up.
Well, I'm only looking after number one, ain't I?
What's the matter with everybody in this bloody place?
They're not here, Staff.
They've gone.
Staff Harris has taken them over to the M.O.
Back to your detail. About turn!
Double march!
Left, right, left, right, left, right.
Get him over here.
- What's this, Staff?
- Roberts is reporting sick.
Double outside, you two.
Okay, double out.
On your feet, Roberts.
Jerk him out of it, Staff.
He's got a busted foot.
What the hell are you two doing outside here?
Brought Roberts over, sir. He's poorly.
On your feet.
He's got a foot injury, sir.
On your feet, Roberts, and stand to attention.
March outside.
Left, right, left, right.
Keep marching.
- Double inside, you two.
- Right, double in.
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Halt!
About turn.
Para 528, Section 7.
"An officer will not reprove a warrant officer or an NCO in the presence
"or hearing of a private soldier."
- You know the KRRs, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
You're breaking every rule in the book.
- And you live by it, don't you?
- We're both regulars.
We are the army.
What the hell else are we supposed to do?
Well, I lived by the book.
Para this, and Para under Section X-Y-Z that.
But Queen Victoria's dead. It's out of date.
What kind of a soldier are you?
I'm a live one, unless Williams has got other plans for me.
Discipline. The army's run on discipline.
I'm a regular soldier because
I couldn't get a bloody job in civvy street, but I was a good toy clockwork soldier, just like you are.
You throw an order at me and I could pick it up like a dog picks up a bone.
- On your feet and you listen.
- No, you listen!
Three bloody years in the desert.
Three bloody years fighting under paid gunmen. That's all we are.
- Treason, you're talking treason.
- Right!
Get on your feet.
Okay, treason. That's Para 531, Section 7.
"Any person committing any traitorous
"or mutinous practice may be
"sentenced to penal servitude for the term of his natural life."
- So you...
- Life.
Well, all right.
All I know is that I can't do things that don't make sense to me anymore.
You can. You can still live by the book, but it's out of date!
It's stupid and out of date!
So, you quit, eh?
Glasshouse permanent for the rest of the war?
- Right!
- You'd sign away our bloody empire.
Yes, give it to Jacko, maybe he can use it.
To the niggers!
They couldn't run a knocking shop.
On your feet, stand up and stand still!
Yes, I'm on my feet.
Well, what's the charge?
Failing to obey an order?
Drunk in charge of a cigarette lighter?
You crazy bastard.
You'd prop up dead men and inspect them if you was ordered to.
Right, you're right.
Keep those men on the move!
You used to be an NCO.
You used to be a soldier, but you've forgotten.
Now, I'm gonna teach you.
Teach you from the beginning.
I'll make you into something the army can be proud of.
You'll double, drill, do any damn thing I tell you.
Roberts, you'll be lost, lost, unless somebody's shouting an order at you. Staff!
Sir!
How did Roberts get into this state?
Been fighting with one of the prisoners, sir. McGrath.
- Has he?
- He got stuck into me, as well.
- Did he?
- I took him out of the cell.
Gave him the order to double, he refused and struck me.
We had to restrain him, sir.
- Any witnesses, Staff?
- Henshaw and Colbey, sir.
I hope he didn't beat you up too bad, Staff.
If Henshaw and Colbey hadn't come along, sir...
It's clear Roberts is a dangerous fellow, but if you ever have to restrain him again,
I don't want him looking like a battle casualty, understand?
He come at me and went smack into the wall, sir.
He must have.
There's no other logical explanation.
McGrath did most of the damage.
Yes. Charge him with fighting McGrath,
Colbey and Henshaw and with insubordination.
McGrath didn't beat me up, Williams did.
Witnesses?
Staff! From now on,
I'm looking after his welfare.
Sir, I can manage him.
No, you can't, Staff.
You're a bloody revelation.
But let me tell you, this is your last chance.
Beat up another one of my lads, and I'll have you inside here, and if the prisoners don't cripple you,
I will.
- Now, get the others over here.
- Yes, sir.
Double over, you two!
Come on, move it!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.
Halt! Stand still.
McGrath. You had a fight with Roberts, is that right?
We had a slight difference.
- And you witnessed it.
- They had a scrap.
You made a right job of him, didn't you?
- I'm not responsible for the state he's in.
- Then who is?
Staff Williams, sir.
He took Joe out, and when Joe come back, he was like that.
I'll say I know damn well
McGrath had nothing to do with it.
Stand to attention when I'm talking to you.
Now, nigger boy, tell me again, what did you see?
You black ape, I'm talking to you.
Do you want to do a dose of solitary?
You stinking filthy nigger, answer me.
What did you see?
I'll see you in hell, you...
You ruddy useless Sergeant Major. In hell!
Look at that.
Dancing about like a flea-bitten monkey.
Thinks he's still in the jungle.
I'll teach you you're in the British Army.
I quit your stinking army, you hear that?
You loud-mouthed Sergeant Major.
I give up this damn soldiering.
Now what you gonna do about it?
Throw every charge in the book at him,
Staff.
Sir.
But first of all, see that Harris has him outside the Commandant's office at 0930 hours.
The Commandant can hear his case.
- Yes, sir. You'll be there, sir?
- No, Staff.
I shall be busy making arrangements for Stevens' funeral.
You're gonna let them shoot their mouths off and not be there, sir?
You worried, Staff? Any cause to be?
I haven't.
Let them shout, then I'll have my say.
Go on. Double away, you two.
Left turn, double march!
Move it! Move, move, move!
Left, right, left, right.
Come on, double, double, double!
- You're a clever boy, you are.
- I quit this army.
- Don't be daft.
- Clever boy.
What's the clever thing to do? Go crawling to Williams the way you do, huh?
Now just watch your big mouth.
I'll kill that man if he lifts one finger to me, one finger.
- Yeah, go on. You're all shout.
- And I know how tough you are.
Now watch your step.
You useless article, made in Yorkshire, exported to the Middle East and marked "Fragile!"
Come on. Go on, you're the big man in the cell. Did you hear what he said? Come on.
What the hell is this now?
Break it up, break it up, break it up now.
Come on, come on, break it up.
You're on Commandant's orders.
Get dressed, King, and get outside.
- I've quit the army.
- Get dressed!
I've finished with the army, and this is what I think of British justice.
Stark raving bonkers. Outside, all of you.
King, what the hell's wrong with you?
I've finished with the army, so I don't wear the uniform.
You're going into the Commandant dressed like this, lad?
Unless you've got a top hat and a bone to put through me nose.
That's the way you white folks think that we dress back home.
This ought to be one day he remembers.
Come on, then. All right, double.
Come on, double! Left, left, left, right, left.
Left, left, left, right, left.
There you are, Roberts.
What's the verdict? Medicine and duty?
You go back to your cell, pick up your kit, and then I'm recommending you for hospital.
I wouldn't do that.
The RSM wouldn't like it.
- I decide what's...
- You decide nothing.
You just do what you're told.
Look here, Roberts,
I'm making a full report about you.
Well, you'd better, because I'm fighting every one of you in this dirty, lousy dump.
Every one of you. Every single one of you.
Left, right, left, left, left, right, left, left, right.
You've had me for a soldier.
Wouldn't get me in the Boy Scouts after that.
Shut up, lad.
- King, attention!
- Mr. Harris.
You may tell Mister Commandant that Mr. Jacko King will see him now.
Quiet down, you dumb lad.
What are you doing, then? Get back, you...
Horace, sit down. Don't stand up for me.
I've jagged in me rank.
I recommend this brand, but I cannot recommend your hotel,
Horace. The service is lousy.
Staff!
Sir, he's round the bend, sir.
I can't do anything with him.
So you don't like the hotel?
Not since one of the guests died, no.
Staff, get this mad man out.
Send the RSM to me.
He's making the funeral arrangements, sir.
- What?
- Stevens died, sir.
- Well, why wasn't I told?
- You weren't here.
Send the RSM to me the minute he gets back.
- Who died?
- George Stevens!
Williams murdered him.
- Get this maniac out. Out!
- Sir!
King, double out, lad! Double! Double!
Double!
Horace.
Williams murdered Stevens.
Don't forget that. He murdered him.
Right, get back to your details.
Party, halt!
Get those prisoners out of here,
Staff Harris.
About turn, double march!
Roberts imagines that he's being persecuted.
Imagines he was beaten up by one of the staff, does he?
Even that.
So he was.
- What did you say?
- So he was.
- You realize I'll have to report that?
- Let's hope you do.
- If it's true.
- You know it's true.
Yes, Harris, but would you tell the Commandant that?
Yes. Yes, I will. I will.
There will have to be an enquiry.
You'll have to give evidence.
Yes, I know, but yours is the only evidence the court will take seriously.
After the RSM's testified that I'm useless as a prison officer, followed by every screw he can muster and Williams and...
Of course I'll need evidence, but this man's here for striking an officer.
They'll have a very strong case, Harris.
Evidence? If you don't move soon, you'll have all the evidence you need.
His coffin.
All right, you two, get your kits.
You're going into solitary.
About turn! Double in!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.
Come on, move it.
The men are not to come in here, Staff.
- Well, my orders, sir, were...
- I'm giving the orders now, and I have a very serious complaint against you, Williams.
From Roberts, sir?
And Staff Harris.
His days are numbered.
I've just had a word with the Commandant and I'll answer any queries as to how I treat prisoners at the Court of Enquiry, sir.
I'll see the other prisoners now.
In fairness, sir, send for the RSM before you...
I will conduct this my own way.
- Have you any complaints?
- Sir.
I want you to fix it for me to get posted out of this cell, sir.
I can't take much more of this shower.
Get me out of here, sir.
You. You, any complaints?
I've falsely confessed to the Commandant that I half beat up Roberts, and that's why I'm going into solitary.
I'm telling you, the army's had me for a soldier if something's not done about this.
Right, get out.
I haven't always seen eye to eye with you, Roberts, but good luck.
McGrath, watch out for yourself.
- Why is this man improperly dressed?
- Refuses to wear King's uniform.
- Stand to attention.
- Oh, no. No, man.
I don't recognize the army or the officers.
- I quit.
- I said stand to attention.
- You're talking to a civilian, Cuthbert.
- Give him to me, sir. I'll teach him.
Joe, you tell me your visiting hours,
I'll come up and see you sometime.
Harris, take this lunatic into the corridor and keep him there till I'm ready for him.
Yes, sir. After you, Mr. King.
- See you later, Joe.
- Okay, Mr. King.
Double out!
Double!
Bartlett, move it!
You can see what we're up against, sir.
If you're easy on them, we won't be able to do a damn thing with them, will we, sir?
What the hell are these men doing idling here in the corridor?
- Orders, sir.
- Whose orders?
M.O.'s.
- What's going on here, sir?
- I'm giving these men a medical.
On sick report, are they, sir? Why?
It's not your place to question me,
Sergeant Major.
Soon as you've passed them fit,
I want them, sir.
I've had some complaints about Williams' treatment of...
Prisoners complaining, we get that sometimes.
King just tried it. Walked in...
Walked in, mind you, on the Commandant half-naked, just in his tribal feathers.
What kind of a bloody fool are you trying to make of me, sir?
The complaint against Williams came from Staff Harris.
Harris.
- What have you told him?
- I told him the truth, sir.
The truth?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's not your fault, sir, it's Williams'.
It's me. Me! Who the hell runs this place?
Retract all you've said, Charlie!
Put your finger onto him, Bert. Get him.
You telling me again how to run this place, are you? Outside, Staff.
Sergeant Major,
Roberts is going into hospital.
Keep him here, sir, in a cell.
Be better if you attend him here, sir.
Sergeant Major!
In 25 years,
I've never known a balls-up like it!
From now on, I'm checking on every man, every prisoner, every staff!
- Staff Harris!
- Sir!
Report on your brother officers, would you?
Try and undermine my authority, eh?
A useless article like you, Harris.
You're under close arrest.
No, don't push me too hard.
You're gonna need
- all the help you can get!
- I'm breaking you!
Now, before you're confined to your quarters, do something useful.
- Get a cell ready for Roberts.
- No.
Help Roberts with his kit.
He's going to hospital.
I'm in charge of discipline here, sir!
Then you look after your department, and I'll look after mine.
Don't try and cancel out my orders.
I have the final word where the men's health is concerned.
Perhaps I was hasty.
- I've had a day of it.
- Yeah, so has Roberts.
He's going into hospital.
It's a pity you didn't put Roberts and Stevens on light duties, sir.
What?
I thought Stevens looked delicate, but that wasn't my worry, was it?
- What are you driving at?
- Were they fit?
Let's start with Stevens, was he fit?
If I understand you right, by God, you're going to be in serious trouble.
- Did you give him a medical?
- He did not. I was there, wasn't I?
Passed him A-1 fit for punishment.
I punished him alongside Roberts,
King, Bartlett and McGrath.
Well, he's dead.
Heat exhaustion, sun stroke and...
Stevens was a sick man and I only caught on when it was too late, I'll swear to it.
Your neglect lumbered me with a dead man.
Now, you put Roberts into hospital and give me the chance to break you.
- Sergeant Major.
- Don't let them get away with it.
Sergeant Major, he's trying blackmail.
You heard him.
I'm putting Roberts in a cell.
Look, I gave an order.
Get Roberts into hospital, sir.
A court martial will break you, sir, not Williams.
Shut your trap, Harris.
The Commandant's got to check on this lot now. I won't be slow in telling him.
It's me who's gonna bust you, Bert.
I'm sorry.
I'll double Harris to his quarters, sir.
That's not the kind of doubling you're gonna do. Get Roberts out.
Me? I'm running this place.
You ain't running this place, Bert.
Williams is, look at him.
He took over days ago, and you still haven't caught on.
I'm reporting everything that's happened here.
It's you I'm after, but I won't worry too much if you go down with him.
I'm phoning for an ambulance.
Roberts is going to hospital.
Then I'm going to see the area commander.
Try and blackmail me, would you,
Williams? Well, try it. Go on, try it.
Have you anything else to say?
Yes, sir. You won't do any better than Stevens on that hill.
What the hell are you doing there?
Get back, do you hear me!
I'm giving you an order!
- Get away from that door!
- Move along, lads.
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
Right, Bartlett, I'm putting you in another cell. Follow me.
I knew I could trust you, Staff.
It was getting very dicey in there, Staff.
Roberts, get your kit.
I'm moving you into a Ionely cell.
Why don't you catch on?
Your days of turning men into toy soldiers are over.
I run this place. Me.
I say what goes and what don't go.
Williams, I told you when you came here
I stand by my staff.
- We've gotta do some quick thinking.
- You won't get me into another bloody mess like this again.
I'm putting you on the gate.
Listen, Harris and the M.O.
Are going on report...
You're a bit too hot even for me!
You don't seem to understand we stand together!
You work alongside me, and I'll show you how it's done.
You don't belt them in this game, you break them, gently break them, then you build them up again into men, into soldiers!
Listen. We throw it all onto Harris and the...
You listening to me?
People listen to me when I'm talking.
Don't you ever forget that.
Will you shut up a minute?
I'll tell you how!
You pay attention.
I've got enough on my plate without you...
You trying to give me orders?
No one does that!
I run this place. Me.
I say what goes and what don't go.
Even if you go to the Commandant, think he'll listen?
He's saying yes to me before I've even walked through the door.
Now, get this place cleaned up.
It's a pigsty.
Carry on, Staff.
In 25 years, I've never known anybody...
Never, not in 25 years, never.
You're on your own now, Williams.
No, you're still with me, Roberts.
Just you and me this time.
Don't touch him!
Don't muck it up, boys. Don't touch him!
You'll muck it up! Don't touch him.
We've won.
We've won. You'll muck it up.
Double! Double!
Double!
English
January 1942.
The high water Mark of Nazi conquest.
Hitler's armies hammered at the gateway to the near east.
Their Japanese allies poured across Asia an irresistible flood of men and weapons... driving to link up with the Germans to the west, crushing the world between them.
Sweeping into Burma, they captured the vital air base at Myitkyina and cut the Burma road.
Our forces, pitifully weak, retreated along elephant trails, through jungles... across rivers and mountains to the temporary refuge of India.
General Joseph Stilwell said the last word on the campaign.
I claim we got a hell of a beating.
We got run out of Burma and it's humiliating as hell.
I think we ought to find out what caused it, go back and retake the place.
Meeting in Quebec... president Roosevelt and prime minister Churchill gather their strength.
To India, they sent our men.
Irish, English, Scot and welsh,
Australian, New Zealander, Gurkha, Sikh.
And from the United
States came 3,000 volunteers.
Seasoned jungle fighters, veterans of
Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Bougainville.
Men who responded to a call for one dangerous and hazardous operation somewhere.
Organized as the 5307th
Composite Unit Provisional... and placed under the command of brigadier general Frank D. Merrill.
They became a part of the forces which sought to regain Burma.
On January 4, 1944, the invasion was launched.
Merrill's mission, to sneak behind enemy lines... surprise and destroy the main Japanese supply base in north Burma, Walawbum.
Moving in three columns, spearheaded by an advance platoon, its point... they succeeded in making their way undetected through 200 miles of Japanese territory.
After three months in the cruelest jungle on earth, the point was close to its goal.
Bend in the trail, we better see what's around the other end.
Come on Wheeler.
A few miles to the rear, the main body... reached the last physical barrier to Walawbum, the Tanja Ga river.
Private Driscoll, take cover.
- You think that Japanese plane saw us?
- Let's pray to god he didn't.
Sneaking 3,000 men through this damn jungle is going to drive me nuts.
Come on, let's go.
- Private Driscoll.
- Yes sir? Yes sir?
What happened with you out there?
Don't know that plane could've spotted you?
I don't know what's eating me general, going through this jungle is driving me nuts.
Get moving.
I got 3,000 nervous wrecks on my hands Doc.
90 days and 90 nights bellying behind Japanese lines... afraid to talk, afraid to breathe, what do you expect?
Left guard, this is
Quarterback. Come in Left guard.
Left guard to Quarterback.
Come in Quarterback.
You think that plane spotted any of your men?
- No sir, we've good cover here from the air.
- Well, what's your situation?
Scouts report 300 enemy in village of Tanja Ga.
Tell your patrols to steer clear of them and stay out of sight.
Yes sir.
Right guard, this
Quarterback, come in Right guard.
Right guard to
Quarterback, come in quarterback.
Left guard is crossing the river now.
When you reach it, move fast.
That plane is liable to come back any minute.
What's your picture?
Patrols report small enemy force moving west along river bank.
Don't touch them, hold where you are until they pass.
- Yes sir.
- Advise point that we're moving out again.
Another bend in the road, wonder what's around this one.
Stock from Quarterback.
Stock from Quarterback.
Come in, Stock.
Quarterback to Stock, knock out that gun.
Quarterback to Stock, knock out that gun.
See that officer?
- Yeah.
- He's all yours.
Bullseye gets that officer.
- You move in with smoke and frag.
- Right.
Bullseye.
Stay away from my ammo.
- Doskis?
- Yeah?
- Any of those Japanese get away?
- No sir.
- Muley.
- Yes sir?
- Where you've been?
- Watching out for Eleanor.
She could've got hurt.
- O'Brien make it all right?
- No, not with that leg.
- Stock, you wouldn't leave me here?
- You know we don't leave anybody O'Brien.
I'll radio the column and have them pick you up.
- Muley.
- Yeah Stock.
- Stick with him.
- Yes sir.
Alright, let's go.
I got some extra smokes stashed away in Eleanor's pack, I'll dig them up for you.
- We knocked out two guns sir.
- What took you so long?
I want news, have Taggy tap into that line leading to those guns?
- That line is been hit.
- Well, find another one.
- Yes sir.
- Right.
Barney, have my battalion commanders come up here right away.
- Hey Taggy.
- Yeah?
You know enough Japanese to run interference for me in a geisha house?
- What geisha house?
- In Tokyo when we get there.
I'll teach you what I picked up on
Bataan, from there on you're on your own.
Hey, there's a wire.
I better start climbing and pick up some gossip for the general.
Hey Bullseye, what's eating you?
Ah, come on, something is, what's eating you?
Chowhound, I'll tell you about one last time.
You stay away from my chow, you hear me?
- Sir.
- General.
Well, now they know we're here.
In a way, it's a relief.
I can let my breath out.
I'd suggest you hold it until we take Walawbum.
You think we ought to notify the British we're not such a hot secret anymore?
It might change their plans to link up with us there.
I'd hate to be in the middle of Burma all by ourselves.
Whether the British get there or not we got to knock out Walawbum.
That's the job we volunteered for.
Now Chuck, your responsibility is going to be the underground ammo dump.
Yes sir.
Sammy, your responsibility is the communications center.
Sir, lieutenant Stockton.
Go ahead Stock.
Taggy intercepted one of their messages sir.
Here's his translation.
Americans in our rear. Where? How many?
What's their strength? Identify their units.
Meet me at .33.
Right.
Gentlemen... it's a Japanese battalion on its way to Walawbum.
We got to beat them there.
20 mile march, you have your men drop their packs.
Yes sir.
- Hello Stock.
- Hello general.
How's the voice on the radio holding out?
It's getting a little hoarse sir.
- You lost a little weight, haven't you?
- Looking skinny yourself sir.
Well, I'm fatter than the last time we were here.
Yeah, it's a lot better than when they ran us out of this... rat-trap two years ago, it's still rough.
How you like running your own platoon?
You didn't tell me when you gave me command I'd be getting gray hairs also.
Hello Stock.
Hello Doctor.
You pick up private O'Brien sir?
He going to lose his leg?
Not if we can fly him back to India.
Hello boys.
We flying back as soon as we take Walawbum.
You know if... if someone could get in behind them at Walawbum and create a diversion.
That did help an awful lot.
- Why don't I get going?
- Yeah, why don't you?
- Doctor, general look Ok to you sir?
- Nobody looks Ok to me.
Keep an eye on him, will you sir?
That's an unusual relationship between a general and a second lieutenant.
Started a long time ago when Merrill was a major and Stock was a sergeant.
Someday that boy is going to be a general, he can lick one problem.
Stock.
- Stock.
- What?
Yeah?
You know, when Merrill put those bars on you, he made you the big wheel in this platoon.
So?
So don't be sticking your neck out for us by taking the point.
Let one of those other knot-heads do it.
You right.
Bullseye.
- Yo.
- Take the point.
Lucky boy.
Shut up.
Chowhound, keep him company.
Stock...
This way buddy.
You want me to stay behind.
Squeeze that joker off while you start the fireworks?
I got your work cut out at the ammo dump.
Kolowicz...
Put a man here to take care of that OP when we blow up the rear.
Taggy, grenade that ammo truck.
Bullseye, you get that
OP, we attack in 33 seconds.
Right guard sir.
- Have you lost your watch?
- No sir.
Then why haven't you told me you're ready? You are ready, aren't you?
- Just about sir.
- Just about isn't good enough, get cracking.
Yes sir.
Left guard sir.
- All set?
- Getting my heavy stuff into position sir.
What's holding you up?
If we don't kick this off on time we've lost the element of surprise.
Ok.
Here, use mine.
Stock is blown the ammo dump.
- Ok, you're on your own.
- We're moving in Frank.
Alright, hit them hard,
Put your weapon away Stock, you won't find any Japanese around here.
We've licked them sir.
You sure?
Well, you better get out of here sir.
- Nervous Stock?
- Me?
Hell no, let's go.
You know...
I like that boy, he's relaxing.
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- You stay away from my girl.
I recommend this guy for a section 8.
Kolowicz, when we going home?
I don't know, the general ain't check with me yet.
- Oh, come on, level with us, when we going?
- When we get replaced by the British.
- What's holding them up?
- The enemy, you meat-head.
- Hey, Kolowicz.
- Yeah?
- When we going home?
- Oh, is that all you guys ever think about?
I've been thinking about it ever since Guadalcanal.
Sarge, will you make him stop eating that slop?
Turning my stomach.
A little rice with some chocolate bars chopped in, what's wrong with that?
Hey Eleanor, want some chow?
Taggy, how many times
I've to tell you? Tuck in the shirt.
- Why does my shirt always bother you sarge?
- You look sloppy.
- Nobody said I was sloppy in Bataan.
- But you ain't in Bataan.
Nobody said I was sloppy when I escaped the Philippines.
You ain't in the Philippines.
Nobody said I was sloppy in that open boat to Australia.
You ain't in an open boat either.
Well, nobody minded how sloppy I looked... when I enlisted in the American army to keep on fighting, I'm a Filipino.
And I'll wear my shirt out until all tyrants are dead, death to the tyrants.
- You got O'Brien's?
- Yeah.
- Addresses?
- In here.
This letter is to his father.
I was with him once on furlough, they were pretty close.
I can't write letters.
This one took me two hours.
The general, he's a great letter writer.
Wrote one for me once, the time I was wounded.
He didn't have a home address for me, so he asked me for one.
I didn't have one so I wasn't about to tell him that,
So I made up one.
He gave me the letter to read.
Was all about me and stuff like that.
I couldn't let a letter like that just go anyplace... so I told him the truth, I told him I didn't have anybody for him to write to.
You can't guess what he did Kolly.
He mailed that letter home to his wife along with a picture of me.
You know what he said? He said sergeant... any time anybody wants to write home about you, you give them my address.
I got to write these letters.
- Stock, sergeant.
- General.
Any sign of anything coming around that bend?
No sir.
Alert your men that general Stilwell is expected. If he shows up, let me know.
Yes sir.
How many?
Eight.
When are those ambulance planes getting here to pick up our wounded?
Plane was shot down by zeros from Myitkyina.
Stock, what did he say? When we going home?
You mean lieutenant.
From now on around here, he's the lieutenant.
You remember that, now get back to your gun.
Oh boy.
Why you pulling rank for me Kolowicz?
You know I don't mind being called
Stock, I like being close to my men.
You too close to them.
- What's wrong with that?
- You got to be able to write those letters.
- When we going home?
- We're never going home.
Merrill got kicked out of Burma, didn't he?
And I got it right from a guy in the 1st battalion.
The general won't be happy till every Japanese is bounced out of Burma.
Come off it.
Merrill wants to get out of this place as bad as we do.
Somebody is coming.
Eleanor, you just keep calm.
You ain't got a thing to worry about because you old Muley is going to take care of you.
Here they come boys, the British are here. We've been relieved.
See? Just like I told you.
Just like I told you the other day, the British are here, come on.
The British are here.
Muley, Taggy, come look at this.
I told you Doskis.
Boy, we glad to see you guys.
- Hey, what's your outfit?
- Queen's Crown Royal West Kent regiment.
- Hey, that's a fancy name.
- How about that?
What is your outfit?
- The 5307th composite unit.
- Provisional.
Oh, Quartermaster corps.
Quartermaster? Do we look like supply clerks to you?
We're the United States infantry and death to the redcoats.
- Where you guys headed?
- Myitkyina.
Myitkyina?
- Those poor guys.
- 500 mile hike from here.
Yeah and the 18th Japanese imperial division is there.
Man, am I glad I'm not in that British army.
Amen.
General Stilwell, gentlemen.
Hal, Bannister.
- How are you Frank?
- Fine sir.
Well, you'd say that anyway.
I'll come right to the point Frank.
You got to take Myitkyina.
I thought that was a British mission.
It still is, but Myitkyina is going to need all of us.
- Oh, my men have earned a breather general.
- After Myitkyina.
Sir, we've taken a beating.
My people have got malaria, dengue, dysentery, psychological fatigue.
Being behind enemy lines for three months is sapped them.
You've got to beat the monsoon
Frank, that means moving right away.
We're not the only outfit in Burma.
You're the only American infantry between New Guinea and Italy.
The British have been fighting here alone three years now, we got to pull our weight.
I suggest you grab their rail-head first at this spot here, Shaduzup.
That'll knock out their transportation.
Then cross the mountains to Myitkyina.
Sir, what the general is describing is a 6 months... campaign over the worst terrain in the world.
My men have just come
125 miles through all sorts of hell.
To ask them to go another 500 and then fight a pitched battle when they get... there is not only unfair, it's, it's impossible.
- And it's your job to do the impossible.
- Not without replacements.
Replacements? Every theater commander is crying for replacements.
Eisenhower is got first priority in Europe.
Then come MacArthur and Nimitz, I'm low man on the totem pole. Frank, you're all I got.
May I remind the general, every one of my men is a 2 year combat veteran.
They gave up earned furloughs so they could volunteer for one mission, Walawbum.
They had one job to do and they did it.
Their job is to keep the Japanese out of India.
Keep them from linking up with the Germans.
That's my big nightmare Frank... one million Japanese joining forces with the German army.
Myitkyina is the linchpin to Burma and Burma is the road to India.
It's going to be tough
Frank, but it's got to be done.
Oh, by the way, the newspaper boys have made up a name for your men.
They're called the marauders.
Come on Eleanor.
Come on Eleanor, come on.
Come on Eleanor.
Lieutenant, lieutenant, general Merrill wants to see you sir.
You're going to get the word now Stock, lieutenant.
Hey, maybe they'll give us a private plane.
Who cares what kind of plane as long as it's Bombay.
Maybe they'll give us a big parade up Dewey boulevard in Manila, eh?
San Francisco, here I come.
- You sent for me sir?
- Stock, what shape are your men in?
- They're rich, our mule just won the race.
- And you?
- I didn't bet.
- You know what I mean.
Well, I have to admit I'm looking forward to getting back to Bombay.
Those eight men you lost, it hit you hard, didn't it?
They were my friends.
Think you can face losing more of your friends?
We're not going back to Bombay, are we?
No, we're going to Shaduzup.
There's a rail-head there, it has to be taken and held.
They're going to be looking for us so we're going there the hard way, through the swamps.
Yes sir.
Your men have been out at point for a long stretch now, they got a break coming.
If you want me to, I'll put another platoon out front.
- You leaving me that choice?
- It's right.
Well, that's a tough decision to make.
- Can I think it over?
- We moving right out.
- Why I get going?
- Yeah, why don't you?
Frank, don't you think you might've told him about Myitkyina?
Tough enough for him to tell them what he's telling them now.
Alright, take 10.
- Well, how's it going Chris?
- Beats milking cows back in Kansas.
Better radio the column, tell them we're taking a break.
- Stock to Quarterback, we're taking 10.
- Ok.
Battalion reports are no good.
They're out of food and water.
Sick list is growing, they need more rest.
Yeah, who doesn't?
Behind our timetable now on account of all this muck.
I don't know how they're doing it, typhus, malaria.
We're hurting, we're hurting Frank.
You better get the column started Barney.
Alright Frank.
What's the matter with you?
- You look funny to me general.
- Funny?
You're not going to pin one of these, these little tags on me.
Pin it on your back when you're not looking, they'll drag you out of here.
I told you, all I have is a dizzy spell, maybe a touch of fever, nothing to it.
Open your shirt.
Will you stop apple polishing?
You already took my blood pressure.
Open your shirt.
You wasting my time.
You like me cough?
How long have you been getting away with this?
- Away with what?
You don't have to lie to me general, I'm your doctor.
- The last physical I was top-notch.
- I don't believe you.
- A captain always believes a general.
- How long you've been having chest pains?
Was the last time you had a pain in your left arm?
- Did you go in a pool of sweat?
- I'm in one now, damn it.
My men are liable to die in this swamp without firing a shot.
Ok, Ok. I...
I had one about a, about a year, three years ago... in, in Tokyo as military attache.
- I was treated at a private hospital.
- What was the diagnosis?
I'll tell you what it was, heart...
Coronary thrombosis.
And you're on your way to another one.
Doc, you keep this under your hat.
Captain Kolodny, I'd like you to regard that as a, as an order.
Hey Stock, ain't this column got any food?
What you bet they're holding on us back there?
Nobody is holding out on you
Chowhound, we're all in the same boat.
Yeah, we could use one around here.
I didn't know we have enough blood left for these damn leeches.
Medic, get Doskis.
Hey Stock, on the level, when we getting out of here?
Like I told you, when we hit the railroad tracks.
Railroad tracks? Is he kidding?
There ain't nothing at the end of this swamp except maybe more swamp.
Relax Bullseye.
- Take advantage of the break.
- How you even get in this outfit Muley?
They drafted Eleanor, where she goes, I go.
Yeah, you're two of a kind.
Boy, if my mother could see me now.
- You know, there was a time...
- What time is it?
- AM or PM?
- AM, you knot-head.
Taggy it's PM it's night, its getting dark.
You're out of your head, it was night already.
Now, I'm watching very carefully, it's PM.
Ok, wise guy, if you're so smart, what day is it?
- It's, it's Tuesday.
- Everybody knows it's Sunday.
- It's Tuesday.
- It's Sunday.
You've been hearing church bells or something?
Both got battle fatigue, it's Wednesday.
How do you know? You got a calender?
- It's my birthday.
- Let's bake a cake.
No, I got a better idea.
Let's have some steaks.
You better knock that idea right out of your mouth Chowhound.
People eat horses, don't they? What's the matter?
Nobody eats mule meat until I tell you to.
Get some shuteye for a few minutes, all of you.
Oh, Baby, now just settle down, that's it.
When I close my eyes, I see a mule is behind.
Also when I open them.
- What's wrong with Doskis?
- Typhus.
Typhus, are you sure?
He's got the rash and I found a bug bite on his leg, he's running 105.
- Does he know it?
- He thinks it's malaria.
Tag him that.
Yes sir.
Alright, knock it off.
Knock it off, knock it off. Come on.
You guys want to fight, wait till we find more Japanese.
- I caught Chowhound going through my pack.
- This mule Skinner is hoarding all the food.
What did you do with all the
K rations I tell you put that pack?
I gave them to you last week, you crazy tapeworm.
- Let's go.
- Lieutenant Stockton...
- What's holding you up?
- One of my men is down.
- Who is it?
- Corporal Doskis.
What's the matter with him?
Typhus.
- What you tag him?
- Malaria.
- Got many cases?
- Got too many.
Railroad tracks shouldn't be too far away now.
I wonder if he made contact with anybody.
Over here general,
I found the railroad tracks.
Barney, send for a food drop.
See, just like I told you Eleanor, uncle
Muley said he'd get you out of this swamp.
Reach rear base loud and clear on the radio sir, the food is on the way.
Alright, everybody back in the swamp and keep moving.
Aren't we going to wait for the air drop sir?
- No.
- These men are starving.
I'd rather have them hungry than dead.
Parachutes will bring the enemy to this spot, we're not going to be here.
- What do we do for food?
- Fight for it.
Right at the end of those tracks is our objective, we'll eat Japanese food.
Want everybody in the swamp, get moving.
All of you in the swamp, get moving.
Stock, let me have that hot one.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Come on, let's get you over here.
There.
Let's have a look at this young lady.
Here.
Hey. Look. Hey.
Watch me.
See?
See? Won't hurt you, here.
That ought to hold it.
Get you over to the doc and see if he can't get that piece of shrapnel out of there.
Medic.
Take care of her, will you?
She's got some steel in her thigh.
- I gave her some sulfa.
- Sure Stock.
Hey.
Hey, he's not going to hurt you.
There.
Hey, it's going to be all right.
Go on now, he's going to take care of your leg.
There.
Here you are Eleanor.
Get some genuine Shaduzup H2O.
Hey Bullseye.
Girls.
Yeah.
Well, the landing strip is ready.
The wounded are all set for evacuation.
Hey, out of pipe tobacco?
I guess I lost my pouch in the swamp somewhere.
Signal from headquarters,
Northern Combat Command.
- General Stilwell is messaging you sir.
- Ben, give him a hand decoding, will you?
Yes sir.
Have a match?
- He sure doesn't waste much time, does he?
- Hello Doc.
- What's the score?
- You want details?
- No, no, just the bottom line.
- The 5307th is collapsed.
From a medical viewpoint, they're finished as a fighting unit.
Could I have that fire again? I don't seem to be able to get this pipe going.
I have never seen human beings in such condition.
Drained, physically and psychologically drained.
I'm not tagging them for specific ailments.
I'm simply marking every man in the outfit AOE.
Accumulation of everything.
They're through.
- I've general Stilwell's message sir.
- Read it.
Three Japanese divisions invading India,
Imperative we take Myitkyina, can you do it?
Frank, he's asking if we can do it, that lets us out.
- Sergeant?
- Of course, he's not ordering us to go.
- He's leaving it up to you.
- Yeah.
Yeah, he's leaving up to me alright.
Alright Doc... let's have a look at this washed-up outfit of ours... before I make up my mind whether or not we can go on to Myitkyina.
Can I ask you a question general?
What you looking for?
Something is not in your medical book Doc.
- Can I get out of line?
- No.
Alright, forget about the army, this is just between doctor and patient.
- The answer is still no.
- Alright then, I'll talk to you as a friend.
If you're thinking about sending these men to Myitkyina, don't do it.
You'll never be able to live with yourself.
- How do you know what I'm able to live with?
- I wouldn't want it on my conscience.
Nobody wants you to have anything on your conscience.
You've been paid to make diagnoses and I'm paid to make decisions.
Hope your decision is as accurate as my diagnoses.
- I'm checking your diagnoses right now.
- Who's going to check your decision?
Me.
You're kidding yourself general, you got no decision to make.
These men are at the end of their rope and so are you.
When you're at the end of your rope, all you have to do is make one foot... move out in front of the other, just take the next step.
It's all there is to it.
Who are you?
- Merrill, who are you?
- Lieutenant Lemcheck make it?
Did Lemcheck make it? I saw him get hit.
Poor Lemcheck, poor Lemcheck.
- He's dead.
- Did Lemcheck make it?
He's Lemcheck.
Chris, headquarters needs another radio man. Taggy, you go along with him.
They've got some captured
Japanese documents need translating.
Kolowicz, put four men on security.
Bullseye, pick up eight cases of ammo for the platoon.
Ammo?
What's Merrill volunteering us for this time?
We're low, get the ammo.
I don't need any ammo,
Damned, I'm not fighting anybody.
- Pick up the ammo Bullseye.
- Tell Merrill to pick it up himself.
- What you say?
- I said, tell Merrill to pick it up himself.
I've taken my last order from that butcher.
I'm sorry Stock.
- I didn't mean it.
- I didn't either.
- I'll get the ammo.
- I'll give him a hand lieutenant.
- They're coming apart.
- Yeah, yeah, we all are.
Well, I hope Merrill don't take us any further than this.
What's left of us.
And it's been the most... difficult decision of my life.
I pray...
I've chosen correctly.
Kiss the children for me.
My love...
To you, as always Frank.
Well Stock?
Message to general Stilwell transmitted sir.
Thank you.
General...
I've never asked a favor of you before but I got to ask one now.
I'd like your permission to tell my men when they go home.
Stock, I've just radioed general Stilwell that said we're going to Myitkyina.
- To Myitkyina?
- Yeah.
I told him that in my opinion we can take the base.
- Sir, my men can't make it.
- Yes, they can.
- You don't know my men.
- I know them better than you do.
General, is not that they don't want to fight, they can't.
They just can't physically fight anymore.
If they've got a single ounce of strength left in them, they can fight.
Men don't mean anything to you, do they?
They're just two legs to walk with, shoulders to carry a pack... a pair of hands to shoot a rifle, that's all.
When I pinned those bars on you I made a leader out of you.
When you lead, you have to hurt people, the enemy and sometimes your own.
I don't want any more of my men butchered.
And I request to be relieved of the command of my platoon.
Request denied, I need you too much.
O'Steen...
Pick that up, pick up your ammo belt and put it on.
Here you go.
- Go on O'Steen.
- Yes sir.
What's holding it up? Come on, let's move out.
Come on now Eleanor, come on baby.
Now come on Eleanor, you volunteered for this too.
- Ok, ready to shove her over.
- No, you can't do that sarge.
She'll be all right after a little rest, her load is too heavy.
Muley, she's holding up the whole column.
Wait, I'll carry her load.
Boys, give me a hand with this pack.
Come on Eleanor, we climb this little old hill.
Just like old uncle Muley told you, we made it Eleanor.
Come on Muley, that's ok, come on.
Over yonder is Myitkyina.
You don't agree with what I'm doing, do you Barney?
Well, the textbooks would say that dividing our forces at this point... invites piecemeal destruction.
Yeah I, I wouldn't teach students this sort of thing.
But if we can make the Japanese think we're twice as many of us as there are.
Well, what would you do if it were your decision?
I'd go through the same hell that you did making yours.
How long do you figure before you can hit the base?
In our condition, 24 hours.
18th Japanese division will be waiting there for us.
You feel anything?
- Rain.
- Yeah.
Yeah, only, only a few drops but it could be the beginning.
We got to beat that monsoon.
When this is all over, you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to get married,
I'm going to have about six kids.
Align them against a wall and tell them what it was like here in Burma.
If they don't cry,
I'll beat the hell out of them.
- I'll see you in Myitkyina.
- So long Frank.
Request general's permission to bury my man here.
In there.
Get on that radio, find out if Bannister is been hit.
- Wonder what they're up to next.
- It's only one way to find out.
Pass the word, Taggy is going out.
Enemy infiltration increasing along the 1st battalion right flank sir.
- Who's holding that position?
- Stock's platoon sir.
Hey, sarge?
Kolowicz, where are you?
Sarge? Hey sarge.
You keep your mouth shut.
Don't shoot, it's Taggy coming in.
- Did you learn anything?
- Banzai when it gets light.
- You hurt?
- A little.
Infiltration stopped sir.
Stock is Ok sir, I just talked to radio man.
You got good cover in here Eleanor.
Taggy got some dope, it's a banzai at dawn.
Terry, pass the word along the line.
- Stock.
- Yes sir.
That's all.
Stay awake soldier, banzai at dawn.
Banzai at dawn Kolly.
Banzai at dawn, banzai at dawn.
Banzai at dawn, banzai at dawn.
- Here.
- It's your last one sir.
Go on, take it,
Doc says smoking is bad for me.
Come in, left guard. Come in, left guard.
We're pinned down by heavy machine gun fire from west of here.
- Send medics, send medics.
- Victor to Tom, have fallen back.
I'm reorganizing and digging in.
Lou hit by enemy sniper.
Suggest you get down at once.
All units, all units, enemy making heavy rush through center.
Breakthrough, breakthrough.
Left guard to
Quarterback, Japanese falling back.
Right guard to
Quarterback, enemy pulling out.
- We beat them off, they're running.
- But why?
Quarterback to Bannister, come in Bannister.
- This is Bannister, come in Quarterback.
- What is your situation?
We've reached the airstrip, we're attacking, resistance is heavy.
It's going to get heavier.
It's the reason the Japanese are pulling out.
Heading back to Myitkyina to defend the airstrip, we better get a move on.
Notify battalion to assemble all able bodied men.
- We're moving on Myitkyina.
- We better get a move on.
I want every man who can walk, every man who can carry a rifle.
- You cannot order these men to fight.
- Every man who can carry a rifle.
Bannister needs one more push.
- With these men we can take Myitkyina.
- You cannot order them to fight.
They'll never make it, you'll never make it.
Doc, just give me something to keep me on my feet 24 hours.
- That's all I ask, 24 hours.
- You're asking for a miracle general.
I don't have any up my sleeve and neither have you.
A miracle isn't called for.
Just another step, just one more step.
Alright, everybody on your feet.
As long as you can breathe, you can fight.
Come on boy, pick up that rifle. Come on son, follow me.
You can make it, all you have to do is take that next step.
It's all there's to it, one foot in front of the other.
Come on, let's go.
You heard the general, on your feet.
Kolowicz, move out.
Chris, let's go. Move out.
Let's go.
What sort of men are these? How do they do it?
How can they do it?
But they did it, they did the impossible.
They took Myitkyina.
On that day of victory, of the 3,000 volunteers who marched into Burma... only 100 remained in action.
On that same day, Merrill's marauders were demobilized... and thus ceased to exist officially.
But by order of the president of the United States, a special unit... citation was awarded these men so that history would never forget them.
Today their traditions are being carried on by the U.S. army special forces... and other proud units of the United States army.
We salute them all.

In June of 1807, in Tilsit, the meeting of the emperors Alexander and Napoleon took place.
In the meantime, life, the actual life of people, with its concerns of health, sickness, work, rest, and the interest people take in thinking, the sciences, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, passion, went on as usual, independently and outside of the political issue of friendship or war with
Napoleon Bonaparte.
January, February, March, April...
Come on, speak, Mama.
This won't do, my dear.
Not everyone can understand your childhood friendship.
Seeing you two being so close may be detrimental to you, and what's more important, it's making him wretched for nothing.
He might have already found a good match, and now he's going crazy.
Is he?
I’ll tell you about myself.
I had a cousin...
I know, Kirill Matveyevich.
But he's an old man.
He was not always old.
I’ll speak to Boris.
He mustn't come so often.
- Why not, if he wants to?
- Because it can't come to anything.
Mama, what nonsense!
All right, I won't marry him, but let him come if we both enjoy it.
Not to be married, but - just so...
- How so, my dear?
- Oh, just so.
I don't want to get married at all.
Just so...
Stop laughing.
You're shaking the bed.
You're so much like me, just another giggler.
Well, is he very much in love?
What do you think?
Did someone love you as much?
Besides, he's very nice.
Only not quite to my liking.
He's so narrow, like the grandfather clock in the dining-room.
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.
- Narrow, gray, light-colored...
- What nonsense you talk!
Don't you really understand?
Nikolenka would understand.
Bezukhov, for instance, is blue.
Navy blue and red.
And he's quadrangular.
- You're flirting with him, too.
- No, he's a Freemason.
He's a darling, navy blue and red.
How can I explain it to you?
Countess, are you asleep?
No one can understand all that I have in me.
Sonya? No, how could she?
She's too virtuous.
Even mother can't understand me.
It’s amazing how clever I am and...
She is so charming. She's got everything.
Extraordinarily intelligent, pretty, graceful.
She swims, rides beautifully, and her voice!
She's got a marvelous voice!
On December 31, on the eve of the new year 1810, a Catherine court dignitary was giving a grand ball.
The Czar and the diplomatic corps were expected to attend.
The Rostovs were invited, too, and Natasha was preparing for the first great ball of her life.
Sonya! That bow isn't right.
Come here, will you?
- Aren't you ready? It’s nearly 10.
- Coming!
- Are you ready, Mama?
- I only have my cap to pin on.
- Don't do it without me!
- But it's ten o'clock already!
Mavrusha, darling, hurry!
- Aren't you ever going to be ready?
- In a minute. Don't come in, Papa!
Can it be that no one will ask me to dance?
That no one will notice me?
No, it can't be!
They have got to know how I long to dance, how wonderfully I dance, and how glad they'll be to dance with me.
This is indeed interesting...
You always dance, don't you? I have a protégée here, the Rostov girl.
- Will you ask her to dance?
- Where is she?
Excuse me, I’d be happy to go on with our talk some other time.
But at a ball one should dance.
I want you to meet my daughter.
I have the pleasure of her acquaintance, if the Countess remembers me.
Would you do me the honor for a waltz?
If she goes to her cousin first, then to another lady, it will mean she will be my wife.
Isn't this marvelous?
Yes, it is. I’m very glad.
Oh, that's you. I’ve been working.
My dear, I have never experienced anything like that.
I’m in love, my friend.
- Well?
- Mama, don't ask me anything now.
- With Natasha Rostova?
- Yes. Who else?
This feeling is too strong for me.
I wasn't really living until now.
Only now I feel alive, but I can't live without her.
How could she ever love me?
I’ve never felt like this before!
But I feel scared when I’m with him.
Does that mean it's the real thing?
- Why don't you say something?
- Me? I’ve been telling you...
- Mama, are you asleep?
- No, my darling, I’m frightened.
I know I won't sleep anyway.
I never felt like this before!
That girl is such a treasure...
She's such a rare girl.
I’m asking you, don't try to rationalize, have no doubts, marry her, and I’m sure that there will never be a happier man.
- But how about her?
- She loves you.
- Nonsense, Pierre.
- Yes, I know it.
- I must talk to someone about it.
- Go on, I’d be glad to.
It had to happen that he came to
St. Petersburg when we were here.
And we had to meet at that ball.
It was Fate, I’m sure.
Yes, it must have been that.
For me now, the world is divided into two.
She is one part where you find happiness, hope and light.
The other part is all where she isn't, and that's all gloom.
Gloom and darkness.
Yes, I know what you mean.
Can a man help preferring light to gloom? I’m so happy.
- I know you're glad for my sake.
- Yes, yes.
Mama, darling, how I love you!
How happy I am!
Three weeks went by.
Not once did Prince Bolkonsky call on the Rostovs.
Natasha, darling, perhaps he's ill. After all, he was wounded at Austerlitz.
Please, don't, Mama!
I don't want to think about him.
He just started visiting us and then stopped.
And I don't feel like getting married. I’m afraid of the man.
I mean what I’m saying.
Why think that much about it?
Things are fine as they are.
Yes, that's me! And I don't need anyone.
What a charming creature that Natasha is!
She's pretty, has a nice voice, she is young, she doesn't bother anyone.
Just leave her alone!
Mama, Bolkonsky is here!
Mama, it's awful!
I don't want to be tortured!
Who's here? Why?
Oh please, Natasha!..
It’s such a long time since we have had the pleasure...
I haven't been to visit you because I had to see my father.
There was something very important
I had to talk to him about.
I would like to speak to you,
Countess.
Go, Natasha, I will call you.
Lord, have pity on me.
Lord, please help me.
Well, Mama?
Go to him.
He's asking for your hand.
Can it be that this stranger has become everything to me now?
Now he's dearer to me than anything else in the world.
Since the very first minute I saw you I have loved you.
Please say that I can hope.
Why ask?
Why doubt what it's impossible not to know?
Why talk when you can't express with words what you feel?
- Do you love me?
- Oh yes, yes...
- What is it? Is something wrong?
- I feel so happy.
Now, Prince Andrei no longer felt the same love for her as before.
Something within him had changed.
There was none of the former poetic charm of attraction, only a kind of pity for her feminine and childish weakness, a sort of terror before her devotion and trustfulness.
Although this new feeling was not as poetic as the old one, it was stronger and more serious.
Did your mother tell you that we cannot be married for a year?
Is it possible that it's me?..
Is it possible that from now on
I’m to be the wife, the equal of this stranger, who is so intelligent and charming, whom even my father looks up to?
Can it be true that life is no longer a game, that now I’m responsible for everything I do and say?
But what was it he asked me?
You are so young, and I’ve already been through such a great deal.
It’s for you that I’m afraid.
You don't know yourself yet.
Difficult as it is for me to wait an entire year, delaying my happiness, it will give you some time to test yourself.
I’m asking you to make me happy in a year.
But till then you are free.
Our engagement will remain secret.
And should you find that you do not love me...
Why do you say that?
From the first day you came to
Otradnoye, I have loved you.
In one year you will learn to know yourself.
A whole year?
Why wait a year?
Can't anything be done?
It’s frightening!
I’ll die waiting a year!
Why, it's so awful!
No! I’ll do anything.
I feel so happy!
There was no ceremony and their betrothal was not announced to anyone.
Don't go.
I beg you, Natalie,
God knows what may happen.
Perhaps you will stop loving me...
I know I shouldn't talk about that.
But whatever may happen to you when I’m not here...
Don't go...
Whatever may happen, go to Pierre for help.
He's the most absent-minded man, but he has a heart of gold.
Don't go...
How indignant Pierre would have been seven years before, when he'd returned from his sojourn abroad, if someone had told him that there would be no need for him to seek or plan anything, that his path had long ago been traced and predetermined for him.
Sometimes he consoled himself that the life he led was a temporary thing.
But then he would be shocked by another thought: how many other men had temporarily slipped into this sort of life, just as he had, with all their teeth and all their hair, only to leave it without a single tooth and without a single hair.
Why? What for?
What was going on in the world?
Now and then Pierre recalled what he had been told of soldiers under fire in ambuscade when they have nothing to do, how they try hard to find occupation so as to bear their danger more easily.
And Pierre pictured all men as such soldiers trying to find a refuge from life, some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women, some in games, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some in wine, some in the government service.
Nothing is trivial, nothing is important. Only one thing matters: to escape from her as best I can!
Only not to see her, that dreadful her.
Under the influence of wine he would say to himself:
"I’ll get it straightened out.
I have a solution already.
But I’ll think it over later on!”
The trouble was this “later on” never came.
Good morning, Uncle!
All’s well and quick march!
I knew you couldn't resist it.
You had better attack at once, for my Girchik reported that the Ilaghins are out with their hounds at Korniki.
They'll snatch the litter right under your noses.
That's where I’m going.
Shall we join the packs?
Good morning, Uncle!
See? We're going too!
Good morning to you. Be careful you don't trample the hounds.
We won't get in anyone's way.
We'll stay in our places.
A good thing too, little Countess, only don't fall off your horse, since there's nothing for a horse to hold on to.
Have you seen Natalya Ilyinichna?
Where is she?
She and Pyotr Ilyich are standing behind the high grass at Zharov.
A lady, but she has a great love for the chase.
And you wonder at her riding, eh?
- It wouldn't be amiss for a man.
- Yes! So daring, so smart!
You old hag, don't scare the game off, or old Danila'll curse you...
I know a thing or two myself!
They're on the track of the litter.
In the Lyadovsky uplands.
Stand still!
There!
He slipped by you! Some hunters!
Dear Lord, what would it cost You to do this for me?
I know it's a sin to ask You such a thing.
But please, let the wolf come out my way!
Just once in my life let me get a hermit wolf, that's all I want!
Keep going or go back?
Keep going!
What a magnificent wolf!
- A real hermit wolf, eh?
- The meanest one, Your Excellency.
As mean as you are, Danila.
That's my little Countess, all’s well, quick march!
I never saw an amazon like her!
Dawn to sundown, riding sidesaddle, and she's as fresh as a daisy!
Have a taste of this, little Countess.
Come on, Petya, wake up!
Taste some of this, it's delicious!
This is how I’m finishing my days.
When you die, there's nothing left at all. All’s well, quick march.
So why complain...
Open the door! Why have you shut it?
That's my coachman.
I’ve bought him a good balalaika.
How nice! It’s really good.
What do you mean, good?
It’s simply enchanting!
Please, go on! Play some more.
You enjoy it, little Countess?
He plays very well, doesn't he?
That's not the way to do it.
You should hear trills there, all’s well, quick march!
Can you play, Uncle?
Anisya, will you see if the strings are all right on the guitar?
I haven't touched it for a long time, all’s well, quick march!
Beautiful, Uncle! Go on! More!
Please, dear Uncle!
Now then, my dear niece...
Where, when, how had this little
Countess, reared in silk and velvet by a French governess, ever managed to absorb, with only the air she breathed, this manner that was so typically
Russian?
And yet the spirit and gestures were precisely and inimitably Russian, which her uncle expected to find in her.
How did she manage to grasp everything that was in Anisya, in Anisya's father, in her mother, in every Russian man or woman?
Well done, my little Countess!
That's my niece!
All you need now is to pick out a worthy young man for a husband!
He's already picked out.
Yes, and a very good one!
What did Nikolai's smile mean when he said, “he's already picked out”?
He acts as if he thought that my
Bolkonsky wouldn't understand, wouldn't approve of this wonderful time we're having.
But he would understand.
Where is he now?
But I mustn't think about him.
Night has laid out a blanket
Of the newly-fallen snow.
Swept it over every pathway
In the field of predawn glow.
It’s not sorrow that's eating
A good fellow, it's woe.
A good fellow is grieving...
- What are you thinking about?
- Me? Wait.
I was thinking that here we're driving thinking we're going home.
But actually, we're going Heaven knows where and finally we'd arrive and find we weren't at Otradnoye, but that we were in a fairy land.
And then I thought...
No, that was all.
-You were certainly thinking of him.
- No.
And also I was thinking how beautiful Anisya was.
I know that I shall never be as happy as I am now.
Nonsense, gibberish, folly.
What a treasure my Natasha is!
I have no other friend like her and I’ll never have.
Why does she have to marry? We could have gone like this forever.
What a treasure my Nikolai is.
Oh, if he'd only come back sooner.
I’m afraid we'll never get married.
Worst of all, I’m getting older...
I shall no longer be what I am now.
But what if he comes today?
Perhaps he came yesterday, and I’ve forgotten it?
What am I to do with them?
Oh yes, Nikita, will you please go and...
Where am I to send him?
Yes, will you please go to the yard and bring me a rooster?
Nastasya Ivanovna, what shall I give birth to?
You? Fleas.
Dragon-flies, grasshoppers.
Oh, my God, the same old thing.
Where am I to go?
What am I to do with myself?
The Island of Mad-a-gas-car.
Mad-a-gas-car. Madagascar.
Do you feel sometimes that nothing is going to happen to you anymore, that everything good had already happened, and you feel not so much bored, as sad?
Oh yes, very often!
I remember moments, when everybody around is cheerful, it suddenly strikes me that I’m sick of it all, and all must die.
I didn't go to a squadron party once, and there the music was playing, and I felt all at once so dreary.
I know it. I know it.
Even when I was quite little,
I used to have that feeling.
Do you remember, I was punished once for eating some plums, and you were all dancing, and I sat in the study sobbing?
I shall never forget it.
I felt so miserable and sorry for everyone.
And what's most important,
I wasn't to blame.
I remember that I came to you later and I longed to comfort you.
We used to be so funny.
I had a dummy toy then, and I wanted to give it to you.
- Do you remember it, Sonya?
- Yes, I do remember something.
How strange it is, as though it were a dream. I like that.
And do you remember how Papa, in his blue fur coat, fired a gun off on the porch?
Do you remember what fun it was?..
- They've brought a rooster, Miss.
- Tell them to take it back.
I think that when one goes on remembering and remembering, one remembers till one recalls what happened before one was in this world.
That's metempsychosis.
The Egyptians used to believe that our souls had been in animals, and would go into animals again.
I don't believe we were once in animals, but I know for certain that we were once angels somewhere, and we have been here, and that's why we remember everything.
If we had been angels, why should we have fallen lower?
Not lower.
Who told you we were lower?
This is how I know
I have existed before.
The soul is immortal, you know.
If I’m to live forever, that means
I have lived for all eternity.
But it's hard for us to conceive of eternity.
Why is it hard?
There's today, there will be tomorrow, and there will be forever, and yesterday has been, and the day before.
The mummers are here!
- Natasha!
- Did you see? Did you see him?
Yes.
- Wait, I... saw him.
- Standing or lying down?
At first there wasn't anything. Then suddenly, I saw him lying down.
- Lying down? Could he be ill?
- No. His face was cheerful.
What happened then, Sonya?
I couldn't make it out.
I saw something blue and red.
When is he going to come back?
When shall I see him again?
I’m so afraid for him, and for myself, and about everything else...
Prince Andrei wants his year reduced by three months.
So write him and tell him to wait till I’m dead. It won't take long.
Go ahead, marry, dear son.
What a fine alliance!
Smart people, eh? And rich, eh?
And what a stepmother he's going to give poor Nikolushka!
Let him marry tomorrow if he wants! And I’ll marry our governess!
He mustn't be without a stepmother, either!
But I’m not going to put up with any more women in my house!
Would you like to live with him, too? Bon voyage and good riddance!
Put the Count's things over here.
The young ladies' - on the left.
You've grown plumper and prettier.
Phoo! How cold you are!
Maria Dmitrievna, my Countess has gotten ill. Our house isn't heated.
I took an opportunity of your invitation, and here we are.
High time you did.
I’m so glad you could come.
The old Bolkonsky's in Moscow.
His son is also expected any day.
You really should make his acquaintance.
His highness cannot see you, but her highness, the Princess, asks you to come up.
You see, my dear Princess, I’ve brought you my little songstress.
I’m so happy that you can get to know each other.
I have long wanted to do so, Count.
I’m very glad.
I’m sorry to hear that the Prince is unwell.
If you'll permit, Princess,
I’d like to leave my Natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour.
I would like to drop in on Anna Semyonovna.
Then I’ll come back and pick her up.
Please spend the longest time possible at your friend's.
My dear Natalie, I’m so delighted to see that my brother has found happiness at last.
I think, Princess, that it's not opportune to talk about that now.
Ah, Mademoiselle!
Countess Rostova, if I am not mistaken?
I beg your pardon.
God is my witness, I didn't know that you've honored us with a visit.
It was to my daughter that I came in this costume.
Please excuse me.
So help me God, I didn't know.
I beg you to excuse me.
After all, what do his father and sister matter to me?
He's the one I love and he alone.
No, I’d better not think of him.
I’d better forget him for now.
Look what a cap Anna Mikhailovna has on.
That's the Karaghins with Julie and
Boris. One can see they're engaged.
Drubetskoy has made a proposal.
I heard so today.
How long have you been in town,
Countess?
I have some business here, too, and I’ve brought my girls with me.
They say, Semyonova's acting is superb.
Here he is, Kuraghin!
I can't call on you. Does it mean
I’ll never see you again?
How madly I’m in love with you!
Never to see you again?
Natalie!
Just one word! For the love of God!
One word!
Mademoiselle, a man asked me to give you this.
Since last evening, my fate is sealed:
To be loved by you or to die.
I have no other choice.
Forget all this. There's time yet.
Stop talking nonsense.
If you only knew what this means to me.
I’m being serious.
What you're planning is no joke.
Stop teasing me!
Go to the devil!
I’ve helped you plan this, but you must be told the truth.
This affair is dangerous, and when you think of it, it's stupid.
All right, you'll take the girl away, but they won't let it go at that.
They're going to find out you're married. They'll take you to court!
Rubbish! Haven't I explained everything to you?
If this marriage is invalid,
I won't have to answer for anything.
And if it's valid, in a foreign country no one will know a thing.
So I don't want to hear about it any more.
- You'll get your head in a noose.
- You go to the devil!
You don't understand what I’m going through. Just feel it beating.
What a lovely foot she has! And the look in her eye! A pure goddess!
-When your money's gone, what then?
- What then?..
How am I to know what then?..
Don't talk nonsense.
Sonya, I can't keep it from you any longer.
We're in love.
He's written to me, Sonya...
And Bolkonsky?
You can't imagine how happy I am!
You mean you're breaking up with Prince Andrei?
You don't understand anything.
Stop this nonsense, listen to me.
I’m not going to let you do it.
I will tell.
If you tell, then you're my enemy!
You want to ruin my life.
You can't meddle in such affairs.
I confided in you...
Why doesn't he come right out and ask for your hand?
After all, Prince Andrei has given you complete freedom.
You mustn't doubt him, Sonya, don't you understand?
- What if he's not an honorable man?
- I can't live without him!
I don't understand you!
Think of your father, of Nikolai!
I don't need anyone!
I don't love anybody except him!
I don't want to quarrel. Please go!
Don't you see that I’m suffering?
Well, lads, friends of my youth, we have had jolly sprees together!
Now, when shall we meet again?
I’m going abroad. Farewell!
- Let's get going!
- And where's the sable coat?
Ignatka! Go upstairs and ask for a sable coat!
She'll come out nearly dead with fright, wearing whatever she had on.
If you don't act fast, she'll get cold and want to go back.
Then you wrap the coat around her and carry her over to the sleigh.
You idiot! I said sable, didn't l?
Come on, take it. I won't miss it.
I shall demonstrate.
That's the way. See?
Giddyap!
She will be out directly.
- Will you come to the mistress?
- What mistress?
My orders are to bring you in.
Kuraghin! We've been betrayed!
Maria Dmitrievna, let me in to see her, for God's sake!
Shameless girl! Wretched little hussy!
A fine thing! Arranging meetings with lovers under my roof.
Enough of those crocodile tears.
Listen to me when I speak to you.
You've disgraced yourself, like a common girl of the streets.
I don't know what I’d have done if
I didn't feel sorry for your father.
A lucky thing for that scoundrel that he escaped, but he'll be found.
Will you listen to what I’m saying?
Let me alone. I don't care.
I’m going to die!
Natasha!
I’m doing this for your own good.
Now lie still, I won't touch you.
What am I going to tell your father when he comes back tomorrow?
-What if he and your fiance find out?
- I have no fiance. I’ve broken up.
Makes no difference. He'll find out.
Do you think he'll keep quiet?
He might even challenge that scoundrel to a duel. What then?
Will you leave me alone?
Why did you have to meddle?
Who asked you to do that?
Just what did you expect?
Suppose he had kidnapped you?
Do you think you'd get away with it?
He's a scoundrel, that's what he is!
He's better than any of you!
Why did you have to interfere?
Oh, merciful God, why?
Sonya, why?
Will you get out?
Everyone hates me, despises me!
You are worse than a cad. You're a scoundrel!
Why am I denying myself the pleasure of smashing your head?
- Had you promised to marry her?
- I... I didn't think.
Well, I couldn't make any promises because I’m married already.
Have you any letters from her?
I won't do anything to you, don't be afraid.
I’ve got the letters. Now you will have to leave Moscow by morning.
And one other thing. You'll never breathe a word about what happened.
I know I can't prevent you from doing so, but if there remains in you a scrap of human conscience...
If you must, go to women like my wife for your diversion.
They know what you want, and so there you're within your rights.
They're as well armed as you with the same experience of debauchery.
But deceiving a girl whom you've vowed to marry... kidnapping her...
Have you never been told that it's just as cowardly and infamous as killing an old man or a child?
I wouldn't know and I really don't care to know.
But you used certain words, like cowardly and so on, that I cannot condone as a man of honor.
Although there are no witnesses, still I’m not going...
You want satisfaction?
You might at least take back your insults, if you want me to comply with your wishes.
I take back my words and ask you to forgive me.
And should you need any money for your journey...
What a breed you are! Mean, sordid, heartless!
Her letters and her portrait. Would you return them to the Countess?
She is very ill.
So she is still here?
And Prince Kuraghin?
He left long ago.
She almost died.
I’m very sorry to hear of her illness.
I take it, Monsieur Kuraghin did not honor her with his hand?
He couldn't marry because he was already married.
And where might your brother-in-law be now, if I may ask?
He left for St. Petersburg...
Actually I’ve no idea where he is.
You may tell Countess Rostova she's always been and remains free, and that I wish her every happiness.
Do you remember that discussion we had in St. Petersburg...
Yes, I told you that one should forgive a fallen woman.
But I never said I would be able to.
I can't forgive.
But can this be compared?
Once more to ask for her hand, to be magnanimous?
I am not up to following the same path as that gentleman.
If you want to be my friend, don't talk to me again about that... about all this.
Well, goodbye.
Pyotr Kirillovich,
Prince Bolkonsky is your friend.
He once told me
I could come to you for help.
Now the Prince is here...
Could you tell him to... to please forgive me?
- Yes, I will tell him, but...
- I know everything's finished.
What torments me is that I have hurt him so.
Can you tell him that I beg him to forgive me for everything.
Yes, I’ll tell him. I will do as you ask.
Only I’d like to know one thing...
I would like to know whether you loved...
Did you love that evil man?
You mustn't call him evil.
I don't know anymore.
Then we won't speak of it again, my dear.
I will tell him everything, but you must think of me as your friend.
If you ever need help, if you feel like confiding in someone, not right now, but when you can see in yourself more clearly, remember I’m your friend.
If there's anything I can do,
I would be happy...
Please don't be so kind.
I don't deserve it!
Don't say that! Your whole life still lies ahead of you.
No! For me, everything's finished.
Everything is finished?
If I were somebody else, somebody who was good-looking, intelligent and the best of men, and if I were free,
I would be right now at your feet asking for your hand and your love.
It seemed to him that this dazzling comet was the perfect symbol of what he felt in his compassionate soul which brimmed with the blossom of a new life.
On June 12, the armies of Western
Europe crossed the Russian border, and the war began, an event completely opposed to human reason and human nature.
End of Part Two
subrip：xunbao http://www.waf.com.cn
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.
Did you know him well?
I knew him.
Well, nil nisi bonum.
But did he really deserve...
...a place in here?
Lord Allenby, could you give a few words about Lawrence?
What, more words?
The revolt in the desert...
...played a decisive part in the Middle Eastern campaign.
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.
No, no. I didn't know him well, you know.
Mr. Bentley, you know as much about Lawrence as anybody.
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.
And to make him known to the world.
He was a poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior.
Thank you.
He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.
You, sir. Who are you?
My name is Jackson Bentley.
I overheard your last remark and take the gravest exception.
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?
No, I can't claim to have known him.
I had the honour to shake his hand in Damascus.
Knew him? I never knew him.
He had some minor function on my staff in Cairo.
Michael George Hartley...
...this is a nasty, dark little room.
That's right.
We are not happy in it.
I am. It's better than a nasty, dark little trench.
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.
Here is William Potter with my newspaper.
- Here you are, tosh.
- Thanks.
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?
- Is it there?
- Of course.
Headlines.
But I bet it isn't mentioned in the Times.
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."
I bet that no one in this headquarters even knows it happened.
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.
Michael George Hartley, you're a philosopher.
And you're balmy!
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.
What's the trick, then?
The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.
By the way, if Captain Gibbon should enquire for me...
...tell him I've gone for a chat with the general.
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.
Lawrence.
Yes?
You're supposed to be...
Do you usually wear your cap in the mess?
Always.
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.
I'm going for a powwow with the general.
I'm not asking as your superior, but as the secretary of this mess.
We don't want chaps in here who should be on duty.
Where are you going?
I must say, Lawrence!
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.
Sorry.
It's an intrigue, Dryden.
I do not propose to let an overweening, crass lieutenant...
...thumb his nose at his commander and get away with it.
It doesn't sound as though he'd be any great loss, sir.
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.
There is, indeed.
He's of no use here in Cairo.
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.
Knows the books, you mean.
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.
If Brighton thinks we should send some arms, we will.
Well, what more do you want?
That there would be no question of Lieutenant Lawrence...
...giving military advice.
By God, I should hope not.
It's just that the Arab Bureau would like its own man on the spot to...
To what?
To make our own appraisal of the situation.
I'll tell you, it's my considered opinion and that of my staff...
...that time spent on the Bedouin will be time wasted.
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.
They did attack Medina.
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.
We don't know that.
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.
In my opinion, this whole theatre of operations is a sideshow.
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.
Not here, but on the Western front in the trenches.
Your Bedouin Army, or whatever it calls itself...
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.
Big things have small beginnings, sir.
Does the Arab Bureau want a big thing in Arabia?
Does the bureau think they'll sit down under us when this war is over?
The bureau thinks the job of the moment, sir, is to win the war.
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.
Good morning, sir.
Salute.
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.
- It's my manner.
- Your what?
My manner. It looks insubordinate, but it isn't.
I can't make out whether you're bad-mannered or just half-witted.
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.
The Arab Bureau thinks you would be of use to them in Arabia.
Why, I can't imagine.
You can't perform your present duties properly.
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great state from a little city."
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.
It says so in your dossier.
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.
But I suppose I could be wrong.
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.
Who knows? It might even make a man of him. Come in!
Yes, what is it?
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.
There doesn't seem to be any artillery.
But there must be artillery!
Sir, this is something of an expedition.
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide, find the Arabs and then get back.
He can't do that in six weeks.
- Two months, then.
- Three.
All right, three. Now, will you let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?
Thank you, sir.
I'd like to say, sir, that I am grateful for this.
Shut up and get out.
Sir?
How can I fight a bloody war without bloody artillery?
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?
Find Prince Feisal.
Good. And when I've found him?
Find out what kind of a man he is.
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.
That is Colonel Brighton's business, not yours.
I mean, his intentions in Arabia altogether.
That's new.
Where are they now?
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.
They're Hashemite Bedouins.
They can cross 60 miles of desert in a day.
Thanks. This is going to be fun.
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get fun in the desert:
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither. Take it from me.
For ordinary men, it's a burning fiery furnace.
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.
It is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun.
Here you may drink.
One cup.
You do not drink?
No.
I'll drink when you do.
I am Bedu.
Truly, now, you are a British officer?
Yes.
From Cairo?
Yes.
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.
And before?
From Britain?
Yes.
Truly?
From Oxfordshire.
Is that a desert country?
No. A fat country. Fat people.
You are not fat?
No.
I'm different.
Here...
...take it.
First I take you to Lord Feisal, then you give it to me.
Take it now.
Bedu food.
Good.
More?
- Bedu.
- Where?
From here to Lord Feisal's camp is Harith country.
Yes, I know.
- I am not Harith.
- No.
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.
When you are ready to go...
...hit her on the shoulder and say, "Hut-hut-hut."
Today will be difficult, but tomorrow, good riding.
I think we reach Masturah Well tomorrow. Yes.
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.
Now!
Good?
It's all right.
This is a Harith well.
The Harith are a dirty people.
Turks?
Bedu.
Who is he?
He is dead.
Yes.
Why?
This is my well.
I have drunk from it.
You are welcome.
He was my friend.
- That?
- Yes, that.
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.
His?
Mine.
Then I will use it.
Your friend...
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.
I know.
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.
I have heard of you.
So...
...what was a Hazimi doing here?
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.
I can both read and write.
My Lord Feisal already has an Englishman.
What is your name?
My name is for my friends.
None of my friends is a murderer.
You are angry, English.
He was nothing.
The well is everything.
The Hazimi may not drink at our wells.
He knew that.
Salaam.
Sherif Ali.
So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe...
...so long will they be a little people...
...a silly people.
Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are.
Come.
I will take you to Feisal.
I do not want your company, sherif.
Wadi Safra is another day from here.
You will not find it, and you will die.
I will find it with this.
Good army compass.
How if I take it?
Then you would be a thief.
Have you no fear, English?
My fear is my concern.
Truly.
God be with you, English.
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air
You can hear the girls declare
He must be a millionaire
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo
Hey, you!
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.
How did he know?
Not much happens within 50 miles of Feisal that he doesn't know.
I'll give him that. No escort?
My guide was killed at the Masturah Well.
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.
Bloody savages.
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?
Lawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab Bureau.
What are you to do for the Arab Bureau?
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.
Their morale, if they ever had any, which I doubt...
...the Turks knocked out of them in front of Medina, with howitzers.
They're fading away by dozens every night.
What I want to say is this:
Wherever you are and whoever you are with...
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.
When we get into that camp, you're to keep your mouth shut.
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.
You'll make your appreciation and get back to...
Oh, my God.
Not again.
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."
They simply will not understand what modern weapons do!
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.
Fire back at them.
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.
You were right and I was wrong.
We must take some thought for the wounded.
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- Lf they can get to Yenbo.
They can hardly come with us.
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant?
Lawrence.
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...
...my people are unused to explosives and machines.
First the guns, and now this.
Cigarette?
I'm sorry.
Cigarette, Your Excellency?
Umph off.
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?
Hold it, Jenkins!
Jenkins!
Lawrence?
You have no servant.
- I don't need a servant.
- No?
We can do everything. Light fires, cook food, wash clothes.
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may be easy to you.
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may be easy to you.
God knoweth that there be some among you sick...
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.
Others do battle in His cause.
Recite, therefore, as much as may be easy.
And observe the prayers.
This will be best and richest in the recompense.
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful...
Greetings, Ali.
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.
Yes, my lord.
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."
"By the noonday brightness...
...and by the night when it darkeneth...
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...
...neither hath He been displeased.
And surely the future shall be better for thee than the past."
"And in the end shall your Lord be bounteous to thee...
...and thou be satisfied."
So?
Yes, colonel.
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.
Well, you're not doing much good here, sir.
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we can't supply you here.
You could supply us through Aqaba!
Aqaba!
If you can get ahold of Aqaba, we can supply you.
- But you can't!
- You could.
You mean, the navy?
The Turks have 12-inch guns at Aqaba, sir.
Can you imagine what that means?
Yes, I can imagine.
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.
The one essential sector of this front is and must be the canal.
You can see that, sir, surely.
I see that the canal is an essential British interest.
It is of little consequence to us.
I must ask you not to speak like that.
British and Arab interests are one and the same.
Possibly.
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.
Fall back on Yenbo and we will give you equipment.
Give you arms, advice, training, everything.
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.
No. Guns. Artillery.
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.
Yes, give us guns and keep the training.
Your men need training far more than guns, sir.
English will teach
Bedu to fight?
We will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight a modern mechanized army.
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?
I think it is far from Damascus.
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?
Yes, my lord.
It is beautiful, is it not?
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus, but discipline will.
Look, Great Britain is a small country, much smaller than yours.
Small population compared with some.
It's small, but it's great. And why?
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.
Because it has a navy, because of this...
...the English go where they please...
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!
Lawrence is not your military adviser.
But I would like to hear his opinion.
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.
My lord, I think...
I think your book is right.
The desert is an ocean in which no oar is dipped.
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they please...
...and strike where they please.
This is the way the Bedu has always fought.
You're famed through the world for fighting this way.
And this is the way you should fight now.
I don't know.
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising becomes one unit in the British army.
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.
No, colonel.
He is a young man, and young men are passionate.
They must say their say.
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.
You tread heavily...
...but you speak the truth.
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...
...it is late.
Colonel Brighton means to put my men...
...under European officers, does he not?
In effect, my lord, yes.
And I must do it...
...because the Turks have
European guns.
But I fear to do it...
...upon my soul I do.
The English have a great hunger for desolate places.
I fear they hunger for Arabia.
Then you must deny it to them.
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?
To England and to other things.
To England and Arabia both?
And is that possible?
I think you are another of these desert-Ioving English.
Doughty, Stanhope...
...Gordon of Khartoum.
No Arab loves the desert.
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.
And no man needs nothing.
Or is it that you think we are something you can play with...
...because we are a little people, a silly people...
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?
Or do you know, lieutenant, in the Arab city of Cordoba...
...were two miles of lighting in the streets...
...when London was a village.
Yes, you were great.
Nine centuries ago.
Time to be great again, my lord.
Which is why my father made this war upon the Turks.
My father, Mr. Lawrence, not the English.
But my father is old...
...and I...
...I long for the vanished gardens of Cordoba.
However, before the gardens must come the fighting.
To be great again, it seems that we need the English...
...or...
Or?
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.
We need a miracle.
Aqaba.
Aqaba.
From the land.
You are mad.
To come to Aqaba by land we should have to cross the Nefud Desert.
That's right.
The Nefud cannot be crossed.
I'll cross it if you will.
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.
Fifty men?
Fifty? Against Aqaba?
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...
...they would be 50 men other men might join.
The Howeitat are there, I hear.
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.
- Good fighters, though.
- Good...
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.
They face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot be turned around.
From the landward side, there are no guns at Aqaba.
With good reason. It cannot be approached from the landward side.
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.
Aqaba's over there.
It's only a matter of going.
You are mad.
And where are you going, lieutenant?
With 50 of my men.
To work your miracle.
Blasphemy is a bad beginning for such a journey.
- Who told you?
- Ali did.
Why not you?
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?
Yes, I must.
But I will spare these to you.
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my lord.
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.
No.
Since you do know...
...we can claim to arrive in the name of Feisal of Mecca.
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim it.
But in whose name do you ride?
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.
They were here. I caught them.
Why are you here? Boy!
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.
You have been tracking us.
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.
Our camel strayed. We followed her.
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.
Don't do that.
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.
Be warned. They are not suitable.
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.
One shilling, every week?
That is fair.
- Each?
- No.
- That is too much.
- All right.
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.
There is the railway.
And that is the desert.
From here until the other side, no water but what we carry.
For the camels, no water at all.
If the camels die...
...we die.
And in 20 days they will start to die.
There's no time to waste, then, is there?
I was thinking.
You were drifting.
Yes. It will not happen again.
Be warned, you were drifting.
It will not happen again.
That water is wasted.
From now on, we must travel by night...
...and rest while it is too hot to travel.
A few hours each day.
Why don't we start now?
No. We will rest now.
Three hours.
Fine.
I'll wake you.
Do we rest here?
There is no rest now short of water.
The other side of that.
And how much of that is there?
I'm not sure.
But however much, it must be crossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.
This is the sun's anvil.
Have we done it?
No, but we're off the anvil.
Thank God for that anyway.
Yes, thank Him.
Lawrence, I do not think you know how you have tempted Him.
I know.
We've done it.
God willing.
When do we reach the wells?
God willing, midday.
- Then we've done it.
- Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.
Gasim's.
What's happened to him?
God knows.
Why don't you stop?
For what? He will be dead by midday.
We must go back.
What for, to die with Gasim?
In one hour comes the sun.
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!
I can.
Take the boys.
If you go back, you kill yourself, is all.
Gasim you have killed already.
Get out of my way.
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.
Nothing is written!
Go back, then!
What did you bring us here for with your blasphemous conceit?
English blasphemer!
Aqaba?
Was it Aqaba?
You will not be at Aqaba, English!
Go back, blasphemer...
...but you will not be at Aqaba.
I shall be at Aqaba.
That is written.
In here.
English!
English!
Lawrence! Daud!
Nothing is written.
Al Lawrence.
Farraj.
Wash.
Al Lawrence.
Truly, for some men nothing is written unless they write it.
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.
Then when he dies, you too will be a lord.
No.
You have an elder brother.
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.
He didn't marry my mother.
I see.
I'm sorry.
It seems to me that you are free to choose your own name, then.
Yes, I suppose I am.
Al Lawrence is best.
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.
They are the robes of a sherif of the Beni Wejh.
Very fine.
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.
He for whom nothing is written may write himself a clan.
They are good for riding. Try.
What are you doing, Englishman?
As you see.
Are you alone?
Almost.
Are you with those dogs drinking at my well?
Yours?
I am Auda Abu Tayi.
I've heard of another man of that name.
Other? What other?
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to summon help to look after his wells.
He must be a great hero.
He is.
He wouldn't refuse water to men coming out of Nefud Desert.
Now, would he not?
No, that must be some other man.
Here is my help.
Son, what fashion is this?
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?
A Beni Wejh sherif.
And is he Harith?
No, Father, English.
Son...
...they are stealing our water.
Tell them we are coming.
Tell them.
- Empty that!
- Do not!
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.
Harith.
Ali.
Does your father still steal?
No.
Does Auda take me for one of his own bastards?
No. There is no resemblance.
Alas, you resemble your father.
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.
I knew your father well.
Did you know your own?
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?
Why, then you have a blood feud with the Howeitat.
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...
...nor the sultan himself desire that.
Call off your men.
This honours the unworthy.
I've only just begun to teach him.
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?
Be not clever with me, English.
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.
Is he your tongue?
We do desire it.
Then it is given, if you will take it.
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.
But...
...dine with me.
Dine with Auda, English.
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.
It is my pleasure that you dine with me in Wadi Rumm!
This thing you work against Aqaba...
...what profit do you hope from it?
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.
The Harith do not work for profit.
Well, if it is in a man to be a servant, Sherif Ali...
...he could find worse masters than Feisal.
But I...
I cannot serve.
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.
Yes, it is my pleasure.
We do not work this thing for Feisal.
No?
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.
The Arabs?
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.
I have even heard of the Harith.
But the Arabs?
What tribe is that?
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.
Well, they are nothing to me.
My tribe is the Howeitat.
Who work only for profit.
Who work at Auda's pleasure.
And Auda's pleasure is to serve the Turks.
Serve?
I serve?
It is the servant who takes money.
I am Auda Abu Tayi.
- Does Auda serve?
- No!
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!
I carry 23 great wounds, all got in battle.
75 men have I killed with my own hands, in battle.
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.
The Turks pay me a golden treasure, yet I am poor!
Because I am a river to my people.
Is that service?
No.
And yet now it seems Auda has grown old.
And lost his taste for fighting.
It is well you say it in my tent, thou old tulip.
Yet this is a tulip that the Turks could not buy.
Why should they wish to?
Now...
I will tell you what they pay me, and you will tell me if this is...
...a servant's wages.
They pay me, month by month...
...100 golden guineas.
150, Auda.
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.
And a long tongue between them.
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.
A trifle which they take from a great box they have.
In Aqaba.
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?
You trouble me like women.
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.
- For money?
- No.
- For Feisal?
- No!
Nor to drive away the Turks.
He will come...
...because it is his pleasure.
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.
Make God your agent!
Aqaba!
Aqaba!
God be with you.
God be with you.
God be with you.
God be with you.
Yes.
Aqaba.
Tomorrow we will go and get it.
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.
If you are right about the guns.
He killed. He dies.
This is the end of Aqaba.
One of our men murdered Auda's man.
Why?
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.
Ali!
It is an ancient wound.
I didn't come here to watch a tribal bloodbath.
It is the law, Lawrence.
The law says the man must die.
If he dies, will that content the Howeitat?
Yes.
Sherif Ali!
If none of Lord Auda's men harms any of yours...
...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.
Then I will execute the law.
I have no tribe.
And no one is offended.
Gasim.
Did you do it?
Well, Lawrence...
What ails the Englishman?
That that he killed was the man he brought out of the Nefud.
It was written, then.
Better to have left him.
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.
Besides, it was necessary.
You gave life and you took it.
The writing is still yours.
Auda Abu Tayi!
The miracle is accomplished.
Garlands for the conqueror.
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.
I'm none of those things, Ali.
- What, then?
- Don't know.
Thanks.
My God, I love this country.
What!
No gold in Aqaba!
Auda, I found it!
That's a pity.
Ali, get a message down the coast to Yenbo.
Tell Feisal to find boats, any boats...
...and bring the Arab army here to Aqaba, quickly.
And you?
I'm going to tell the generals...
...in Cairo.
Yes, cross Sinai.
Come on!
Sinai?
Yes.
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and said:
"We've taken Aqaba," the generals would laugh.
I see.
In Cairo you will put off these funny clothes.
You'll wear trousers and tell stories of our quaintness and barbarity...
...and then they will believe you.
You're an ignorant man.
Paper.
Paper!
There is no gold in Aqaba.
No gold.
No great box!
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?
For my pleasure, as you said.
But gold is honorable...
...and Lawrence promised gold.
Lawrence lied.
See, Auda.
"The Crown of England...
...promises to pay...
...5000 golden guineas...
...to Auda Abu Tayi."
Signed in His Majesty's absence...
...by...
...me.
In 10 days...
...I'll be back with the gold.
With gold, with guns, with everything.
Ten days.
You'll cross Sinai?
Why not?
Moses did.
And you will take the children?
Moses did.
Moses was a prophet...
...and beloved of God.
He said there was gold here.
He lied.
He is not perfect.
Lord, can we not rest?
I told you, no rest till they know that I have Aqaba.
Have you two slept in beds?
Farraj?
Daud?
With sheets?
Tomorrow the finest sheets in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.
I promise.
Then it shall be so, lord.
Look!
Pillar of fire.
No, lord. Dust.
My compass.
No matter.
If we ride west, we must strike the canal.
Due west.
Come on!
Lawrence!
Farraj!
Farraj, don't! Don't!
Don't!
Why do you walk?
But why, lord?
But why, lord?
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.
Lawrence, look!
It's all right, Farraj.
It's all right.
Who are you?
Who are you?
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.
You taking him in there?
Yes.
Here!
Here. You!
And where the hell do you think you're going to, Mustapha?
We are thirsty.
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.
You can't take him in there, sir.
What do you think you look like?
No, no. You must go.
No, no. Go, effendi, go!
Get out! You must get out! Get out!
We want two large glasses of lemonade.
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.
Corporal, we'll have this one out anyway.
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.
What's going on?
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.
Explain yourself.
We've taken Aqaba.
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.
We have.
He likes your lemonade.
You mean the Turks have gone?
No, they're still there but they've no boots.
Prisoners, sir. We took them prisoners. The entire garrison.
That's not true. We killed some.
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.
There's been a lot of killing one way or another.
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's all perfectly true.
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.
I did it.
You'd better talk to Allenby.
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.
That's a step in the right direction.
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.
Right. You want a bed yourself, don't you?
See Allenby first, though.
Will he see me?
I think so.
Do that, then.
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.
You'd better get into some trousers too.
"Undisciplined.
Unpunctual.
Untidy.
Several languages.
Knowledge of music...
...literature.
Knowledge of...
Knowledge of..."
You're an interesting man, there's no doubt about it.
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.
- Sir.
- Sir.
Then why did you?
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.
True.
And it will be further behind your right when you go for Jerusalem.
Am I going for Jerusalem?
Yes.
Very well.
Aqaba behind my right.
It threatened EI' Arish and Gaza.
Anything else?
Yes.
Aqaba's linked with Medina.
Do you think we should shift them out of Medina now?
No. I think you should leave them there.
You acted without orders, you know.
Shouldn't officers use their initiative at all times?
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.
Yes, I know.
Already?
Yes.
I'm promoting you major.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...
...and carry on the good work.
No. Thank you, sir.
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...
Let me see now...
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.
One was a boy.
That was...
...yesterday.
I led him into a quicksand.
The other was a man.
That was...
...before Aqaba, anyway.
I had to execute him with my pistol.
There was something about it
I didn't like.
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.
No. Something else.
What, then?
I enjoyed it.
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.
What do you mean coming dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?
Yes. Entirely.
Let me see that hat thing or whatever it is.
Fascinating gear they wear.
How would I look in this, Harry?
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.
What I'm trying to say is I don't think I'm fit for it.
Really? What do you think, Dryden?
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said it couldn't be done.
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.
I think you should recommend a decoration, sir.
I don't think it matters what his motives were.
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!
Come on, then.
You're a clever man, sir.
No, but I know a good thing when I see one.
That's fair, surely?
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.
- Bravo.
- You know better?
I fight like Clausewitz, then you fight like Saxe.
We should do very well indeed, shouldn't we?
Easy, gentlemen, please.
- Give us something to drink.
- Of course, sir.
I'm here at the invitation of Major Lawrence.
Tracy.
Shall we go outside?
So you hold bound the Turkish desert army?
Yes.
With 1000 Arabs?
With 1000 Arabs?
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.
Delivered anywhere, day or night.
It means 1000 camels.
That means 1000 packs of high explosives and 1000 crack rifles.
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.
I'll smash his railways.
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.
You are going back, then?
Yes.
Of course I'm going back.
Well, if we can see it, so can the Turk.
If he finds he's using four divisions to fend off a handful of bandits...
...he'll withdraw.
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.
If he gets out now, he'll never get back again.
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.
Arabia's for the Arabs now.
That's what I've told them anyway.
That's what they think.
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.
They've only one suspicion.
That we'll let them drive the Turks out and then move in ourselves.
I've told them that that's false, that we have no ambitions in Arabia.
Have we?
I'm not a politician, thank God.
Have we any ambition in Arabia, Dryden?
Difficult question, sir.
I want to know, sir, if I can tell them in your name...
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.
Certainly.
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.
Right.
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.
More money.
- How much more?
- 25,000 now. A lot more later.
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.
A couple of armoured cars.
Right.
Field artillery.
Right.
I'll give you every blessed thing I can...
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen.
Congratulations!
Are you really going to give them artillery, sir?
I was wondering that, sir.
Might be difficult to get it back.
Give them artillery and you've made them independent.
Then I can't give it to them, can I?
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.
I've got orders to obey, thank God.
Not like that poor devil.
He's riding the whirlwind.
Let's hope we're not.
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?
To Prince Feisal.
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.
You know him though?
He is my master. I am his servant.
Can you read?
Chicago Courier is my paper, but my work is syndicated in America.
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.
Now...
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?
Not altogether, sir, no.
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?
I don't know.
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.
In Mellaha now? They move fast.
They do.
But not so fast as we do, you will find.
Myself...
...I am going to Cairo.
- As you know.
- Yes.
There's work for me there of a different kind.
Yes.
I understand you've been given no artillery.
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?
It restricts us to small things.
It's intended to.
Do you know General Allenby?
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.
Slim customer. It's very good.
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.
Your Highness, we Americans were once a colonial people.
We naturally feel sympathetic to any people...
...who struggle for their freedom.
Very gratifying.
Also, my interests are the same as yours. You want your story told.
I badly want a story to tell.
Ah, now you are talking turkey, are you not?
I will give you a guide and a letter.
And before I leave here...
...which must be presently...
...I will have some facts and figures put on paper for you.
You know that we are destroying the Turkish railways.
I do, sir.
Major Lawrence is in charge of all this, is he?
My army is made up of tribes.
The tribes are led by the tribal leaders.
Your people do think very highly of Major Lawrence?
Oh, yes. And the rightly.
In this country, Mr. Bentley...
...the man who gives victory in battle is prized...
...beyond every other man.
One figure I can give you from my head...
...because it never leaves my head.
Since starting this campaign four months ago, we have lost...
...37 wounded...
...156 dead.
You remark the disproportion between our dead and wounded.
Yeah.
Four times as many.
That's because those too wounded to bring away, we ourselves kill.
We leave no wounded for the Turks.
- You mean?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.
In their eyes, we are not soldiers but rebels.
Rebels, wounded or whole, are not protected by the Geneva Code...
...and are treated harshly.
How harshly?
More harshly than I hope you can imagine.
I see.
Our own prisoners are taken care of until the British...
...can relieve us of them, according to the Code.
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.
Is that the influence of Major Lawrence?
Why should you suppose?
It's just that I heard in Cairo that...
...Major Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.
That is exactly so.
With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion.
With me, it is merely good manners.
You may judge which motive is the more reliable.
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.
Thank you, sir.
Can you manage the letter...?
I'll do everything I have said...
...if you will tell me truly the nature of your interest...
...in my people and Major Lawrence.
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.
Oh, no.
But influential men back home believe it's time for America...
...to lend her weight to the struggle against Germany.
And Turkey.
I've been sent to find material to show our people that this war is...
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.
But to show it in its more adventurous aspects.
You look for a figure who will draw your country towards war.
All right. Yes.
Lawrence is your man.
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Come on, men!
Lawrence!
Good God! God!
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed with a sword before.
Why don't you take a picture?
Wish I had.
How is it with thee, Lawrence?
Am I in this?
Did you take his picture?
Yeah.
You are using up your nine lives very quickly.
Charming company you keep.
Auda?
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks these things will steal his virtue.
He thinks you're a kind of thief.
It's all right to take your picture?
- All right.
- Okay.
Just walk.
Major Lawrence!
Yes, sir, that's my baby.
This looting has got to stop!
It is customary.
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.
I would not say that to Auda.
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.
Well, there's another lot you've seen the last of.
They'll come back.
He says they'll come back.
Will they?
Not this year, Lawrence.
Look, Lawrence, how many men do you think you'll have left? 200?
- Less.
- Well, then?
I said, they'll come back.
You badly hurt?
Not hurt at all.
Didn't you know? They can only kill me with a golden bullet.
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?
I will tell you that when I have a country.
Did I answer well?
You answered without saying anything. That's politics.
You learn quickly.
I have a good teacher.
Yeah.
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.
Before I return to the fleshpots, which I shall be very glad to do...
...may I put two questions to you, straight?
I'd be interested to hear you put a question straight.
One.
What, in your opinion, do these people hope to gain from this war?
They hope to gain their freedom.
Freedom.
"They hope to gain their freedom."
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.
I'm going to give it to them.
- The second question?
- Well, I was going to ask...
...what is it that attracts you personally to the desert?
It's clean.
Well, now...
...that's a very illuminating answer.
May I...
...take one farewell picture?
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.
One clock for two lamps.
A fair bargain.
Fair? I robbed him.
Trash.
I must find something honorable.
Honorable?
The year is running out, Brighton.
I must find something honorable.
Now you may blow up my train.
And what will you do now?
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.
They will carry my toys too, see?
Major Lawrence will campaign this winter.
But you got what you wanted, so you're going home, is that it?
Of course. When Lawrence has got what he wants, he will go home.
When you've got what you want, you will go home.
No, I shan't, Auda.
Then you are a fool.
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.
Give thanks to God, Brighton...
...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.
You are an impudent rascal.
I must go, Lawrence, before I soil myself with a fool's blood.
Like talking to a brick wall.
So what will you do now?
What can you do?
I'll go north.
That's what Allenby wants.
Allenby wanted the Arab army behind Deraa.
Then that's where I'll take it.
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.
Won't we?
Train, Farraj.
Yeah, Lawrence.
Hide yourself, my friend.
Detonator.
All right, fetch another.
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put...
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.
Farraj?
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.
If they take him alive, you know what they'll do to him.
Daud will be angry with you.
Salute him for me.
What will you do now?
Go north.
With twenty?
What would you recommend me to do?
What would you recommend?
He hasn't 1 l10 so many men, sir.
He's lied, in fact.
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have done anything he hasn't done.
Then there is an Arab north army.
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?
No.
He would if he could, I think.
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.
What matters is I believed it.
The Turks believe it.
They are offering 20,000 pounds for him.
Good heavens.
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Whatever else, he's a brave man...
Surely, surely. If he's still going north with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.
I wonder if they'd offer that much for me.
What about next year?
Will they still come back?
I wouldn't be surprised.
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.
One more failure and you will find yourself alone.
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.
So say they love you.
The more reason to be thrifty with them.
Give them something to do that can be done. But you, no.
They must move mountains, walk on water.
That's right. That's right.
Who are you to know what can be done?
If we'd done what you thought could be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.
Whatever I ask them to do can be done. They know that if you don't.
Do you think I'm just anybody?
Do you?
My friends, who will walk on water with me?
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.
Will you take 20 against 2000?
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?
Because I told the English generals...
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa when they'd be in Jerusalem.
Or perhaps you are here...
...for the English generals.
Who says this?
Rumour.
That is not an argument.
Oh, argument.
This afternoon I will take the Arab revolt into Deraa...
...while the Arabs argue.
Can you pass for an Arab in an Arab town?
Yes. If one of you would lend me some dirty clothes.
It's madness.
What are you looking for?
Some way to announce myself.
Be patient with him, God.
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.
Halt!
Walk on.
- Halt!
- Walk on.
You and you.
You.
You have blue eyes.
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.
How old are you?
Twenty-seven, effendi.
I think.
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.
It's an interesting face.
I am surrounded by cattle.
He wouldn't know an interesting face from a sow's belly.
I have been is Deraa now for three and a half years.
If they posted me to the dark side of the moon, I could not be more...
...isolated.
You haven't the least idea what I'm talking about.
No, effendi.
Have you?
No.
That would be too...
...lucky.
Where did you get that?
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.
Yes, you are a deserter.
But from which army?
Not that it matters at all.
A man cannot be always in uniform.
Your skin is very fair.
Beat him.
To me!
Sleep.
Sleep.
Eat.
Eat.
You have a body, like other men.
Good.
Then sleep.
Better?
Much better. You were right.
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?
Oh, I've learned all right.
I'm going, Ali.
- Why?
- Why?
Heavens.
Why?
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.
And the end of the Arab revolt?
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.
You proved it.
Look, Ali. Look.
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.
He can...
...but he can't want what he wants.
This is the stuff that decides what he wants.
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.
- I tried to.
- So would any man.
Well, any man is what I am.
And I'm going back to Allenby to ask him for a job...
...that any man can do.
Allenby's in Jerusalem.
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?
Oh, yes. Easy stages.
Look, Ali, I think I see a way of being just...
...ordinarily...
...happy.
Can I take this?
It is not clean.
No, but it's warm.
And these...
...having led them here, have you no care for them?
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.
And let me go back to mine.
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.
Mind if I join you?
Honoured, sir.
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.
- What's doing out there?
- Where?
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.
Jolly good.
Well, I have to go up there.
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.
Bloody wogs.
Yes, probably.
Jolly good about the squash court.
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?
Morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good to be back.
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.
Hello.
Morning. You're to go right in.
Lawrence.
Or is it Major Lawrence?
Sir.
Well, general, I will leave you.
Major Lawrence doubtless has reports to make...
...about my people and their weakness...
...and the need to keep them in the British interest.
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.
Yes, general, you have lied most bravely, but not convincingly.
I know this treaty does exist.
Treaty, sir?
He does it better than you, general.
But then, of course, he is almost an Arab.
You really don't know?
Then what the devil's this?
It's my request for release from Arabia, sir.
For what reason?
You sure you haven't heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?
No.
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.
Well, now...
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.
Monsieur Picot is a French civil servant.
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met, and they agreed that after the war...
...France and England should share the Turkish Empire.
Including Arabia.
They signed an agreement, not a treaty, sir.
An agreement to that effect.
There may be honour among thieves, but there's none in politicians.
And let's have no displays of indignation.
You may not have known, but you certainly had suspicions.
If we've told lies, you've told half-lies.
And a man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth.
But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it.
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.
You might have told me that, Dryden.
And I want an ordinary job, sir.
That's my reason for resigning.
It's personal.
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.
And as it happens, a damned important one. Are you mad?
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.
That's my reason too.
Look, I'm making my big push on Damascus the 16th of next month...
...and you are part of it.
Can you understand that? You're an important part of the big push!
I don't want to be part of your big push!
What about your Arab friends?
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?
I've told you, I just want my ration of common humanity.
- Lawrence.
- Yes?
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.
Thank you, sir.
Why don't we?
There's blood on your back.
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.
Tell me what happened.
Say, what goes on in there?
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!
- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.
When the war's over, he can be anything he wants.
Yes. Well, at the moment he wants to be somebody else.
Will you kindly allow me to pass?
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.
Always walking away, aren't you?
Well, I'll tell you.
It's a clash of temperament that's going on in there.
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.
I believe your name will be a household word...
...when you'd have to go to the war museum to find who Allenby was.
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.
Leave me alone.
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.
All right, I'm extraordinary.
What of it?
Not many people have a destiny, Lawrence.
It's a terrible thing for a man to flunk it if he has.
Are you speaking from experience?
No.
You're guessing, then.
Suppose you're wrong.
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all...
- The 16th?
- Can you do it?
I'll give you a lot of money.
- Artillery?
- I can't.
They won't be coming for money, not the best of them.
They'll be coming for Damascus.
Which I'm going to give them.
That's all I want.
All you want is someone holding down the Turkish Right.
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.
Tell the politicians to burn their paper now.
Fair enough.
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?
It's going to happen.
I shall want quite a lot of money.
All there is.
Not that much.
The best of them won't come for money.
They'll come for me.
No pictures!
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.
He doesn't mind having his picture taken. He doesn't mind at all.
Well, there's only one Lawrence.
Have you met Major Lawrence since he's come back?
Yes.
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.
What did that Turkish general do to him in Deraa?
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.
What did the English general do to him in Jerusalem?
Search me. Ask Lawrence.
- I did.
- What did he say?
He laughed.
He told me to gather the Harith here.
He offered me money.
Did you take it?
No. But many did.
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.
There is not a man without a price on his head.
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.
The sheiks will hang these men.
These men are mine.
Lawrence, these things know nothing of the Arab revolt.
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.
Aye, but for what?
Sherif, for Lawrence.
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!
Damascus!
Damascus! Damascus!
Damascus! Damascus!
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone through Mazril and Deraa.
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.
If the enemy's retreating in any order, which we'll assume...
Certainly.
He can't be far from Mallud...
...in which case I can have him within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.
Splendid. Philip.
These are the last infantry supports going up now.
But Mallud, we could have the fusiliers there by Wednesday.
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.
Any questions?
This Arab army on the right, sir, what's it consist of?
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.
Where are they now?
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.
Pound them, Charley.
Pound them.
God help the men who lie under that.
They're Turks.
God help them.
Well, he's got the bit between his teeth all right.
Cocky?
More than cocky, sir.
He's got the bit between his teeth all right.
I tell you, sir, I think he'll get to Damascus before we do.
- Unless...
- Unless?
Well, there's a Turkish column in front of him, out of Mazril.
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.
I wonder where they are now.
No prisoners.
Damascus, Lawrence.
Lawrence, not this.
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.
No prisoners.
This was Talaal's village.
Talaal!
Talaal!
No prisoners!
No prisoners!
God.
God.
God!
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!
Major!
Major Lawrence!
Jesus wept.
Jesus wept.
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?
Surely you know the Arabs are a barbarous people.
Barbarous and cruel.
Who but they?
Who but they?
Oh, you rotten man.
Here, let me take your rotten bloody picture.
For the rotten bloody newspapers.
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.
Damascus!
Take them to Sherif Ali.
Tell him.
Remind him.
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.
Tell Sherif Ali that.
They are not ripe.
General salute!
Present arms!
Port arms!
Lawrence is behind it, sir.
The whole town is plastered with the Arab flag.
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.
They've been here a day and a night.
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.
He's set up his own headquarters in the town hall.
What else beside the town hall?
Telephone exchange, post office, powerhouse...
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.
They call themselves the Arab National Council...
...and they're in the town hall.
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.
What should we do about it?
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.
How about that, Dryden?
Not unless you want a full-scale rising.
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?
By special train in two days' time.
Two days.
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.
And Tracey, all troops to remain quartered until further orders.
Does that apply to technical units?
Technical units particularly.
Yes, sir.
Medicals too, sir?
I'm afraid so, Harry.
Medicals too.
We here...
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...
...of the Arab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.
He insulted me.
Sherif Ali said that the telephones are in the care of the Howeitat...
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.
They will not work because they are given no electricity.
The electricity is in the care of the Harith.
If you answer, there will be bloodshed.
You speak to me of bloodshed?
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.
Humbly?
Humbly, Harith?
Yes, humbly.
This is a new trick.
Why is there no electricity?
I have been to that electrical house, Lawrence.
There are three large machines.
He means generators!
So.
One of them is burning.
They are of an incredible size, but helpless.
It is so of all machines.
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.
No. Take English engineers and you take English government.
Take...
Fire has broken out.
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!
Then use the fire brigade!
We have tried, but there is no force in the water.
Then you must carry it.
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?
We will hear petitions this afternoon.
This afternoon!
- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?
All I can say is, sir, it's a heavy responsibility.
Sorry, sir.
Maybe it's the bulb.
No, sir.
It's the power.
They're leaving.
That's it, then.
Marvellous-Iooking beggars, aren't they?
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.
- Come where?
- Back.
I know your heart.
What is it?
Is it this?
I tell you, this is nothing.
Is it the blood?
The desert has dried up more blood than you could think of.
I pray that I may never see the desert again.
Hear me, God.
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.
What about you?
No, I shall stay here and learn politics.
A very low occupation.
I had not thought of it when I met you.
You have tried very hard to give us Damascus.
It's what I came for.
And then...
...it would be something.
Yes.
Much.
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.
- You love him.
- I fear him.
Then why do you weep?
If I fear him, who love him...
...how must he fear himself, who hates himself?
Take your hand away, Howeitat!
So you are not yet entirely politician.
Not yet.
Well, these are new tricks, and I am an old dog.
And Allah be thanked.
I'll tell thee what...
...being an Arab will be thornier than you suppose, Harith.
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.
It comes within the jurisdiction of the Arab Council.
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.
Under any circumstances at all, you must obey your orders.
No, sir, I will not.
Control yourself.
Now, go over to the town hall and see what they say.
We did what we could in the civic hospitals.
But you forgot the Turkish Military Hospital.
It has 600 beds. There are about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.
All of whom are the responsibility of your precious Arab Council.
What's it like?
This is outrageous!
Outrageous!
Outrageous!
You filthy little wog!
My friend Lawrence, if I may call him that.
"My friend Lawrence."
How many men will claim the right to use that phrase? How proudly.
He longs for the greenness of his native land.
He pines for the Gothic cottages of Surrey, is it not?
Already in imagination, he catches trout...
...and all the activities of the English gentleman.
That's me you're describing, sir, not Colonel Lawrence.
You're promoted colonel.
Yes. What for?
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin to yourself on the boat home.
Then, thank you.
Well, then...
...Godspeed.
There's nothing further here for a warrior.
We drive bargains. Old men's work.
Young men make wars, and the virtues of war...
...are the virtues of young men.
Courage and hope for the future.
Then old men make the peace.
And the vices of peace are the vices of old men.
Mistrust and caution.
It must be so.
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.
The powerhouse, the telephone exchange, these I concede.
The pumping plant I must retain.
If you retain it, there will be no water.
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.
I shall not, and if your men attempt it, my men will resist it.
- Have you men?
- Enough of that.
It's a thing that makes an ugly incident.
I'm sure your government...
...does not wish to appear at the peace conference as an aggressor.
I say!
It's Lawrence, isn't it?
May I shake your hand, sir?
Just want to be able to say I'd done it, sir.
Haven't we met before?
Don't think so, sir.
No, no, sir, I should remember that.
It is widely known the Arab Council took power in my name.
They have no power. It's illusory.
Illusions can be very powerful.
Particularly...
...when they take this form.
The world is delighted at the picture of Damascus...
...liberated by the Arab army.
Led, may I remind you, by a British-serving officer.
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence is a sword with two edges.
We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?
I thought I was a hard man, sir.
You are merely a general.
I must be a king.
Excuse me, sir.
Well?
Well...
...it seems we're to have a British waterworks...
...with an Arab flag on it.
Do you think it was worth it?
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.
Yes, sir.
So you keep saying.
You, I suspect...
...are chief architect of this compromise.
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.
Well, sir. Going home.
Home, sir.
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you
Though it breaks my heart to go
THE RHINE, GERMANY 1945
Third Troop, Fourth Musketeers.
Come on, come on.
Move yourselves.
Third Troop, Fourth Musketeers.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Third Troop, Fourth Musketeers.
(shot)
Inflating parties forward.
(releases air valve)
Embark!
Follow me.
Paddles out.
Prepare to paddle.
Paddle.
(gun cocks)
Yes, during the war,
I was a Musketeer myself.
We had one young John Thomas ostensibly commanding.
More myself was the backbone, of course.
Of a dark night, many of our officers... (clicks)
...by some of their own men. You had to.
- (cash till rings)
- Yes, I will, squire.
Yeah, that's right, you was there.
After breakfasting in Paddington, we was transferred to the Second Army for Rhine and Other Rivers.
Ours was an infantry role though many of us could swim only loosely, if at all.
- It was a complete cock-up.
- 144177 Musketeer Brazier S.
No, no, how I won the war.
The memoirs of Lieutenant Ernest Goodbody.
("Auf Wiedersehen, Sweetheart")
Auf Wiedersehen
Auf Wiedersehen
We'll meet again, sweetheart
This lovely day
Has flown away
The time has come
To part
(screams)
We'll kiss again
Like this again
Don't let the teardrops start
With love that's true
I'll wait for you
Auf Wiedersehen, sweetheart
I'll tell you nothing but my name, rank and number.
My number is 131313.
Lieutenant of Musket Ernest Goodbody.
It all started in 1939.
I suppose it did for you too.
But then first things first.
War is without doubt the noblest of games.
Finer, I think, Corporal of Musket.
Corporal of Musket Transom, my troop sergeant and a good all-rounder.
Stay there. You, Juniper, you're perfect where you are. Very square.
Musketeer Juniper, a joy to have on any team, one of the original BEFs.
What they really thought of me,
I shall never know.
- I thought he was bleeding rubbish.
- I thought he was a bleeding tart.
Can I have you right out there in the country, Gripweed?
Musketeer Gripweed, without whom these memoirs would never have been written.
My faithful batman.
May I rub your ball, sir?
It gives me pleasure.
- Musketeer Drogue, I die in North Africa.
- Please.
We're gonna hang out the washing on the Siegfried Line
I rallied to the flag in October 1939 and was immediately selected as officer potential.
Every word of this film is written in pencil in my own handwriting.
I owe my introduction to the art of war
to my instructors at No.212 OCTU.
In particular,
1431 Lieutenant Colonel Grapple,
later to be known as Grapple
of the Bedoo, who impressed me no end.
I took care to talk as far back
in the mouth as possible,
being a grammar school lad...
which made no difference.
I've always been treated
by the army as top drawer.
- (affected laughter)
- What did you say?
(laughs) Sir...
Never underrate the wily Pathan.
We are going onto the wily Pathan and the use of anti-gas carpet.
- Ya... Ya...
- The Pathan lives in India.
India is a hot, strange country, full of wily Pathans up to wily things.
Which is why I always wear spurs, even in cold weather.
My advice is to keep your rifle strapped to a suitable portion of your body.
A leg is good. Otherwise, the wily Pathan will strip himself naked, grease himself all over, slippery as an eel, make off with your rifle, which is a crime. Any questions?
- Or can we take gas?
- Has the Pathan gone over to Hitler, sir?
- Grammar school boy?
- Sir.
No, he has not.
Too wily for that, the wily Pathan.
Then shall we be fighting him in this war, sir?
Of course, the British army has always fought the wily Pathan.
Stripped naked under the tent brailings like a snake, he is.
- Why?
- Why what?
We want to get on to gas.
It may save your life one day.
Why has the British army always fought the wily Pathan?
He's just like you, a damn troublemaker.
What's your name?
How did you get into OCTU not knowing your history?
God help your men.
They'll be torn apart by the wily Pathan.
See your dugouts.
Stand by your dugouts. Stand to. Dig in.
To beat the Hun, dig in then break through with sword and lance. I think.
Do your best, eh? That's good...
- Body, sir. This is.
- That's very good, Body.
- It is rather wet inside, sir.
- I know it is.
That smell. That smell.
Light the little candle, eh?
This is where the war will be fought.
War of movement, my bum.
Sit down, Body.
Thank you, sir.
You're going to be an officer, young Body.
- I wonder if you know what that means.
- I think so, sir.
- What does it mean, Body?
- It means my mother will be pleased, sir.
I worry about your men, Body.
That's what being an officer means.
You know... I think you know how England is fixed at the moment.
It's not a question of money, sir.
I'll serve for nothing.
Tell me about yourself...
What I hope I'm saying about England is that we have no submachine guns, no rimless cartridges, percussion grenades, field artillery, no tanks much, no anti-tanks ever, no dive bombers, no bombs, and we invented shrapnel.
Knew him well... His son.
I can't, I fear, I can't march properly on my own as an officer in the public eye.
Isn't that sickening when that happens to a chap?
Couldn't your drill instructor do something?
A quick jab up the crutch.
With a broom?
"They're Coming."
"They're Coming" by EC Grapple MC VD.
And scar.
"They're Coming."
They're coming from the shires
Coming from the byres
They're coming from the cities and towns
They're coming from the factories
They're coming from the farms...
- You married?
- No, I play the harmonica.
I'm coming after you civil reservists to see if you can remember about rifles and thumbs down the seams of your slacks, into your pink civvy thoughts with my big black boots, bearing a big, black, knobbly stick.
So take a hold of yourselves. Stand still.
- Face your front.
- I am.
Squad, 'shun!
- Down them rifles.
- Rifles!
- Splinter.
- Slope arms.
Two, three, across...
- Hands...
- Down!
(Transom) Throw them rifles.
- Will advance.
- Front, Clapper.
- Splinter.
- By the right, quick march.
Left, right, left, right, left...
(Grapple) Coming dressed in overalls...
- Retire. About.
- Coming with umbrellas...
- Coming bringing gifts...
- Turn!
Stand still. Those two men, about.
Don't speak to me like that.
I'm a married man.
About turn.
By the right, quick march.
What's this? Halt.
Stand still. Never, ever have I seen such a sight.
- Am I hurting you?
- No.
I should be. I'm standing on your hair.
- Who said that?
- Is this North Africa?
- Catterick.
- Marching like idiots.
- Never...
- In all my life!
It really is only a question of getting the right leg to respond to my brain.
Move to the right in threes.
- Wait for it.
- Where are you going? Still.
- It's no good to me.
- My finger. There's a splinter.
- Right in threes. Right turn.
- Would you go sick?
- I want to fight.
- That's the spirit.
- Who's the one in the flat hat?
- Baden-Powell.
Fall in, you.
On the command, move. Move.
Don't look at him, look at me.
If you look at him,
I'll give you to him.
You can be put into his hands.
You can spend your life with such as him.
- Oh...
- Brain, brawn and guile...
They're coming dressed in overalls
Coming dressed in tweed...
To the front, salute.
- As you were.
- Hit them rifles.
You won't break them.
To the front, salute!
Of skin and guts and fortitude
Of brain and brawn and guile
And what is more, they're yours, young man
See you do well by them.
(piano flourish)
(sparse applause)
(Goodbody) I'll never forget the moment
I was appointed to my first command.
No...
- Oh...
- Him!
Squad, 'shun.
- We're all going to die.
- I'm gonna die in North Africa.
Come, now, be fair.
Not all of us, Corporal of Musket.
- There will be survivors.
- (machine gun)
Many of us, even, will survive training.
It's personal. Can I speak to you on a personal matter?
Personal? Keep your rear down.
It's her, sir. She's getting stuffed the jacksy off her by the man from the Pru.
Jacksy?
That is posterior, that is.
Some spy says he gets his hoggins every Monday, regular as dick, along with the 18d funeral policy.
- Hoggins?
- Is it right, sir?
- Is he intimate?
- He's no friend of mine, sir.
I ask you, in all conscience, is it right that a serviceman is forced to carnal knowledge for the insurance?
No, no, decidedly not.
I'll do anything you advise, sir.
Well, Clapper, is your good lady wife a willing partner to this hoggins?
No, sir. It's this damn war.
It's got her excited.
And him, he's suave.
- Go on.
- Not in my silk stockings!
Here, you've brought your child's gas mask.
Oh, no, not in front of your child's gas mask.
Well, Clapper, lapse the policy.
It's yours, isn't it?
Good. Then lapse it. You don't need a funeral policy in the army.
You get the last post.
My word.
Then the insurance will not call on a Monday for his hoggins.
My life. What you've saved is my life and my honey pot.
Do you mind if I gives a jump of admiration here, sir?
Dirty bleeder. He'll have to entertain somewhere else to obtain satisfaction.
Hold on, I'll rescue you, Clapper.
We didn't all die.
I often didn't feel well.
But I put a brave face on it
and we were soon sent to Egypt,
it seemed at the time,
where I volunteered myself. Didn't we all?
What the bloody hell are you doing here?
I'm here, sir, at your convenience.
Ernest.
I know the names of all my men, sir.
Come over here.
Your eyes are bright.
- My knees are brown, sir.
- Nice, I've got brown knees.
You'd like to get away from here,
Ernest, wouldn't you? See some action.
- My sole ambition, sir.
- I know.
Ernest, I want you to take your troop of musketeers and go and do this job for me.
If you do it well, you need never hang around on street corners again.
You can go away and do stirring things.
Would you like that?
Oh, sir.
Sir, I'd give my right arm and leg.
It's not you, sir.
I'm not bored with you. I love you.
In a strict metaphorical way of speaking, as it were.
I'd give them my arm and leg.
Damn sporting of you, sir.
The lads will be chuffed.
- (gulps)
- I gulped.
I used to gulp like a fish every time a general touched me.
One time, when I was a subaltern...
Nice eyes.
We are exchanging bubblegum cards.
We are staff officers.
- Have you got Dunkirk?
- Toby's got Dunkirk.
There's a lot of Dunkirk about.
Ghastly colours.
- I do a bit of Sunday painting myself.
- I want School Bombing.
- We know what you want, Toby.
- I want School Bombing.
- (laughter)
- Not much doubt about morale here, eh?
It's funny when the killing starts.
Some of them don't like it.
That's where you come in. I want you to set up an advanced area cricket pitch.
Did you think you can do that?
Can you read a map?
239451 or thereabouts, near an oasis.
Get some grass if you can.
Doesn't matter if you can't.
I want it first class, and I want it in September.
That means you have three days from the time you land behind enemy lines.
It's got to be a good pitch because a very important bod is going to see it.
- How much is she?
- Does she take bully beef?
He's going to come up out of the torment of the noblest of games and hear the sharp click of leather on willow.
Ah, with his weary soldier boys.
That'll show them, bring their tails up.
Show this very important bod just how high the British soldier can get his tail.
Yes, I want it first class and in three days.
That doesn't give you much time.
I want you to go all out.
Will you go all out for me?
Just remember my standing orders.
Usual thing.
Let no man surrender if he is wounded and can fight.
- Need I say more?
- No, sir.
And thank you, sir, for your faith.
I'll do what I can to tire her out, sir, so these young soldiers don't get hurt.
Hey, hey, hey. It's a dangerous job and it's an important job.
The next three days are not going to be a picnic.
I want you to come to me not only as a troop leader - and it is a good troop - but also as a friend.
Should you have any doubts, problems, do not hesitate to come to me.
I want you to feel you can come to me for help as you would your own father.
Hello, Dad, Mum's been looking all over the shop for you.
Back! Mines!
Reverse engines!
(yells)
Hard astern.
To me, sir! Troop!
Good job I saw that. Good job, eh?
Very heavily mined, you'll find, I'm sure.
We're best out of here.
To me.
Rally to me, Third Troop.
If it is humanly possible.
I shouldn't be left on my own.
I can't win a war on my own.
I'm rather too young.
I feel I'm folding up like a telescope.
I hold the DSO. I do hold the DSO, after all.
- Commando?
- No.
On your feet.
(speaks German)
Come inside.
You are Number 1331490?
Lieutenant Ernest Goodbody of His Majesty's Brigade of Musketeers.
Huh? Educated at Wellington and Marlborough.
Before the war, a solicitor in the firm of Nicholas, Collins & Osgood.
- Am I right?
- No. Sir.
The name is right, but all the rest is wrong.
Oh, well, just a guess.
We are not all supermen.
(whistles)
Home is favourite. You wouldn't want us making a nuisance of ourselves out there.
- Use your initiative.
- I ain't got none.
- Come on. Off, Pongo.
- Matelot! Whose bloody side are you on?
It's a great gamble for a great stake and I pray to God that it comes off.
- I like a game of cricket myself.
- Don't you know there's a war on, jack?
Oh, come on, don't give me that.
The sea has always bred heroes.
At the battle of Trafalgar, one of the
French captains had both legs blown off.
- And he directed his men to the end.
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- More than my job's worth.
- Mount, come on. Juldi/ Drivers, start up!
We do have some drivers, don't we?
Well, who drove them on? I did.
Clutch in, move gear, pedal down, clutch out, now all together.
(all) Clutch in, move gear, pedal down, clutch out.
Very good.
Come on, come on. Give me some speed.
Put that brake on.
Clutch. Don't get too near the man in front.
It's working.
It this absolutely North Africa?
Because I'd like you to have my best boots.
I don't want your best boots.
Gear in. Accelerator down. Best boots(!)
No, they're good lads.
They'd follow you anywhere.
Hark at them, gazing on me with their trusting little eyes.
- Sir.
- Shufty.
My feet's wet, sir. Sir, my feet's wet.
- It's disgusting. They are manky.
- Well, they're yours.
- You gave them toys.
- Yours.
I haven't been able to command respect since before the war.
Right, stop! Stop!
Stop!
Then they're Mr Goodbody's, who we seem to have mislaid.
We'll do our best to find him. I'm gonna shoot the bleeder, dropping me in it.
Out, Gripweed. Handbrake on.
Come here.
- Is your feet, Gripweed, wet?
- No.
You're giving me lies.
Goodbody will want to see your feet.
- They dried.
- Then you best get them wet again. Move!
- At the double.
- At the double.
- Anybody else?
- Left, right, left, right...
- (horn)
- Sarge!
(horn blares)
I'll teach you to try to put the blame on me.
That was a nasty moment.
Right, all together now.
- Mr Goodbody, sir.
- (all) Mr Goodbody, sir.
(all) Mr Goodbody! Mr Goodbody, sir!
Peter Nan Oboe...
Peter Nan Oboe... Peter Nan Oboe...
Netting call, net now.
Seen any Musketeers swanning about, trooper?
Come here.
Come here.
All stations, report my signal.
Peter Nan Oboe... Peter Nan Oboe...
Fourth Muskets, aren't you?
Been expecting you.
- Blue, white and two reds.
- I'm green, green, green, sir.
Oh, I know you are.
Well, keep out of my way until the pitch is ready to play.
Peter Nan Oboe...
Hello, all stations, report my signal.
- Where are they?
- Who, sir?
- The Bedoo, my wily Arabs.
- I've lost contact with my men too, sir.
- Oh, brew, sir?
- Treating them right? No!
- They think the world of me.
- They should be up here then.
- No brew.
- Bum on. On to Tripoli.
Uh...
- Come on.
- I was wondering, sir, a lift.
Sir... I...
Bum on. Bum on.
- Oh, it's gonna hurt, Flo.
- Damn, damn!
Get me another vehicle.
Come on, come on, come on.
- Ah!
- I'll take one of yours. Come on, come on!
- Come on, come on!
- Where've you been?
Get out. Come on, come on.
Get out.
Looking after their feet, are you, boy?
See they get plenty of tea.
Curious thing, that, give the British soldier plenty of tea, and he'll die for you.
Of course, I'm a poet.
I expect things. I love the desert.
You took me for an ignorant old fire-eater.
No. I'm sleeping with the desert.
Not unusual. Pat a white rump in the desert and you'll startle an Englishman.
The Englishman loves the desert.
- You?
- I'm trying, sir.
Er, I play the piano. Not boasting.
Just a fact, that's all. Working class.
I think you should. Look after their feet, boy. They can't be trusted with their feet.
Feet and brew-ups and you'll find you can do anything with him.
Keep a tight rein on his habits.
Those of a pig, mostly.
But even a pig has his moment. Carries the blue ribbon. Don't despise your men.
They've given me a good life so don't despise them. Here.
Share these out amongst them.
- Remember me, Grapple of the Bedoo.
- I won't bloody remember you.
- He used to be a fascist, sir.
- It takes all sorts.
Fascism is something you grow out of.
I tried to change the world myself.
Doesn't do. I wouldn't think anything of you if you hadn't been a fascist.
Keep them at it so they don't have time for dirty things.
Come on, young fella, you've only got three more days.
No time for poetry.
(bugle)
- There goes a very gallant gentleman.
- Oh, I know, sir, like you, sir.
Thank you, sir, for not holding fascism against me.
I was a great mate of Mosley's. I held his voice for him while he lost his meetings.
Hey, hey, I'd just like to say a few words.
Move, now.
I want to say how pleased I am...
How pleased I was when I heard that I was going to lead you on this dangerous and important task.
I've always thought that when the time came, we'd all get on splendidly together.
Bravery, things like that.
(yells)
When I was told I was to be your troop leader, I had a little weep and a laugh.
I do know we're all going to get on splendidly together.
- You play ball with me...
- (men) And I'll play ball with you.
(all) You do your bit and I'll do mine.
We're all members of the same team, each playing our part in the fight for freedom and democracy.
Never surrender. Work hard. Train hard.
Play hard. And kill hard.
Don't take it too hard.
(Grapple) Look after your lads. They're no
good to me if their feet aren't up to snuff.
It hurts, Flo.
It is impossible to tell all the touching and heroic stories of courage and patience...
- It hurts, Flo.
- Run them under the cold tap, love.
It is indeed a lovely sight.
Thank you, sir, it is my best part.
- Corporal of Musket!
- Can I put my shirt on now, sir?
Have you seen it?
It is indeed a lovely sight.
Corporal of Musket, look at it.
Will you be available for stag, sir?
If you will be taking your turn on guard,
I'd suggest first stag and me on last, making sure you was fresh for command on the off at the most likely times.
Pro tem, you can say no, I'll have you down for mine being off at the first light.
Think we ought to green, green, green?
- Not unless you want bang, bang, bang.
- In the sky? Send up the Union Jack!
White and two reds...
That's very like the Colonel, which reminds me...
If you do take a stag, sir, that's one hour each, unless you keep the wireless open, making the operator unavailable for guard.
- That's me.
- Wireless silence, Corporal of Musket.
What have we got a wireless for, then?
We can't have wireless silence without a wireless, can we, Spool?
Do come in, Corporal of Musket.
Of course I'll take my turn. That goes without saying. Put me down for last stag.
- Gripweed.
- Sir?
Green, green, green.
Well, our officer calls me up and he says,
"Musketeer Gripweed..."
He was a tall chap.
Some would call him weedy. I did.
He said to me, and bear in mind we were a few hundred miles behind enemy lines,
"Green, green, green" so I did.
(shots)
What...?
(speaks German)
Gr黱, gr黱, gr黱? Weg/
These were given to me by a very gallant gentleman.
- I want to see all feet before we move.
- I think that was a mistake, sir.
Why, Corporal Dooley?
Have they been neglecting their feet?
- Have you?
- Get away from those vehicles.
(shouts)
(explosion)
Dooley, hitch that roller up.
- That's a relief.
- (all) That's a relief.
- Is this still North Africa?
- What?
Brew-up, sir?
You see why those lorries burnt so well and exploded - nay, came apart - that's petrol and lubricants, which is very difficult to get in war.
- Not for the British army. Or doctors.
- Right.
All we're getting on with now is casualties.
Report me casualties.
Ammo, water, petrol remaining.
One, have we got enough to get to the oasis - which we will - is a point?
Two days, Corporal of Musket.
Two, dip for remaining fuel,
Corporal Dooley.
What's this?
That's a coward, sir.
We were bound to have one.
You can tell by the sweat and the mess on his uniform.
- Not a pretty sight, is he, sir?
- He's taking all his clothes off.
Now, stop this. That.
- Will you take my horse, sir?
- (canned laughter)
Take no large notice, sir.
He is working what is known as ticket.
It keeps the lads amused.
Pick those bits up, Gripweed.
- Where's your tin hat, Juniper?
- Losing by neglect, sir.
If I catch you without it again,
I'll ram it down your throat.
Losing one mess tin.
- Did you have your name on it?
- Scratched on.
- Pull these men together.
- Scratched on?
- Scored it.
- You disfigured government property?
Six days Royal Warrant.
March him off, Musket Major. Two men.
You ought to camouflage up, sir, or get the scrim up if you're stopping.
Us in our vest are exposed to all manner of nastiness.
I'm going to explode, but I won't.
I think the roller, don't you?
- Bayonet. Where's your bayonet?
- Must have left it sticking in the enemy.
- Where's your spur?
- Left it in the horse.
- Two men.
- (canned laughter continues)
- There, on the end of my finger.
- Finger?
- Musketeer Juniper, where's your finger?
- Left it up the Khyber Pass.
Self-inflicted injury.
March him off, Musket Major. Wait for it!
Two men.
I'm going away. I'm going to walk a few paces backwards.
And I'm going to take a bearing, out of earshot.
I am... right now.
Me. And when I get back,
I want that man in there out of there... where I command from, with all his clothes on.
And I want the roller limbered up for moving.
With all his clothes on.
PDQ.
- That's a relief.
- That's a relief.
Excuse me, sir. Sorry, sir.
That's a relief.
Two men.
Mount!
- It's for your own good, lad.
- Let me out.
Let me out.
- Will you put this on?
- No. Bloody let me out.
I wish I had 20 like you, Corporal Dooley.
Do you think you ought to go sick?
Driver, advance.
(theme from "Lawrence Of Arabia")
Get your cable out, Gripweed.
Get this half-track back.
Drogue, records for the regimental magazine.
Right reverse. Come on.
Back, back, back, back. Right!
Come on, hitch it on.
Cable attached, Gripweed?
Right, forward.
Sorry, the gears look all alike.
Smile, please.
- That's a relief.
- That's a relief.
Dig the officer out.
(theme from "Lawrence Of Arabia")
- Brew-up, sir?
- I think so, yes.
Can you read a map, Corporal of Musket?
This is the Via Balbia.
Now, there is where...
There... we get our petrol from.
- We take it from a German petrol dump.
- Very good, sir.
That man, stand still.
- Clapper.
- Me?
You're improperly dressed.
- Best boots in for repair, sir?
- Do your button up, lad. You're idle.
- Oh, ta.
- Entertaining the troops.
My wife - large girl - works in a caff.
Biggest chips in the business.
There have been too many unwounded prisoners taken.
Don't let it happen again.
Cut your throats next time.
Talking of throats, my wife. I took her to the station to see the engines shunt.
Christmas, lovely girl, do you know what she had in her stocking?
Legs, all the way up.
- He's mad.
- No, he's not, sir.
Working his ticket. It's inevitable.
You, when you find yourself surrounded by the enemy with no hope of survival, you must organise yourself into a defensive locality and hold out.
I will.
By doing so, you will add enormously to the enemy's difficulties.
I'd like to add to the enormous enemy...
I've never been a bother.
You will also save yourself spending the rest of the war years in the bag.
I mean, the box. Prisoner-of-war camp.
Sitting there, going... (repeated ticks)
Let us go into the ring in this, our first round, with the light of battle in our eyes and the strength of the righteous in our hearts.
- He's not mad.
- Yes, he is, sir.
Keep the first three rows for the officers.
- Sir. Tea, sir? Thank you, sir, tea, sir.
- (Juniper) Take my wife.
You, the commanding officer! You look as if you're suffering from bottle fatigue.
- The man's mad, eh?
- No, he's not, sir.
Working his ticket.
Put him somewhere, he might cop one.
- I want to fight.
- Good lad.
Is that a linear belt? It's very nice.
Yes, well. Put some clothes on and we'll see, eh?
Ah! This damn sand.
When will it ever end?
You see, the thing about fighting a desert war is that it is a clean war.
Without brutality. Clean-limbed, without dishonourable actions on either side.
Number 18, concerning the weather.
What wretched, filthy, glorious, disappointing weather we are having.
And there are no civilians in the desert.
Except me. I'm a civilian.
But what am I then?
Well, try as I may, I can't see you queuing for a number eight bus, jingling your fourpence.
That's because I'm German.
(speaking German)
I think you are a civilian.
Yes, certainly I am.
Don't be put off by the clothes we wear.
We only wear these for fighting in.
I expect I've grown out of my Harris tweeds by now.
Putting it that way, I think we all are.
Yes, I think underneath we are all blameless.
- Hey, Franz, you are a civilian.
- A civilian?
"Thank Christ for that" he said, laying down his rifle and going home, so helping to perpetuate the dangerous myth that soldiers don't like war.
Which they do.
It's a strange thought to think that this will be the last world war fought by civilians.
I find it strange.
It'll make a nice change to stick a bayonet into a chap rather than a rotten old sandbag.
You'll be all right, lad.
I'm not going. Let him nick his own petrol.
I've got a young wife.
(all mutter)
- Now, see, lads, there's more to it, eh?
- (discontent increases)
There's lots of satisfaction to be had out of the anticipation.
There's lots of fun and letting off steam.
It's not all death.
There's lots of fun to be had out of other things as well.
Now, come on, let's take a look at you.
- (clamour)
- Hang on a minute.
Can't let you down with dirty nails, can we?
Right. Crews front. Get fell in.
(shouting)
- Don't say or tell them anything.
- My wife is young.
If you say anything, whisper, so they won't know.
- Happy, shed a tear, entertained.
- I haven't got a wife yet. I've never done it.
I'll stick my bayonet up the jacksy of the first who talks loud of love and wives and children - I've got children.
I play the piano.
I'm not fighting this war for them.
Now, then, first one to look wonky will get my boot up his dirtbox.
I die now in North Africa.
I've been crying, telling you.
Don't ask, don't threaten, don't plead, keep it shut.
- I'm not a thief.
- Now, then, you're all clean for gangrene.
Don't loose me down. If we should be stonked, get away from the vehicles.
I want to see you back here, clean, bright and spent.
Keep it wrapped, don't do anything I wouldn't. There's transport if you want it.
If you're picked up, tell them you're a Guardsman.
Hands out of your pockets.
Top hats will not be worn.
No fish and chips in uniform.
Parade... Parade, turn.
- Parade ready for your inspection, sir.
- Thank you, Corporal of Musket.
- Musketeer Drogue, isn't it?
- I'd like you to have my blessing.
Don't worry too much. Very good turnout.
There's been marvellous advances in surgery, thanks to war.
- Well done, Musketeer Drogue. Black up.
- (quacks)
You can't make me fight.
No, but we can put you where your decision might prove fatal. Pieces of jam.
Right, mount.
I don't know your name but I'd like you to have my camera.
Orders, information enemy, nil.
Information own troops. We are...
(all) Third Troop of the Fourth Muskets
acting in an independent role as infantry,
lorried behind the enemy lines
with sports equipment.
(Goodbody) Intention.
(all) We shall, under cover of darkness,
occupy a position
overlooking the enemy encampment.
We will then attack
and destroy the enemy for his petrol.
I spy with my little eye something beginning with G.
Method. Corporal Dooley, with one LMG, will move forward to high ground at 1.00 o'clock from my present position.
(all) The rest of the troop,
under my command,
will crawl to a point - figures -
100 yards in front of the objective
where they will wait for the LMG
to get into position.
The signal for the LMG to open fire
shall be green, green, green.
The LMG shall cease firing
when the main attack is mounted
and is within - figures -
50 yards of the objective.
We will consolidate on the objective.
We shall not take prisoners.
If we pull together, with true British pluck and team spirit, we shall, with the help of the Almighty God of battles, win his just victory over the forces of evil.
Good luck. I'm a little duck so let's get quacking into battle.
- Come on.
- Eh?
Who's the Almighty God of battles?
Jesus, is it?
That's right. It will be. Jesus.
Clapper, I'd like you to have my watch.
(shouting in German)
Command, forward!
Come on! Come on!
Forward!
(Goodbody) Follow me!
(speaking German)
(shouting in German)
Where are you going, lad?
Why don't you make the best of it?
It can be fun. Some have the best of their life in the army.
(screaming/canned laughter)
A rout! A disgraceful rout.
Get fell in. Let's see your bayonets.
Have them out, have them out.
Why are you laughing, Drogue?
Wipe that smile off your face.
Let's see 'em, at the end of your hype - not waving about like a hampton searching for a hand.
What do we wear in our caps?
Does it need cleaning, Juniper?
- Yes, it does.
- Look at them all, shining bright.
Fancy me fighting filthy like that.
An old chubby duster like me.
Might have got gangrene from that.
I'll have it out with my servant.
Filthy! Get a tube, siphon petrol from the gin palace and fill up the half-track.
- That's you out of mischief.
- Look at them all, shining bright.
- I want them stinking.
- Corporal of Musket.
Condensed milk.
About all you're good for, sticking it in tins.
Your badge represents the regiment and the regiment represents all of us.
You, me, all of us here today.
- A dirty badge is a disgrace.
- They shouldn't be clean.
Shining bright? Two days, for having a dirty bayonet.
- They shouldn't be clean.
- They should be sticky with blood.
What did you return with?
- I got some pretty things.
- No, no.
I want to see you coming back on the high port, grinning.
With blood running down arms, dripping from elbows.
I don't care whose blood it is.
Stick it in your mate.
Let's have it used. I hate waste.
See. See mine.
It represents your father, mine, his before that.
It represents battles fought and won years ago.
Battles fought so that we could live as we wanted to, long before the Americans were even thought of.
They didn't invent living, you know.
It represents tradition, Musketeer.
And I for one won't stand for a dirty tradition.
Get the nonsense out of them.
I tried to get you interested.
You'll have to learn the hard way.
Squad, 'shun!
High port.
At the throat, point in!
Out! En garde. Shout it, Clapper.
- In, out, en garde!
- Let's hear from you.
Can I see you for a moment, personal, sir?
- What?
- It's the butcher this time, sir.
With his steak and his mutton.
She'll do anything for extra.
(soldiers) Left nipple, right groin/
Left nipple, right groin/
Is it now the butcher which is carrying out intimacy at your home address?
- (all) In, out, en garde.
- Is it right, sir?
- Is it right a butcher should...
- (all) Whip it out!
- (all) Whip it in!
...while her husband is away fighting?
- (all) And wipe it.
- At the throat, jab. Shout it, Clapper.
At the throat, jab!
At the throat, jab! At the throat, jab!
- Kill him. Kill the bleeder.
- At the throat, Gripweed!
- How's this for openers?
- (engine)
Now, watch closely.
I am about to demonstrate the correct use of the identification triangle.
Oblique, middle and near east.
Oblique, yellow.
Each platoon, troop or tactical unit will detail one man to carry the triangle at all times.
Now watch closely, Clapper, because in future you will be the triangle man.
But any one of you might be called upon to be conversant with the triangle.
So watch closely.
You won't get another chance.
It is tied under the chin, like so.
On the approach of a friendly aircraft, the bearer stands in a prominent position and displays the triangle thus.
- Where's the roller gone?
- (machine gun)
Gripweed, have you stolen the roller?
Where's that roller gone?
This is the last straw.
That is it. No one move from this spot.
There'll be no more leave, late-night passes until that roller is returned.
I get you all clean, fit, ready for fighting and what do you do?
There'll be no more privileges.
I'll stop this petty thieving.
And, Gripweed, what's more, who's had my Brylcreem?
- You?
- Never touch the stuff, I'm excused hair.
There! Italian recreation eyeties!
You can't put a bloody thing down.
There is a code, you know. Scavengers.
Sticks in my craw. I can take most things but stealing I draw the line at.
Here we are, fighting the most desperate war in history, and a few wop adventurers act the giddy goat.
I've seen your sort fumigated.
If a wop can be fumigated.
To think they once handed out ice cream wafers.
To think you once handed out cornets on a Sunday afternoon.
Is there no damn decency left in you?
No respect for the property of others?
Play your ridiculous game but don't expect us to take any notice of you.
Grown men in shorts! I'm pretty incensed.
It's one of the most shocking things in the war.
It's a shame the Italian nation has to be brought into disrepute by the lunatic actions of a pitiful few fascist pimps.
And let that be a lesson to you!
(engine cuts out)
Well done! Oh, very well done!
- (cheering)
- Italia/
The tide is turning.
Our very first real victory.
The beginning of the end for the Boche.
I think the tide is turning. I do!
You got him, Tranners! I do!
- Wasn't he one of ours?
- Here's one of mine.
- Go on, get him.
- Let that be a lesson to you.
- Shoot your own officers.
- You can't leave a thing lying around.
There's nobody to be trusted in total war.
Well done, though.
Our first real victory. The writing on the wall. We're coming back, Adolf.
The tide has turned.
Come on, Gripweed. The army didn't bring you to admire the view.
There's a job to be done and precious little time.
You two check for damage.
Juniper, put that petrol in the half-track.
Empty your water bottles into the roller.
We need the weight.
Come on, Clapper, stop daydreaming.
Tell the wife to drop the butcher and become a vegetarian. That's my advice.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, you've saved my life again, sir.
Then he won't be round tempting her with his buckshee mutton.
Bloody waste of time. Soft git.
I know it's a long way.
I know it's not glamorous as a job.
I know there are others doing jobs in this war that are more glamorous.
But I had this promise.
Some soldiers are going to come out of the din of battle and are going to thank us.
If we can get our very small cricket pitch by first light tomorrow morning.
Another 20 miles, that's all.
If we can, they're going to look at our small patch of sanity and they're going to say it was worth it.
They are, and then we...
I have this promise.
We can go and do stirring things.
Bloody waste of...
I'll stop this petty thieving.
Petty thieving!
Do you get much thievery, cowardice, things like that?
No, no.
Being in improper possession of a comrade's property.
- Can't put a thing down.
- No.
On the whole, no thievery, no fibbing, no arguing with a superior officer, no treachery, no cowardice, not much rape.
I don't countenance rape.
No letting down of the boys.
They'll have to put all that back.
Most of us are artists.
Ah! He's very good.
Ah, look, they're going to blow up your geraniums.
Oh, dear.
(theme from "Lawrence Of Arabia")
That's a relief.
What's so damned important about a damned cricket pitch?
I said, more to show that though I was an officer,
I could understand the feelings of ordinary chaps like them.
- But it isn't just a cricket pitch, is it?
- It is.
I'll tell you for why. Because it's a silly bloody silly cricket pitch is why.
On. We'll find the bloody oasis ourselves.
(German spoken in distance)
(first voice) I'm going to be
in the second battle of Alamein.
(second voice) I'm going to be
in the second battle of Alamein.
I'm excused Alamein... for my feet.
I suppose some form of National
Socialism is inevitable after the war.
(voices overlap and distort)
- I'm going to be in the second battle...
- That's the ticket.
- It is good news, isn't it?
- Congratulations.
I don't half envy you.
What you'll be able to tell your children.
Come on, kids, Dad is going to tell us about the second battle of Alamein again.
This is today, and I'm still alive today.
My name is Henry Bridgehouse.
I'm still thinking of you all, and so are you, I fondly hopes, alive, and all the kiddies still at home, to whom I send my very best.
Is that all right?
(whimpers)
Any chance of another battle?
It's high time.
You're a great man, a very great man, but you are impatient.
- I want a battle.
- That is the way to lose battles.
- I want a battle.
- I'll tell you the sort of man I am.
I am patient. At the second battle of Alamein, I shall be patient.
I shall start the battle... here.
And then I shall go to bed... there.
That is the sort of man I am.
Never fight battles when you're awake.
That is the way to lose battles.
Mines! Don't move.
(screams)
We've done it, lads! We've made it.
Oh, well, done, Third Troop.
They're very beautiful.
What can be done with them in this world after the war is over?
We're fighting against men inflicted with a terrible virus.
Do push-ups. Clapper, on your belly.
And it is a belly. I want you fit.
I want 500 guns,
300 tanks, 200 aeroplanes.
I'll tell you my plan.
I hatched it in the lavatory.
My plans are always hatched in lavatories.
Pull the bleeding chain, then.
- There's none in it.
- Spool, no. Have some pride, lad.
- I let it out.
- Who took the water?
Spool, I'm talking to you, lad.
I can shoot you.
A hole in your head.
You'll die with your silly name.
- I let it out so it would be lighter.
- Shoot me, in my big toe.
I can, you know, shoot you, and him.
And you can, him.
Put a round up him. All it needs.
Come on, come on. Running on the spot.
Begin! One, two, one, two...
- Go on, Gripweed.
- I can't, Tranny.
Yes, you can. It's easy.
It gets easier. That's the thing about it.
The thing I hate more than anything else.
I'm not going to be able to go home, you know.
A lad I know saved a grenade at Dunkirk.
Didn't drop it in the sandbag.
Saved it, took it home and put in on his stomach, holding it between belly and thigh, and went to bed.
Pin out, relaxed and died.
It gets very easy.
I can look at a man, dead, step over him ten times a day, going to the cookhouse.
Not curious enough to turn him over and see his face.
Front lying... down!
I do blame them for that.
This way, sir.
I do blame them for that.
I used to be put off my supper should
I see a cat dead in the middle of the road.
Or a bird, leave alone a man, though we didn't get much of that down our way.
- So you can.
- I won't, though.
- That's different, won't.
- This beats National Socialism, Gripweed!
I am glad I won't.
Don't move, sir, we're all in a minefield.
It's a very simple plan.
All my plans are simple plans.
Look at Dieppe. That was simple.
Wait until Arnhem.
That's going to be simple.
Gather your ammunition.
Leave your packs by the roller.
- And have them whipped?
- No, Gripweed is coming with us.
I'm simple. Gather round me.
Can you hear me at the back?
- Hi-de-hi!
- Ho-de-ho!
Has he sent you any water, has he?
That man. Corporal of Musket, stop that man making an ass of himself.
Get all 500 guns and fire them in the same place to blow the daylights out of them.
- Hold still, Spool.
- Fill your bottles from the roller.
- Give him a drink, Corporal of Musket.
- There's none in there.
- My God, the roller. Get it in the shade.
- I thought it would be lighter.
Come on, lad. We'll get some water when we capture the oasis. Lashings of water.
We'll send you chaps in with 200 tanks going like bats out of hell.
You've seen enough now. Off you go, there's good chaps. Hold his head.
Just who could play a trick like that?
At the best, it's rank inefficiency.
- Me!
- Who took my man's water? I want water.
- How can my men fight without water?
- Me!
I did, I let the bloody water out to make it lighter.
Give the lad some room, will you?
Would you take that camera away?
There's a good fella.
Haven't you had enough?
Find a battle and film it.
- (Juniper) A good battle.
- Clear these cameramen away.
Haven't you insulted us enough? Your army is the best in the world. Get away.
It's all right. Don't let him bite this time.
- It's all over. Make a ring round him.
- No, let the bastards see.
No. The next of kin, think of them.
(Spool screams)
That happened to a son of mine.
He was left all through the war.
- They do, don't they?
- With his eardrum.
- It's the noise, I expect.
- Still, he's not dead like some.
- Well, you can forgive.
- Missing. Not dead. They didn't get him.
He'll turn up. Missing, he is.
(bugle)
Colonel! Colonel, any water?
Bum on, bum on, on to Tunis.
See to the roller... and Spool first.
Huzzah! It'll be all right now.
Huzzah! Good old Colonel Grapple.
He's a character that will see us through.
That's the thing about war.
It's a picnic if left to the right officers.
Men who understand our ways.
Treat us like human beings.
What we want is more humane killers.
Good old Colonel Grapple! See you on personal when you have a moment, sir?
(all) Achtung/
My God! No time for that now.
They must know we're here.
- Rounds per man?
- Three and a half, sir.
When you use that, fix bayonets and die.
Charge is the joke.
Fix bayonets and charge.
- We're all gonna die under funny names.
- Charge.
Good luck to you all. Tally-ho!
Boot the Hun right through to Tunis!
(repeatedly) Fire!
(bagpipes)
Now, bear in mind, we had him on the run, Jerry.
We'd stood to all night, of course.
As we stood up, the bullets flew around us. Like rain it was.
I well remember - and bear in mind,
I was platoon sergeant - it therefore was behove of me to keep morale up - so I said, more as a laugh, cos it wasn't tense or below par...
You very rarely are, at the start line.
Take no notice of the Yanks. They haven't lived. And they was always bombing us.
Now there's rarely any tenseness.
It's the relaxation you notices.
Little kips all along the start line, barring them as is already haywire.
So... more to raise a laugh...
Like shoelaces, seeing as they're tight.
Not crippling you, not causing you to trip.
There. (he laughs)
Silly ha'porth! Crippled you. It's important to raise a laugh on the battlefield.
And very humorous the laughs can be.
Some humorous books being written.
More for a laugh, I said "We should have us gas capes on. It is raining bullets."
That was when we lost Charles Black from a raindrop.
I said "We should have us umbrellas and gas capes, boys. Raining bullets."
"We'll get wet, boys, if we're not careful, chums" I said.
More for a laugh.
(whistles "Colonel Bogey")
Well, you see? Good.
(speaks German)
Wollen Sie trinken?
(shouting in German)
(groaning)
Oh, my poor horses.
Cavalry horses love the stir and the din, even the danger, of battle.
The British cavalryman regards his horse as his friend.
Those who have ponies, children and horses of your own, at home, may like to know how well we look after our steeds.
Sometimes we risk being shot at to put our wounded mounts out of their misery.
(gunshot, man yelps)
Eight, nine... How's your leg theory,
Corporal of Musket?
I'd like your opinion. What do you think?
As a wicket, likely to vent spiteful by midday, I think.
Er... Light roller.
Bowlers don't expect miracles.
As a pitch, it will teach you perseverance.
I want a batting crease four feet from here, Gripweed.
Spool, put a stump in here.
The light should be good.
Keep the water off, I think.
Don't want to have to contend with a sticky wicket.
On a dead wicket, always bat first.
Remember, Gripweed, medals are merely milestones on the road to final victory.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
(yells)
- Where've you been?
- In enemy hands, sir.
You told them nothing but name, rank and number?
I don't know my name, rank and number.
I remember the number of my first rifle.
Don't try that.
I can smell them, the ones who are not
100 per cent for it. Try that one on me?
Take those nasty Nazi clothes off and play cricket. Teach you team spirit.
Not a wound on him.
Show me a wound.
You stink of surrender.
Not a decent wound on you.
- I've been burned.
- We've all been burned.
Pads on! Play every ball on its merit.
- I want to fight.
- That man is malingering.
I've a damn shrewd idea that you are trying to work your ticket.
I say, you can't do that.
He's a private soldier.
He's a stinking coward.
I've always wanted to hit a general.
Fall in, two men, he hit the General.
- Open the batting from the mountain end.
- What's going on here?
That boy is only 19. Here, hold this camel.
Hit somebody your own rank, or near it.
- Who are you?
- Grapple MC. Grapple of the Bedoo.
And another thing, I will not play cricket...
- Come, now, none of us like war.
- I do. I like war.
I do not like cricket.
- Did you have many humorous incidents?
- Yes, we did.
- Tell me about yours.
- They're not funny, really.
- Tell me. Are the British cruel?
- Oh, yes.
- We know what we're doing.
- And we are.
Do you know what we have done to millions of people?
- I think you've killed them.
- I don't know anything about it. Terrible.
- Are you sorry about these people?
- No, no, I am not.
I thought about it and... no, I'm not.
I'm not sorry about my men.
- Did you have a lot of men?
- Yes.
- You did?
- Yes, hundreds.
Me too, and all with the same faces.
They all looked the same to me.
You look after them, see their feet is clean, dry, powdered.
- They will not look after their feet.
- They began to kill me with worry.
More than that. More.
May I?
The thing about them was they would not respond.
There it was for them, a crusade against tyranny...
Oh, not you. Not you.
But if they knew the King.
My mother knew him well.
She used to send to his birthday.
And all the children, the princesses, they all got something, even though we were not that well off.
I wanted to do my best for him.
He knew why he gave me his commission.
- You know what I mean?
- Ja.
I wanted to know them.
I wanted to know them very much.
I can talk to you.
I could talk to nobody else.
I haven't spoken to anyone else about the King and me for the whole of this...
And I. The King and I. You know?
- You'd like him.
- Thank you.
As I was saying, I haven't been able to speak to anyone else through the whole of this film.
You see, one day, after a not particularly arduous or expensive skirmish, they were all gathered round me...
I well remember... the way an admirable man and a great soldier referred to expensive noises as he listened to a battle without emotion.
That is the way, isn't it?
- For our kind.
- You are a fascist!
Am I? But I don't particularly dislike Jews.
- I love them.
- Have you...? Are you cruel?
- Have you killed many Jews?
- Quite a lot.
- What do you say to that?
- Good Lord.
But then I try to find good in everybody.
(sparse applause)
Why choose me as your defending officer?
You're the only one decently turned out.
- Halt. Face your front.
- Shut up.
This man is not fit to plead.
It is obvious to anyone with a spark of humanity in them that he should be treated with sympathy and understanding and sent home.
- Shut up! You may not say anything.
- Defending officer, sir.
He's not an officer, for all his voice and his linear belt.
Therefore, he may not make speeches.
He has no privileges in this court.
Choose anyone you like but only officers can talk to me.
That makes it awkward.
He should have gone to grammar school.
- Got his Cert A, passed his commission,
- I came up from the ranks. I'm a general.
- This is a general court martial.
- For hitting me.
- Permission to speak.
- Shut up.
Speak up. Be respectful.
What is wrong with the army is that there is not enough humanity in it.
Shut up! If it wasn't for the British army, you wouldn't be here today.
Humanity!
We're going into Germany soon.
When we get to the home of the Hun, take your pips off.
You're a very lucky chap.
You're fighting in a war which may well turn out to be a crusade. If I know the Hun.
A good soldier but a bit frightful. With any luck, he's up to some revolting things.
In case he isn't, better take your pips off.
They will put a bullet through your neck for what you've made them do.
I don't think Jerry will disappoint us, so shut up!
I don't think I could do that. They're the nicest things that ever happened to me.
I think my lads are very fond of me.
Sir! Permission to fall out, sir?
We've been playing cricket in the hot sun for three hours.
We can't enjoy ourselves infinitum, or at least bowl underarm.
Play on is my advice to you unless you want to look at me in a court martial.
- Enjoy yourselves. It will be a long war.
- Play on!
You may not fall out until a very important bod sees you entertained and happy.
Tails up, I haven't brought you all this way to bowl underarm.
- It's just as hard for me as it is for you.
- You're a bastard.
I hope so, I hope I am a bastard.
- I'm not proud of it.
- Sit down, son.
I've looked after their feet as if they were my own, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
- What is all this?
- Advance cricket pitch.
Present and ready for your inspection, sir.
What rotten bowlers. Right, drive on.
It is bad. The lower-middle and working classes receiving the King's Commission?
These classes, unlike like the classes who led the army when I was a lad, never had their people to consider.
I liked it better when he was a comedian.
He wasn't very funny but I liked it better.
Jokes. Mind you, I'm working class.
I had a grandfather who was a miner.
Until he sold it.
It's a very simple plan.
All my plans are simple.
You remember Dieppe? Arnhem will be as simple. A few parachutes, that's all.
My heart's not in it any more.
Oh, go away, I'm tired. I'm the only bleeding bowler in the Second Army.
(artillery and machine guns)
(bomb falls)
- Sorry, old man.
- It's all right, sir. I'm very grateful.
- Stretcher bearer!
- Jammy bastard.
With the Second Army linking up, the men of the Airborne can afford to relax a little.
(cackles)
(shouts in Dutch)
Out!
Come on, come on!
- Tot ziens/
- Auf Wiedersehen/
- Welkom, welkom.
- Thanks.
One, two...
Don't look, don't look, don't look!
Don't look... Don't look...
Don't look.
Don't look...
Come on.
Dooley, Spool, take the barn.
Sergeant Transom with me.
We are English.
Nice place you've got.
Right, you two, outside. Slit trench eight yards from this wall. Move yourselves.
Do sit down.
(announcer) Now, this is the job on which the soldier's life and the battle depends.
As soon as the infantryman reaches a new position, he starts to dig in with pick and spade.
To begin with, cover is a hole in the ground, but as the enemy are rolled back by succeeding waves of troops, the men immediately behind start serious digging.
The infantryman's home in battle is his slit trench.
In a narrow five-foot hole, he lives, sleeps, eats, and rests.
If the men are lucky, rations, great coats and mail are brought to them after dark.
It's the missus again, of course.
She's having it away with a Yank now.
Hands across the sea, straight up her woollies.
(shrieks with laughter)
(clattering)
- Stop it!
- What are you laughing at?
I can't say it. I can say nothing.
I'd like to say what I feel, but I can only tell you what I see.
The weather's not bad and I still write to you.
The words look so young on paper and we are grown people.
But I'll tell you. I do miss you.
"Moonlight Cocktail" is now all the rage.
...with an American soldier.
They're all over here now.
He thrust his great American hand into my dress and I felt the utility material of which it was made, parachute silk, tear asunder under the thrust of his passion.
Fondest ever always, your own Mrs Clapper.
Gripweed, Clapper, cover yourselves.
They're coming from the right!
Sergeant Transom, tank and infantry coming from the right. This side.
Sergeant Transom! Get out.
Now, watch it.
Have a heart, eh?
(metal clanks)
Thieving git. Some bastard's been prior, has he, Jock?
- One bastard stinks to high heaven.
- Are you a duration bloke?
- You wouldn't chuckle?
- Pack it in.
I'm a regular.
It's my soddin' career, liberating.
I knew this'd happen.
You knew it'd happen, didn't you?
(speaking German)
(German)
Thank you. Thank you for your help.
- Steady on, we're still on it, the bridge.
- It is a lovely bridge.
It is the only bridge still intact across the Rhine.
- It won't be for long.
- If you had it, you could win the war.
- I think we're doing that anyhow.
- And I could retire sooner.
- You'd win.
- Yes.
- It's yours.
- No, I don't want to blow it up.
You've done all the work.
- No, please.
- Cheap.
How much do you want for it?
No, no, no.
As we mean to go on, after the war.
The war brings out the best in some, you know?
Thank you, but as we mean to go on.
- Eisenhower would never pay.
Have it. Go on.
No. Those days are over.
There's no hope for you or your country if you're going to let emotion rule.
I tell you. And it's got me nowhere.
To me, Sergeant Transom! To me!
(gunfire continues)
I should have shot that stupid little bleeder a long time ago.
I always wanted to, as you know.
You shoot one, you've got to shoot the lot.
Before they takes their exams and are taught virtue and industry.
Cor! Stone a little colonel, eh?
- It's a fine bridge.
- And it's worth about what? 17,000?
You know what? You are right.
I was beginning to forget what democracy means.
- It's a wonderful bridge. 23,000.
- That's better.
- No, I am risking my life here.
They are shooting people for not blowing up bridges.
Well, we could build one for 23,000.
Less. It's too far south for us, anyway.
- I'd never get it past the accountants.
- Dooley! To me!
- My name is Dooley.
- I am not going. I'm just not going.
There's more to say.
I've got more to say.
- I'm not going without shouting.
- My name is Spool.
I was transferred from the Service Corps for a better chance of promotion.
- I'd like to speak to you on personal, sir.
- Transom!
Here!
I never said a word to you before I was dying... mate.
(Drogue) I died in North Africa.
I fought for three reasons.
I can't remember what they were.
The first reason gets you in, and the reason when you're in is staying alive.
I won't know the reason they find afterwards but it will be a very good one.
I'm sure we'll be glad, and I'm not a thief, really.
I never found anything worth keeping.
Suddenly, my phone rang.
We were eager to secure a Rhine river bridgehead but we despaired of taking a bridge intact.
Suddenly, my phone rang.
22,000, take it or leave it.
In view of the personal danger to yourself, 19.
Right, done.
Fine bleeding hospital this is.
Suddenly, my phone rang.
It was Hodges calling from Spa.
"Brad" he called.
"Brad, we've gotten a bridge, a bridge."
"You mean you've gotten one intact over the Rhine?"
"Yep."
"Hot dog" I said,
"this'll bust them wide open."
They're coming.
Come on!
It's ours, sir, it's ours!
One minute! One minute!
- Get out of the way, you idiot!
- (yells)
Get out of it!
Bum on! Bum on!
To Moscow!
We've come a long way, chaps.
Now we've come to the end of the road.
Head up, Gripweed. Be proud.
Show them who's won the war.
Across the world, we've trod the stony path from defeat to final victory.
And soon, the Great Umpire above will call close of play in this, the Second World War.
Or as I prefer to call it... the final test.
And I want to take this opportunity of letting you know how proud I have been to have commanded such a fine body of men.
Would have bounced anyway.
I haven't got 19d.
Transom, keep your feet up.
- What's he keep calling me that for?
- We're not out of the woods yet.
You haven't had a big part in this.
Ah, well. What you doing next?
- I hear there's this Vietnam thing coming.
- Yeah, I know that.
But I don't like working with that director much. Still, the money's good.
I'm glad you could get here.
I've been trying to contact all the members of Third Troop for years.
And, really, without success.
The strange thing is, I agree, there was a good reason for fighting the war.
I knew it. I felt really despicable.
We had to fight the war.
I couldn't, that's all. I just couldn't do it.
I had to leave it to chaps like you who hadn't really got a reason.
- I wanted to fight, honestly.
- I know you did.
But I won the war.

ENHOH
In here, please.
This is it, the most luxurious quarters on the Bedford...
...except for the captain's cabin.
That landing a little bit hairy, huh?
- Plenty hairy.
- Are you kidding?
I'm Ensign Ralston.
- You must be Mr. Ben Munceford.
- That's right, ensign.
Ensigns are usually called mister, sir.
Dr. Potter?
Glad to meet you, mister.
Mr. Munceford, it's a great honor meeting you.
We've all read your stuff.
I hope we can give you what you're looking for.
I'm sure you will.
You wanna watch how you secure that equipment, Mr. Munceford.
Dropped it like a bundle of old newspapers.
We're likely to make another radical change of course.
- Is it always like this?
- Only during general quarters, sir.
Oh, I see.
Try to make yourselves comfortable.
I suggest you find where the most convenient handholds are.
I mean it,
I would do that on the bunk.
You tell Capt. Finlander we'll be right out.
Can't do that, sir. Good luck.
What is he doing?
Making U-turns up there?
- Cmdr. Potter, sir.
- Yes?
Captain's compliments.
You should be in your GQ station.
That's in sickbay, sir.
- Will you put these on?
- Sure.
Meantime, I'll climb topside and check what's going on.
I'm sorry, sir.
That's against regulations.
Which regulations?
This section's been compartmented off, in case we take a torpedo, sir.
Well, I appreciate the realism, sailor.
Oh, that's extremely good.
Commendatory.
But since it's only practice, how about a little cooperation, huh?
I'm sorry, Mr. Munceford.
- What kind of an attitude is that?
- The captain's attitude.
He'd chew me out. You understand.
- Ready, sir?
- Yeah.
We've tried to cooperate, sir. We've had the typewriter installed for you.
This way, sir.
The new medical officer,
Lt. Cmdr. Potter.
Gentlemen.
I'll be right with you, commander.
Get a move on. You've been holding me up for three minutes.
The violet stain, chief, it takes time.
While you're watching for it to show, triple-check that bucket.
Lookout spotted that stuff only about a half an hour ago.
Chief hospital man James Aloysius
McKinley. Welcome aboard, sir.
- Glad to meet you, chief.
- Hospital men Nerney and Strauss.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Well, you are witnessing the biochemical, histological section...
...of the cellular analysis department of the DLG-113 in action.
- You wanna look, sir?
- Well...
It was plumb dumb luck picking that stuff up out here...
...when you consider the million square miles of nothing around here.
- It looks like garbage.
- Very good analysis.
As a matter of fact, it is.
We're the greatest garbage analysis team in the history of naval warfare.
- Now, sir, your keys.
- Oh, yeah.
The men's medical files and records are in that cabinet over there.
Officer's locked cabinet is here...
...and the keys to the narcotics and booze are in there.
- Booze?
- Brandy and pure grain alcohol.
Doctor, this might interest you.
All right.
Can you identify that?
Well, let's see now.
Looks like seaweed.
Red cabbage.
Staple food of the Russian navy.
Those little black specks that you see are coarsely ground black pepper.
Nerney, those slides...
No, show him an untreated sample.
- What's this?
- Potato peeling.
I see. Thank you.
Well, do you find all this stuff around here?
That's right.
And in very good condition too.
That's what set the old man's hair on fire.
That's why he's charging this ship around like a fox in a henhouse.
That stuff could be brand-new.
Me, I say no. It only looks that way.
You know, the Arctic.
- The ocean, the water's cold.
- Well...
Ready on the grease test.
Here it comes, doctor.
Hydrogenated.
Hydrogenated?
The oil on the cabbage leaves, doctor.
It's very significant.
Indicates very fancy cooking.
Oh, I see.
Bridge, urgent report for the captain.
McKinley, captain.
Finest Russian naval cuisine.
Peppered red cabbage sautéed in butter.
Yes, sir, submarine fare.
Aye, aye, sir, as soon as we can.
We're checking the cellular state of decomposition.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Oh, sorry.
Potato peelings are best for that.
These sample slides here we made ourselves and by comparing...
...we can tell how long it is since the sub dumped that in the water.
I see.
No, no, Nerney, it's no good.
Give me some older.
Now then, Nerney, what was your guess?
Twenty-four hours.
Eighteen hours tops. No more.
Eighteen hours. Twenty-four hours.
McKinley.
Give me the captain again, please.
Captain? Positive identification on those Russian waste materials.
Been in the water for 36 hours.
Yeah, that's right, 36 hours.
Aye, aye, sir. I'll tell him.
Well, thank you, captain.
Well, biopsy like that would take 12 hours in any laboratory in the world.
Just 33 minutes.
Oh, Capt. Finlander requests that you report to him at 1800 hours.
- Have you ever met the captain?
- No, not yet.
Well, the old man can come on kind of hard, if you know what I mean.
Well, he's prone to be a bit hard-nosed with reserve officers.
Well, maybe because you're a doctor it'll make a difference...
...but I suggest you watch yourself.
Now secure general quarters.
Set regular sea detail. Watch three.
Darken ship. The smoking lamp is out on all weather decks.
- Sir, this is Mr. Munceford.
- Oh.
- How are you, captain?
- I'm not the captain.
- I'm the exec, Cmdr. Allison.
- How are you?
Capt. Finlander's busy with the doctor at the moment.
- You been out with the Navy before?
- As a matter of fact, I have.
- A few reservist cruises.
- Well, that's fine.
But I hope you'll bear in mind that this is not a reservist cruise.
We are an active part of our defenses...
...and we run this ship virtually under wartime conditions.
Which reminds me, may I see your credentials?
- My what?
- Your credentials.
Thank you.
Note that Mr. Munceford's credentials have been checked...
...and log him aboard.
What would've happened if my credentials weren't in order?
Thrown me overboard?
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- No, not me, the captain.
Excuse us, Mr. Munceford.
Well, I'm glad you found the analysis interesting, doctor.
Oh, yes, sir, very much so.
McKinley showed you how he runs my sickbay.
Think you might have anything to contribute?
- I wouldn't be at all surprised, sir.
- Is that so?
I requested that no replacement doctor be assigned my ship.
They sent one anyway.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't quite get that.
I said I didn't want a doctor, but they sent you.
Well, sir, if you'd like to arrange for my transfer out of here...
...or shall I handle it? I'll be down below until you make a decision.
Stand where you are, doc.
Sir, my request for sea duty did not specify this ship.
You didn't aim high, huh?
And you're out of uniform, doc.
Blue caps went out two years ago.
- Change it.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.
- Yes?
You sent for Ensign Ralston.
Yes, I did.
Mr. Ralston, I gave express orders for that copter to keep off...
...while I was in GQ.
- Yes, sir.
- You landed it.
- Yes, sir.
Explain that.
I didn't know if the pilot had enough gas.
He had enough to buzz my ship repeatedly despite visual signals.
You disregarded my order.
- It was getting dark, sir.
- I gave you an order, mister.
- Yes, sir.
- You ignored it.
- Yes, sir. I can explain further.
- I don't want an explanation.
- I think your action was correct.
- Thank you, sir.
Who's that?
Security watch.
- Did you pass this civilian to CIC?
- It's the correspondent, Munceford.
He wanted to find out the patterns we ran during general quarters.
- I gave no such permission.
- Don't blame him. I'm responsible.
Commander, put this man on report pending next captain's mast.
Mr. Munceford, you come with me.
You too, doc.
- Can't I square this for the kid?
- I suggest you keep out of it.
- Captain, about that...
- Commodore Wolfgang Schrepke...
...of the West German navy. Benjamin
Munceford of the American press.
- How do you do?
- And Lt. Cmdr...
- What was that name again?
- Chester Potter.
Potter. My new medical officer.
I've heard a lot about you, but I never expected I'd meet you.
- Is that so?
- Not aboard an American destroyer.
- Is that so surprising in these times?
- I guess not...
...if one can make the switch mentally.
But I still connect you with Hitler's navy.
Your pardon.
Adm. Donitz's navy, sir.
The commodore was an ace
U-boat commander, gentlemen.
He sank over 200,000 tons of Allied shipping.
Really?
But now, under NATO, he's on our side.
So I requested him as technical adviser for this cruise.
- I'd like to put in a word for that kid...
- Mr. Munceford.
You will oblige me by not referring to the security breach...
...on the part of my crew again.
- Yes, but...
The Department of Defense wants you to have full cooperation...
...in the preparation of a story for your magazine.
All right, that I'll give.
But how and why I discipline my crew is none of your business.
Understood?
Do you understand me,
Mr. Munceford?
Yes, sir.
Fine.
- Now, here's what this is all...
- Excuse me, sir. Sorry.
Here's what this is all about.
You can take notes, Mr. Munceford.
We're positioned in the Denmark
Strait, right about here.
- Midway between...
- Excuse me, sir.
All right with you if I smoke?
Go ahead.
Midway between
Greenland and Iceland.
Much closer to Moscow than Washington.
Now, this ship functions in two ways:
One, as a part of NATO defense...
...and two, the defense of the United
States against enemy aggression...
...by air or sea.
And to put it simply...
...the Bedford can inflict more damage in 10 minutes...
...than the entire United States Navy caused in World War II.
- Wow!
- But that's not our purpose.
We're primarily hunters. Stalkers.
- Of subs.
- That's right.
We track by ear an enemy who is also intently listening for us.
There is Russian submarine activity at present in the Denmark Strait, right?
Right.
They can come and go as they please.
Cold war or no cold war, and so can we.
And contrary to...
A little later, please, huh?
Later.
Contrary to certain scuttlebutt...
...we aren't out to spy on each other's missile ranges or atomic tests.
That kind of work can be...
Mr. Munceford.
This briefing is for you.
I was saying that that kind of work can be done cheaper and easier...
...by one man and a U-2.
But DEW line and NORAD emissions are something else.
I'm convinced that Soviet subs are recording them...
...penetrating our defenses.
I also suspect the locating and setting up...
...of submarine missile firing positions.
Now, these are objectives worth tremendous risks.
They're worth killing over.
Are you telling us you would attack...
...the Russian submarines?
- You got any language skills, doctor?
- Greek and Latin, sir.
- Oh, just Greek and Latin, huh?
Why the language question?
I have three Russian language experts onboard. I'd like more.
- Just Greek and Latin, you say?
- That's it.
Captain, would you attack a Russian submarine?
The world is at peace, Mr. Munceford.
Your magazine says so.
There's something I heard about you in the Pentagon.
- Yeah? What's that?
- It's nothing bad.
Your crew turns down substantial offers from private industry.
- Electronics, et cetera...
- That's right.
...to stay on this ship.
- Why?
- Well, because technical skills aside...
...they're professional naval fighting men.
Excuse me, sir, but that doesn't answer it.
- You don't think so, huh?
- Well, not quite.
Well, let's put it this way,
Mr. Munceford.
I keep them interested...
...with the hunt.
There's something very exciting about the hunt.
And the kill, my captain?
You'll have to forgive the commodore's alleged sense of humor.
Now, to get back to this.
Today's activity was the initial maneuver on a new action.
We're hunting now.
The quarry is a specific
Russian submarine.
And we know he's carrying nuclear torpedoes.
That's right. Code name is Big Red.
So far we've only seen his traces, tracks you might call them.
But he's here. North, south, east, west, we don't know.
Now, he has a mother ship.
That may be any one of five Russian trawlers...
...purportedly commercial fishing vessels...
...operating in these waters legally.
We keep all five under constant surveillance.
And we hope to entice one of those five trawlers...
...the real mother ship, into showing its hand.
There's that chance the mother may check the baby, make sure he's safe.
And when the baby answers?
All right, gentlemen, that's all.
I'm sure you'll find interesting company in the wardroom.
I wanted to make an appointment with you.
- Later, doctor. Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, commodore.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Munceford.
- Good night, captain. Commodore.
Did you ever get the feeling you weren't wanted?
- Brother.
- How'd he strike you?
- I don't think he likes me.
- Finlander's ice-cold.
- You don't fit his needs, out.
- I'll say.
- But he's quite a professional.
- How do you mean?
He's a result-getter.
Remember that Russian sub that was forced to surface off of Cuba?
- Yes. Did he do that?
- Yeah.
He got commendations.
So did his crew.
He's the most result-getting officer in the U.S. Navy.
Yet he was passed over for admiral last month.
I wonder why.
I wonder why.
And, men, no matter what you do...
And, men, no matter what you do...
...don't minimize your importance on the Bedford.
So just keep on your toes, fellows...
...and be prepared for some drills I'll be scheduling for the next few days.
And that's it.
All right, fellows.
Mac, I want you to make a note to assign some extra men...
...to act as casualties during the litter-carrying drills.
You'll have to clear that with the captain.
Each man on the ship has a specific task during GQ.
Well, we'll get that straightened out.
Now...
Okay, I'm ready for sick call.
You can call in the first man.
Nobody's reported for sick call, sir.
Well, it's a bit early.
No, this is normal. Hardly anyone ever reports for sick call.
Oh, come on, Mac.
You're trying to tell me...
...that with a complement of over
300 men, nobody ever gets sick?
What about the inevitable hypochondriacs and malingerers?
We don't have that kind on this ship.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Please, commodore, come in.
I'll only take up a few minutes of your time.
- I hope you're not feeling sick, sir.
- I feel very good, thank you.
Your captain informs me a prescription...
...given by the former medical officer...
...should be renewed by yourself.
I see. A prescription?
Sure.
A prescription.
Schrepke? Is that it?
Here we are.
Nothing there.
It looks like Lt. Hirschfeld didn't make any notation of the prescription...
...or the nature of the condition it's supposed to treat.
That's all right, commander. The doctor and I had an understanding.
I see. Well, what was the medicine?
Schnapps.
- Schnapps?
- Yes, schnapps.
You carry brandy in your medical supplies, do you not?
Well, yes, of course. But why do you have to have schnapps?
I really don't know, commander.
I've had three schnapps a day ever since I joined the Navy in 1931.
Even when I was a prisoner of war...
...your English allies were kind enough to let me have my schnapps.
I'm afraid I'll have to check this with Capt. Finlander.
It was he who suggested you see me.
- Sorry if I troubled you.
- No, no, it's all right.
Mac, will you fill that, please?
Commodore, you realize there's nothing personal about this.
I'm sure you can see that I have to exercise caution in the matter.
If the crew got wind of this...
...there'd be a hell of a raid on the dispensary.
You're wrong, doctor.
Not on this ship.
Thank you. Good morning.
Good morning.
What about this?
- Maybe.
- Yes.
Lieutenant!
Yes, thanks.
- You see what I mean?
- No, not really.
All right, I'll run it through again.
And this time, Beck, don't try reading it. Just listen to his tone.
I know I'm right.
Mr. Munceford.
Please come to the bridge.
Captain?
Don't take any more shots of the
ASROC. They'll just be censored.
- Rocket-boosted torpedoes, huh?
- Our number-one antisub device.
How far do they travel?
Quite a ways.
What's the matter, you a little chilly out there?
Captain.
Yes, Beckman.
- You got it?
- Got it, sir.
The message we intercepted from the Novo Sibursk...
...appeared routine.
But Lt. Berger, in checking out their figures...
...on water temperature, tide movements...
...found them to be inaccurate beyond any possibility of a legitimate mistake.
They were obviously trying to throw us.
Now, the other four ships checked out okay.
So Novo Sibursk is Big Red's mother.
I've set an interception course so we'll rendezvous about 1700.
Now, the sub should be somewhere here...
...maybe.
And the mother ship will clue us in...
...maybe.
But I want Commodore Schrepke to take a good look at Novo Sibursk.
Well?
The concealed tanks are very obvious.
Look for Big Red to be one of the old Chernikov class...
...with a submerged maximum speed of 25 knots...
...and a duration of 2 4 hours without snorkeling.
Yeah.
Take a look at that.
What are they up to?
The rules of international courtesy call for them to dip their colors.
Shall I prepare to return the salute, captain?
No.
Well, do you still feel like exchanging courtesies with the Russians?
Officer of the deck, turn left to 3-1-5.
And double the lookout. We'll probably hit fog as we close the coast.
- Left to 3-1-5.
- Left to 3-1-5, sir.
- Bosun's mate?
- Sir.
- Post a fog watch.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Captain?
The new course, sir. There's floe ice drifting southwest across that course.
With this light wind, it's certain to be scattered, sir.
- Not to mention it's getting dark.
- So?
Excuse me, but will I change course four or five degrees left and miss it?
If my mission were to steam along like a passenger liner...
...that would be an excellent idea.
What is our mission, Mr. Ralston?
To patrol for Russian submarine activity.
And if you were a Russian sub commander...
...operating under these sea conditions...
...what would you do,
Mr. Ralston?
I'd use the ice to screen my movements.
Assuming the Russian thinks that way, how close would you move to...?
Mr. Munceford, please leave the bridge!
How close would you move to the Greenland coast to confuse...
...any tracking destroyer's radar and sonar search?
If you were the Russian sub commander, that is.
Well, the ice runs almost a mile out from there, sir.
I'd try to get under it, if I could.
You would.
Then how close should we run?
Maybe a thousand yards, sir.
A thousand yards.
All right, make it so.
And run a series of maximum sonar searches.
Every 15 minutes, sir?
Now, why every 15 minutes,
Mr. Ralston?
To help the Russians set a schedule for silent running?
Now, come on!
Be a little unpredictable about it.
Now, get into CIC with Queffle.
Give him a schedule.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- A smart one. Unpredictable.
Aye, aye, sir.
What's the matter?
Think I'm too rough on him?
Well...
Well, go on, say it, yes or no.
You might try giving him a word of praise now and then.
What for?
- He tries so damn hard, for one thing.
- That he does.
So he makes mistakes.
You got him so rattled he can't think.
Yeah?
Yeah. You've been on his back ever since we left Norfolk.
Isn't it time you eased up a bit?
- You think so, huh?
- I do.
I'm telling you, he's too jumpy.
Ease up. He'll do better.
That's my opinion.
You can take it or leave it.
You know, Buck, you're getting worse than an old mother hen.
You've gone soft on me.
Okay, so I like him.
He's a good kid.
Right. And he'll make a good officer someday.
Then what are we arguing about?
If he quits expecting the crew to cheer every time he carries out an order.
No, the trouble with that kid, he can't forget what a big hero he was.
Star quarterback, voted most all-around, most likely, most popular...
That one he's still bucking for.
No, the only way to cut him down to size is to keep on him.
Yeah. If he survives.
If I hammer too hard, you let me know, huh?
I'll try.
Yeah. It's a lot of work being a mean bastard.
Sometimes I can't help admiring how effortlessly you do it, captain.
Almost as if it came naturally.
So taking your goals and your methods...
So taking your goals and your methods...
...and your requirements into consideration...
...I've come up with a plan of my own that I'd like to propose, sir.
You see, I said to myself, I said,
"Chester, what does this ship...
...need that you could contribute?"
- Chester?
- That's right, sir.
If the ship doesn't fit the man, then the man damn well...
...has to fit the ship, and that's the line my thinking has been going on.
- Put it here.
- Along... Excuse me.
Along that line, more or less.
Well, I think the thing to do now is to run it up the flagpole, so to say...
...and kind of kick it around for some reactions.
Good.
You see, sir, it's been my observance of the men on this ship that...
It's occurred to me that most of them are just...
...sitting around on their dead butts all day.
- What did you say?
- Don't get me wrong.
I mean of necessity. You see, scientific work is necessarily sedentary.
Therefore, I thought that a physical-fitness program...
...would be just in order.
Bodies toned, trained, developed.
No flabbies, no flabbies around.
The men all fit and shipshape, so to say.
- Yeah.
- Now, this can be accomplished...
...with isometric exercises.
- How's that again?
- Isometric, sir.
It's all done with tension.
Tense, relax. Tense, relax.
Tense, relax.
Tense, relax. Tense, relax.
Tense, relax. Tense, relax.
Tense, relax. You can do it anywhere.
Yeah, I think I've grasped the idea, doc. Is that all?
- Of the entire program?
- Yeah.
No, sir.
There are two more essentials.
Mental health is one.
I thought we could introduce group therapy...
...and individual counseling whenever necessary.
With men at sea, it seemed a logical step, sir.
Isolation, separation from family.
Not to mention women.
You see, sir, that's the real hell of it on these long trips.
- Men without women...
- Yeah, yeah. Go on.
Well, the exercise will help there.
- Yeah, I got you.
- Now, the third item...
...the third item is nutrition.
I thought that we could improve the...
I thought we can improve the men's diet, sir, by introducing...
...high-protein supplements like amino acids, natural grain, lecithin...
...and let's see, well, things like that, sir.
I see.
Are you through now?
Nutrition, mental health and the physical-fitness program.
Yes, sir, I think it's about what I had in mind.
Doc, how long have you been out of the Navy?
Sir, I wouldn't exactly call over 20 years in the Reserves...
...being out of the Navy.
Well, I'm afraid I would.
Have another look around this ship, doc.
It's a whole new set of numbers.
I don't understand, sir.
Does that mean my suggestions...
...are outmoded or just plain out?
Both.
You keep trying, though.
Don't give up the ship, so to say.
Captain, captain.
I am the medical officer here.
Just what are my duties?
Well, that depends.
On me as an officer, or on me personally?
Well, I have to wonder why after all these years you quit civilian life...
...and came back on active duty.
- I think the answer is fairly obvious.
Yeah, it is.
Knowing your history.
Your wives, divorces.
Three, weren't there? Your practice.
Rough going everywhere. So you decided to nip back in here for a while.
No, doc. Your type can be found in every branch of the service.
I don't like them.
Well, I see.
Does that mean I'm to be exiled into a sickbay that just sorts out garbage?
- Is that it?
- Sorry, doc, I've got work to do.
Captain.
Captain, you are denying me a fair chance.
Even if it's to fail, I want it.
Okay. Study these. You got a lot of catching up to do, doc.
The Bedford's a very complicated ship...
...and about as sturdy as a Christmas tree ball.
Almost everything above the water line's aluminum. You understand?
- Sir.
- One hit and we've had it.
So you see, a sickbay and a doctor...
...they really aren't much use to us, unfortunately.
But you'll understand more when you've read up on it.
General quarters. General quarters.
What's that GQ for?
Be right up.
Good luck, doc.
I get an unidentified aircraft report under these conditions...
I get an unidentified aircraft report under these conditions...
...and that's cause for sounding GQ whether the skipper's here or not.
What's this all about?
CIC reports a bogey, sir.
Lt. Beckman reports the is four miles, bearing...
Come on, Buck.
What have you got, Beck?
I'm sorry, captain, there was a mistake.
Why? What did you see?
The unidentified aerial blip turns out to be a weather balloon.
Oh? Where?
Bearing 1-8-6.
Range: four miles.
Altitude: 7000 feet.
- Get Lt. Bascombe in here.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- This is Greenland coast, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- What's the range?
- Ten miles, sir.
Weather balloon...
The Novo Sibursk is 100 miles back.
No other known surface vessels in the area to release that balloon.
So...
- Big Red?
- Yeah.
Sir.
Oh, Bascombe. You and Beckman get a fix on that balloon.
Track it backwards to its point of release and hurry it up.
Aye, aye, sir.
One opening, check.
- Sixty-two fathoms.
- Sixty-two fathoms.
No sign of anything,
Bascombe.
Whoever released the balloon could be anywhere by now.
But I know that the balloon itself was released right here.
- You're positive?
- Yes, sir, I'm positive.
It all checks out, sir.
Hey, what's that?
- Buck, take her in closer.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Fifty-eight fathoms.
- All engines ahead one-third.
All engines answer ahead one-third, sir.
That's close enough. Hold her parallel. Give me a sounding.
- Thirty-five fathoms, sir.
- Captain!
Over there, sir.
Three points off the bow.
Yeah.
There he is, commodore, just going under.
Do you see him?
I see him.
That's it! Light up the sonar.
Sound general quarters.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Start sonar.
- Sound general quarters.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Queffle?
- Captain, I have a sonar contact.
Bearing 0-0-2.
Range: 1-7-5-0.
Good boy, Queffle.
Keep on him.
Aye, aye, sir. Bearing 0-0-4.
Range: 1-8-0-0.
Opening: slight down-Doppler.
Classified: positive submarine.
Got it, Queffle. Buck, what's his position in reference to the coastline?
He's one mile off. Two miles inside
Greenland territorial waters.
Good.
Good.
- Very good.
- And now what?
- Fire Control.
- Sir?
Start feeding target data to all systems. Place ASROC on standby.
Buck, keep clear of the ice ledge.
Con the ships to block any attempt to break for open sea.
Messenger, take down this message for immediate transmission.
Communication, stand by.
Message to COMNATONORTH:
Sonar contact at entrance to Jacobson's Fjord.
Classified positive
Russian submarine.
Two miles inside. Repeat:
Inside Greenland territorial waters.
Request authority to force sub to surface...
...and withdraw from those waters.
That's it.
- Bridge. One moment.
- We're gonna clock him.
- He's got 2 4 hours.
- Captain, it's Mr. Munceford.
Munceford? What the hell does he want? Captain speaking.
About this GQ. Is this another one of your rehearsals?
How long do you think it's gonna last?
You see, I was interrupted...
...in the middle of something very important, and I would like to finish it.
Why, I wouldn't dream of interrupting the creative process, Mr. Munceford.
You just keep up the good work.
However, it's no fun down here when you pull that full security routine.
You know, I mean, the hallway is blocked and the water is turned off...
...and it's all very realistic, you know what I mean?
Well, you missed a very nice photograph a few minutes ago.
It's too bad.
The view of the Russian submarine violating international law...
...in Greenland territorial waters was breathtaking.
The official photographer got some nice shots.
I'll have him save you a print.
Thanks.
Buck, after about half an hour...
...tell the security watch in wardroom country to let Mr. Munceford come up.
Aye, aye, sir.
Stick with it, Queffle.
That sub commander must like it under the ice.
I can't figure why he doesn't cut for the open sea.
- He is testing you.
- You think so?
- Captain, sir.
- Yes.
Mr. Munceford requests permission to enter CIC.
- All right, bring him in.
- Aye, aye, sir.
He's running all out at less than 40 fathoms.
Not even trying to hide his sounding gear.
He's got the best underwater charts anybody ever heard of or he's crazy.
- Well, Mr. Munceford.
- Captain.
You finish your creative labors?
Yeah. Well, I just took another shower.
- No.
- Just a rinse.
- A man's got to keep neat and tidy.
- It helps.
- Captain?
- Yes, Hacker. Is that it?
Yes, sir. From commander,
NATO, North Atlantic.
- Good. Come on, read it.
- Yes, sir.
"Reference your message
1-2-1-0-2-8 Zulu.
Take no action other than tracking until further orders.
This passive course of action dictated by a critical political situation."
Sonar contact bearing 3-0-1 steady.
Range: 1-2-5-0 steady.
Depth: 0-7-5 steady.
Sir.
All right, that's all, Hacker.
You have been relieved of a very dangerous decision.
Yeah.
Do we secure?
- What?
- Do we secure battle stations, sir?
No.
Submarine bearing 0-3-4 steady.
Range: 1-3...
Message from
COMNATONORTH, sir.
Wait.
- Yes, sir.
- Any change in sub course or speed?
- No change, sir.
- Thank you.
- Who saw this?
- Just Communications.
I don't want the rest of the crew to know.
Right.
Cigarette?
I've been planning to switch back to a pipe.
I'm afraid I'd have bitten the stem off by now.
Don't they know we've got him in a spot?
He might as well be on the bottom of San Francisco Bay.
Why don't they know that?
- Captain.
- Big Red 's changing course, sir.
Right.
Commodore.
Bearing 0-5-5, drifting right.
Slight up-Doppler.
He's turning right.
New course.
He's killed his sonar.
Big Red's heading for the open sea.
Follow him around, stick right on his tail.
Captain, he's crossed into international waters.
Great.
I suppose he figures that's the end of it.
- Is it not?
- It is not.
Not by a damn sight.
Bearing 0-7-0. Mark up-Doppler.
Right to course 0-6-5.
Speed: 6 knots, drifting right.
New course: 0-8-0.
Hey, Queffle. You're going to knock yourself out.
You'd better have somebody take over for a while.
Oh, no, sir. I'm running the ship from here.
- Steer course: 0-9-2.
- Okay.
- Excuse me, captain.
- What?
Did Lt. Krindlemeyer tell you about the shrimp schools?
- No.
- I spotted three of them yesterday...
...all big ones.
- You did?
We could make a fortune in the fish business.
Well, I think you'd better stick to this business for now, Queffle.
- But thank you. Very kind of you.
- Yes, sir.
- Submerged time: 18 hours.
- That's right, captain.
Headed due north.
Well, he can't go under the icecap, because he's not nuclear.
And he can't make it back to Russian waters without surfacing for air.
And when he does surface, we'll be there. Right there.
Pretty dull, huh, Mr. Munceford?
How does the commodore stand it out there?
Well, you see, he's not really out there, Mr. Munceford.
He's about 200 feet below the surface with that sub.
- Good night.
- Oh, captain.
- Could we have our talk now?
- Well, it's pretty late, Mr. Munceford.
It'll only take a few minutes.
All right, come on.
How does the commodore feel about all this?
How does the commodore feel about all this?
- I wouldn't ask if I were you.
- What's your guess?
Well, he's the old U-boat man.
He's riding with the hounds, but his heart is with the fox.
- Waiting for when we close.
- Close?
Close for the kill, is that what you mean, captain?
Mr. Munceford.
- Let's get one thing straight.
- What's that?
Don't ever put words in my mouth.
All right?
I'll try my best.
Good. Sit down.
Look, maybe this isn't a good time.
You must be tired.
Oh, it's as good a time as any.
Go ahead, sit down.
All right, fire away.
Before you get started,
I'd like to ask you a question.
Go ahead.
Why did you pick my ship?
It wasn't your ship, captain.
It was you.
Oh? Why me?
You looked like an interesting subject.
Really. Now, whatever gave you that idea?
I saw a film clip of you being interviewed just after the Cuban deal.
- Yeah?
- I thought I recognized something.
Something rare. An individualist.
A man not afraid to speak his mind.
I consider that provocative and interesting.
I see.
With that bit of flattery, you hope to pull a few rash statements out of me.
Make good copy, is that it?
Well, frankly, I hadn't thought of that.
But since you've mentioned it...
I'm sorry if I sound cynical,
Mr. Munceford.
But you see, it's been my experience with the press...
...that they ignore truth for sensationalism.
Excuse me, but isn't that a generalization that's only valid...
...depending on which side of the fence you're on?
You're right.
You're quite right.
I've been anxious to meet an exception. It could very well be you.
Thank you. I thank you on behalf of myself and my colleagues.
Don't mention it.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
- Crew cooperating with you all right?
- Fine.
Good.
Accommodations comfortable?
- Anything you need?
- Fine, not a thing.
Very good. Anything you want, you just sing out. I'll be glad to help.
Now then, sir, about that television interview.
What about it?
There was something about it that puzzled me.
Something personal that relates to your record.
- I don't care to talk about it.
- In looking up your record...
...I found out that...
- What did you find?
Nothing derogatory. Far from it.
That's not what I meant.
But what struck me as a curious coincidence...
...was the fact that it was right after Cuba...
...that you were passed over for admiral.
I wondered if there was any connection there.
None.
Most of the statements made then were cautious.
Nobody came out and said anything, except you.
You were very outspoken, even critical, you might say.
You advocated using greater force.
- Well, that's your interpretation.
- I don't think so.
But I wondered whether the Pentagon resented that view...
...and that's why you were passed over for admiral.
Now, there you are.
Right there.
A clear example of the press putting its own interpretation on the facts.
Your words seemed unmistakable.
I have never made a public statement that did not go right down the line...
...with government policy.
- What about your private views, sir?
What?
I have none.
Do you believe the military should have more say in government policy?
I've never said that.
Taking the situation you're in now, as you send messages to Command...
...and they reply:
"Hold still, do nothing."
I'd say from your reaction you don't hardly agree.
You're guessing again.
You're interpreting me.
And you're wrong, Mr. Munceford.
You're dead wrong.
I'm only trying to get clear exactly what your views are, sir.
Now, if you could help me.
All right, I'll give you my views.
First, you'll have to concede I'm not a fool.
I like my job with the government.
I wouldn't consciously jeopardize it.
It demands more than most jobs, a man's life even...
...and for that you need a higher sense of Ioyalty.
I'm proud to be an old-fashioned patriot...
...and I'd destroy any enemy if it meant saving my country.
Now, what in the hell is wrong with that?
- But how far would you go?
- All the way.
Does that mean all-out nuclear attack?
- I didn't say that.
- But you implied it.
You implied. I said nothing.
Could you make a statement about the action you're engaged in now?
In terms of purpose and so forth?
Certainly.
Our purpose is to prevent by threat a certain course of action by the enemy.
- You mean a genuine threat?
- We're not bluffing, Mr. Munceford.
But the outcome is certain.
You're sure that nothing will happen.
If a deterrence is successful, aggression does not take place.
Well, I must say...
...it certainly has a nice ring to it anyway.
I'm glad you approve.
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Of course.
- Thank you for the interview.
- Anytime. It's been most stimulating.
For me also.
Mr. Munceford.
I did not say,
"Close for the kill."
Eric Finlander watched the brooding ex-U-boat officer...
...whose heart lay with the unknown enemy in the icy darkness below...
...and said laconically:
"His heart is with the fox waiting for when we close."
Sub has been down for 20 hours.
According to Commodore Schrepke, they're about to run out of air.
Have not been able to get any information from crew or Finlander...
...whether keeping sub down for 20 hours...
...is routine action in these circumstances or unduly severe.
Nobody talks.
Everybody cooperates, but nobody talks.
Except the doc.
How's it going?
- Swell. You?
- Check.
What do you say you and me jump ship?
Baby, it's cold outside.
Well, I'm so burned
I wouldn't even feel it.
- It's that bad?
- Yeah, it's that bad.
What the hell am I doing sitting in a corner with a lot of homework?
I'm a qualified doctor.
I don't want to learn a new trade.
Right.
For crying out loud.
You want to know my theory?
My theory is that he hates doctors.
Now, you give him a plain, humble scientific genius, but don't stop there.
Make sure that he can stand watch, navigate and man a battle station.
But that's the new Navy, doc.
Yes, I know times have changed, but this is a floating IBM machine.
Can you see any of those guys...
...singing "Anchors Aweigh," for example?
- Old nostalgia's got you, doc.
- It's not funny, Ben.
Have you ever seen these boys playing poker? They never relax.
Well, they can't. He's sounding
GQ every two minutes.
This man is playing at war. How long do you think he can keep it up?
He's got the crew going at fever pitch.
They're triggered up. They're geared to shoot and they can't.
They're frustrated.
Now, that's abnormal.
It's inhuman, and it's dangerous.
- Did you talk to him about that?
- Well, not exactly.
I have in a...
...sort of a roundabout wa...
What's the use? I can't cut it with a guy like that, I never could.
I guess I'm just a born loser.
Turn on sonar.
I want to hear Big Red.
Well, you're up late.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Captain.
Commodore?
Come in.
Well, you think this sub can do it?
The man is desperate, but he no doubt thinks his chances are better.
Yeah.
Do what?
Find a path through the icebergs only a submarine could get through.
- Would you like some fresh coffee...?
- Quiet!
Queffle, listen only.
- Hazelwood, take the con.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Try him now, Queffle.
Yeah.
He's back again.
Mr. Ralston, you turn from that panel once more, I'll confine you to quarters.
Aye, aye, sir.
He's trying to find a path through the bergs.
And we'll follow him.
Double the lookout watch.
- We're on condition two now.
- Then sound GQ again.
- Sound general quarters.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Your life preserver.
You don't think we're going to hit one, do you?
I doubt if we'll hit any above water, my friend.
Why'd you give me this?
You're not wearing one.
I thought you might find it reassuring.
Actually, it is of no use whatsoever.
How's that?
Immersion in these waters means instantaneous shock and paralysis.
Absolute der Tod in less than four minutes.
Big one bearing 0-1-0.
Range: 4-0-0.
Looks to be about a quarter-mile deep, sloping shelf. Can't tell how shallow.
I'm only giving you the nearest
10 degrees. You got that?
- Got it.
- Iceberg to starboard...
...Iooks to be about...
Holy smokes!
Maybe it goes down
100 fathoms.
One thing is sure.
The sub won't get under it.
Iceberg in sight.
Close to port, captain.
Is the submarine pinging now?
- Turn on sonar.
- Aye, aye, sir.
There you are.
- What's the sub's range?
- Six hundred yards, sir.
Close up another 100 yards and hold at 500.
Queffle, one just flipped on the starboard beam.
You'll probably pick up a bounce from its wave.
Yes, sir.
There's one coming that looks like Mt. Everest.
- How is it below the water line?
- You should clear it.
- The sub made it.
- Right.
Come left 10 degrees.
Left 10 degrees rudder, sir.
She struck!
The sub struck!
Was it head-on, Queffle?
No, sir. It was more like glancing along a wall. Blang!
- And then what?
- I don't know. I've lost sonar contact.
I'm not getting anything but the iceberg.
All engines stop.
Rig for silent ship.
All engines stop.
Rig for silent ship, sir.
- Now kill sonar. Just listen.
- Rig for silent ship.
Keep quiet above the decks and all lower deck spaces.
She's silent too, sir. No sonar, no engines, no nothing.
Okay.
- Everything all right, captain?
- Fine, fine. No problems.
From the silence, I gather you have lost your sonar contact.
Yeah.
Twenty-one hours.
- Down there, the stink begins.
- I hope so.
- It means so much to you, then?
- Yes, it means so much to me.
Commodore, what do you think he's up to?
He could have done one of three things:
Wedged himself up against the ice and surfaced...
...so you would lose your contact.
He could have scraped the ice on his way to the bottom...
...where he is lying right now completely silent.
And what's the third?
He could be on the other side of the berg.
If that is the case,
I'm afraid you have lost him.
I don't think he's on the other side.
But you don't know, do you?
Let's find out.
Nothing.
Buck.
You still feel that...
...Big Red might have had a chance to get under that ice to the other side?
Yeah.
Well, I still don't think so.
I'm convinced he's right around here.
You must be convinced, captain.
You have no choice.
What do you mean,
I have no choice?
If he cleared the berg, the sub could have gone in any direction.
To start a new search pattern on the other side would take hours.
Yeah.
All right, what do you think we should do?
You are the hunter, the one who stalks.
- Correct?
- Yeah, yeah. Go on, go on.
If I were hunting, at this point...
...considering he cannot breathe much longer, I would do nothing.
Wait for the animal to make the next move.
Okay, we wait.
Till sunup.
This is the captain speaking.
I know you're all tired and disgusted right now.
Maybe you even think that Big Red has been making fools of us...
...and those commies are laughing at another humiliation...
...to add to the many endured by our country in this cold war.
Personally, I doubt it. They have too little clean air left for a laugh.
Anyway, I'm gonna hang on here.
And when our rat decides it's safe to come out of its hole...
...we'll be there to grab him.
Now, that sounds simple enough...
...but you all know it'll mean more hours of waiting...
...of uncertainty and of doubt.
Well, just sit tight.
And above all, sit silent.
I want every man to listen, to concentrate...
...and to keep his whole being so alert...
...that this ship will tingle like an animal about to attack.
And if the Russians down there suspect our presence at all...
...let it be because they sense this.
And then let's see if they come up laughing. That's all.
Any comment, commodore?
Were you speaking to me?
I wondered whether you'd care to comment on that glockenspiel?
Sorry, I paid very little attention.
But you recognize the tone, though.
Stirring, keep the men fired up.
Sieg Heil.
Young man, I am too weary to follow your satirical wit this morning.
Excuse me, sir.
It's my own uneasiness
I'm knocking, not your country.
My stomach's tied up in knots.
I'm as whacked up as everybody else around here.
Do you mind?
I'd like to ask you some questions.
- For your story?
- No, no, no, off-the-record. For me.
For instance, what is going on?
Why ask me?
You and the captain are the only two onboard who know, and he won't talk.
- Nor will I.
- But why not?
I promise.
Off-the-record.
You waste your time with me.
My feelings are very deep.
Twenty, 25 years ago,
I was involved.
But no longer.
No longer.
Tell the captain.
Message from COMNATONORTH.
Permission granted.
Swell. This is one hell of a time to get permission.
That's all, Hacker.
- CIC, any information?
- Negative, sir. No contact.
Looks like you could be right, commodore.
Start radar and sonar search to maximum range...
...and somebody take Queffle's comic book away from him.
- I heard that, sir.
- Let's get chopping.
- Mr. Thresher?
- Sir.
Wind her up. Stand by for maximum speed.
Aye, aye, sir.
- Well, what do you think?
- He has gone, your submarine.
Let it go, Eric. You will find only trouble in this obsession. Let it go.
Come right to new course:
1-3-5, true.
- Speed: 5 knots.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Steer: 1-3-5, true.
- Steer: 1-3-5, true.
- 1-8-0 revolutions.
- 1-8-0 revolutions.
Secure from general quarters but maintain full watertight integrity...
...and double the lookout watch.
That, Mr. Ralston, means secure Fire Control.
Yes, captain.
Secure from general quarters, set condition three. On deck, section one.
Trussed, tied and nailed to the wall, but those idiots down in Norfolk...
...decided it'd be more sporting this way.
Big Red...
- You like that, don't you?
- Like what, captain?
When I speak disrespectfully of the high command.
Sure. Brings out that individuality.
Bridge, CIC.
We have a small radar pip...
...bearing 0-8-5.
Range: 1500 yards.
Queffle, do you hold sonar contact?
Queffle! Queffle!
It...
I don't know, captain.
- It sounds like...
- Bridge port lookout.
- I don't know.
- Snorkel on the port bow.
Range: 1000 yards.
- Come left 20 degrees.
- Left 20 degrees, sir.
- All engines ahead two-thirds.
- All engines ahead two-thirds, sir.
Sound general quarters.
Snorkel bearing 0-9-0,
500 yards. Snorkel bearing 0-9-0.
Commodore, how much air did he get?
I doubt he had time to start his air blowers.
Good. Good.
Queffle, let's sit on him.
Well, now, gentlemen, this is more like it.
- You're lucky, my captain.
- Yes, Wolfgang, I'm lucky.
I'm very lucky.
Queffle?
- Queffle!
- I don't know what's wrong.
I just couldn't read it.
- What's the trouble?
- I couldn't read the sub, sir.
- Get the doctor.
- I don't know what's wrong.
I heard sounds and they didn't make sense.
- You'll be all right. Sit here.
- I couldn't tell what they would be.
- It just didn't make any sense.
- That's all right, Queffle.
- You just take it easy. Watch him.
- Okay.
- Lucky or not, we've got him.
- Yeah.
The squeeze play is on.
- Captain.
- I want him to...
Doc, take a look at Queffle.
Take him to my cabin and fix him up.
I want him back in shape in two hours.
Can't be done, captain.
What do you mean, "can't"?
This man's had it.
He's finished.
- It was nutty, sir.
- He's young, he can snap back.
- Lf you push him any harder...
- Look, just do what I said.
- I know that this is very important...
- You know nothing, doc.
This isn't one of your lousy ulcer cases. Now get him below.
You dirty bastard.
- What did you call me?
- I called you a dirty bastard.
What do you think I am?
Some kind of joke?
I've been a Navy officer for 20 years.
I've saved more men than you have on this ship.
Who are you to tell me how to run my business? I'm a doctor.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
As I said before, this man's finished.
When you've done as ordered, don't sedate him.
I want him back here sharp.
Aye, aye, sir.
You'll have him back.
It's your order, your responsibility.
Come on, son.
Come here.
All right.
If you don't mind, Mr. Munceford, the bridge is secured.
Captain, I would like to stay...
I'd appreciate it very much,
Mr. Munceford, if you'd get below.
- Beckman!
- Sir.
Prepare for underwater transmission and get up here with a translator.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Munceford!
I have no more time or patience.
Would you please get below?
That permission specifically said,
"If the sub is still in territorial waters."
- Is that not so?
- A matter of interpretation.
But the Russian is in international waters.
- The ocean is free, my captain.
- Yes, so it is.
So you have lost your opportunity.
It was magnificent...
If I catch a man robbing my house...
...do I let him go just because he got to the sidewalk?
- You oversimplify, captain.
- All I'm going to do is challenge.
- On what grounds?
- When he surfaces, I'll tell him.
Not only will he not surface, he'll not even acknowledge your challenge.
- You will accomplish nothing.
- But I already have. Add it up.
He didn't surface during the night.
We must've been directly over him.
So he's out of breathing air.
Staying down, he couldn't charge his batteries, so he can't run.
And there he is.
So you see, commodore, we've accomplished the most important step.
We've made him desperate.
He's certainly desperate.
That is the danger. You're dealing with a desperate force.
And we're a determined force.
You are in the power here, Eric.
It is not a force. There's just you.
You mean you're trying to say that you consider me desperate.
No, captain. To be frank...
...I consider you frightening.
Captain. Snorkel in sight.
- Captain?
- Oh, Beckman, let's go.
- Williams.
- Yes, sir.
All hands. This is the captain.
What you are about to hear, the enemy commander will be unable...
...to censor or screen from his crew.
The sound waves will hit the sub's hull.
They'll get it straight.
- Ready?
- Yes, sir. Sonar speaker on.
- All set, Williams?
- Yes, sir.
To captain of unidentified submarine...
...from commander of most immediate surface vessel.
Cannot understand your refusal...
...to acknowledge request that you surface and identify yourself.
Our respective powers are not at war.
Repeat request.
Surface and identify self.
Unless I receive an immediate answer...
...I disclaim responsibility for the consequences.
End of message.
- All right, that's all. Thanks.
- Yes, sir.
Beckman.
He's got his air blowers going full blast.
How much longer before it does him any good?
One hour. It'll only prolong the agony.
- Is that it?
- Sir, that's the Novo Sibursk.
She must be about 50 miles off.
So she'll arrive, and it will end.
Thank God.
Switch back to the sub.
Nothing, sir.
- All right, get back to your station.
- Aye, sir.
No answer.
Okay, if that's how he wants it.
- I'll take the con.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- All ahead full.
- All engines ahead full, sir.
- Head directly for the snorkel.
- Directly for the snorkel.
- Those are men.
- Men answer.
Take her just enough off the bow to miss our sonar.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- How shall I log it, sir?
Designate it "unidentified floating object."
Aye, aye, sir.
In the interest of journalistic accuracy, Mr. Munceford...
...our ship will pass safely over the sub.
We won't touch it.
- Engines ahead two-thirds!
- Engines ahead two-thirds, sir.
Bring her about the starboard.
- Buck, take the con.
- Aye, sir.
Take position 2000 yards on the sub's quarter.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- How's the sonar?
Sonar operating.
- Fire Control.
- Sir.
- Report!
- All systems in automatic control, sir.
- Ready for firing when armed...
- You're not chasing whales now!
- You're pushing him too far.
- He's right. Stop this madness.
So you still think
I'm frightening, commodore?
That captain and his crew will act now like animals, fighting for survival.
- This is my job.
- It's not your job!
Break off this action, or you'll force him to fight.
So you think he's going to fire at us, do you?
I would in his place. So would you.
- CIC.
- Sir?
- What's the target aspect?
- Minimum surface area. Bow on.
Thank you.
- Fire Control.
- Sir?
Arm number one ASROC.
Aye, aye, sir.
- Armed and ready, sir.
- Captain, you are a fool!
- Finlander, leave it alone.
- Take it easy, Ralston.
All systems in automatic control, sir.
Weapons armed and ready.
- Take it easy.
- Fire Control, A-Okay, sir.
- All systems armed and ready.
- This is insane!
Oh, don't worry, commodore.
The Bedford will never fire first.
- But if he fires one, I'll fire one.
- Fire one.
- Did you disarm it?
- I don't know.
Back to your stations!
All engines stopped.
Back to your stations!
All hands! All hands!
Remain at general quarters.
Remain at general quarters.
- Sonar.
- Sir.
We tried to disarm the warhead in time, but we don't know.
Captain?
- Keep listening.
- Yes, sir.
I'm tracking the torpedo now, sir.
Touched down pretty close.
Holding contact, captain.
It's funny but I'm picking up...
Jeez!
- Sonar.
- Sir.
- Keep ranging.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain?
- Yes.
Captain, there's...
Oh, my God.
- What is it?
- Torpedoes!
Range: 2000 yards. Closing.
Right full rudder! All ahead flank!
Allison, actuate countermeasures!
Aye, sir!
Right full rudder, sir!
All engines ahead flank, sir!
Torpedoes approaching bearing
1-3-0. Four of them at intervals.
He must have fired as soon as the
ASROC broke the surface.
- What's the range?
- 1500. Coming straight on.
Range: 1300.
Speed: 40. Closing.
You have a torpedo evasion plan, haven't you?
Well, have you or haven't you?
Captain!
Come on, you knew there was this chance! Do something!
Range: 800 yards. Closing.
Finlander!
Answer me, damn you!

I was very upset by your last report that today in June 1942, the communist resistance holds such a large territory in their hands.
As long as the Axis forces are winning in the European and African fronts,
5vz it is unacceptable that you haven't managed to govern these parts.
Therefor I order that general von Stahl immediately starts with all the proceedings for total destruction of the bandits and their sympathizers in the region, which is of great importance for the lines of communication in the Balkan.
No measure is considered too brutal, especially when it's about the resistance focal point in mountain pasture Kozara.
You are personally responsible for the accomplishment of this task,
Mr Field Marshal.
I understand, my Fuhrer.
We are thankful to the people of
Kozara and Podkozarje, the people of Prijedor and Bosanska Dubica, the Yugoslav National Army units and the Air Force, and especially to the surviving fighters of Kozara, soldiers, noncommissioned officers and officers of the Banjaluka post for all the help they offered us at the time of the making of the movie.
Dad, let's run.
Dad!
Leave the board and run.
-Grab the board and run.
We're not going without you! -Don't, old man ... -Go if I tell you.
Maybe they're only passing through the village.
-Come on. -Just walk, quickly.
Out of the truck!
Immediately into quick attack.
Rally the people.
A lesson is followed.
Gather around, quickly.
Hurry up, hurry up.
It would be better if we ran away.
Take their pieces.
-Let's go together.
Closer, closer.
You there, hurry up.
Come on, faster, faster.
Hello, you two.
-We?
Take off your cap.
Give me the cap.
Give me the cap.
Give me the cap!
Activist.
-So that's how it is.
The offensive has started
I see.
Come on.
Fill the wall to the end.
Only men.
Come on, faster.
Attention.
Aim.
You, there.
Throw away the pipe.
-Mind your own business.
Fire!
Mr captain hopes, that those of you from the Podkozara villages won't collaborate any more with the partisans.
Now we need a guide.
You.
Me?
-Yes, you.
Do you maybe know a short cut to
Gornja Zarada?
I don't. I have never been on this side.
I know you.
Last year you led me away to the wrong road in Bihac.
You have confused me with someone else.
I swear I wasn't in Bihac.
He's telling the truth.
Since the war started, he didn't move from here.
-Oh really.
Home!
-Go home.
And you? Would you show us the way?
-Of course I will, why not.
Just let me put on my shoes.
-And where is your house?
This one, here.
-Quick, go.
Mr captain. Are they all going to the concentration camp?
All of them.
Let's go to the camp.
Quick, quick.
Let's go, we're leaving.
Women shouldn't go here.
Come on, faster.
Trucks, depart.
Godfather Sorga, godfather Sorga.
What is it, you poor fellow? -Save yourself.
They will kill everyone down in the village.
Take care of the cow. Anda, they're killing.
-What is it? -Take the kids and Seko.
Children!
They will destroy everything.
Run grandpa, run.
You just run, I'll manage.
They won't hurt me.
Enough!
Mirjana, faster with the cow.
Quick, quick. -Towards the road, comrades. -Squad, quick
Let's go.
Stop!
Stop, comrades.
Squad, stop!
Dragojevo has fallen.
I saw from the hill how they put people on the trucks.
I will do it sideways from this side, you, Ahmet, do it from below.
First platoon, follow me.
-Second platoon, follow me.
Second lance-corporal, across the road!
Comrade down there with the carriage.
Stop!
Lie there. Jojo, Ivica.
-Yes. -I'm here.
Block the road with the carriage.
Jojo. Wait till the trucks stop.
I  understand, commissar.
Bow down, poet, so you don't get hit by something.
First platoon. Only after Jojo shoots, we head into attack.
Lie down.
Joja.
Bow down.
Now!
Attack!
Hurry with the children.
Faster.
Airplanes.
Hide grandpa, hide!
Come back Radica.
-Come back!
Over here grandpa, over here.
Shoot!
Damn devils.
May your mothers be cursed.
My God, where are you.
They're leaving!
Get up people.
-Mitra, Mitra.
Let's go folks.
Quick, quick.
Listen, commander.
-I'll do it. -Can I?
Comrade commander. We would like to ask you something.
Why are entrenching?
-What are you doing now?
Listen.
This time it's for real.
Prijedor has fallen and the Germans have surrounded us from all sides.
Surely not from all sides.
Maybe like this.
Isn't it so, Tomislav.
-No, Jojo.
The whole of Kozara is surrounded.
-What can we do at all?
Of course we'll defend the refugees.
They're still coming from Prijedor.
If there wasn't so many people, we would have break through tonight.
But now we are stuck here.
So we partisans, are entering into a frontal battle.
Yes, that's how it is. There is no other way.
So, comrades. Entrench.
We understand.
I honorably swear, that to the last breath
I will defend my home..
That I will defend the fighting brotherhood of our nations ...
That I will destroy the Fascist criminals ...
That are robbing my homeland and killing my nation ...
If I break this holy oath and betray my nation...
I'm going.
-Who will work at home?
You shouldn't go on, Pavel.
How will you defend Kozara.
Who will take care of grandpa?
-I'm going to the couriers. I want a rifle.
Who'll give you a rifle?
Others have got it too.
I swear by the honor of a partisan fighter of the Krajina detachment...
That I will be loyal to my nation and its fight ...
Return to headquarters. and your mother Kozara.
Death to Fascism.
Freedom for the nation.
You.
You are.
We're finally together.
-But I'm leaving again.
What are you saying?
-They're sending me back to Prijedor.
When are you leaving?
Tonight.
Across the river.
We can somehow breakthrough over there.
Why are they sending you again?
I have to bring the data about the offensive. The headquarters think
I'm the most suitable for the task.
When will we be finally together again?
Pavel. Immediately after I return from Prijedor.
Then it would be the safest way if we accompany you with Jojo. It will be dusk soon.
Tell me exactly.
When do you return?
Expect me in 7 days.
I will come on this or on the lower road.
I'll be waiting for you
Be careful.
Take care.
You take care of yourself too.
You never take care of yourself.
Hi.
-Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Jojo.
Hi, Zlata. and good luck.
Commissar, will I be the first or the second witness?
You and Vuksa should agree upon it.
-I'll be the first, he'll be the second.
He's already the first in the unit.
Radio Free Yugoslavia.
News 121 , military report.
The fights are continuing for the
Stopolj villages, where the sailors of the Soviet Black Sea fleet have once again occupied the stronghold
Maxim Gorki.
East from Kharkov, the forces of the famous Red Army have driven back the impetuous attacks of the Fascist man-at-arms units of general von Kroecht.
In Yugoslavia the striking group of the proletarian brigades under the command of the famous commander Tito continues its triumphant campaign towards the west part of Bosnia.
The enemy has conquered Prijedor today, but the city is empty because of the losses it did not expect.
On the front around Kozara heavy defensive battles are going on.
In the fierce counterattacks of the
Kozara detachment at the village of
Pogledzevo the second
Ustasha brigade was destroyed yesterday.
At the lower unit of the first Krajina brigade the second alpine battalion was battered of the Prince Eugen division.
Are these those commandos?
-Come on, Ivica.
What kind of commandos, being defeated. Read on.
The nation and its fighters have become one, to defend Kozara.
Death to Fascism.
Freedom to the nation.
Come on Ivica, read again.
Radio Free Yugoslavia.
News 121, military report.
When Zlata returns it would be the best thing to do, to ask for a transfer to this squad. And you two won't have to separate any more.
With me, it was like this.
In Spain, me and Maria parted only for a day.
And we didn't see each other again.
It wasn't my fault.
And yet I still feel guilty today.
I would have had today a son almost this big.
Comrade commissar.
I read it twice to all of them.
Good.
Take the harmonica.
Don't, Ahmet. I can't sing now.
-Just that Zlata one, foe her. Come on.
Dusk has fallen, red is the moon.
Will I ever reach Cordoba?
The wind brought me your name, your eyes are looking for you, the heart awaits you, it waits.
Everything will be fine.
Vuksa is singing.
We will defend Kozara.
Good morning, godfather Obrad.
-Good morning, Mara.
Good morning.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine, Mara. -May God give.
Did you dream anything, godfather Obrad?
-I did, i have dreams.
I never dreamt.
What kind of dreams did you have, Obrad?
What else.
Good morning, Baja.
Thank you, people.
I never had a worse sleep and more beautiful dreams then now.
If they are so beautiful, you should tell them to us.. Tell them.
Anda. Let me hear to
-Come grandpa, sit down.
Tell, Obrad.
-Don't be afraid people, don't be afraid.
I dreamt that a white cloud will appear when it all starts on the top of Kozara.
And from the cloud on a white horse commander Mladen will come on horseback.
May he rest in peace, and come among us.
Mama, can i go to Vucko? -Go.
All the people and soldiers gather around him.
Mladen is looking at us and saying:
Endure, Kozara brothers.
When he says that, he immediately returns to that white cloud, which instantly turns into a red one.
Even I Obrad, dream sometimes.
But my dreams tell a different story.
-Such dreams you have.
My dreams are becoming reality.
-Why should your dreams be more real then mine?
Keep your dreams, Sorga, for yourself.
I only believe Obrad's dreams.
They are more beautiful then yours.
Ok, Anda. We'll see which ones will come true.
Some morning, before 7 am the fascists knock on the door.
Stop people, my child is waking up, so his father kisses him for the last time.
The Pikes are flying, the airplanes are flying.
To destroy the gypsy homes.
Airplanes!
Did they head towards the village?
They did.
Then take care so they don't come up behind my back.
Wait here.
Squad, get ready.
Forward, forward.
Get ready, get ready.
And undo the bombs, comrades.
Get down, comrade.
Wait for the mark.
-Load the guns.
Get ready, comrades.
Wait for the command.
Forward, forward.
Wait for my mark.
Ok.
Commander.
Can I use just one bullet for that yellow dude with the whistle?
-No, keep him in sight.
Shall we go?
Let's go.
At your will.
Forward.
Forward.
Lie down.
Bombs.
Second platoon, attack!
-Forward, at will.
Platoon, follow me.
Forward.
Back to the pits.
Take your weapons and get back.
Please, don't shoot me.
Please, don't shoot me.
Beware now, yellow one.
Well done, Jojo.
-Thank you.
He was a commando from the Prince Eugen division.
Hey, partisan.
-Partisan.
Comrade partisans.
Get up. -We are militiamen, peasants. Don't shoot.
Get up.
All of you get up.
Hands up.
Is there anyone here of the Ustasha?
No.
-Onward, drop your guns.
Jojo, Jojo.
-Pick up the guns.
Pick up all the guns.
Pick them up, Bajo, pick.
Come on, comrade.
Pick up the guns, quickly.
Was it interesting , Baja?
It was fine at me.
It could have been better.
Comrade commander.
-Wait. What are you saying?
You confiscated the mortars?
Come, send me two of them with mines.
And I'll send you a machine gun.
Ok, bye.
What is it, Jojo?
-What will we do with the prisoners, commander?
Are they all militiamen? -They are.
Where should they go? Who will take them over?
Take them to the battalion headquarters.
They'll know what to do with them.
How many of them are there?
-We don't count the militiamen.
I understand, comrade commander.
Those in the battalion headquarters make a decision and continue resting.
Take off your clothes! Mitra, search them.
Take off everything but your pants.
Commander.
You're wounded, Marinko.
-You should lie down. I'm sorry.
Get well, son.
People.
There they're taking the prisoners.
These traitors burnt down our houses. 
Get them!
Leave them alone, leave them alone.
Come on people, get them.
-Leave them alone!
Calm down!
People, people.
This is not how it should be.
These are prisoner.
I'm taking them to the battalion headquarters,
I have to hand them over.
If someone doesn't like that, you all know me.
I'm Jojo, from Vuksa's squad.
Prisoners, forward.
Milja.
Milja.
Listen. I have a gun and I have you.
We only have to get married now.
So everyone knows that you are mine.
Listen, Mitra.
In first row, hell.
When I was in Galicia, we entrenched ourselves to the neck.
That's why I am still burdened with this.
And these people of ours are jumping here and there.
And they don't even know what is in front and what is behind.
In the second row ...
What are you two doing?
We'll get married father, when the offensive is over.
Where is your kerchief?
-Give me the kerchief. -Here.
Well, you just tie it.
It's the task of the elect.
Come on, will you.
Well, children.
Almighty, help us.
Protect the young.
Bless Mitro and Milja and that I live to see a grandson.
Oh, Lord.
Bless Miljo, who fights with all the heart against the devilish force.
Oh, Lord.
What can I do, Jojo.
That's how I am.
I'm different then you or Mitra.
I tend to have a girlfriend everywhere.
If I lose one, I quickly head towards another one.
I never surrender.
And my word of honor, each of them loves me.
Jojo, it's a matter of each individual's feelings. -Yes, yes.
But...
What is a feeling anyway?
Is it
THAT.
Exactly this.
I have a feeling you will become a great man. Just like our poet.
If only his doesn't meet a grenade before.
He's very confused in battle.
But as long as he's with me, you won't have to worry about him.
Let's go Jojo.
It's time.
If it comes from your side, whistle. -Don't worry.
I'm the new connection.
Zlata was captured the day before yesterday and shot.
Damn them.
Yes, we couldn't save her.
The information about the offensive is sent through the new channel to the regional committee.
General von Stahl is preparing the biggest assault till now from all sides. There's more then 50.000 of them.
And how are you doing?
We're not giving up, not giving up.
You say Zlata was killed.
Tell Ahmet she was brave to the very end. Hi, comrade.
Hi.
Ahmet, Ahmet.
The connection came.
It say that Zlata will come in 15 days and the report has to be sent to the regional committee.
Where is the connection?
-Left already.
Repeat it to me one more time.
Word for word.
What did the connection tell you about Zlata?
-I told you everything already.
Word for word.
What now ... -It's ok, Jojo.
We'll wait for it next time too.
Dad, dad. Uncle Obrad will take Zana away.
Obrad.
Obrad.
Where are you taking Zana?
Didn't you say you would give an ox?
If I kept my word, godfather, you should give away your ox too.
-I won't give it.
I gave enough. I'm not the state.
What is Kozara, if not the state?
We all are the state.
Are you aware of that?
This is my only one.
-Nothing here is mine or yours.
It all goes to the collective kitchen.
-What will I eat now?
Where will I get it? -You and your children won't be hungry.
As long as it all assembles in one.
And what then?
Then we'll be chewing beech leafs together.
I won't be chewing. I'll rather take my family to Slavonija.
They say that some have already left for it.
But I won't give you the ox.
-Sorga.
Godfather Obrad, you're right.
Take your ox and bring it to the military positions.
Sorga, we won't die from hunger.
You won't give it.
And you also won't take it away.
I'll take it myself to slaughter.
I am the state too, just as much as you two and all the others.
Jojo, you know what we think.
I know.
I know.
You and Mitra think, that I didn't do right.
You didn't do right.
Why would I lie to a man.
I felt sorry for Ahmet.
You could have told him that they shot her, you fool.
I have been a fighter for a year and I know when I can say something,
You still should have told him the truth.
And if you're a human and a fighter, go to Ahmet and tell him that as a comrade you weren't able to tell him the truth.
Ok.
I'll go tell him.
I'll tell him I meant no harm.
Wait Jojo.
Let's not tell him yet.
Let's keep it between ourselves.
Such news is never too late to tell.
They're attacking the forth battalion.
They broke through?
Is that possible?
Yes.
Yes.
I understand.
I understood everything.
They broke thought at the forth battalion.
They drove them back three times but the cavalry attacked them.
The detachment headquarters is ordering a breakthrough in this sector in the direction of Karan. Tonight.
They're informing you to prepare the refugees.
So, Vuksa, it has started.
-It seems so.
I'm going.
People. We have seen with our own eyes, how they broke through at the forth  battalion.
They broke through to Pastirovo with the help of the cavalry. Really.
In won't take more then three hours when blood will be spilt here.
Take your things and save yourself, as good as you can.
Dear god, where should we go.
-My god, what now.
Anda, with the army towards Sleme.
-There is no army there anymore.
They killed everyone of them.
We hardly saved ourselves with the wounded.
People, then it's our turn.
Prepare for slaughter .
Quiet!
Come here.
Wait, calm down.
Why did you get so frightened?
We're in trouble. Don't you know, that they broke thought at Krajina?
I know. That's why we'll try to break through as well.
We'll be breaking thought across Karan and Grmec. We'll all save ourselves.
We will, if God gives.
But is it in our power, Ahmet?
-It is, there is no other way.
We have to break through.
-We have to as there is no other way.
We certainly won't surrender.
We won't, Sorga.
We won't.
As long as we're alive, the German will not kill you.
Get ready.
And don't take too much.
Ok. What about the cattle?
What should we do with the cattle?
Take it with you.
Separate.
Take the pregnant women.
Hurry up people, we're leaving.
The wounded on the carriages.
Stop.
Read squad, stop.
Sit down, comrades.
We'll check the weapons again.
Members of the party and members of the League of the Communist Youth of Yugoslavia, machine gunners, bomber volunteers, forward.
Bombers, let's take off our shoes.
Sister, take the dog and keep it with yourself.
It can't be with us in the squad.
Hi.
Radica, Radica.
Where are you going, stay here.
You have been gone for two days.
We're going to break through, I'm in a hurry.
Radica ...
-Hi.
Radica left.
-Follow him.
I'll manage with the children.
Ok. But keep up to the others.
Don't separate.
I'm sorry, Baja, for that before.
I simply didn't want to believe it.
I forgive you, as it is you.
Now you can join the bombers.
Miljo, Miljo.
Don't cry, Miljo.
This is my son.
My blood.
Hold on, Mitra, hold on.
-Don't worry, dad.
It will all be fine.
We'll break through.
We will.
Fight, my ...
Let's go, grandpa.
We have been thinking.
Will we tell Ahmet?
No, don't tell him anything.
He's coming. I'll tell him after the breakthrough.
When do I attack with the rear squad?
The shock brigades will start any moment.
You jump in when you realise, that we will need help.
-I'll go prepare them.
Ok.
Good luck tonight, Vule.
-Hi.
Hi, Jojo and Ivica.
-Hi, comrade commissar.
Bombers, prepare the bombs.
Keep it quiet comrade, quiet.
Have some patience.
Get ready, rear, we'll start any moment.
Let's go into breakthrough.
Stand up, comrades.
Milja, the bombers have set off.
The bombers have set off.
Radica.
Radica, give me a bomb.
You too, Jojo.
Fire!
Radica, Radica.
Forward!
Forward!
Forward, Kozara!
Forward, Kozara!
Forward.
Forward.
Comrades, Ahmet has fallen.
Forward.
Ahmet has fallen.
Forward, company.
Be brave, boys.
Forward, comrades.
Jojo is ahead of you.
Comrades, enough.
Forward.
Quickly comrades.
To the hills, quick.
Mom, grandpa fell behind.
Anda, Anda.
Tanks.
They're coming from the other side too.
Let's run.
You go.
Run, my love.
-I don't want to, mom.
Go on, run away my love.
-I don't want.
Mom!
Look.
Whose are you?
Partisans, grandpa.
Communists.
You see, comrade, I fell behind a bit. Where are the people?
Over here, grandpa.
And now just straight forward, grandpa.
-Thank you, son. May God...
Mummy is sleeping.
Mummy is sleeping here.
Mummy is sleeping here.
Mummy sleeps.
Mummy is here.
Commander, may I go to the field, to bury Radica?
I would need an hour to wait for dad and Milja.
Ok.
Sorga, did your wife and children come trough the circle? -They didn't, they stayed in Kozara. If I don't go immediately, I will be too late.
Go.
And get back soon.
Get up.
Get up, comrades.
Come on, get up.
Listen.
The breakthrough didn't succeed.
Only part of the detachment and our squad managed to break through and escape the circle.
It's still thundering across all of Kozara.
The majority of the people and fighters stayed in the circle.
We must go back to help them at a new breakthrough.
Get some sleep and rest comrades.
Tonight we return to the circle.
-Listen, Vuksa.
Tonight we fell like dogs.
A lot of comrades fell.
We were breaking through the circle to run out of it, not to return into it.
My family escaped from it.
I won't be going back.
It's easy for you.
Mine are still caught there.
There are also some of us that have no family in the circle or outside of it.
We'll go wherever it is needed.
-Listen, comrades.
Those who don't want to return, should lay down the guns and disappear from the squad.
Forgive me.
Jakov, give me the gun and go.
-I won't
Jakov, give me the gun and go.
-I won't.
You didn't give it to me.
But remember:
I will go with the squad, because I don't want to break it up.
-Comrade was clear about it.
Jojo, don't provoke.
-What did you say, Jojo?
Enough!
Calm down.
You're right, Jakov.
The squad should not be broken up.
Anyone else that doesn't want to return to Kozara?
Ok, get some rest.
It hasn't been easy on any of us and we were all born by our mother.
Comrades. Each will give away 10 cartridges for the machine gunners.
We will move to
Kozara, to the starting point.
To the place from which we came out of the circle.
As soon as they leave, we'll cross the road. -No, Milja, wait a bit.
Let's find another spot to cross.
-I must find Mitra tonight.
Who knows where the squad is headed to.
-I'm going.
Ok.
Stop, stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Anda, Anda!
Fire.
Fire.
Comrade commander, I'm here
-Ok, Mitra, ok.
I'm coming from the battalion headquarters.
Comrades, all the plans for the renewed breakthrough have failed.
And it has been ordered that all the units should divide into smaller groups.
The enemy is getting bigger, and we're getting smaller.
People have been hiding in earth cabins, all across Kozara.
Our squad also has to divide into smaller groups.
There is no other solution.
Why did you bring us here then?
Why?
I thought that we would manage to break through again with the other units.
Oh you thought, did you.
You and the headquarters really imagined this nicely.
First we defend Kozara, then we break through from the circle, and then back again. Our squad was saved. Do you realise that?
More then you do.
I didn't order it because of myself,
I did it because of the people.
Stop speaking in the name of the nation.
Now you're breaking up the squad.
And for that you will be held responsible, sooner or later.
You think that I have led you badly?
And that I will be held responsible for it?
You will, Vuksa.
Someone will survive and ...
-You will, you will.
I will.
Right now.
Because we don't know who that someone will be.
That's why, as long as I'm here ...
Well, shoot me!
Shoot.
What are you waiting for?
Vuksa.
Vuksa.
What's wrong with you?
You know I couldn't point a gun at you.
It's ok, Jakov.
We're tired, aren't we?
We're breaking up.
Comrades, break through in the night.
Only Kozara can save us now.
Save us and the nation.
If you fall into battle with the enemy shoot till the last bullet.
And save one for yourself.
Let's die in a Kozara way.
Those that survive rake ...
The rallying point is here.
Let's go, comrades.
Hurry up.
And bury the mine throwers as quick as possible.
Hi Bajo.
Hi Sorga.
-Well, commander.
Eventually it has happened that I can give orders to myself.
Oh, Jojo. It's hard to give orders to yourself, let alone to the others.
-Commander.
I'm going with you.
-Ok, Jakov.
Hi, Jojo.
-Hi.
Hi, Jakov.
-Hi, Jojo.
Ivica.
We're going together.
-Thank you, Jojo.
But it would be easier for you without me.
-Don't worry, comrade.
You'll read me some poem.
Let's go.
One moment.
Let's rather head in this direction.
Let's go.
Make some place in the earth cabin for the wounded.
Let's go comrades.
Faster, faster.
Hold on, people.
Stop.
Go back.
The rakes are coming from that part of the road.
Dad. Do you know where Milja is?
I have looked for her everywhere.
What Milja.
Who knows where she's roaming.
Don't you see that they are pursuing us from all sides.
What devil sent you back to Kozara?
To this hell.
-We have returned.
Go on, I'll stop them.
-You won't.
Run, son.
Save yourself, run.
Run dad, run.
I'll stop them.
Run to the forest.
People, Mitro has been hit.
Don't be afraid.
Mitra
Here you have Milja.
Milja is here.
Milja is here.
Mitra.
I'll do it for my Marinko too.
Enough, enough.
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
Interesting.
There are no communists here?
There are communists.
You, a communist?
Yes.
Bravo, bravo.
Good.
Everyone!
To the concentration camp.
Mom will come.
Hold it, Miso.
Forward.
Quick, quick.
They're here.
They're heading towards us.
Quiet.
Jakov, you stay here.
Get the Ustasha into the hole.
No one should stay outside.
Come along, comrades.
Take them away.
Quick, quick.
Put them in the corner.
What will you write about this day?
I don't know.
Friday as Thursday.
Thursday as Wednesday.
Wednesday as Tuesday.
You as a scholar could write a poem about the love between
Ahmet and Zlata.
All the youth in Kozara would sing it.
I thought, it could start like this:
Listen, comrade dear.
To the  misfortunate story, that has happened.
Just listen, comrade dear.
To the misfortunate story, that has happened.
In Kozara in these days
They were separated by a deadly wound.
First you write.
Oh how the proletarians would sing it.
I'll leave with them as soon as possible.
This is life. You disappear at
Prijedor and you appear at the copper mine.
Nobody is on your back.
I have enough of everything.
I wont go further with this detachment, then till Kozara.
-Water.
Be still.
I'll bring it to you.
You grab it by the horns and
I'll milk it.
Milk her fast.
Jojo.
Damn it. We can't shoot because of the wounded.
Quiet.
I will be quiet, if you let me go.
I will, later.
Chetnik, Chetnik.
What are you doing, are we going?
Chetnik.
Chetnik.
Faster.
Go.
Hello.
What happened?
-Partisans.
What happened?
Nothing, go inside.
Hans, Hans!
Hans, Chetnik, Chetnik,
Ustasha.
Hans, Hans.
Help.
Help.
Battalion, attention!
To the left!
Direction, rallying point.
Come out, people.
The offensive is over.
Everyone to the rallying point.
Let's pay our respect to the fallen.
Come on, comrades.
In a column, one by one.
Jojo.
I'm here. -Sing, Jojo.
-I will, commander.
Song.

Aussteigen.
Tor aufmachen!
Go inside.
Hurry up.
This way.
Hurry up.
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?
- I...
- No, that's mine.
Allez... hup!
How far are the trees, Danny?
- Over 200 feet.
- Yeah, I'd say 300.
Long ways to dig.
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.
Willie, you think X got away?
He'd have sent us word, somehow, if he had.
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.
Good morning, Group Captain.
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer, you are to be liaison between the prisoners and the colonel.
He wishes to make clear to you certain matters of...
- The word is "policy"?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Herein.
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.
I am Colonel Von Luger.
Please sit down.
Group Captain Ramsey, in the past four years the Reich has been forced to spend an enormous amount of time, energy, manpower and equipment hunting down escaping prisoner-of-war officers.
At least it's rather nice to know you're wanted, isn't it?
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty of all officers to try to escape.
If they can't, it is their duty to cause the enemy to use an inordinate number of troops to guard them, and their sworn duty to harass the enemy to the best of their ability.
Yes, I know.
The men under your authority have been most successful.
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.
Caught in the North Sea, escaped, recaptured, escaped, recaptured.
Archibald "Archie" Ives, eleven escape attempts.
Even tried to jump out of the truck coming here.
Dickes, William.
Known to have participated in digging of
11 escape tunnels.
Flight Lieutenant Willinski, four escapes.
MacDonald, nine.
Hendley, the American, five.
Haynes, four. Sedgwick, seven.
The list is almost endless.
One man here has made 17 attempted escapes.
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.
- Quite.
- And it must stop!
Colonel, do you expect officers to forget their duty?
No.
It is because we expect the opposite that we have brought you here.
This is a new camp.
It has been built to hold you and your men.
It is organized to incorporate all we have learned of security measures.
And, in me, you will not be dealing with a common jailer, but with a staff officer personally selected for the task by the Luftwaffe high command.
We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully.
Very wise.
You will not be denied the usual facilities.
Sports, a library, a recreation hall...
And, for gardening, we will give you tools.
We trust you to use them for gardening.
Devote your energies to these things.
Give up your hopeless attempts to escape.
And, with intelligent cooperation, we may all sit out the war... as comfortably as possible.
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.
Of course. Why do you come to Germany?
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?
- In 1812 they burned your Capitol.
- That's propaganda.
It's in the history books. I read it.
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.
Yeah. No tools.
Hey, Virgil.
Hey, did you see the cooler?
Boy, is it ever a big one!
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.
Those two guys who were with us in the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.
What were their names?
It was Jackson and, uh...
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Danny. Who are they?
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.
Willie, cigarettes.
Danny and I have a blitz in mind.
Could you put on a brief show for the goons?
Sure, man. What'll it be?
An all-out go?
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles?
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!
- Are you pushing me?
- That's mine, you son of a...
Tovarich.
Spasibo.
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!
It's all right, mate.
We're just having a friendly little argument.
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.
You, too!
Get away! Get back in your huts!
Go on!
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only one other American in the whole camp.
Some guy named Hendley in the RAF Eagle squadron.
Hey, you got something goin' already?
See the way the goons got those towers placed?
There's a blind spot through the middle.
A blind spot?
A guy could stand at that wire and not be seen by either tower.
They'd never see me, especially at night.
You're crazy.
You think so?
Let's find out right now.
Now, the next step's a little tricky.
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.
I think I'll take a little walk.
Abteilung marsch!
Tovarich.
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.
- Let me have it, mate.
- Ja vas lublu.
- Ja vas...
- Lublu.
Lublu? Ja vas lublu.
Ja vas lublu.
- What's it mean?
- I love you.
I love you? What bloody good is that?
I don't know. I wasn't going to use it myself.
Halt!
Out.
- Out!
- Nyet, nyet. Tovarich.
Your friend, yes?
Tovarich.
And who vouches for you, Lieutenant Willinski?
Get out, Sedgwick.
Spasibo.
Marsch!
Hold it, hold it!
- Your name?
- Ives.
Ives. Ives.
Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.
The photograph doesn't do you justice.
I'd like to see one of you under similar circumstances.
I will not take action against you now.
This is the first day here, and there has been much stupidity and carelessness... on both sides.
Hey! Get out!
Nicht schieben! Nicht schieben!
Don't shoot!
You fool! To cross the wire is death!
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.
Gettin' my baseball.
Stop this!
Get over the wire immediately!
- OK.
- You stay there!
Out of the way. Out.
What are you doing over here by the wire?
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...
Achtung!
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...
I was trying to cut my way through your wire, because I wanna get out.
Durchsuchen Sie ihn.
- Do you speak German?
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
- Wire cutters.
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite a number of British officers in this war.
And I flatter myself that we understand one another.
You are the first American officer I have met.
Hilts, isn't it?
Captain Hilts, actually.
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.
I suppose what's called in the American army a "hotshot pilot."
Unfortunately, you were shot down anyway.
So we are both grounded for the duration of the war.
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.
I plan on doing so before the war's over.
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?
- About 99 percent.
- Perhaps while you are with us, you will have a chance to learn some.
Ten days isolation, Hilts.
- Captain Hilts.
- Twenty days.
Right.
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?
Cooler.
- Name?
- Ives.
- Flying Officer Ives.
- Cooler, 20 days.
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.
- Hilts.
- Yeah?
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?
No, I was in college.
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.
- How tall are you, Ives?
- Five feet four. Why?
Oh, just wondering.
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.
- Bicycles?
- Motorcycles.
Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?
No, horse racing. Jockey.
Jockey.
Jockey.
Hilts?
Are you there, Hilts?
Yeah, I'm here.
Don't you have them in the States? Jockeys?
- Sure.
- They were the days.
Saturday nights in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.
You had to fight off the birds.
You know, birds.
Girls, man. Girls.
Do you not have them in the States?
Hilts? Are you there, Hilts?
Ives.
What?
You know the kind of clay and gravel we got here in the compound?
How many feet do you think you could get through in eight hours?
I could go through this dirt here like the bit on an end of an auger.
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood, and getting the dirt out, that's what you've to worry about.
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.
How are you going to get the dirt out?
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.
Aye.
Well, what do you think?
I must say, it's an interesting first 20 minutes.
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.
As the sergeant out there says, this is only the first day.
Eric.
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.
He has arrived.
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.
I suggest this prisoner be kept under the strictest security confinement permanently.
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.
We have reason to believe he is the leader of numerous criminal escape attempts.
Squadron Leader Bartlett has been three months in your care, and the Gestapo has only "reason to believe"?
If he once more falls into our hands, he will not be so lucky.
Air-force officer prisoners are the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not the SS... or the Gestapo.
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.
That is why he is returned, for the moment, to your care.
Of course, if the Luftwaffe is not up to the task, the prisoners will find themselves totally in our charge.
We regretfully are not so professionally understanding.
Squadron Leader Bartlett, if you escape again and be caught, you will be shot.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Herr Kuhn.
Nehmen Sie dem Mann diese Dinger ab.
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?
Well, it's new.
- Here. Let's find you a bed.
- Thanks.
Come in.
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.
The fellows wanted to put up a welcome committee, but that's for later.
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.
New camp, expert guards, the elite.
You met the commandant?
Yes, I did.
What were the Gestapo and the SS doing with you?
They wanted to find out who helped me to the border.
Who else is here? Cavendish?
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.
- Blythe?
- Yes.
Almost the whole X organization.
Almost. They cleaned out all the other camps and dumped us in this one.
As Von Luger put it,
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."
There's madness in their method.
- What about Tommy Bristol?
- No, but there's an American, Hendley.
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.
Last of the tea until the Red Cross gets through again.
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?
Not nearly as rough as I now intend to give them.
Roger, personal revenge must be kept out of what we have to do here.
Too many lives are at stake.
What my personal feelings are is of no importance.
You appointed me Big X, and it's my duty to harass, confound and confuse the enemy to the best of my ability.
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink in this Third Reich of theirs that thousands of troops'll be tied up here looking after us.
How?
By putting more men out of this... perfect camp of theirs than have ever escaped before.
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.
The goons have put every escape artist in Germany here. You said so yourself.
Have you thought of what it might cost?
I've thought of the humiliation if we just tamely submit, knuckle under and crawl.
Surely you don't advocate that, do you, sir?
I have to point out one thing to you, Roger.
No matter how unsatisfactory this camp may be, the high command have left us in the hands of the Luftwaffe, not the Gestapo and the SS.
Look, sir, you talk about the high command of the Luftwaffe, then the SS and the Gestapo.
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.
There's only one way to put it, sir.
They are the common enemies of everyone who believes in freedom.
If they didn't approve of Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?
I have no argument with you, Roger.
As senior officer,
I'm merely pointing out a pertinent fact.
When are you calling a meeting, X?
Tonight.
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the immortal words of our new commandant.
"Devote your energies to things other than escape, and sit out the war as comfortably as possible."
Well, that's exactly what we're going to do.
We're going to devote our energies to sports and gardening, all the cultural pursuits as far as they're concerned.
In fact, we're going to put the goons to sleep.
Meanwhile... we dig.
Now, even a superficial look at the compound shows us that huts 104 and five are closest to the woods.
The first tunnel goes out from 105, directly east under the cooler and the wire.
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down 30 feet before we go horizontal.
That'll rule out any question of sound detection or probing.
All right, Roger, but... did you say the first tunnel?
I did. There'll be three.
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.
If the goons find one, we'll move into the other.
How many men do you plan to take out, Roger?
Two hundred and fifty.
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Mostly civilian clothes.
Yes, but, uh...
OK, Roger.
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations, compasses for all the walkers.
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.
- We're going to tunnel.
- Splendid.
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, in charge of traps.
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions.
Mac, of course, will take care of intelligence.
Hendley. We haven't met.
- Scrounger?
- Right.
Dennis, maps and surveys.
Colin, you'll take your usual job.
Eric, how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated three tunnels, but we'll manage.
Roger, who's going to handle security for all this?
You are. I want a system of stooges covering this compound from front to back, checking every goon in and out.
I want a signal system so perfect that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet of any of the huts in which we're working, we can shut down without a sign.
Well, I don't think there's much point in discussing any more now.
I'll meet each of you on the exercise circuit, we'll pound out the details.
- Nothing else, is there, Mac?
- I shouldn't think so, Roger.
Oh, hello. My name's Blythe.
Hendley.
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.
Oh, not hunting. Watching.
Oh, a... bird watcher?
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.
I suppose you have bird watchers in the States?
Yes, we have some.
Tea?
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.
- Where's your kit?
- This is it.
The rest was confiscated in the last shakedown.
The goons didn't appreciate some of my more... personal items.
Such as.
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.
I'll need a camera.
- What kind?
- A good one.
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter should do all right.
All right.
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.
- Only one?
- Two would be better.
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.
I must have used these wretched leaves about 20 times.
It's not that I mind so much.
Tea without milk is so uncivilized.
Yeah. I'll get our wood.
Close up! Close up!
Close up!
Close up!
Close up!
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!
Splendid.
Blythe, what are you doing here?
I'm in Photographic Aerial Reconnaissance Interpretation.
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?
I'm the forger.
Forgers are installing themselves in the recreation hut.
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 110.
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.
- 109? Right.
- I'll work in 107.
For now, Danny, Willie and their trap team will be in 104.
I want to take a chance on the tunnels and press ahead without any shoring-up.
We will need timber for the shafts and the entrance chambers.
Hendley figures there are 36 empty bunks.
We can tear up 15 and move the men around so the goons won't miss them.
The rest will come from strips off the wall.
Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
Not yet.
He's working on some steel for a pick that Danny needs.
Hey! What the hell is going on here?
Turn the water off!
Get your hands away!
Get away!
Hey! What the hell's going on there?
Stop this nonsense!
Get away! Turn the water off!
Somewhere!
In the stove, we keep fire burning, always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 113's washroom.
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.
Not when you're organized, Mac.
- We're ready.
- Big enough?
It's perfect. Right through the middle of the foundation.
Good luck to us, Danny.
Why 17?
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.
All right?
It's good.
It's very good.
- Raus!
- Get out!
- Get out!
- Raus hier!
Raus! Fertig machen da hinten.
Du da hinten. Raus hier!
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?
Mopping up.
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.
Raus!
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.
Raus.
No. I vote no. Look, we've put the goons to sleep exactly like you said.
But just one little thing like this and we're up the creek without a paddle.
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.
I understand you two are contemplating a blitz-out.
Where'd you hear that... sir?
MacDonald. It's Mac's job to know everything that goes on.
We thought, perhaps, we might talk it over.
Why? It's only a two-man job.
Everybody in the camp is supposed to clear all escape attempts in advance with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.
We don't necessarily want to interfere.
It's just that...
Well, what sort of blitz were you contemplating?
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire, a blind spot.
Then we dig down, take the dirt, spread it on top so it won't make a pile, and then straight out.
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs in front, pushes the dirt behind him.
I stash it behind me, then we burrow through the dirt like a couple of moles.
By dawn we're under the wire, across the open space, into the woods and gone.
Well, uh...
When do you intend to try this?
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.
Hilts, this may not be quite the right time for this sort of thing.
Look, sir, I've been in the bag nearly three years now, bloody close to being wire-happy.
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.
It'll work. I know it will.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- Hilts... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.
We shove it up and make air holes as we go along.
Good night, sir.
Now, why didn't anybody think of that before?
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.
But it'll bring every goon in the camp down on top of us.
I don't know. Perhaps we're being too clever.
If we stop all the breakouts, it may only convince the goons that we must be tunneling.
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going to be in the cooler for an awful long time.
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.
This is the dirt from the compound.
This is from the tunnel.
Wherever we put it, they're going to spot it a mile away.
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.
It's the first place the ferrets'd look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.
Maybe we could dry it to the same color.
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.
If you must think, for God's sake, think clearly.
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?
We can't destroy the dirt and we can't eat it.
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.
That's as far as my thinking takes me.
Didn't they teach you promptness in the RN?
You'll never believe it, but I think I have the solution.
The problem is somehow to get rid of this tunnel dirt over the compound.
Well, of course.
Would you mind?
Now... you fill these bags with the dirt from the tunnel.
Then, wearing them inside your trousers, you wander out into the compound where you pull these strings in your pockets.
Out come the pins.
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.
Unless you're a fool, the ferrets won't see a thing.
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. it works.
Mac, this is what we'll do.
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.
Nice garden you've got, sir.
All right. Let's look sharp.
That looks sharp.
Sir.
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.
I am sorry the soil here isn't better suited to your men's purpose.
We'll manage, sir.
I must say I am surprised with the extent of this activity, Group Captain.
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.
- The English are keen on gardening.
- Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.
Good point.
I have the nasty feeling he knows exactly what we're doing.
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.
Here we are. Now, let's see.
Biscuits, two packets.
Coffee, two tins.
Bovril, one jar.
Cigarettes, six packets.
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Blackcurrant jam, Cavendish.
And marmalade, mine.
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.
That cleans out the gift food for the entire organization.
Now, the first thing we need is the new form of travel permit.
The forgers have no idea what it looks like.
I'll see what I can do.
And, of course, any other identity cards, personal papers, documents you can put your hands on.
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.
Good luck.
O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?
Patience is a virtue, Roger.
Yes, I know, but the diggers can only work when the trap's open, and this is holding us up very badly.
- Is it finished?
- Of course.
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.
Mac.
Excellent.
Have it in by tomorrow night.
Christ the Lord
- Got a light?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?
I'll smoke it later, when I'm off duty.
Thank you.
You probably have a couple of roommates, huh?
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.
No, no. Red sky in the morning, sailor takes warning.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
It was a red sky last night.
I never heard that before.
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.
- You were a Boy Scout? So was I.
- Really?
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.
I was working on my 20th when the government abolished scouting and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.
Werner, you think you'll stay in the army after the war?
No. I'm not a well man.
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?
Yes. I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.
Our dentist here is a butcher.
But don't tell anyone I said so.
- It's a soldier's right to complain.
- Maybe in your army, but here?
One little criticism, and... to the Russian front.
Is that so? Terrible.
That's terrible.
Werner.
Why don't we go into my room?
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...
I was just gonna make some coffee.
Real coffee.
Coffee, coffee, coffee.
Where is it?
Marmelade. Ist ja wunderbar.
My grandmother keeps sending me this stuff.
- Ach du lieber Gott, Schokolade.
- Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.
- Von Lugers Butter.
- Yeah. Keep it.
Nein. I must go.
It's OK. You can keep it.
We're friends.
With you in the cooler, will we be friends?
I must report this.
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.
- I'll never be able to eat it all.
- Nein, ich muss jetzt weg.
I'm sorry. All right.
Forget it. Forget it.
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember, is the voice of the Nelles warbler.
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman, the masked shrike.
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.
The shrike impales his foes on the spikes of thorn bushes.
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the coloring.
Uniform black above, from head to tail.
A black rump, a black crown with a bold white flash, and a white line over the eye.
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country...
Hendley. Sit down.
You'll find drawing materials on the table.
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country, olive groves and gardens.
Well, Hendley, have you taken to birds, too, now?
Yeah. Stick around. You might learn something.
I have better things to do than draw birds.
The voice is a monotonous succession of scratchy, complaining notes.
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to cross a frontier.
Here's another one.
Which one's the forgery?
- That one.
- That's right.
They both are.
What's holding us up now is the new form of this travel permit.
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.
And a military identity card.
And a...
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.
What appears to be the ferret assignments for the next week.
You get ten out of ten for this, old boy.
Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?
- It's on loan.
In order to get the right amount of outfits, Roger,
I suggest that we work mainly from service uniforms.
I can do double-breasteds, single-breasteds, and rather nice lounge suits.
Lapels. I can do quite a lot of things with those.
I can have them deep like that, or high ones like that.
Here's one that we're working on right now.
Oh, yes. What about buttons?
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.
And, uh... here's one that I dyed with a bottle of blue ink.
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?
The goons'd have a field day if they crashed in on this lot.
That's Sorren's department.
Now, I've started working on the other materials.
This blanket.
Particularly the stripes. Marvelous.
- Coats.
- Yes.
I've got the chaps working on these all over the compound.
Those battle dresses,
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.
I'll have to get the chaps to make those into some sort of working man's outfits.
Blanket ticking.
Now, I've made these into rather nice little Waistcoats.
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.
Just take a look at this, Roger.
Now, this blanket material, we scrape this down until it's really smooth, and then dye it with boot polish.
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.
Good morning, Hilts.
Well, if you're here to find out if I'm going out again, I am.
- When?
- Seventeen days, 7th of July.
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.
- Is Ives going with you?
- Yeah, if he wants to.
You, uh... You know that Ives is close to cracking?
Yeah.
Better for him to go out in the tunnel, huh?
Safer.
Right.
It's possible for one man to get out through the wire, even get away, but there are in fact a considerable number of people besides yourself in this camp who are trying to escape.
I appreciate that.
Something's coming, I can feel it, and it's coming right around the corner at me, Squadron Leader.
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.
Yes, well... as I was saying, uh, Hilts, we have maps of Germany, general maps, that is.
We have all the information we need for the escape routes out of Germany.
But what we do not have... is a clear idea of what's 500 yards beyond those trees.
We've tried every goon in the camp. No go.
We must know the exact position of the local town.
We want to know where we hit the main roads.
Where the police stations are, where they've got their roadblocks.
And, most important of all, we've got to know how to get from here to the railway station.
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,
I'm not gonna be making maps for you guys.
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear if they're shooting at me with howitzers.
- Understandable.
- Completely.
I mean, I'd like to help, but...
Interesting idea.
- How many you taking out?
- Two hundred and fifty.
Two hundred and fifty?
Yeah.
You're crazy. You too.
Two hundred and fifty guys just walking down the road, just like that.
Well, some on the road, some by train, some cross-country.
They'll have forged papers, clothes, maps, compasses, rations.
You're gonna alert every goon in the country.
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork is gonna be out looking for you.
They're gonna swoop down and scoop you up so fast it'd make your head swim.
Yes, well... thanks, anyway.
If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.
- Any time.
Wait a minute.
You aren't seriously suggesting that if I get through the wire and case everything out there and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown back in the cooler so you can get the information you need?
Yes. One has to ask some very strange things in the job I have.
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.
Check.
- Herr Hendley, I...
- Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.
What's the matter, Werner?
My wallet, my papers, my identity card.
Gone. I lost them. Everything.
He lost his wallet.
Do you realize what would happen if Strachwitz found this out?
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.
I've looked every place, every place.
I must have lost them while I was in here.
- No.
- Yes.
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.
Werner.
Not now. It might look a little peculiar if you and I were seen probing around at this time of night.
Look, I'll find them.
I promise you I'll find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.
- Thank you.
- Forget it.
- Werner.
- Yes?
There is one small favor.
A camera.
We want to take some snapshots.
You know... keepsakes.
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.
Focal-plane shutter.
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.
Let me know when you got it.
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid, that Werner, but I like him.
Checkmate.
How soon's our air pump going to be ready?
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.
- No good?
- Today, three times.
Willie, you all right? Pull!
You're gonna have to shore up the whole bloody tunnel, Roger.
- All 335 feet of it.
- Four times today.
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.
It's a lot of timber, Roger.
Can you get it?
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.
I'll put Hendley on it, and the new man we got this morning.
OK, Willie.
On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me
A partridge in a pear tree
On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the fourth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the fifth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Five gold rings
How's it going with the rafters up there?
Taking out one in four.
Stay with it.
Five gold rings
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the seventh day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Seven swans a-swimming, six geese a-laying
Five gold rings
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
Five gold rings, four calling birds...
Bloody singing.
I've never worked so hard in all my life.
Hi, Hilts.
Say, Cavendish...
Three French hens, two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear...
Allez... hup!
Never mind.
Here's a present from our friend, Werner.
Splendid. Simply splendid.
This should do very nicely.
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.
He requested permission to dispose of some of his dirt in our attic.
Tom has reached just beyond that pile of wood, sir.
Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?
- We make it 50 feet, sir.
- Dark of the moon is the seventh...
- Eight and ninth.
A day earlier in August.
Morning.
There he goes again.
Why is he buying up all the potatoes in the camp?
I've been working on that, but I can't find out.
Hilts and Hendley lock themselves in every night.
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.
Put the entire effort into Tom, and press on into the trees.
Right, Roger.
About face!
Forward march!
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.
It's the Fourth of July.
What the devil's this?
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.
- Quite right, too.
- And a little drink to Tom.
- And to getting home.
- Very well. We accept.
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!
Gentlemen, follow us.
About face!
Company... halt!
All right, let's line up down here!
All right, grab a cup!
Line it up! Here we go.
That explains what happened to the potatoes.
No harm in closing down Tom for one day, Roger.
I suppose it'll do us all good to let off a bit of steam.
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you can feel it throughout the whole camp.
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?
Moonshine. American moonshine. Moonshine.
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.
Keep it moving.
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.
- There you go.
- Down with the British.
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?
- Keep it moving.
- Don't get any on your clothes, sir.
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.
Get good and stoned, my friend.
Keep it going. Keep it...
No taxation without representation.
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...
Keep it going, fellas.
Enjoy yourselves.
- Well, let's drink to Tom.
- To Tom.
In the three years, seven months and two weeks that I've been in the bag, that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.
Call on Ives.
Cheers, Hendley!
You know what that is?
I'll tell you what it isn't.
It isn't Napoleon brandy.
How do you like it, sir?
- Well, it's, uh...
- To the colonies.
Independence.
How are you managing over there without us?
Getting along all right, are you?
We seem to be getting along all right, shir... sir.
Yes, well, it's, uh...
It's good stuff, Hilts.
Thank you, sir.
Danny! Here's to...
Roger, goons in 105.
- Who?
- Strachwitz.
We have to ignore it.
If we pay attention, the goons'll know the hut's important.
Here's to going home.
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.
Home!
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you in the tunnel with us. To Tom.
Never mind.
You'll be walking down Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realize that myself.
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.
We're nearly at the trees.
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
Das ist es also.
Los, holen Sie die Wache!
Ich hab's doch geahnt.
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.
It's the tunnel.
Success.
- Ives!
- Halt! Halt!
Halt!
Sir, let me know the exact information you need.
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.
Open up, Harry. We dig.
Around the clock.
- Cooler.
- Right.
Well, I didn't think they'd catch him so soon.
He wasn't caught.
Hilts, welcome home.
Danny?
Danny?
Danny?
Are you all right, Danny?
Yes. All right.
All right. Bring some shovels.
I'm all right.
For God's sake, you've left out a whole eagle.
That's impossible.
Yes.
Four days' work up the bloody spout!
- I'm sorry, Colin.
- It's all right, Smithy.
It's getting late. You push off to bed.
I'll pack up here.
All right.
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Hut ab.
Sehr gut. In Ordnung. Danke schön.
- Bitte schön.
- Herein.
Heil Hitler.
- Wie heiben Sie?
- Erich Stressel, aus München.
Warum sind Sie hier?
Ich habe Urlaub bekommen.
Meine Mutter ist krank.
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up a suspect.
Don't fall for that old gag.
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.
Herein.
One, two, three, four, five.
Roger.
No, it's me.
How do you like the old escape suit?
Fine, fine.
Colin.
How do you like mine?
It looks splendid.
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.
Danny, we're getting out through the tunnel.
We're almost clear.
Please, Willie, let me alone.
I can't go in that tunnel anymore.
So I'm going out through the wire.
Danny, think. We're getting out, but not through the wire.
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.
- I go out now.
- No.
Danny, you go through that wire and you'll get killed.
Don't do that.
Willie...
Since I was a boy,
I hate... and feared little rooms, closets, caves.
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.
Because I must get out.
I hide the fear, and I dig.
But tomorrow night in the tunnel with all those men,
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head, and ruin the escape for everybody.
So I go now.
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.
All right.
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.
Well, how do you think we look?
Guten Abend, mein Herr.
Wie geht es Ihnen?
It's as bad as all that?
Colin, I want first of all to say that without you, we would not have been ready.
That's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.
What's the matter, Roger?
You can't go.
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.
Why?
You can't see your hand in front of your face.
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
Never heard anything so absurd in my life.
I can see perfectly.
I can see perfectly!
I can see... that pin down there.
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?
Yes, of course.
Put the pin down there, will you?
All right.
All right. Come on. Come on. Sit down.
Sit down. It was a good try.
I hate these last-minute letdowns, but I've only just been told.
It's too risky for you.
Don't you think that's Colin's decision?
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.
We all know the score here.
Well, at least... most of us do.
Your idea of this escape is to start another front, to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.
But once we get past that wire and have them looking all over Germany for us, that mission is accomplished.
Afterwards, we have some ideas of our own.
You mean getting home?
- Back to your family?
- That's right.
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that, too?
I'm sure you have.
I know Colin has.
And, Roger, I have, too.
We think we can make it all the way.
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard to the escape. That must be my decision.
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.
No one has said you can't go.
That's true.
I have thought about the Gestapo.
But if you're asking me how far a commanding officer is allowed to go, or dare go, or should be permitted to play God,
I can't answer you.
But I can tell you a blind man is an unnecessary hazard to himself and the whole plan, and must therefore be eliminated from the operation.
Colin's not a blind man as long as he's with me, and he's going with me.
It's all right with you, Colin?
Oh, yes. Quite.
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape numbers to be altered accordingly.
Good night, gentlemen.
Actually... he's quite right.
He's completely right.
I really shouldn't go at all.
My eyes have been getting worse and worse lately.
I think they call it progressive myopia.
I can see things up here. Close to.
I can see to work, but, uh...
- you're just a blur.
- I know.
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.
Colin, do you have any tea?
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.
Splendid.
Raus.
- Hi, Hilts.
- Hey, Mac.
When?
Tonight. We thought they'd never let you out.
Me, too. Let's get at it.
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.
What time?
Only eight minutes now, Danny.
You OK?
Cavendish.
Griff, down there.
Goff, there.
Smith, Foles, third on the right.
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.
There are the lights.
Right on the tick, Danny.
Look down the tunnel, Danny.
It's lovely.
It's just like Blackpool at the height of the season.
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?
Yes. No.
I don't know.
It's time, Roger.
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.
It's all clear, sir.
All set, Roger.
Roger.
Good luck.
They're coming down the shaft now, Danny.
And then they'll be coming right up the tunnel.
Willie... I can't wait. I must get out.
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.
Danny, tell me what this is, and tell me quickly!
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.
Let me out. Let me out.
Take him out, Willie.
Take him out.
Danny? What is it?
Danny, what's going on?
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.
All right, Colin. Down you go.
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the ladder with your right foot. Got it?
Down you go.
Danny cut out, huh?
Willie took him up top.
Hilts, I, uh...
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.
Right.
Bartlett.
All right?
Hold onto yourself.
You're 20 feet short.
What do you mean?
Twenty feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.
The guard is between us and the lights.
How could that happen?
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!
We could postpone it.
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.
One chance.
When the guard goes to the far end, you might be able to move out.
I think I can make it to the woods, set up a signal when you're clear.
What about the towers?
They're gonna be watching the compound, not the woods.
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.
Send down 30 feet of rope!
Send down 30 feet of rope.
Send down 30 feet of rope!
- What?
- Thirty feet of rope!
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.
Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
I don't think so, sir.
He's over there.
Right. You go first, Eric.
I'm staying here till we get moving.
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.
Right.
Thank you.
- Good luck.
- Right.
We're moving.
Danny, they're moving through the tunnel now.
They're getting out.
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and came to England because you're a flier.
You came because you wanted to fly with us and fight the Germans.
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.
If you don't go through that tunnel, everything you've done will have been for nothing, nothing!
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.
- In here, Colin.
- Come on.
Sit down.
You're up, Sedgwick.
I'll take over.
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?
Hilts is on the other end of that rope in the woods.
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs, off you go, but keep Colin low.
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.
What's that?
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.
Come on, Colin.
We can get out when the lights go down.
Willie.
Willie!
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!
Get 'em out.
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.
Light the lamps down there!
There's been an air raid and they've cut the lights.
Danny, it's all right.
Listen to me!
Danny, look.
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.
What the hell's going on?
- You go.
- No. Danny.
Go.
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.
Get him out fast.
Come on.
Come on, Danny, move.
Up you go.
Give me your bag.
We're on the rope!
You and I had better get out, or we won't have a chance of any of the trains.
It's moving. We'll just have to pass the instructions from man to man.
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.
Ist da jemand?
- Hast du etwas gehört?
- Nein.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Get off! We're coming back!
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot of shooting going on up there.
Think they've been shooting them as they came out?
We would've heard the shots before.
- Pull!
- Wait for me.
Out.
Out.
Die Aufstellung, Herr Hauptmann.
- Sechsundsiebzig.
- Jawohl.
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.
Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!
Half the guys who missed their trains are piled up here.
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.
Makes quite a group.
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.
Merci.
Können Sie mich mitnehmen?
Aber gerne. Steigen Sie ein.
Danke schön.
Ihre Pässe, bitte.
Tallyho.
- Vous êtes Français?
- Oui.
Moi, aussi.
- Merci bien.
- Merci.
Tallyho.
- Sie reisen für eine Firma?
- Ja.
Für mein...
Fur mein Geschäft.
- Danke.
- Danke.
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.
All right.
I'll tell you when.
I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
That's quite exciting.
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.
Switzerland.
Hey!
Wo willst du hin? Komm mal her.
Wo willst du denn hin?
Zeig mal deinen Ausweis.
Bartlett.
Alles auf den Boden.
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I, uh... I hadn't quite decided.
What information were you to collect on the way?
None.
What sabotage directions did you receive?
What have you done with your papers?
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?
All I did was escape from a prison camp.
You'd do the same if you'd been locked up for three years.
I wanted to get home.
I don't think you'll see your wife again.
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.
You're wearing civilian clothes.
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.
I dyed it with boot polish to cover some oil smears
I picked up when I was shot down.
And you lost your insignia over the years?
That's right.
Bringen Sie ihn zu den anderen.
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.
Hello, boys.
Hello.
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.
I wish I could say I was happy to see you again.
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.
There's a trainer out there I can fly.
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.
Colin, when I say go, crank this clockwise.
When the engine catches, don't move, or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.
Go!
Next stop, Switzerland!
- The Alps.
- Splendid.
Over this range, then 20 more minutes and we've got it made.
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.
Go that way! I'll follow.
Hendley?
Colin!
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!
Colin... I'm sorry I fouled things up.
That's all right.
Thank you for... getting me... out.
Los, aufstehen.
Hände hoch.
Bonjour, messieurs.
Comment ça va? Ça va bien?
Bonjour.
Comme d'habitude, trois Pernod, n'est-ce pas?
Trois Pernod, Papa.
Café Suzette.
Oui.
- Et voilà, messieurs, les trois Pernod.
- Merci.
Deux...
Et trois. Et voilà de l'eau.
- Bon appétit, messieurs.
- Merci.
Monsieur. Téléphone pour vous.
- Téléphone pour moi?
- Oui, monsieur, téléphone.
Par ici.
Voilà, téléphone.
Merci.
Hello?
Hello?
Resistance.
Resistance?
You are English?
I'm Australian.
- Dites-moi...
- You can speak English. I understand.
Bloody good. I'm a British officer.
I've just escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?
- Oui.
- Can you help me?
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.
Geheime Staatspolizei.
Ihren Ausweis, bitte.
- Français?
- Jawohl.
- Commerçant?
- Mais oui. Parlez-vous français?
- Un peu.
- Votre accent est très bon.
Je l'ai étudié dans l'école supérieure.
Très bien. Passez.
Au revoir, monsieur. Au revoir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Halt!
Zwei vom Lager sind getürmt. Engländer.
Los!
Alles einsteigen.
Einsteigen.
Halt! Halt!
Stehen bleiben! Hände hoch!
- Was soll das?
- You are English.
Engländer?
Sie drohen mir mit einer Pistole?
- Nehmen Sie die weg.
- Ach, Sie sind Deutscher?
- Selbstverständlich.
- Schon gut. Entschuldigung.
Herr Bartlett?
- Ich heibe Fröhlich.
- Your German is good.
And I hear also your French.
Your arms... up!
Ausgezeichnet!
Herr Bartlett... and Herr MacDonald.
We are together again.
You are going to wish you had never put us to so much trouble.
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.
I expected either a long stay or a very short trip.
Yes.
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.
I hope to God I haven't blotted 70-odd ledgers.
No, no.
We're all over 21, footloose and fancy-free.
We'd never have got as far as we did without you, Roger.
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.
- I think we all do.
- Yes.
Was ist los? Wo sind wir?
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.
It will take hours before you reach the camp.
You know, Mac, all this, the organization, tunneling,
Tom and Harry, kept me alive.
And even though we...
I've never been happier.
You know, Mac...
Eleven of your men are being returned today.
- Oh, who?
- I do not have that information.
I...
I am directed by a higher authority to inform you that...
50 of your officers were shot while escaping.
Shot?
Their... personal effects will be returned.
How many of them were wounded?
Here are the names... of the dead.
How many of the 50 were wounded?
None. They, the higher authority... only directs me to inform you that... that 50 men were...
I see.
Addison, John.
Alladale, Peter.
Bancroft, Edward.
Bartlett, Roger.
Cavendish, Dennis.
Eldridge, David.
Felton, William.
Fanshaw, Arthur.
- Ici?
- Oui, monsieur. C'est ici.
Alors, au revoir.
- Merci beaucoup, monsieur.
- Pas de quoi. Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
- Bonne chance.
I am your guide, señor.
For Spain?
España.
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.
What happened to Blythe?
He didn't make it, sir.
Roger was right about that.
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.
I've just posted the list.
They shot... 50.
The Gestapo murdered them.
Fifty? MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?
No, they're not on the list.
- Haynes?
- Yes. I'm sorry.
Roger's idea was to get back at the enemy the hardest way he could.
Mess up the works.
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.
Do you think it was worth the price?
That depends on your point of view, Hendley.
Yes, sir.
Achtung!
Achtung!
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.
The job just didn't work out, huh?
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...
How many?
Fifty.
It looks, after all, as if you will see Berlin before I do.
Sir.
Hey, Hilts!
English - US
All ready here, sir. Crew standing by and awaiting your word. Over.
Right. Over and out.
Our man was brought down at 2 a. m. this morning.
SHAEF, in their all-knowing wisdom, didn't let us know until 10 a. m.
Damned idiots.
Damned idiots for not letting us know.
Double damned idiots for ignoring our advice in the first place.
Anyway, here he is...
...in a town called Werfen...
...at the Schloss Adler, the Castle of the Eagles.
And believe me, it's well-named, because only an eagle can get to it.
Our job is to get inside there and get him out as soon as possible...
...before they can get the information from him.
How are you so sure that he's there, sir?
The Mosquito he was in crash-landed only 10 miles away.
The Schloss Adler is the headquarters of the
German secret service in southern Bavaria.
Where else would they take him?
- How did the plane crash, sir?
- Through the most damnable ill luck.
We carried out a saturation raid on Nuremberg last night.
There shouldn't have been a German fighter within 100 miles of the Austrian border.
A wandering Messerschmitt patrol got him.
Anyway, that's not important.
What is important is that we get him out before he talks.
Or I should say, you get him out.
What about paratroops, sir?
The Schloss Adler is inaccessible and impregnable.
It would require a battalion of paratroops to take it.
We haven't got the time.
Stealth and secrecy are our only hope...
...and you gentlemen are,
I trust, stealthy and secretive.
We realize of course that you've never worked together before as a team...
...but you're familiar with one another, except for Lieutenant Schaffer here.
You probably noticed that Lieutenant Schaffer...
...wears the shoulder flashes of the American Ranger division.
I think that speaks for itself.
Major Smith will lead the group in.
Now, you're all expert at survival behind enemy lines.
Smith, Lieutenant Schaffer...
...Sergeants Harrod and MacPherson in their military capacities...
...the rest of you in other duties.
You all speak fluent German.
You've been trained in different types of combat.
If anybody has a chance of getting him out, you have.
There is, of course, another way, sir.
A way with a 100 percent guarantee of success.
Neither Admiral Rolland or I claim to be omniscient or infallible.
Is there an alternative that we've missed?
Whistle up a pathfinder squadron of Lancasters with 10-ton bombs.
I don't think anybody in that castle would ever talk again.
Nor do I think that you grasp the realities of the situation.
The captured man, General Carnaby, is an American.
If we were to destroy him, then I think General Eisenhower...
...might launch his second front against us rather than against the Germans.
There are certain niceties to be observed in our relationship with our allies.
Very well, then, gentlemen.
Ten o'clock tonight at the airfield.
- No more questions, I take it?
- Yes, sir.
Begging the colonel's pardon, sir.
What's all this about?
I mean, why is this man so damned important?
- Why should...?
- That'll do, sergeant.
You have all the information you require.
I think if we're sending a man to what may be his death...
...he has a right to know why.
It's painfully simple, sergeant.
General Carnaby is one of the overall coordinators...
...of planning for the second front.
He set out last night to meet his opposite numbers in the Middle East...
...to finalize the plans for the invasion of Europe.
The rendezvous with the Russians was to have been in Crete.
Now, unfortunately, his plane didn't get through.
Now, if the Germans can make him talk...
...it could mean no second front this year.
- Do you understand, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry, sir.
That's all right, sergeant. Forget it.
Now, if you have any more questions,
Major Smith will answer them.
That's all, gentlemen.
Get them ready.
We're approaching the drop area.
Stand by!
Green on! Go!
Where's Harrod?
Well, last time I saw him, he was drifting towards those trees over here.
All right. Spread out.
Let's go and find him.
Major!
- His neck's broken.
- Damn it.
Well, what do we do now?
Do we bury him or do we leave him here?
We leave him here. The snow will cover him in a couple of hours.
Get back and pick up the equipment.
I want to see if the radio's still working.
Well...
...the radio works all right. There's a barn about a mile down the valley.
We'll use it to check our equipment.
- What about the people who live in it?
- There aren't any.
This is a high alpine pasture.
They bring the cattle up in May and take them down in September.
The rest of the time, the place is totally deserted.
Come on. Let's go.
Somehow, you know, this just isn't me.
It's not any of us, Jock.
You're the cook. Cook...
...some hot food and some hot coffee, and then call London on the radio.
Damn it. I left that codebook in Sergeant Harrod's tunic.
- I'll go and get it for you.
- No, it's all right. It's my own stupid fault.
Sounds as if it's still blowing a blizzard.
Yeah.
Well, if I'm not back in an hour...
...signal me with a flare pistol four times every five minutes.
That should bring a blind man home.
Might also bring the best part of a German regiment.
There's not a German within five miles.
Nobody leaves here until I come back.
- Jock, save me some coffee.
- It'll be cold by then.
They say that's an advantage.
You can't taste cold coffee.
Halt.
Turn around.
You took your time getting here, didn't you?
Things to attend to.
- You enjoy your trip?
- Lovely.
I nearly froze to death in that damn plane.
Why couldn't you have supplied some hot water bottles or an electrically heated suit?
- I thought you loved me.
- I can't help what you think.
You managed to bring your gear.
Is that all the greeting I'm going to get?
I'm afraid so, for the time being.
My radio operator was killed in the drop.
What happened?
Something struck him in the back of the neck.
Either the haft of a knife or the butt of a gun.
The skin was unbroken, but badly discolored.
It means someone broke his neck afterwards...
...to make it look like an accident.
Now listen, I'm taking the group at dawn over the ridge into the next valley.
We'll stop in the woods until about 7.
Now, don't stumble into us.
As soon as it's dark, we'll move into the village of Werfen.
In the village, there's a gasthaus called Zum Wilden Hirsch.
Behind it and to the right, there's a woodshed.
I'll meet you there at exactly 8:00 tomorrow night.
- And after that, what?
- I'll let you know when the time comes.
Ah.
- I see you've come fully prepared.
- Never mind about that.
How do you know about all these things,
Zum Wilden Hirsch and the shed?
I'm entitled to know.
You're entitled to know nothing.
We've worked together for three years.
I'm a professional.
So am I.
If I were the marrying kind, which I'm...
- I thought you were in a hurry.
- So I am.
Aren't you?
What kept you?
Well, I was very lucky.
I ran into this fabulous blond.
She was lying on a snowdrift.
Does she have a friend?
No, I'm afraid you're out of luck.
- Thanks for waiting up for me, anyway.
- No problem.
Lieutenant, why don't you go to sleep?
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.
You too, Jock.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Can't get a thing.
Probably the storm, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll try again in the morning.
Lieutenant, come with me.
The rest of you stay here.
Better leave the equipment here.
Somebody's got to be crazy.
How'd your colonel expect anyone to get in there?
He feels if he can penetrate the German High Command...
...we shouldn't have difficulty getting up.
He did what?
He spent the years '40 to '43 in Germany, first in the Wehrmacht...
...and then finally in General Headquarters in Berlin.
They say he knew Hitler quite well.
- I thought he looked a little nuts.
- Yeah, probably is.
Now we've got problems of our own.
Get the boys into the trees.
We've brought them too far over.
Be sure they go beyond that tree line.
- And what about you?
- I'll be along in a minute.
- Be sure they stay behind the trees.
- All right.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Danny Boy calling
Broadsword. Father Machree is waiting.
This is Father Machree, Broadsword.
What is your present position, please?
Over.
Woods due west of castle.
Descending at dusk. Harrod dead.
Over.
Was Harrod killed accidentally? Over.
No. Over.
By the Germans? Over.
No.
Time of next broadcast uncertain.
Will you stand by?
Over.
Colonel Turner and I will remain at headquarters till operation completed.
Good luck. Out.
It looks as though you're right, sir.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Who's next, I wonder?
Smith himself, perhaps.
I doubt that.
Some people have a sixth sense.
He has a sixth, a seventh and an eighth.
- He's our best agent.
- Except yourself.
Still and all, even if he is the best, this whole operation looks impossible now.
Take a look down there, at the foot of the castle.
Dobermans.
Yeah. Dobermans, a guard tower and a wire fence.
Fences can be cut or climbed, lieutenant.
I doubt if that one can be climbed. It's got around 3,000 volts running through it.
If I'm not mistaken, major, that's an army barracks over there.
No mistake. This is the headquarters of the Wehrmacht Alpenkorps.
Swell. If you got any other surprises,
I think I ought to know about them.
I thought you knew, lieutenant.
Why do you think we're not dressed as German sailors?
Training troops come and go all the time.
What are six new faces among 600 new faces?
Look, major, this is primarily a British operation.
I'm an American.
I don't even know why the hell I'm here.
Lieutenant, you're here because you're an American.
Dear Kramer, you have turned a little gray since I saw you last.
I'm afraid so, sir.
- How is Berlin, sir?
- Things have changed.
You like my machine?
- It looks pretty dangerous.
- Well, you must try it.
Major Burkhalter, my adjutant.
Major Brant, Jaeger Battalion.
Colonel Weissner, Field Security.
Major Von Hapen, Gestapo.
- Have you questioned him yet?
- No. I was waiting for you.
That Major Von Hapen, does he know General Carnaby's here?
Yes. I did inform him of his arrival, but not of his importance.
Good. If possible, I'd prefer the Gestapo to be kept out of this matter...
...until we have the information we want.
- Fine.
We don't need them cluttering up things with torture chambers.
This can remain a strictly army matter for the time being.
- I agree.
- Good.
I've had a very tiring trip down here from Berlin. I'd like to freshen up a bit.
Perhaps sleep a few hours before meeting General Carnaby.
I'll see you to your quarters.
Thank you.
The meeting will be ready whenever you wish.
Tell me...
Show me your papers.
Right.
I've written her many times of course, but...
...with so many troops on leave in Berlin, it was hardly likely she'd remember me.
But one always hopes you're the one she'll never forget.
Yeah. What was her name, anyway?
- Fred.
- Fred?
Oh, yeah, I remember Fred, yeah.
She was a short little redhead.
We'll try this one behind us.
When you get inside, circulate around.
Keep your ears open for anything about General Carnaby.
We meet back here in half an hour. All right.
Two beers.
Ah.
See you later.
Anything else needed here? Oh.
And who might you be, my pretty alpine rose?
- Heidi. Stop, major. I've got work.
- There's no more important work...
...than entertaining the soldiers of the fatherland.
- Shall I sing you a song?
- I hear too much singing.
Oh, very well, then. I'll whistle.
It goes like this:
I bet you have a beautiful singing voice too.
Thank you.
Be in the woodshed in five minutes.
Now slap me across the face as hard as you can.
Oh!
Major...
...your conduct does not become an officer of the Wehrmacht.
Herr Major, when you talk to me.
Major Bernd Himmler.
Does the name mean anything to you?
I advise you to mind your own business in future.
Is that understood?
- Cognac.
- Make that two.
I don't suppose you found out anything about General Carnaby.
I didn't get around to that. Thank you.
What were you and that major talking about?
I told him I was Himmler's brother.
Yeah, I could see why that would shake him up a little.
More than a little, I should think.
Keep an eye on things. I'll be back.
Take your clothes off.
- But I...
- Don't argue. Take your clothes off.
All right.
Now, relax. I didn't mean it that way.
You are going up to the castle tonight as...
Well, yes, as a domestic.
How? Naked?
Not a bad idea, but it's a bit obvious.
There's an acute staff shortage in Germany and the Schloss Adler is no exception.
You're the type they're looking for: young, intelligent, good-looking...
...and as we both know, not entirely without humor.
You must be mad.
If I wasn't, what would I be doing in this job?
Now listen very carefully.
You're supposed to arrive on a bus from Steingaden in about 20 minutes.
Your name is Maria Schenk.
You come from the Rhineland.
Here, give me that boot.
You've had TB and were forced to give up your job.
You have a cousin called Heidi who works in Zum Wilden Hirsch.
It's because of her that you got the job.
- Where are my identity papers?
- In that case...
...together with your travel permit.
Heidi will give you the rest later.
It must have taken time to prepare these things.
Very likely. Our Forgery Department did a special job on your papers.
But I thought General Carnaby's plane crashed only yesterday morning.
It was carefully arranged.
The plane was crash-landed in Oberhausen Military Airfield...
...about five miles from here.
It was riddled with machine-gun holes,
British machine-gun holes.
But what the hell?
A hole is a hole is a hole, as they say.
Are you trying to say that you'd risk the life of an American general...
...and all the plans for the second front?
- Of course not.
Give me the other boot.
I'm in a hurry to get to the castle...
...before they find out they haven't got General Carnaby.
The chap they've got knows no more about the second front...
...than I know about the back end of the moon. He's an American corporal.
His name is Cartwright Jones.
He's an ex-actor, probably second-rate...
...but he's the dead spitting image of the general.
Did you talk this poor man into getting involved with all this?
I didn't have to. He volunteered.
What actor wouldn't?
If he pulls this off, it'll be the summit of his professional career.
Mind you, it might be a short engagement.
Yes. A one-night stand.
Ah.
Well, here we are.
Mary, now Maria, this is your cousin Heidi.
Leave this behind in case you're searched.
Heidi will tell you what to do from now on.
She's been one of our top agents in Bavaria since 1941 and...
What a disguise.
So he left three minutes after me...
...in a hurry, you say, so he wasn't after me.
Any of the others leave?
Not that I could see, but this place is so crowded...
...and there are several other exits.
Any one of them could have slipped out.
You better start playing it straight or you can deal me out of this mess.
Now, we both know that radio operator wasn't killed in any drop.
Now, with MacPherson dead, there's only five of us left.
You either let me know what's going on or there's only gonna be four.
All right, lieutenant.
This morning you asked me why you, an American, was on this mission.
Well, the answer is really very simple.
Maria.
Oh, my dear Maria, you came after all.
My dear cousin Heidi, how wonderful to see you after all these years.
Gestapo. I am so happy to see you.
May I introduce you to a friend of mine?
Major Von Hapen.
My cousin Maria Schenk.
Your cousin told us to expect you,
Fräulein Schenk, but Heidi...
...you did not tell me she was as beautiful as this.
Thank you.
Perhaps when you're ready to take the cable car to the castle...
...I'll have the honor to escort you.
Thank you.
And I am going with her.
Oh.
Both of you, huh?
Well, then I am very fortunate.
Fräulein, until a little bit later.
This is a map of the castle.
And your instructions.
Do your homework well.
He doesn't seem to be anywhere in here.
Wonder where the devil he's got to.
I gave orders that nobody should leave.
Shall I go outside and take a look?
Attention. Nobody make a move.
Against the wall, please.
Against the wall.
Attention.
We are looking for four or five
Alpenkorps deserters from Stuttgart.
To escape, they killed two officers and a guardroom sergeant.
They were last known to be heading this way.
Clever. Very clever, indeed.
I want the senior officers of Drafts 13,
14 and 15 to come forward at once.
Check their papers.
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?
Lieutenant?
Well, I think we'll stand a lot better chance outside than we will in here.
Agreed.
Gentlemen, see you after the war.
These papers are from the Fourth Panzer
Division stationed in Stuttgart.
When were they issued to him?
- Colonel.
- What is it, major?
Myself and the others are the ones you're looking for. We've come to surrender.
Lieutenant, take the three men away for questioning.
The officers will come with me.
Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Major Von Hapen.
Yes, sir.
Fräulein.
It's just my shoelaces.
- Need to get rid of this thing.
- Yeah.
Over the cliff. Let's push.
Okay. Push.
Push.
And a little more.
Good evening, lieutenant.
This is Miss Schenk. Lieutenant Kernitser.
She is the colonel's secretary in charge of all the female staff.
Can I see your papers, please?
And yours, Fräulein.
Would you come with me, please?
- Perhaps I'll see you a little later.
- Thank you.
Do you find anything interesting, major?
I hear there was some excitement in the village tonight.
Oh, nothing very serious.
Just the arrest of five army deserters, that's all.
Not quite. Those were the orders that were put out.
But actually, they were five British agents dressed in German uniforms.
British agents? Why wasn't I informed?
I'm informing you now, major.
If you sent out the orders, colonel...
...then you must have known for some time...
...who they were and that they were in this district.
We called you in your office and in your rooms.
You were not there.
Colonel, I don't have to remind you, do I...
...that I am in charge of all the Gestapo activities in this area...
...and if there are foreign agents, then I am to be informed at once!
- You were not here, major.
- Then you find me, colonel.
My duty is to inform you, but not to search every gasthaus to locate you.
I know your duties...
...and your loyalties.
Let me remind you, major, that I'm a colonel in the SS...
...and not some lieutenant you can frighten with your threats!
Your military rank and position are obvious to me, colonel...
...and so are your attempts to discredit me with my superiors in Berlin.
If there is any discredit, you bring it upon yourself.
Good night.
- You better lock the door.
- Sure.
Here are all the things you'll need.
Automatic, field glasses, ball of string and lead weight.
- You put those things in there?
- A week ago.
- You knew all about this even then?
- Yeah. Good luck, cousin.
We may need these.
I guess it's occurred to you, the Germans probably know about all this stuff by now.
It did cross my mind.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Broadsword, sir.
Danny Boy calling Broadsword.
Come in, Broadsword. Over.
MacPherson murdered. Thomas,
Christiansen and Berkeley captured.
I'm effecting entrance within the hour.
Please have transport standing by. Over.
Pull out now, Broadsword.
Save yourselves. Over.
You must be joking. Over and out.
That is an order, Broadsword. Over.
Broadsword? Broadsword?
Broadsword?
He's gone, sir.
Damn it!
It's all my fault.
It's all our fault, colonel.
It was my idea.
Maybe I'm getting too old.
Maybe we're both too old.
Well, anyway, there can't be any doubt anymore.
The Germans have totally penetrated Ml6.
They know every move we make almost before we make it.
Where the hell are they getting it all from?
We handpicked every man for this mission.
- We have top security.
- Security?
That word has become a bloody joke.
We've got company.
- Open the window.
- All right.
Put the bag in the bus and see if you can start the engine.
- How's it going?
- Try to give it a start.
Right.
Yes. Captain Mueller, with three prisoners.
All right.
Leave this one behind and tie that one to the end of the rope.
Good God, that nearly killed me.
You shouldn't go on these insane missions.
You're getting too old.
I thank you for those few kind words.
The first time I've been hot since I was in this bloody country.
- You got a plan of the castle?
- Yes.
Well, fetch it for me, would you?
Why don't you give him a hand?
What for? He's perfectly capable of looking after himself.
If I could climb up on my own, why can't he?
First left down the stairs, third door.
Next right-hander takes us into the east wing.
Down again. Second left.
Telephone exchange.
You wouldn't mind giving me a hand, would you?
You seem to have a lot of women stashed around this country, major.
I'm sorry. This is Mary.
She's one of our group.
- Lieutenant Schaffer.
- Hello.
Hello, Mary.
Thank you.
Take the rope and the explosives to your room...
...and bring them with you when you come.
- How's it looking?
- It's quiet enough.
First thing we gotta do is cripple that helicopter.
They might try to fly Carnaby out in it.
I think we can handle that.
Hello?
- You the pilot?
Yes, sir.
Kommandant wants you on the phone.
It's in the radio office on the left, around the corner.
- Do you have a cigarette, lieutenant?
- Yes, sir. Of course.
- Rather cold, isn't it?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Well, that was quick.
Fear lent them wings, as the saying goes.
What do we do now?
I think we'd better see how
Cartwright Jones is getting along.
You are making things very difficult, Herr General.
- Very, very difficult, indeed.
There aren't any difficulties, major.
General Rosemeyer here hasn't forgotten that Germany's a signatory...
...to the Hague Convention.
I have not forgotten, but my hands are tied.
I have my orders from Berlin.
You can tell Berlin all they're entitled to know.
I'm General George Carnaby,
United States Army, RA 123-025-3964.
And one of the chief coordinators of planning for the second front.
Which second front is that?
Well, general, I have done all I can.
I have tried to hold up the Gestapo.
I've persuaded the High Command that the mere fact of your capture...
...will compel the Allies to alter their plans...
...but this, it seems, is not enough.
For the last time, may I request you to give us the information?
General George Carnaby,
United States Army.
The matter is in your hands, Kramer.
You know, general, we have drugs that will make you talk.
- We do not wish to use them, but...
- Scopolamine. Heh, heh, heh.
Where's that gonna get you, colonel?
There are other drugs too.
The lieutenant here is a trained nurse.
Excuse me.
Yes?
And they are who we thought?
Very good.
Yes. Yes, you can bring them up now.
Has there been any further information about the other two?
Well, keep me advised.
Some very interesting company coming up, general.
The drugs may not be necessary.
Don't you think it's time we make a move?
Any minute now.
Just be patient.
A moment.
Fräulein.
Did I disturb you?
- No, I was just going out.
- Well, then I am just in time.
- You wanted to see me, major?
- Naturally.
What about?
Well, nothing.
I just wanted to see you.
Now, that is not a crime, is it?
No.
It's very seldom we have so pretty a girl here.
Perhaps I can show you a little Bavarian hospitality.
Now, downstairs, we have an armaments room...
...which has been converted into the most marvelous café.
But my duties,
I have to see the colonel's secretary.
The colonel's secretary can wait a little while.
You and me, we have a lot to talk about.
- Such as?
- Düsseldorf.
- Düsseldorf?
- I was a student there for many years.
From 1929 to 1933.
To your health, gentlemen.
You are not drinking, general.
That's understandable...
...when your rescuers turn out to be, well, birds of a different feather.
And the return trip, gentlemen.
How was that to be accomplished?
- Through Switzerland.
- Mm-hm.
Then it should be quite easy for you to return to London.
A rubber dinghy across the Rhine, and then a short walk.
You'll be in Whitehall...
...reporting General Carnaby's transfer to Berlin before you know it.
Back to London? Are you mad?
Not with Smith and Schaffer still alive.
What do you take us for?
You will also, of course, be reporting the unfortunate demise of Major Smith.
- Is he dead?
We are not quite sure.
- It is being looked into right now.
- It's getting late.
- Please remember the important issue.
- Yes, sir.
I think the situation has changed sufficiently...
...for you to give us the information we have been asking for.
Nothing's changed, colonel.
Most unfortunate.
Just a waste of good scopolamine.
Don't move, any of you.
Lieutenant.
No, I'd advise you not to, colonel.
Well, gentlemen, I'm glad to see you all here, safe and sound, enjoying a drink.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Lieutenant, drop that gun.
- What?
- Drop that gun and sit down.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Sit down!
- Major, if I live to be 100...
- Do nothing, lieutenant.
In your own idiom, you're a punk...
...and a pretty second-rate punk at that.
- If I might have some explanation...
- In good time, colonel. All in good time.
I was about to say scopolamine would have little effect on our friend...
...except to prove he's not General Carnaby, but a certain Cartwright Jones...
...an American actor impersonating General Carnaby.
- Who are you?
- Just a passer-by, as you might say.
In fact, I think the drug would probably work better...
...on our friends at the end of the table.
They're our real enemies.
- Don't listen to him, general. It's a bluff!
- Keep quiet!
Allow me to introduce myself.
Major Johann Schmidt.
SS Military Intelligence, Stuttgart.
- Can you prove that?
- Certainly, colonel.
Before I do, I wonder if you'd be good enough to call one of your guards.
I don't fancy talking and keeping my eye on these people at the same time.
Strange.
I seem to remember...
...that the cathedral was on the other side of the square.
Well...
Of course, I might be mistaken.
It's been a long time.
Oh, no, major.
I could have made a mistake.
I haven't been to Düsseldorf for three years.
It's very easy to forget.
Yes. It's very easy.
Fräulein, you seem to be a little bit distracted.
- Is anything wrong?
- No. No, it's nothing.
Just a slight headache.
I've had a long day traveling.
Oh, yes, of course. And here I am...
...I'm talking about silly things like Düsseldorf.
- You will forgive me?
- Of course.
Thank you. I tell you what.
We will have one more schnapps together and then I'll see you to your quarters.
- Thank you.
- Fräulein!
Well, now that we're all comfortable, the first order of business...
...is to find out exactly who everybody is and what they're doing here.
Now, first the lieutenant.
He's an assassin...
...a member of the American intelligence organization known as OSS.
His job was to shoot you, Colonel Kramer, and you, General Rosemeyer.
Now, General Carnaby's mission was twofold:
First, to allow himself to be tortured...
...into giving you the wrong plans for the second front.
And secondly, to afford the British...
...a perfect excuse to send in a team of experts to rescue him.
Which brings us to our three friends here...
...and the cleverest phase of the British operation.
- They are, of course, members of Ml6.
- That's a lie.
Let him finish!
Their job was to penetrate the German High Command...
...instead of the real
Thomas, Berkeley and Christiansen...
...who worked for us in London...
...and were discovered and captured by the British about a month ago.
That's another lie.
You can't prove any of this.
Can't I?
Any denials, lieutenant?
Now, General Carnaby, perhaps you'd be good enough...
...to give us your real name, rank and serial number.
Cartwright Jones, corporal, U.S. Army...
...RA 123-025-3964.
Thank you.
Having successfully substituted these three British agents for our men...
...what was the next phase of the British plan?
To penetrate the German High Command.
How? Simple.
Stage a fake air crash with a fake American general on board...
...send in special agents to effect his release...
...be sure that they fail in their mission...
...and these men would be taken to Berlin...
...where they would be right in the heart of the Wehrmacht.
And you, Major Schmidt, what were your orders on this mission?
To lead them in and make my own way out through Switzerland.
- But it... It's incredible.
- Yes.
But to the British, very, very simple.
You were going to give us some proof of who you are.
Certainly, general.
The proof is in three parts.
First, if I'm not who I say I am...
...what am I doing here?
What can I possibly hope to gain?
The rescue of an impostor, the exposure of three spies. Who to?
To the very people they're supposed to be working for.
I have nothing to gain.
Also, if these people are what they say they are...
...they would know the name of our top agent in Whitehall.
- Yes.
- So why don't we ask them?
They should know the man who sent them on this mission.
We all work through contacts.
It wasn't necessary or safe for us to know...
...where our orders were coming from.
Then I should be in the same boat as you, but I know his name and you don't.
Secondly, colonel, you have...
...one of the most powerful radio transmitters in Europe.
Put a radio telephone call through...
...to Field Marshal Kesselring's headquarters in Italy...
...and ask for his Chief of Intelligence, a Major Wilhelm Wilner.
Major. Major.
Major.
There's Colonel Kramer on the telephone from the Schloss Adler in Bavaria.
He says it's very urgent.
Major Wilner speaking.
Ja, colonel.
- Can you describe him?
- That will not be necessary.
Ask him to show you his right forearm.
- May I see your right forearm?
- Certainly.
There are two parallel scars, about three centimeters apart.
The scars are there.
Ask how did he get them.
- How did you get those?
- I was born with them.
He says he was born with them.
That is right. Then tell him he's a traitor.
Tell him he's a renegade.
That is Schmidt. No question about it.
- Thank you, major.
- Thank you, colonel.
Good night.
Give me the water.
As you know, the real Thomas,
Christiansen and Berkeley...
...while working for British counterespionage...
...were responsible for setting up an excellent chain of agents throughout Britain.
Now, if these men are who they claim to be...
...it would be reasonable...
...to expect them to be able to write down a list of those agents.
You could then compare their lists with the genuine one...
...which I have in this book.
- There's something very wrong, colonel.
I don't doubt who Schmidt is, but there has been some mistake.
Yes, and you're the ones who have made it.
Fräulein, would you be good enough to get some pencils and some notebooks...
...and we'll soon find out who's speaking the truth.
Good night, Maria.
You are a most charming girl.
Good night and thank you.
We must get to know each other a little better.
- Yes.
- Good night.
Good night.
Any one of these will do.
Now compare it with my original.
Guard!
Stay as you were, gentlemen.
Just relax.
Second-rate punk, huh?
All I could think of on the spur of the moment.
- Thanks. That even makes it worse.
- Sorry.
Well, between them, they shouldn't have missed anything.
This is all you want. Those books?
- Lots of nice names and addresses.
And these men?
Then they are who they claim to be?
I'm afraid so. They've been under suspicion for some time.
Classified information was going out and useless information was coming in.
It took several weeks to pin it on the departments controlled by those men.
But we knew we couldn't prove it.
Even if we could...
...what we really wanted was the names of their contacts.
These names and addresses.
So we thought this plan up.
And Wilner,
Kesselring's Chief of Intelligence?
He truly believes me to be one of his top agents in Italy.
I've been feeding him useless, false and out-of-date information for a couple years.
- All right, gentlemen...
Stay where you are!
I'd advise everyone to keep perfectly still.
Drop your gun, major.
You too, lieutenant.
By the fireplace.
Thank God you're here.
We were just about...
Sit down, colonel!
Everybody remain as he is...
...until I find out what exactly is going on here.
What do you mean?
Surely, you can see what's...
Sit down, colonel.
It's perfectly simple.
The lieutenant and myself...
...have uncovered a plot to assassinate the Führer.
- This is preposterous!
- General!
Sit down.
These people were all involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the Third Reich.
In my pocket here,
I have the names of all the conspirators.
Just before you interrupted us, we put this entire party under arrest.
The list in his pocket are the names of German agents working in Britain!
I don't expect you to believe me, major.
But you'll certainly believe these names if you'll permit me to show them to you.
Let me see them.
Careful, major.
Go very slowly.
Bring them here.
Smith.
All of you, get up! Stand over there.
Put your hands up.
Put your hands up!
Jones, see if you can find something to tie them up with.
Mary, bring that bag over here.
- What do we do with these three?
- We take them with us.
You were late.
- One day I won't come at all.
- Keep your eye on those three.
Lieutenant, in the next 15 minutes...
...we have to create enough confusion to get out of here alive.
Major, right now you got me about as confused as I ever hope to be.
The armory's here.
If we blow it up, the castle will think...
...it's being attacked by a division.
On the other side of the castle over here is the radio room.
I'll take the others and meet you there.
You take the map.
Mary, we're going.
Let me make myself perfectly understood.
If any of you utters a word, I'll kill you all.
You understand?
- Jones, get the major's gun. Now move.
- Yes, sir.
Move!
Go!
This way.
Jones.
Wait. Go back. Jones, go on.
Mary, get in. Get in there.
At ease.
Hello.
Get them in.
All right, inside, quickly.
You may need this.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
- We got company.
- Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Get the rest of the men out of here and report to the Kommandant.
Danny Boy calling Broadsword. Over.
Everything ready.
We need transport. Understood?
- Over.
- Understood.
Do you have it? Over.
We have it. We have it all. Over.
All sins forgiven.
Damn it.
Get Thomas out of there. Quickly.
Now!
Get out. Climb out.
Get on with it!
Grenades.
Corporal!
Outside! Out! Out!
All right.
Lieutenant, get the rope.
Back. Get back.
All right, to the right.
Quick. Move it.
Damn! Blast it!
Get moving.
All right. Get those men untied.
Better put those coats on if you don't want to freeze to death. Quickly, now.
Christiansen.
Jones, get them out. Mary.
Watch them. Right.
- The doors to the corridor are locked.
- See what winch controls they have.
- There's a stop and start button.
- See if you can make the motor work.
Not bad, huh?
- Yes, good.
Now bring it down here and we'll get on top, and you can take us back inside.
- Mary, bring them out here!
- Go on.
Get ahold of the rope and climb down.
Climb down!
Look out!
Schaffer?
Schaffer? Schaffer?
We've got him, Smith! Now, listen, Smith.
I'll make a deal with you.
You let us go down in the car and we won't kill Schaffer.
Smith!
You bring him out so I can see he's still alive.
I'm bringing him out now.
Get in the car.
Give me that.
Damn it!
Up there. Get him!
Help me. No.
No. No!
Help me.
Please.
No!
Lieutenant.
- Where's the major?
- He's on the cable car.
Jones, the bag.
Let's go.
Set the bombs to go off in three and a half minutes.
- Almost ready?
- Almost.
Jones. Mary.
All set.
Go.
- Twenty-five minutes. Can we make it?
- We can make it.
- Point is, will they?
- God knows.
Everybody on the floor.
Emergency. Get me the Oberhausen Airfield immediately.
- We've got company.
- Yeah, I saw them in the mirror.
How long before we reach the poles?
Just around the next turn.
Oberhausen Airfield?
Give me the Kommandant's office.
Get ready.
Set the rest of them and get out of here.
Oberhausen control tower.
Oberhausen control tower.
Oberhausen control. Over.
I'm in serious trouble.
Request urgent permission to land. Over.
Identify. Over.
Leutnant Ulrich.
Third Jaeger Junker squadron on night navigational exercise.
One engine out. Losing altitude. Over.
You are cleared for immediate landing. Over.
Coming in. Over.
Fighter Wing 126,
Oberhausen Airfield calling. Over.
Fighter Wing 126, Ober...
Get the control tower.
Come in... Aah!
Get down.
- Berkeley wrote these names?
- Yes, sir.
Ted Berkeley. I can't believe it.
And Thomas. And Christiansen.
All three of them?
- My God, it's incredible.
- Yes, quite.
But not as incredible as the one name that's missing from that list, colonel.
What name is that, major?
I have it in this notebook here in my pocket.
Earlier tonight, I showed it to Colonel Kramer.
He agreed with me that this was the top German agent in Britain.
It's your name, colonel.
Don't look so shocked.
Surely, you suspected it.
Otherwise, why were you here to meet us?
In case you were found out?
Go on.
You see, you underestimated
Admiral Rolland.
He'd suspected you and the others for some time.
He brought me and Mary back from Italy because we were the only two...
...in his department that he could trust, yourself included.
He asked you to choose a leader for this expedition.
You chose me because you knew from German intelligence...
...that I was a double agent.
Admiral Rolland knew I was not.
But for you, I was the perfect choice.
- Now you're guessing, Smith.
- No guesswork, colonel.
Your pointing that gun at me is sufficient evidence.
You are pointing it at me, aren't you?
Go on.
Mary was brought on the mission without your knowledge because I needed her...
...to get me into the castle.
The lieutenant, being an American...
...had no possible connection with Ml6...
...and was the only member of the group
I could trust.
I wasn't even sure of
Harrod and MacPherson...
...until they were killed by the others.
Fascinating. Very fascinating.
Perhaps even true.
- Assuming for a moment...
- You're finished, colonel.
- You're overlooking something, aren't you?
- Not at all.
Admiral Rolland took you to the plane himself, didn't he?
He also made certain that you had that gun, didn't he?
We took the precaution of removing the firing pin before the mission started.
Put it down, colonel.
Not so hasty, lieutenant.
We mustn't cheat the hangman.
What now, major?
You'll be tried for treason.
A public trial would be embarrassing.
Painful, not only for myself...
...but also for British Intelligence and Admiral Rolland.
Perhaps, but not as painful as that long drop to the end of the rope.
Well...
...I seem to have no cards left to play, do I?
No, colonel, you don't.
- Do I have an alternative?
- If you want it.
Mm.
Thank you.
I'll have those books.
Well, is that it, major?
Yes, that's it, lieutenant.
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time you have one of these things, keep it an all-British operation.
I'll try, lieutenant.
And you've come here directly from Normandy?
Ja wohl, ja, ja.
And how is the morale of the combat troops?
It's excellent.
You mean that?
Ja, ja.
Please.
Ah. That's where the attack against the Fuhrer took place... right in there, only three weeks ago.
The bomb was placed under the table.
It was in a briefcase.
The generals thought everyone would be killed, but the Fuhrer was safe, thank God.
General Jodl is waiting.
Please.
General Jodl.
Heil Hitler.
Very pleased to see you again.
The Fuhrer wants to see you immediately.
Be careful when you shake his hand.
Oh, then he was wounded.
Not badly; merely a scratch.
Nothing serious.
Nervous?
Ja.
Quite naturally.
Mein Fuhrer.
Noch nicht, mein Fuhrer.
Thank you, mein Fuhrer.
Thank you, mein Fuhrer.
Ja wohl, mein Fuhrer.
Herr Choltitz, at last.
I am so glad they sent you here.
You can't imagine.
As you know, I've been appointed your successor.
Paris is now a fortress city.
I am in full command, and unfortunately, it will not be an easy assignment.
Now, allow me to introduce to you some of my staff officers.
Colonel Jay you know already,
General von Boineburg,
Chief of Staff, and my adjutant... he will serve you well.
Please report to me at
6:30 tomorrow morning at my headquarters in the Hotel Meurice.
At 7:30, I want all the officers for a staff meeting at which we will study a plan for the defense of the city of Paris, street by street.
Is that clear?
Ja wohl, Herr General.
Then I won't disturb you any longer, gentlemen.
My God.
Gentlemen, you have heard which way the wind's blowing.
Well, what's wrong with you?
Are you drunk?
Have you forgotten how to salute?
Look at this uniform.
It's disgusting.
It looks as if you've been sleeping in it.
Why don't you mind your own business?
It is my business...
I am an officer, and you are a soldier in the Wehrmacht.
That's my bad luck, isn't it?
Haven't you heard?
We've lost the war.
Germany's finished. Kaput.
We've had it.
Stand up.
Papers.
What you need is a few days in prison.
You're a disgrace to Germany.
Museum is closing.
All right, we are closing.
Sorry, monsieur, we're closing.
The exit's right there.
Closing time, monsieur.
Ja, I'm leaving.
600 rifles to free Paris.
Where are the arms and ammunition promised by General De Gaulle?
They'll arrive very soon.
Soon? We need them right now.
I should get a message this evening.
London will tell us when the Allies will arrive in Paris.
If they don't decide to go around the city.
We'll have to wait if they do.
Tell that to our men.
Bernard Labe could tell them, and they would listen to him.
But he's in prison.
We have to free him.
I know only one way.
This is the center of Warsaw.
It was here that the Polish terrorists first fired on German troops.
As a result, the Fuhrer ordered the complete destruction of the city.
A lesson not only to the Poles, but to the world.
Your husband's alive.
In Germany?
No. In Paris.
He's to be transferred to the prison at Fresnes with a large group of political prisoners.
Fresnes.
That means they'll send him to Germany.
Yes.
Warsaw no longer exists.
And it will never exist again.
So perish all enemies of the Reich.
Enough of these horror pictures!
Keep quiet, I want to watch.
If you like it so much, why don't you go to Germany?
I didn't do anything, I swear.
I'm telling you, it's a mistake.
Day after tomorrow at Place des Vosges.
That's how we're planning to set them free.
That's premature.
An uprising can't succeed without support from the Allies.
In that case, they'd better hurry.
In the last four years,
I've changed my address ten times.
I've changed my name.
Today, our men are like me.
Impatient to come out in the open.
Impatience was never a good argument for anything.
German morale is low.
We ought to strike right now.
De Gaulle is in London.
If he were in Paris, he'd see things differently.
For the Germans, the
Resistance is an enigma.
Soldiers without uniforms or training.
They're convinced that we've got them outnumbered.
That's to our advantage.
Anyway you measure, the decision can come only from the National
Council of the Resistance.
Yes, we know that.
So call a meeting, but I'm sure they will agree with me.
Think what happened to Warsaw.
If you start too soon, you'll find you've only liberated ruins.
My name is Eller.
I was just parachuted from London.
Thanks, that's a good job.
Please, Sister, would you go get the last messages while I'm decoding this one?
The Allied high command has decided to bypass Paris.
They're going straight to the Rhine.
This is terrible.
As General De Gaulle's military delegate, you are ordered to avoid an uprising at all costs.
But how can I possibly control all the other groups of resistance?
What can I say to them?
Just be patient, relax, and one of these days the Allies will show up?
We must convince the Allies to help us.
Amicol, do you think with a bit of pressure from intelligence service they might change their plans?
My friend, all I'm supposed to do is to get information.
And I do, believe me.
The decision is part of strategy.
They must save all of their fuel to push their way to the Rhine and before Hitler can regroup his troops.
There's only one solution.
I have to go to London.
Then in your absence I will do everything that is in my power to avoid an uprising.
You can't prevent it without any help.
Bernard Labe.
Only he can help us now.
Would you please do me a favor and get me a cup of coffee before I collapse?
I'm afraid you'll have to collapse.
With the new commander, no more coffee breaks.
It's all work and no play.
Austerity till victory.
Just on the front.
Let's not exaggerate.
Reporting for duty,
Herr General.
You are seven minutes late this morning.
I'm sorry, Herr General.
Issue a proclamation to the population of the city of Paris.
Print it immediately.
Should any civilians shoot at a single German soldier, the entire block in which the shot was fired will be razed to the ground.
Do you have such a good memory you don't need to write down what I'm saying?
Yes, Herr General.
I mean, no...
I mean, no, Herr General.
Number two... issue an order to disarm the entire city.
Number three...
I want a plan for the destruction of important strategic points in case we're forced to fight in the city.
To ensure our defense.
Number four... a plan to destroy the entire city in case we're forced to withdraw and retreat to the Rhine.
Destroy the entire city?
Ja.
Any objections?
But is Paris of any strategic importance?
Is there any point in turning the city into a heap of rubble?
Cable Berlin... ask for the arrival date of Captain von Ebernach and his demolition squad.
Also the arrival date of Karl.
"Also arrival date of Karl."
What is his last name, sir?
Hmm?
Oh, ja.
Here, look at this.
That's Karl there.
No, not this one.
Here, look.
A giant mortar.
A beautiful toy.
When old Karl spits out a shell, a city block is erased.
You see that man?
Gives you an idea of the scale.
Ja?
You have lovely children,
Herr General.
Ja.
When you're finished, report back to me.
Ja wohl, Herr General.
Tomorrow morning, the Gestapo will transfer Bernard to Fresnes.
He'll only stay there two or three days.
Oh, if I'd only known.
Do you realize it was the morning the Gestapo arrested Bernard that I found out he worked for the Resistance?
He never knew I was working for them, too.
Each of us kept it a secret.
You might as well tell me the truth.
Were his responsibilities important?
His district covered all of Paris.
More than that, he had respect and admiration of the entire Resistance.
Now there's talk of insurrection, and your husband is one of the few men who can influence Colonel Rol, persuade him to wait.
Bernard is very important to us.
Then... you've got a plan?
Can you get Bernard out?
I have to go away on a mission.
I'm afraid you have to do it without me.
How? Tell me.
Go see Nordling, the Consul General of Sweden.
He's already negotiated for several prisoners.
The cost is high, 20 Germans for every Frenchman, but it's our only hope.
Nordling.
I'll go see him.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
See you after your dance class.
Pardon.
And where are you going, Madame?
I must see Consul Nordling right away, sir.
No, that's impossible.
I'm sorry.
- It's very urgent.
- Can you come back?
It's important.
I've got to see him.
Have you an appointment,
Madame?
It's a matter of life and death.
No, no.
Well, I'm very sorry, but I must ask...
It'll only take a few minutes.
Now, I promise.
Please let me see him.
What's going on here?
Herr Consul Nordling, my name is...
She's trying to force her way in.
What can I do for you, Madame?
Oh, Mr. Nordling, I'm terribly sorry to disturb you, but my husband is in the prison at Fresnes.
Madame, there are 2,980 political prisoners in Fresnes.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Oh, but Bernard is a very important leader in the Resistance.
Bernard Labe.
His work is important.
Bernard.
Bernard Labe.
Races horses, has the lovely place in the country?
Yes.
I've been there.
Madame Labe, you-you don't remember me.
I came with a large company.
You were very charming.
I... I particularly remember the lunch.
There was a marvelous mousse.
Mr. Nordling, you're speaking of another century.
Oh, please, what can I do?
Well, the Germans, so far, have refused to exchange political prisoners.
However, there's a new commander, and it's... just possible.
Oh, will you see him?
Can you see him?
I...
I will give anything.
Money, anything.
Trout.
What?
It was a mousse of trout.
That day at the lunch.
- Oh.
- Come on.
Where are they being sent?
Across the Rhine.
Buchenwald.
Buchenwald.
Oh, Buchenwald, oh, Buchenwald.
They're sending the French prisoners to Germany, and we stay here.
Why the easy way when they can make things hard?
Papers, please.
These are the plans for destroying the most important factories.
Herr General, the Swedish
Consul Nordling is here.
He wishes to see you immediately.
No, I can't now.
I gave specific orders that my conference with Captain Ebernach was not to be interrupted.
Consul Nordling insists it's very urgent.
He'll have to wait.
Ja wohl, Herr General.
Are these the plans of the factories?
Ja wohl. Over 200,
Herr General.
The bridges. 48.
The electrical works.
The reservoirs.
The gas works.
In five minutes, the entire city's totally destroyed.
How long will it take your men to place the explosives?
48 hours.
Good.
Herr General, are we also supposed to destroy the historical monuments?
The Notre Dame?
The Louvre?
Everything.
But not before you receive my personal order.
Ja wohl, Herr General.
This is the greatest assignment the Fuhrer has ever entrusted to me.
To destroy an entire city.
Well... we've had enough practice, haven't we?
Ja wohl, Herr General, but never on such a scale.
You're right.
With Paris, the eyes of the world will be upon us.
But don't forget, huh?
You are not to begin any demolition without receiving written orders from me.
I understand, Herr General.
That will be all.
A beautiful city, Herr General.
Ja.
I suppose so.
But we are soldiers, not tourists.
Send in the Swedish Consul.
Ja wohl, Herr General.
- Herr Consul.
- General.
What can I do for you?
General... it is my desire that the prisoners camps be conducted according to the Geneva Convention.
In order that we may avoid such massacres as have already occurred in Cannes and Fresnes.
That's a political concern, not military.
What happened?
I have a signature.
You do?
I can't believe it.
We have a chance.
Hotel Majestic.
- Oh...
- The prisoners...
Oh, that's marvelous.
May be turned over to the Red Cross if I can get a countersignature from the military governor.
51 is the first bus.
47 is the second bus.
49 is the third bus.
64 is the fourth bus.
Very well.
We shall hold the remaining prisoners until the Red Cross arrives to take them into custody.
Thank you, Major.
Excuse me, I-I wonder, do you happen to have a bit of brandy?
I'm feeling... rather faint.
It must be the heat.
I'm sorry, Consul General.
I do not drink spirits.
But here's some water.
Water's far better for your system than fermented grain.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Major...
I believe that some prisoners are already at the railroad station preparing to leave.
Ja.
2,453 to be exact.
Isn't that a list?
There must be some way to stop them.
They are no longer under my jurisdiction.
Once we deposit them at the station, they belong to the SS.
We don't have trains to repatriate our own wounded home.
And these SS pigs find them to transport prisoners.
There must be some way of releasing these prisoners.
From the SS?
Well...
I suppose you can always try.
I have my orders, which I have conveyed to your group leader.
I advise you to listen to him.
Very attentively.
To avoid any misunderstandings.
Is that clear?
Uh, group leader.
Group leader!
Tell your men what they can expect.
They say that we'll all be executed if anybody escapes.
So there's no use trying to run away.
They'll catch you, and shoot the rest of us.
Papers?
I want to see the Kommandant.
The Kommandant?
Let him pass.
Herr Kommandant.
I have an order from the...
Inside.
Inside!
Inside!
For God's sake, will you stop waving your damn papers in front of my nose?
I don't care in the least what's stamped on it.
Herr Kommandant...
I have orders to send these pigs to Germany.
This has been signed...
Bernard!
Bernard!
I've got the papers!
You are free!
Bernard!
Bernard!
Bernard, I've got the papers!
You are free!
Bernard!
Bernard!
- By general...
- General who?!
General this, General that,
General here, General there...
General damn! Since they tried to kill the Fuhrer,
I don't care about generals anymore.
They're all traitors.
What are you doing here?
How did you get past the roadblock?
What is this?
What's going on?
Why can't you keep any order?
Who is that woman?!
Herr Kommandant, she is under my protection.
- Swedish?
- No, but...
Then get her out of there!
Bernard!
Bernard!
Bernard, you are free!
No! No!
Bernard!
Bernard, no!
No! No! No!
No, Bernard, no!
No!
Bernard!
The Germans have disarmed the police stations at Saint-Denis and Duniere.
As a protest, the entire police force has gone off duty, but the Commissioner of Police ordered them back to their posts.
Will they obey the order?
No. No.
I can't give any orders to the police, but our operation would certainly be much easier... if the police were to stay on strike.
Yes?
It fits in with our plans.
The Resistance units of the police will decide tonight when they meet with the other sections.
I'll be at the meeting.
I'll talk to them.
The leader of the student Resistance was contacted by an agent called Serge.
He said he could get them rifles and ammunition.
How was the student contacted?
By one of his friends.
Says he works for intelligence service.
A favorite trick of the Gestapo.
It's out of the question.
All arms and ammunition must come through us.
Yes, but when?
Very soon.
A little patience.
What did Rol say?
We have to cancel it.
It's too risky.
But that's crazy.
I know Captain Serge.
He can be trusted.
No. It's no.
Oh, but I swear, he told me that...
- It's no use, Paul.
- He promised!
It's no use, Paul.
Colonel Rol says no.
But when are we going to fight back?
Very soon, very soon.
Just be patient.
You come for the ammunition?
I'm Captain Serge.
We were sent here by Francois.
Good work.
You're the first ones.
It's all right; it's Serge.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
Cigarette?
Oh, merci.
Thanks.
Oh, there they are.
They're friends of ours, from the same street.
I'm Captain Serge.
I'm Diane, Catholic Youth Party.
Young Communists.
Here's our driver.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Listen, it's ridiculous, all of us meeting in the middle of the street.
A perfect way to get caught.
Come on, let's go.
The ammunition is in a garage.
Why don't you follow me?
Yes, all right.
Hey, what are you waiting here for?
Hurry, let's go.
Have you got the merchandise?
I've got a big surprise for you, Konrad.
There are at least 30.
How's that?
Bravo.
Don't move.
All of you stay in the truck.
Hands up!
Nobody move!
All right, boys, game's over.
Get into position.
The rest of you, back.
Get them out.
Out!
Aah! No! No! No!
No, no, no!
Not me, not me!
Aah!
Come on, get out!
They killed all of them?
All of them, and no trace of this Serge.
Apparently a Frenchman working for the Gestapo.
I tried to warn them.
The poor kids.
And the strike?
How about the police?
It's done.
They've voted.
Good. And now it's up to us.
Next time, it will be more than posters.
Over there.
Tear them down.
All of them.
Damn French swine.
Any news of Chaban?
The only thing I know is that he's left London.
Will the Allies head for Paris?
I know as much as you do.
Pierreflot, you are late.
I am sorry.
They are all over town.
"Paris fights back."
Hmm, Colonel Rol's been busy, hasn't he?
Mm-hmm.
Apparently, the liberation has begun.
We should have acted first.
Look here, you represent
General de Gaulle in Paris.
What do we do now?
We don't have very much choice, do we?
You sent for me?
What is the latest report?
We have received word from Chabon.
He has returned to Paris.
Chabon's returned.
I must see him before curfew.
We'll call a meeting of the
National Committee tomorrow.
We must move against the Germans before Rol.
We must take the prefecture of police.
It's the nerve center of Paris.
Between now and tomorrow?
The list!
Claire.
Yes?
Mademoiselle, please take this list of names to the mailbox.
The section heads will have all night to notify their agents.
Yes.
May I help you, mademoiselle?
Oh, la, la.
Don't bother.
But curfew is starting in a few minutes.
Permit me.
Ah.
It's not, it's not working so well.
I think it's broken.
I'm sorry.
I have to go home now.
In that case, permit me to take you in my car.
Why, it's very nice of you to help me.
Oh, you simply have no idea how helpful you really are.
Where were you?
What are you doing in uniform?
Well, I saw a circular saying that we should go back to work.
But that's a lie.
The National
Liberation Committee announced they'd dismiss any policeman who puts on his uniform.
Look at us, we're not in uniform.
The orders are to go to the prefecture
But that means they're trying to divide us.
Let them try.
Well, you mustn't come here,
Monsieur Labe.
Things might get dangerous.
That's just the point.
I thought that you might need a chaplain.
Yves Bayet, all your instructions arrived last night.
Everything's working out as we planned.
That's fine. Perfect.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, I'll see you later.
Say, do you think that...
Quiet.
Quiet!
In the name of the Republic, and of General De Gaulle,
I'm taking possession of the prefecture of police.
I never gave orders to take the prefecture.
Looks like somebody else gave the order for you.
Tell our men to go into action immediately.
I'll see what's happening.
Mama!
Take a look down there.
Oh, thank God it's all over.
Jean-Pierre Guillom, do you take Lillian Ceverat for your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
Lillian Ceverat, do you take Jean-Pierre Guillom for your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
Then it is with great pleasure that I pro...
Take off that sash, monsieur.
You're no longer mayor.
Then we can't be married?
The ceremony will continue.
Congratulations and best wishes to you both.
Monsieur Luizet, in compliance with instructions from General De Gaulle,
I'm handing over the prefecture.
- Bayet.
- Yes?
It's Joliot Curie.
You mean... ah.
Ah, excuse me, uh...
Joliot Curie.
Bayet.
Delighted.
Take me to the wine cellar, please.
- The wine?
- That's right.
Go and show the professor the wine cellar.
It's across the courtyard.
Thank you, monsieur.
Don't mention it.
Empty all the wine bottles in the cellar.
Careful.
Easy with the suitcases.
They've got acid in them.
We'll make beautiful
Molotov cocktails.
Even the chateau margot and the champagne?
Yes, except the magnums, they're too big.
The gasoline, the gasoline, hurry.
Attention.
Attention.
This is Colonel Rol talking.
I have a message.
As chief of the F.F.I. for the region of Paris,
I want to congratulate you all.
Thanks to you, the Germans are on the defensive.
That's just the beginning.
But there are far too many of you here.
All of you, except 300, go back to your district headquarters.
We will give you further instructions in due time.
The essential thing is, the Nazis see us all over Paris.
All right, go on.
I see Colonel Rol's found us.
Well, what counts is that we made the first move.
From now on, we are all in the same boat.
We are off to a good start.
The courthouses are occupied, at least 80%.
That's good work.
Now I'm going to check up on the police stations.
Colonel Rol, I have ten men, what shall we do?
Take a position on the riverbank.
But I have no rifles.
Well, go back to bed.
Don't shoot.
Wait till he gets closer.
Quick, the ammunition.
The rifles.
One for me.
Come on.
Here.
Quick.
Go on.
Well, what do we do with them?
Put them in the cellar.
I'm very sorry.
They didn't tell me we weren't allowed to drive across Paris.
You French, I'll kill you all!
I'll kill every one of you!
French pigs.
Take me to the Hotel Meurice!
Hotel Meurice!
What's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What are you waiting for?!
My men are being burnt alive!
Come.
Have three tanks lined up in front of the prefecture right away.
And keep firing at it until every one of them surrenders.
What's more, alert the Luftwaffe at Le Bourget.
We'll need their support.
That will be all.
No. Stay here.
No, let me go.
Listen to me.
Come back.
Monique!
Watch out!
They're going to shoot at us.
Here come the tanks.
Tanks?
- Here come the tanks.
- Where are they?
On Quai St. Michel.
They're encircling us.
They sent a couple of shots through the windows.
Three men were killed.
Quick! Did you get the code through?
- Yes.
- Hurry, Mademoiselle.
- Get down.
- Watch out!
Open up!
It's the Red Cross!
Open the door!
It's the Red Cross!
Damn it!
Just when I was going to get my phone call.
The German...
Hello. German tanks are firing on the prefecture.
Hello.
Hello? We must have reinforcements.
Send every man who's available.
At Ile de...
Hello? Hello? Hello?
At Ile de la Cite.
You must... you must attack the enemy from behind.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Can you hear me?
Hello? H... Hello?
What did you...
Hello. What?
There's another call.
I'm sorry. Quickly.
He's wounded.
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Badly.
It's the Mayor of Paris, but he's wounded.
- Hello, hello.
- He's been hit.
Germans attacking.
Send reinforcements.
Hello? Yes.
Oh, quickly, quickly.
A doctor before he dies!
Diane.
What are you doing?
Don't you see he's dead?
What do you expect us to fight with?
Pen knives?
We've called all over town for ammunition.
They want us to give up the prefecture.
But that's impossible.
Physically and morally.
Absolutely impossible.
Now that we're here, we're staying.
Quick, hurry up!
So, that's the thanks I get for freeing those political prisoners.
And now that rebel at the prefecture wants a cease-fire.
Ha!
Never.
We exterminate all of them!
I promise you that by tomorrow they'll be no prefecture, no cease-fire, no palace.
We leave that to the Luftwaffe.
And if a bomb should miss?
A few bombs always miss, but others will hit the target.
It's the law of averages.
A bomb that misses... could hit...
Notre Dame.
Ste. Chapelle.
That's a thousand years of history turned to dust.
You're not the first one to tell me that.
Yesterday morning, the Mayor of Paris was here,
Monsieur Titinger.
Titinger?
And he said the same thing.
But what can I do?
I am a soldier, and I must obey the orders
I was given by the Fuhrer.
General... your enemy... is the Allied Army, not the people of Paris.
What you really care about is the defense of the city.
Hmm? Am I right?
Arrange for a cease-fire, and you'll have time to prepare that defense.
Report from the prefecture.
Our men are losing ground.
How's it going in Noilly?
Heavier resistance than we expected.
Order the Luftwaffe into action over Paris.
Herr General, the Allies have air superiority.
If we try daylight bombing, we'll lose the last planes that we've got left.
Then attack tomorrow morning before dawn.
The divisions from Denmark... have we had any word of them?
No, and I'm doubtful that we'll ever get them.
Then...
You, you will accept a cease-fire?
I must hold the bridges, and time is running out.
With a cease-fire,
I could gain time.
But you do the negotiating.
I don't want to be involved with it, understand?
Of course.
But if those people dare to shoot at even one of my men...!
Don't worry, General.
History will be grateful to you... for having saved a... very beautiful city.
Hello.
Susan?
Yes.
I'm fine.
I wanted to hear your voice.
Yes.
The children, how are they?
Give them a kiss.
Of course I do.
Don't worry, I will.
Yes.
No, no, don't worry.
No, please.
I don't even have any bullets...
We won! They're pulling out!
They're running away!
No, don't, please.
You mustn't.
Cease fire.
A cease-fire has just been concluded with the German Commander of Paris.
The National Committee of Resistance issued an appeal to all citizens of the Republic not to engage in any further reprisals or demonstrations of any kind.
In exchange, the German occupation forces agree not to attack public buildings now in the hands of the Resistance.
Furthermore, they agree to treat all French prisoners according to the laws of war in the Geneva Convention.
Cease fire!
A cease-fire has just been concluded with the German Commander of Paris.
How do you like that?
What's going on?
Those double-crossers used my name to order a cease-fire.
Now that the Germans are running, we're not going to quit.
I'm afraid we'll have to quit... no ammunition.
We'll find some.
Thanks to the cease-fire...
Thanks to the cease-fire we have already won, first of all, official recognition of this committee and of our forces in Paris.
Furthermore, we can avoid certain defeat, a crucial point.
You know perfectly well the prefecture would have been taken in an hour at most.
- And you know why, too.
- Yes.
Where was the ammunition?
Our delegation has demanded time and time again that the Allies give us arms and launch a spearhead on Paris.
We haven't received an answer.
I met General Patton myself.
He didn't say it in so many words, but it's clear that the Allies intend to capture Paris by encirclement.
It is up to us to remain where we are.
There's no choice.
We must keep the gentleman's agreement we made with Choltitz.
Choltitz.
With Choltitz, gentleman.
That's right. Choltitz.
I'm only concerned with saving the lives of our men and avoiding unnecessary killing.
For us, it's only a matter of deferring all combat until such time as the balance of forces swings in favor of the Resistance.
I see.
We sit on our behinds until the arrival of the Allies.
That is treachery!
It is you who are traitors!
It is impossible to discuss anything seriously under these conditions.
I'm leaving!
I propose we put it to a vote.
Raise your hands if you're voting in favor of a cease-fire.
All those who oppose it?
The cease-fire is rejected by one vote.
I will abide by the decision of the majority, but for tactical reasons,
I must request that our decision to resume fighting not be announced before tomorrow, 3:00.
Halt!
We must put on a show for them so act with authority.
Leave it to me.
Get out!
Hands up!
We are representatives of the Resistance.
A cease-fire was concluded with the General in command of Paris through the intervention of the consul of Sweden.
We are checking to make sure that it's respected.
We shall see.
Major, a briefcase.
Terrorists.
I'm sorry, this is serious.
Very serious.
You're obliged to respect the conditions of the truce.
You have to liberate us.
Go on, get in.
Quickly, get in.
They could be telling the truth, but I can't afford any more trouble.
I think I'd better check up.
I'm turning this over to the Gestapo.
I'll take the women in my car and you the men in yours.
Yes, sir.
Go on! Both of you.
I decided the only thing to do was to execute them, but then I thought you might want to speak to them.
Gentlemen.
I suppose you know the Swedish Consul,
Herr Nordling.
Thanks to his efforts, we arranged a truce which, up to now, has cost the lives of 200 German soldiers.
As a representative of General De Gaulle's provisional government,
I protest!
Against our arrest in the midst of the cease-fire.
We are just contacting our people to make sure they respected it.
In your car, my guards discovered a proclamation that was designed to provoke the city of Paris to revolt.
I don't see how you maintain you're respecting the cease-fire and then make vicious attacks on our men right in front of our faces!
I'm a member of the French
Government in Exile and I won't permit you to question my word of honor!
The circular in the car was a proclamation that had been revoked.
In that case, why did your men shoot at our soldiers?
You command an army of regulars.
When you give an order, your men obey it.
The Resistance is an alliance of many movements, and I don't control them all.
The Communists, for example?
Our ranks include both
Communists and anti-Communists.
Now we're all battling against a common enemy.
You can make among yourselves all the politics that you want!
Only you must not shoot at my soldiers!
If you would like to finish these incidents, stop sending out your patrols.
Herr Consul... since these men were taken prisoner after the cease-fire went into effect,
I place them in your custody.
Thank you, General.
Are you an officer?
Officer in the Reserves.
Well, then...
Get these men out of here before I change my mind.
Careful.
Well... now we're going underground and I mean literally.
We've taken most of the police stations and post offices.
Good, but remember, no matter what as long as the Germans are in Paris, the orders are to keep fighting.
It's right through here.
We'd better hurry.
He'll be calling any minute.
Hey, Maurice.
Here, German sweaters, underwear.
Ah! It's about time.
We're freezing here.
Take one.
Here, give this to Jean.
It's time.
Ja. Ja.
Everything's in order.
Heil Hitler!
What's going on?
The German watchman.
Every day for the last two years he's called to make sure everything's all right in the sewers.
Hello? Hello?
This is the main sewer station,
Place de la Concorde.
A Nazi tank is still patrolling.
Nothing else to report.
Everything's all right.
Somehow, we've got to make contact with the Allied Command.
I thought you were sending Veret.
He was killed.
He didn't even reach the front.
That makes six men we have lost.
And so we'll have to send out a seventh.
Maurice, you know the region?
I- I'm from Marseilles.
You know Normandy?
I've been there on vacation, but I can't say I know it very well.
That leaves it up to you,
I guess.
Will you do it?
Of course.
Dr. Monod has a car, a safe-conduct, everything.
He told me that you might get through by pretending you're going to inspect the hospitals in Normandy.
Sounds good.
Good.
But after you've contacted the Americans...
If I contact them.
Good morning.
These are your papers.
You're assisting me.
I'll let you drive the car.
Uh, tell me, know any medical terms?
No, nothing much.
Well, I'll have an intern at the hospital at Versailles come along with us.
It will help.
A good motor.
Ah. Old Marcie gave me a real gasoline.
- For you.
- Yes, who is it?
It's a man.
I can't hear him.
Hello. Yes? Yes?
It's Mantes! Yes!
The Americans are in Mantes!
The Americans are in Mantes!
Listen.
Y- You can hear tanks.
Listen!
Here, listen!
I can't believe it!
Hospital attendant.
There, you see?
Und he?
He's been assigned to us.
Why, yes, he's my assistant.
We're going to visit one of my patients at the sanitarium in Neufchateau.
The doctor and his assistant have an emergency call, and they'd like to go to Neufchateau by car.
Hey, what's going on over there?
Turn everybody back.
The curfew begins in 30 minutes.
Go on!
I'll have every one of you shot!
Halt!
Turn around!
What are you doing here today,
Monsieur Cocteau?
Good evening, monsieur.
It's nearly curfew.
Matter of fact, we've come to see you.
Oh, fine.
It's a pleasure.
Is it all right?
Of course. Certainly.
I'll open the gate.
Follow me.
So, that's your real name?
I hope you gentlemen will be comfortable.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you, monsieur.
According to the farm boy, it's only 11 kilometers to the front.
He's willing to show me the way.
It's safer to go at night.
You mean you trust a farm boy you never saw before?
Why, you won't even make two kilometers in this rain, and with those shoes.
What if you meet a German patrol?
You can't say you are on your way to give a sick cow some medicine.
Listen, my friend.
To me, it's madness to ask the Allies to parachute arms into a city like Paris.
You realize... guns dropping all over the roofs, in the streets?
You know very well they might fall into anybody's hands.
But after all, it's my mission.
Well, instead of asking for weapons, say they should push immediately for Paris.
Impossible. My orders are...
Well, then, if that doesn't work, you must try and speak to Leclerc, all alone.
Why, returning to Paris... it's been his dream for four years.
Ooh.
I shouldn't have eaten those pig's feet.
To think I'm a doctor.
They always give me heartburn.
You'll never make it, believe me.
The woods are crawling with SS.
The roads are all blocked for ten kilometers.
What do we do now?
The morning's wasted, and we still can't get around the Germans.
Come on.
Major Georges.
Of course, that's it. Why not?
He's the head of the Resistance in Corbeil.
Hurry.
No, no, give me the ration ticket tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
Here, Pierre.
Take your bread.
There. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Thank you very much.
The Americans are at edge of the woods.
Then it's all right.
Good.
Well, I'll leave you here.
I must return to the hospital as soon as possible.
And the Germans?
The Germans?
At the other end of the village.
They've occupied a farm with guns behind each stack of hay.
Believe me, with them you mustn't use tricks.
You must show force.
It's the only method.
Let's go.
Is he the one?
Yes, it's him.
He wants to go over to see the Americans.
Well, we can try.
Seymour!
Watch the store.
I use them because of their uniforms.
The Germans have respect for uniforms.
Conditioned reflex.
I'll let you know when I get back.
I'm going, too.
You need support.
Go on.
Albert...
Yes or no?
Watch out for the machine guns.
Ready?
Ready.
Stop!
This is a good spot.
All right.
Hey, go on.
The Americans are across the field.
Well, good luck.
Thanks.
Get going.
Let him go.
If we shoot him, we'll give away our position to the Americans.
Hey... where did you come from?
I come from Paris with a message for General Eisenhower.
Here's the new call to arms.
Fine.
Where did you find that tin hat?
I stole it from a German sergeant while he was taking a nap.
You should've picked one that fit you.
Hey, why don't you bring a pillow along, too?
Here are the bullets.
Take them over to Colette.
I stole them from the bakery.
They had plenty.
We start out of Deburre, fly over Paris, back to the airfield, then start over again.
Herr General Field Marshal.
Please leave us alone for a minute.
It is quite clear that you are no longer able to keep order in the city.
And we've also learned that you've negotiated with the terrorists.
Herr General Field Marshal...
It's not your business to meddle in politics.
Why did you make the panzers leave their post at the prefecture?
I thought it more efficient to attack with the Luftwaffe.
Then please explain why you didn't use the Luftwaffe?
Because of the superior air strength of the Allies.
I discussed it with Major Hegel of the Luftwaffe...
I warn you, you must restore order by any method, however drastic.
Ja wohl,
Herr General Field Marshal.
If you don't follow my orders you know what the consequences are.
Ja wohl,
Herr General Field Marshal.
Heil Hitler.
Hell Hitler.
General Field Marshall Model.
Draw up a plan for the bombing of Paris.
Okay. Major Gallois.
I've been sent by Colonel Rol, the head of the
French Resistance for Paris, to tell you that we have seized half of the city.
And now we want you to...
You want what? Hmm?
We want you to help us.
The situation is this: we hold all the official buildings.
After one day's truce, fighting has started again, but we are short of arms and ammunition.
The Germans will find out sooner or later, and when they do, their reaction may be terrible.
Especially if they receive reinforcements from the east, as we are told.
They may destroy Paris.
So we ask you to send us one unit to liberate the city immediately.
You're a soldier,
I'm a soldier,
I'll give you a soldier's answer.
First, we're not in the business of liberating cities, not even capitals.
Our business is to destroy the German army.
We can end this war in three months if we keep moving fast.
Second, Major Gallois, don't you think that I would like to help you people?
Can't you see what my position is right now?
Third, we can't change plans that have been scheduled for months.
Final victory depends upon it.
Our plans don't include feeding four million
Parisians, hmm?
I'm sorry, Major, it's no dice.
I'll report our conversation to my superiors in Paris.
Sit down.
Orderly!
Yes, sir?
Open up a bottle of champagne.
- Champagne.
- Yes, sir.
Are you tired?
No, sir.
May I ask you a... a personal favor?
What is it?
I want to talk to a French officer, General Leclerc.
Mmm. Leclerc?
That impatient lion.
You mind traveling all night?
Of course not.
Good.
Here's one for the road.
Akerns?
Yes, sir.
Get a jeep and a driver for this man and see that he gets to Laval.
He needs to see General Leclerc.
Thank you, sir.
You got a long trip ahead of you.
Half the brass in Europe is at Laval, you know?
Hello? Hello?
General Bradley, please.
Good trip, huh?
Brad?
What the hell's happening in Paris?
Colonel Lebel, Major Gallois.
Colonel Lebel,
General de Gaulle's liaison, assigned to General Bradley.
General Patton telephoned to say you were en route.
Who?
General Patton.
You saw him at the front.
That was General Patton?
Yes.
General Leclerc is not here but, um, I...
I told the Americans you were coming, and they are very anxious to see you.
In fact, General Sibert will interrupt a staff meeting to hear your report.
This is our last chance to convince the Allies that they must go on straight to Paris.
It's up to you now.
Yes.
We're listening, Major.
The Resistance and the people of Paris now control most of the city.
We wanted to welcome you to a liberated Paris.
But we cannot hold out indefinitely.
We need your help.
The Germans have no organized units between your advanced lines and Paris.
From the military point of view, it would be a-a mistake, almost a crime, if you didn't take advantage of such a favorable situation.
It... it is only a question of time, gentlemen.
The Germans will counterattack, and they have precise orders to destroy Paris.
Hundreds of thousands of Parisians will be... slaughtered.
The French people will never forgive the Allies for not coming to their aid.
Never.
You're very eloquent.
As a matter of fact, what you told us is exactly what
General de Gaulle's been telling Eisenhower.
I'm contacting Bradley immediately.
You must send us a unit a once.
You can tell General Leclerc that I may have some news for him.
Leclerc? Is he here?
Yes, he arrives in a few hours.
Anyway, congratulations.
I think you made a good impression.
Come on, let's get something to eat.
You must be hungry, eh?
Please.
Here we can talk quietly.
Have a seat.
Your cease-fire didn't work out as you planned.
The situation is worse than before.
The Allies have crossed the Seine near Mantes, so if our information is correct, they'll encircle Paris shortly.
Then I must take drastic measures and begin the demolition of the city.
Really mean to destroy the city?
If that cease-fire of yours had worked out...
We did our best.
Nobody can control the Resistance now.
If de Gaulle were here...
Why doesn't anybody get in touch with him and ask his help?
With de Gaulle?
It's the only way Paris will ever be safe from destruction.
The Resistance is going to force my hand otherwise.
This is the final order
Hitler gave me.
Destroy the entire city of Paris.
Herr Consul, do what you can.
I've issued this for you: a pass that will get you safely through the German lines.
Why are you doing this?
Herr Consul, if I thought that the destruction of Paris could win the war for Germany,
I would set the city on fire myself.
But... we've lost the war.
Then... why has Hitler ordered the destruction of Paris?
Because he's insane.
I know it.
I saw him in Rastenburg.
There are two SS officers waiting for you.
Did you find anything?
No, Herr General.
Force of habit.
Well?
It concerns a mission that's rather delicate.
Well, isn't that the specialty of the SS?
Delicate missions?
Vice Minister Himmler has recently learned that the Louvre has a very valuable tapestry.
A what?!
A tapestry.
It's, uh... it's called the, uh... the Bayeux Tapestry.
11th Century.
It shows the Norman invasion of England.
The Vice Minister would like us to bring it as a gift for the Fuhrer.
Huh.
Instead of the real invasion of England.
I don't find that so amusing, Herr General.
Well, gentlemen, you can have the tapestry.
We were certain we could count on you, Herr General.
Only the Louvre is in the hands of the Resistance.
But the Louvre is just over there.
Ja. The only question is, will it still be there when we get through blasting it?
But why don't you try to bargain with the French?
Go with a white flag in your hand.
You never know. They could give it to you as a present.
Gentlemen, good day.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!
We represent the ministers of the Provisional government.
The cease-fire has at least permitted us to occupy the buildings.
But we must make one more step toward installing the new government by holding a meeting of the new cabinet.
Let's say, at 6:00.
Right.
Then we'll have to take the Maintenon.
Pierrelot will take care of that.
The Maintenon?
Maintenon Palace.
Ah.
Traditionally, that's where all cabinet meetings take place.
I don't think there are any Germans there, but I understand that a group of collaborators are still occupying the building.
Do you think they'll try to keep us out?
We know that some of them are against us.
You never can tell.
Take 30 men along with you.
That should do it.
30 men, huh?
Well, I guess
I better get going.
Claire, start telephoning.
All right.
Gentlemen, see you at 6:00 for the cabinet meeting.
At the Maintenon.
Where else?
Hello? Is Marcelle in?
He's not there?
- Well?
- Nobody can go with you.
Did you reach Maurice?
He can't leave the office.
The Germans are guarding the street.
And Joliot?
At the town hall it's the same thing.
Well, I'll go alone.
I'll go with you.
Over there.
Go on.
Hurry.
Pardon, monsieur.
Yes?
Do you know where the Maintenon is?
Over there, monsieur.
The Prime Minister's house?
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, across the Seine.
Rue de Varenne, yes.
Go on.
Rue de Varenne?
Oh, there's a sentry box in front.
You can't miss it.
And be careful.
They're shooting everywhere.
We'll get ourselves killed.
Come.
What do we do now?
Eh...
Let's go.
What do you want?
The officer in command.
Major, there is someone to see you.
I'm the officer in charge.
What do you want?
I have come to take possession here in the name of the Provisional
Government of the Republic.
Monsieur Le ministre, I've always been for the Republic.
I place myself at your disposal.
Thank you, Major.
Detail, fall in.
You forgot to put armbands on.
Attention!
Close ranks.
Present arms.
The staff welcomes you,
Monsieur Le ministre.
Thank you.
Take me to the Council Hall.
If Monsieur Le ministre will follow me.
Who are you?
Switchboard operator.
Go back to your switchboard.
And you?
Chief librarian, monsieur.
Return to your library.
The meeting starts in two hours.
How many will you be, monsieur?
Around 30.
Very well.
The Prime Minister's desk.
Ah, monsieur, I've seen governments come and go, but nothing like the last one.
They took everything they could.
Even the silverware.
And here is the Council Hall.
Not bad.
Would you please provide some pencils and erasers?
And ink and scratch pads.
In other words, the usual preparations for Council meetings.
Good.
And we will also need rooms for the night.
Bedrooms.
I assume Monsieur Le ministre will the want the Green Room for his personal use?
The Green Room?
It's always reserved for the Prime Minister.
My, my.
Hmm, adequate.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I know exactly how you feel, my son.
But no emotion.
The facts.
If you don't march immediately on Paris, they'll destroy the entire city.
The situation is as serious as that?
I'm afraid so.
You must begin your drive on Paris... tomorrow.
I should personally like nothing better.
And I'm doing all I can to convince headquarters, but you can't push an armored division around like a wheelbarrow.
We've just fought a battle at Argenton.
We're very far from Paris.
I could make it.
But I would have to receive the orders today.
And if not?
If not?
We'll see what we can do.
General de Gaulle will end up by convincing the Allies.
And now, tell me everything.
Well, where's General Bradley?
If he's not here before 7:00, it's going to be too late.
I've got to get that order before tonight.
Ah, here he is.
Well, I got the news
I was waiting for, Sibert.
Where is he?
You win.
The decision has been made to go into Paris, and the three of us hold the responsibility for that decision.
I, because I'm giving the order, you, General Leclerc, because you are going to execute it, and you, Major Gallois, because you brought us the information that led us to that decision.
Thank you.
How do you feel, Major?
Hmm? Oh, I haven't slept in three days.
I promise you a full day's sleep.
But right now
I'm sending you down to G-2, and tomorrow you can join General Leclerc at Ramboullier.
Rebius?
We're moving on to Paris.
Is that your son, Lieutenant?
He was two then.
And now he's four years old.
I've never seen him.
Off your behinds!
We're marching on to Paris!
I'd better shave off my beard before my wife sees it.
This is it.
We're going to Paris!
Dampierre!
That way, there.
Where are you going?
To Paris!
Paris?!
Well, you've still got a long way to go.
I have an aunt who has a restaurant in Montparnasse.
We can eat off her for ten years.
Is that near the Bastille?
Not the Bastille.
I said Montparnasse, peasant.
They signed off, sir.
Fine. Message finished.
Two German panzer divisions have started out for Paris.
Call all the other units.
We must notify them.
Go on, quickly, quickly.
Orders from the General.
All units accelerate.
Where is Leclerc now?
They're moving, they're going all out but they're still more than 50 kilometers away.
Mm. That's about 30 miles.
You know, we can't run the risk that German general might just suddenly change his mind and destroy the city.
So Leclerc has quite a job on his hands.
Tell Hodges to keep the Fourth Division ready just in case.
Look, the Eiffel Tower... that's on the... the right side of the river, right?
The Right Bank?
The left.
Well, okay, if the Eiffel Tower is on the left... that means that the Louvre is on the right, yeah?
And the Chambre of, what do you call it?
Of Deputes.
Now, look, will you just knock it off and quit bothering me?
Yeah, but you've been to Paris and I haven't.
Boy, I never thought in a thousand years
I'd get to see Paris.
Yeah. See Paris and die.
No, that's... that's Naples.
What do you think happens when you die?
You go to Naples.
Funny.
Start unloading those bazookas there, Sergeant.
We going into Paris, Lieutenant?
Yeah, we're moving out.
Oh! The telephone's working!
We can call Paris!
We can call Paris!
We can call...
Hey! The telephone's working!
We can telephone Paris.
Hey, Maurice, the telephone's working.
You can call your house.
Madame, please.
Put a call through for me to Elysees 3-2-2-6.
It's my parents.
My mother, Madame Bovera.
Tell her I'm coming with the Black Berets.
You've come a long way?
Yes.
Sahara.
Sahara?
Mama!
It's Mama.
It's me, Henri.
Put-put the champagne on ice.
We're coming!
How much do I owe you?
May I?
Of course.
Hello?
C'est beau l'accuell...?
Hold on, please.
Here you are.
Hello?
Hello, it's me.
It's me!
But it's true,
I tell you, it's me!
I say it's me. Me!
Tell her your name, it'll be quicker.
Huh?
All right, who are you?
Georges.
All right. Hello. It's Georges.
I mean, I'm not Georges.
I mean, yes, it's Georges.
I'm calling for Georges.
But he can't speak.
He's too excited.
Hey, Georges, we're leaving!
He's in Arpageon.
Tell her we're on the way.
On the way.
He's on the way.
Yes, and I give her a kiss.
He's on the way.
He gives you a kiss.
He loves you.
I love her.
I love her.
Good-bye, Madame.
Where have you come from?
From Paris.
Here are the locations for the mines.
Uh-huh.
Fine.
Then we move on to the next site.
One hour and it's all finished.
They're going to have such a show of fireworks, they'll think the whole world is burning.
We are going home to Berlin!
We are going home to Berlin!
We'll be back for Christmas!
Wait a minute, stop pushing.
General Leclerc asks me to tell you that they're on the march... to hold fast!
Hey, believe it or not, we're passing right in front of my house.
I live on the corner.
Our kitchen is just above the restaurant, and I used to get my cigarettes at the shop across the way.
You know, I said to my wife,
"I'll be back."
"I'm going to get a pack of cigarettes."
The funny part is,
I didn't go back.
I signed up with De Gaulle.
What will you tell your wife?
I've got the pack of cigarettes... Camels.
All right, on your feet.
Hurry, hurry.
What is it now?
You can come out.
Oh, about time.
What's going on?
You've got work to do.
Oh, work.
Yeah.
Hurry.
It's a tank.
55 meters. Direct target.
First, they put you in jail.
Then, they want you to defend it.
Fire. Fire.
What are you doing there, Daum?
We're joining the regiment, sir.
That's stupid.
Yes, but those are the orders.
You should never obey stupid orders.
Sir, they tell me there is a clear road ahead.
Good. You're starting immediately for Paris.
Don't worry about the Germans. Just go.
Don't stop for anything.
Tell the Parisians we're coming.
We'll be there... tomorrow.
Very well, sir.
Go on.
Daum!
Didn't I tell you to clean that up?
There was no time, sir.
In Paris we have to look our best.
Hey!
Who are they?
They're Germans.
No, they are Americans.
Get away from the window.
Juliet, come inside. Juliet!
Why, they're American.
The Americans?
It's the Americans!
The Americans.
No, they're French!
Oh, they are French.
They're French!
I can't believe it!
Say, what's the shortest way to the town hall?
It's very simple, Captain.
You take the Avenue de...
Take the Rue de la Piscine.
Thank you. Thank you.
Why are the bells ringing like that?
Herr General...
They're announcing our funeral, my dear Fraulein Irma.
Would you connect me with General Spiedel?
Put a call through to General Spiedel.
Why do you look so surprised, all of you?
You thought a miracle would save us, huh?
None of you seems to realize what's happening... in Russia, in Germany... or even what's happening now in Normandy.
After the past few months,
I don't think anything could surprise me.
General Spiedel.
Good evening, Spiedel.
There is something you should hear.
Bells?
Ja, they are ringing.
They've been silent for four and a half years.
They're ringing to announce the arrival of the Allies.
And now will you send me those divisions you promised us almost a month ago?
Unfortunately, no.
Our reserves are completely exhausted.
Ja, then, dear Spiedel.
I would appreciate you doing a favor for me.
See that my family doesn't suffer.
Thank you. Ja.
Hmm. Napoleon's tomb.
All his victories:
Marengo,
Austerlitz, lena,
Freidland,
Wagram,
Moscow.
Moscow...
Von Choltitz here.
The Fuhrer wants to know are you ready to proceed with the burning of Paris?
Of course, General Jodl, of course.
All the charges have been placed under the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower.
What are you waiting for?
Why the delay?
What's holding you up?
All the demolitions are set for the fortified bridges, for all of the waterworks.
Then I see no reason for you to delay any longer.
Give the order for total destruction.
The minute that all our occupation units have evacuated the city.
It should've been done already!
The Fuhrer wants the city burned now!
Is that clear?!
Do you know where my son is?
What's his name?
Maurice Bovera.
Don't know him.
Where are the Black Berets?
Over there.
Thank you.
Colonel Fabien.
We are ordered to support your attack on the...
Careful!
Lieutenant Delafu Chartiere.
Second division.
The only way to get those Nazis is to climb up there.
You see?
All right.
Marco, Jacques, you cover us.
- Yes, sir.
- Ready?
Lieutenant Pierre
Delafu Chartiere.
Second Armored Division.
My respects, Madame.
Oh, please, after you.
This way, please.
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
You mustn't force it.
Careful.
They're over there, across the street.
Better step back, Madame.
I want a man at each window.
Yes, sir.
Ooh, careful.
Prepare the grenades.
Right here.
You, you got everything ready?
Careful, my roses there.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, please, please, Madame.
Oh, don't you worry about me.
Oh, don't worry...
Make sure they don't see you, huh?
Jacques, the incendiary grenades?
Ready, sir.
Good.
Marco, ready?
Ready, sir.
When I give the order, hit them with everything.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Ready.
Go on.
Perfect.
Fire.
Cease fire.
Close it carefully, huh?
Madame, thank you for your hospitality.
Gentlemen, would you pick up the cartridge shells?
Very well, sir.
My respects, Madame.
Madame.
All right, we'd better get going.
Madame.
We made it.
We're in Paris.
Yeah, we haven't made it yet.
We got to cross that bridge first.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me.
Ecole Militaire?
Oh, right.
It's there, to the right.
To the right,
Ecole Militaire, right?
Yes.
Please.
Come on. Come on.
Hey!
We've waited four years for you.
But America's only been in the war for three years.
So what?
We knew you'd come.
What's wrong?
Yeah, well, he's already got a date.
But I don't.
The Captain's looking for you.
There's a tank over there.
We've got to knock it out.
Stop.
Bombs are here. Come.
Over here.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you happen to have any bazookas here?
Yeah, yeah.
It so happens we do.
Make it fast.
Cover me, Charlie.
I'm going off with this guy.
Okay, but watch yourself.
We're on the Left Bank, right?
What?
Uh, the... the Left Bank.
Yeah, Boulevard San
Michele over there.
Jardin Luxembourg there.
Yeah.
Yeah, the Latin Quarter.
And, uh, that's not a nightclub either.
That's... that's where the students live, right?
Yeah, I'll explain later.
You see that door?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.
We got it!
We got it!
Yeah.
Hey, let's drink to it.
Yeah, yeah.
First bar we find?
First bar we find.
Okay.
Oh, that was a bull's-eye.
Give us whatever you've got.
Quick.
Quick.
No, not this one.
Come on, have a drink.
We'll open up a good bottle of Bordeaux.
I've never tasted wine till we got to Normandy.
Well, do you like it?
Yeah, I like it.
Hey, I hear there's a war going on.
Oh, come on, give me a break, will ya?
You know, this is exactly the way
I thought Paris would be... a little place like this, checkered tablecloths... red wine.
Come on, Grandpa, you've done your share.
Pardon.
Yes, come back tomorrow.
Hey! Psst! Psst!
Get back inside, for God's sake!
You'll get yourselves killed!
Get back!
They're coming nearer!
Get ready to fire!
300 meters!
Don't stay together!
Francoise! Francoise!
Get over here!
Hurry!
Go get that machine gun!
What are you waiting for!
What's wrong?
It's jammed.
One of the tanks got the panzer.
All right! Let's go!
Good luck to you, Corporal.
I'll be glad to get back to my wife.
She's been waiting six years.
We all have families.
A panzer!
Near the obelisk!
Fire!
Got it! With the smoke shell!
He's going to shoot at us!
No time to reload!
Ram him! Ram him!
A panzer.
Our first in Paris.
Ah, those cowards.
They ran away.
All right, all right. Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on!
Let's go. Back up.
That's right.
We made it at last.
There it is.
Now all we have to do is get inside.
That's not going to be so easy,
Lieutenant.
Well, someone's got to do it.
All right, men, let's go.
Joliot, you and your men guard the entrance.
The others, Gully, Herman, come with me. Inside.
Do we shoot?
Why else are we here?
For a picnic?!
Back, everyone!
A grenade. Quick!
In the interest of saving lives and after a token resistance to preserve our honor,
I'll surrender the city.
I remain, Herr Consul Nordling, gratefully yours...
And so on and so forth.
And see that all this is packed.
We're about to be prisoners of war.
That's if we're lucky.
That'll give me a chance to read
War and Peace at last.
Colonel, I would like to thank you, too.
Get out, all of you, one by one, with your hands up.
All of you, take care of them.
Where's the General?
Herman.
So, Colonel, where's the General?
Who? The General?
- Yes.
- He's upstairs.
Will he surrender?
He will surrender, but only to an officer of the regular army.
Show us the way.
They are here.
Lieutenant Henri Karcher, army of General de Gaulle.
Lieutenant General von Choltitz,
Commander of Paris.
Are you willing to surrender?
Ja.
Unconditionally?
Ja.
Then you are my prisoner.
Give us your arms.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Major Larorie.
General von Choltitz, you have engaged in battle, you have lost.
In the name of General Bayet,
I ask you to give me some of your officers who will ride in Jeeps carrying the white flag so we can convey the order of surrender to those still fighting.
There are already too many killed and wounded.
General, will you follow me?
Karcher, you're in charge of the others.
Yes, sir.
The moment has come.
Come on.
Where are you taking me?
You've surrendered to the French army.
Now you're going to sign the act of capitulation.
Hello, Papa?
This is Lieutenant Karcher.
Your son.
In spite of your pessimistic view of my military career,
I'd like to announce that I've just made prisoners of the general in command of Paris at the Hotel Meurice.
He surrendered to me.
But I'm still very bad at drill.
Go on! Go on!
Go on! Oh...
We made it.
We won the race.
Where are we?
In front of Notre Dame.
What's it look like?
Just like they said, big.
And beautiful with... two towers.

Did you hear a scream?
Like a wild bird, maybe an eagle.
Major...
...I hate this jeep.
I bak ed an eagle once.
Made out of bread.
Finocchi's Bak ery in Los Angeles.
This nut from the Wildlife Federation ordered it.
We came to the wrong war.
If we harness that mother, he'll pull us to Maldorais.
Easily. Maldorais is just there, beyond the hill.
I see Sainte-Croix on the map.
I don't see Maldorais.
Because Maldorais is not a village.
It is a castle.
- A castle?
- Oh, we're gonna barrack in a castle.
It is my castle.
We're going to barrack in your castle.
The Germans did the same.
We're Americans.
I am Henri Tixier,
Comte de Maldorais.
- Captain Beckman.
- Lionel Beckman, the art historian.
Castles interest him.
And this is Major...
Falconer. Let's go.
Keen horse you got there,
Mr. Tixier.
Thank you.
The Germans had no Negro.
These kind gentlemen rescued me from a slaver off of Santo Domingo.
Went down with all hands.
They thought they could learn Swahili from me.
Private Benjamin wants to be a writer, so he talks like a writer.
He thinks the war was invented so he could write a book about it.
Yes, it is Maldorais.
Hey, how long was the Hundred Years' War?
Exactly 215 years.
There are rooms off the great hall.
The enlisted men can live in the keep.
- The keep?
- Castle keep, the tower.
All right, gentlemen.
Has anyone got the exact time?
There you are, Benjamin, a title for your book: Castle Keep.
Not bad.
Castle Keep.
By PFC Alistair P. Benjamin.
Once upon a time...
...eight walking wounded misfits of the American Army...
...entered a castle in Belgium.
But this cannot be a Gothic tale, because it was the Second World War.
Doesn't it give everything another dimension?
No.
Maybe the duke could put in an elevator.
Yeah.
And a flush toilet.
Think my living here will lower the real-estate value?
You trained for the ministry, didn't you, lieutenant?
Then why aren't you a chaplain?
And then the snow came.
It was a good time to write.
All of us had been killed twice.
Some of us three times.
Maybe that's why we were at the castle.
We had been sent to the castle as a replacement company.
Or maybe we had just been put there...
...away from everything...
...to nurse our wounds and sit out the war.
That was three weeks ago when the castle was occupied.
No one knows when the major occupied the countess.
But no one was surprised.
- Yes, Captain Beckman?
- I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know.
You'll learn, Beckman.
It's 6:00, sir. I'm sorry.
You can't do anything about that,
Beckman.
- The men in the chapel?
- Not yet, sir.
Three minutes.
Bitch.
Sergeant Rossi, he's on the way down.
Do you have a pack of cigarettes for me?
I have a chocolate bar.
Do you want it?
The major wants everybody to get his ass in the chapel!
It isn't necessary that we admire each other.
This is where one U.S. Division is holding a 23-mile front.
If the Germans decide not to lose the war so fast, they'll counterattack.
They'll hit that green division and those people will not stop them.
The Germans' first objective...
...will be to secure the hub of the road net in the Ardennes.
This town, Bastogne.
The easiest way to Bastogne is through Verviers.
But they're not coming that way.
Last night there were star shells over
Sainte-Croix. You may have noticed.
They lit the crossroads.
It interests them.
I just want to explain those star shells to you.
It means this is the way they're coming. Right here. This castle.
- Any questions?
- I thought the war was over.
- That's not a question.
- Sir...
...I think you ought to let the
Indian express himself.
- Make him feel part of the group.
- Express yourself.
The Germans couldn't move that many men...
...without our intelligence knowing it.
- Right. Now you're part of the group.
- I have a question.
If they counterattack, wouldn't we be more valuable at the Meuse River?
Saving the castle, the paintings, the sculpture...
...has nothing to do with your strategy.
Frankly, yes, it does.
Well, that's a business about which I understand nothing.
We were put here to service replacements.
But there are no replacements.
So we'll dig in, like real soldiers.
I want the terraces and gardens mined.
Major Falconer.
Maldorais must not become a battleground.
Not a battleground, duke, an island of resistance.
I'll make a diagram of the mining tonight. Also a patrol roster.
Any weapons left behind by the
Germans I want put in firing condition.
Meantime, keep the men occupied.
Find something. Anything.
Put on a play.
I got a good play.
This army stops at a castle.
They're embattled.
They can surrender and save the castle...
...or they can hold.
- It won't work, sir.
It should be about screwing.
Screwing was invented by the Swedes during World War I.
- I got a play.
- Tell it.
A small man comes on stage with a great erection.
Then what?
That's all I got.
Just the first act.
That won't carry the play by itself.
Well, suppose it goes down and down in each succeeding act.
- To infinity.
- Nope.
Any actor who could play the part would get better offers.
Track of the animal.
A boar?
No, a German.
Why not an American?
Those are hobnailed boots.
We don't wear them.
- Should we not return for help?
- No, it's a patrol.
They probably broke through our lines.
- Is there a place we can fort up?
- The summerhouse.
- Does it have a clear field of fire?
- Yes.
Then we'll decoy them to the summerhouse.
What have you got there?
- Han vase.
- What?
Second dynasty.
They're high, about 2 o'clock.
- How's the vase?
- Intact, commandant.
They'll rush us when they get into position.
That's harassing fire to keep us down.
- I've been in a war, commandant.
- Then get rid of that junk.
It's cocked and ready to fire.
Wait till you've got a clear target.
I've got them all spotted.
They had no leader.
One man is missing.
I don't think so.
There were only four tracks.
They wouldn't send a patrol this deep without an officer.
Their officer left them earlier.
Perhaps he went to the castle.
- To what purpose?
- Maybe a mission of his own.
What is it, Captain Beckman?
Jealousy, I'm afraid.
In a chapel?
I've always wanted to live with...
In a place like this.
Now that I'm here, I feel as if...
No, I am an intruder.
We are...
...unwelcome.
Captain Beckman, you are the one who belongs at Maldorais.
I've got the German spotted.
- Where?
- Under the topiary tree near the moat.
Just left your wing of the castle.
He's waiting to see if it's all clear.
He has a rifle, but he doesn't know where the shooting came from.
I'd estimate his range at 200 yards.
- My wing of the castle?
- Yes.
- Is everything correct?
- Everything is correct, duk e.
You shot well, commandant.
He has been a visitor, when the Germans occupied the castle.
He treated the castle with respect.
Your niece seems upset.
My niece is my wife, commandant.
I think you'd better see to your wife, duke.
God is neutral, along with the pope.
But as a traditionalist, he must respect the hierarchy.
The Maldorais.
The Maldorais line must continue.
And God must know where the Americans fit.
Americans are brave and that is why they seem lik e children.
They are young, wild animals.
So, what can you expect?
I can expect a child.
After the war, the flowers will be dead.
And the husbands will take over.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like your permission to hang this Delacroix...
...and some other paintings in the parlour for my lecture.
Your lecture?
I'm organizing an entertainment program for the men.
If it is a matter of their requirements...
Requirements?
That can be taken care of in the village at La Reine Rouge.
- The Red Queen?
- The whorehouse.
- A cigar, captain?
- No.
- Hobbema.
- Yes, a very early one, isn't it?
You live with such things, count.
Works I've read about, second-hand descriptions that don't do them justice.
I've begun an inventory. Unbelievable.
A Botticelli, two Corots.
- Fragonard...
- We are in danger.
Do you intend to do anything about it, captain?
Wait! That's the count's car!
- Enlisted men can't steal his car.
- Right.
- Where you going at this hour?
- Drilling, sir.
- Drilling?
- Drilling the girls at the Red Queen.
So now we were on the way to Sainte- Croix.
The cowboy, the 24-karat Indian, the cook...
... the bak er and myself.
The rage of Paris, France, and all women everywhere.
Bring out early in your book that you're very young and Negro...
...unscrewed and unpublished.
I hate this car.
Who's home to welcome the heroes?
Hey, Rossi.
Where there's a bakery, there's a baker's wife.
The place is closed.
- Where do you come from?
- We come from the castle.
To where are you going?
To the ends of the Earth.
And I think we're there.
Parlez English?
Enough.
I'm a baker.
I'm a baker's wife.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Where's the baker?
Gone.
That's what a man needs.
A baker's wife, kid, family, home.
Come to bed.
I've been making an inventory too,
Captain Beckman.
You should be interested in that inventory.
If those Americans don't hold that ridge...
...your inventory will be shot to hell.
- We don't have to defend here.
- We can drop back to...
- I do, Beckman.
Major, I don't think you know what this castle means.
It stands on the most important crossroads in the Ardennes.
- Isn't that...?
- On the road to Bastogne.
- I think we should pull back.
- Don't think, Beckman.
If something isn't saved, then what's it all for?
You can't save anything by giving it to the Germans.
If you give them anything, you have to give everything.
Is that what you wanna do,
Beckman?
You know all about this...
...castle.
But you don't know how to hold it.
You want it in ruins. Everything.
Do I, Beckman?
My purpose is madness.
It's the only way you can tell what really happened in war.
By lying, you can open the door a little crack on the truth.
Right, baby.
I love the Red Queen.
Red Queen is lovely.
Everybody loves the Red Queen.
Hey, where's Elk?
You're standing on him.
This whole thing has an ineffable, dreamlike quality.
Like I've been here before.
This place, this queen, girls...
- Major Falconer is a warmonger.
- Yeah.
- Besides that, he's immoral.
- What?
Three of them. It just ain't right.
Three of them.
- Who?
- Major Falconer and the duchess.
- Well, that's only two.
- No, the duke is there.
Probably tucks them in.
It just ain't right.
I see. Two people is okay, three people, then it's dirty?
For chrissake, Alistair, can't you see it ain't natural?
Besides that, she's his nephew...
Niece. Anyhow, it just ain't right.
A cowboy like you. American cowboy.
So that's what goes on in that big, wide, wide, outdoor brain.
The movies never told us this about cowboys.
- You wanna fight?
- Not now, I'm thinking.
- I could whip your ass.
- Yeah, that doesn't concern me.
Right now I'm working on your moral indignation.
- What the hell is that?
- Your evangelists.
- My evangelists?
- The evangelists of the American Army.
Hey, you're waking everybody up!
Go back to your outfit!
- Excuse me?
- You're waking everybody up.
Go back to your outfit.
We have no outfit.
We've withdrawn.
- We don't believe in fighting.
- Well, who believes in fighting?
We believe in God.
That frightens you, doesn't it?
All you believe in is fornication and killing.
- What?
- We're conscientious objectors.
You mean you conscientiously object to fornicating?
Hey, didn't you tell them?
They're supposed to excuse you from combat.
They said that our sect was too small!
- Your what was too small?
- Sect! S-E-C-T!
Let the people of the city sleep.
The hell's the matter with you, lieutenant?
Can I tell you something?
I wish I had the courage to go to the Red Queen's.
It would be a way of breaking away from my father.
How does one get the courage,
Captain Beckman?
You have to be an enlisted man.
Cinderella left the ball in such a hurry, she forgot her glass eye...
Slipper. Now, that's how the prince traced her. She had the smallest eye...
- Foot in the world.
- Wait a minute.
You say at midnight, if we don't get back to the castle...
...we're gonna turn into soldiers?
- No, we'll turn into soldiers anyway.
It'd be nice to be in the castle when it happens.
- Where do you come from?
- My bakery.
- To where are you going?
- To that table where my buddies are.
Everybody should eat more bread.
It feeds the heart.
And remember, the heart's the second most important organ in the body.
It disturbs you, my wife and the major.
You find me degenerate.
Or worse, French.
No, I am only impotent.
And I want a son.
What could be more bourgeois,
Puritan, even American, than that?
- You're how old? Twenty, 21?
- Twenty-three.
There ought to be an age limit on the killing.
That doesn't interfere with you, does it?
The German officer under the topiary tree threw his life away.
He made it difficult not to kill him.
He was billeted here?
Yes.
In this room?
Well, how do you feel?
I don't understand.
You don't show much, do you?
What do you want me to do?
I guess there isn't much you can do.
You're not 20 or 23.
You're 1000 years old and you're trying to keep a castle, aren't you?
The war came close today.
I would like to end it.
For a little while, if I can.
You want to end it, don't you?
For a little while.
For a night.
Just before the end of the world,
Captain Beckman gave us soldiers...
... a lecture on the history of art.
Here was a captain in the American Army...
... talking about strength and the force...
Private Benjamin, if you feel more qualified to give this lecture.
Thank you, sir. No, sir.
I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir.
Thank you, Private Benjamin.
We have the privilege of living in this monumental tribute...
...to man's concept of beauty.
I want you to note the connubial chase in Rubens' finest, most supple style.
That must've been his horny period.
Sergeant Rossi.
Gentlemen, I suspect
10 years from now, or 20...
...at some American Legion convention...
...one of your nightmares will be that day in the Ardennes...
...when you weren't blown up by a bomb...
...you were bored to death by
Captain Beckman.
Now, the purpose of my talk...
...is to shock you.
- Sir?
Isn't the purpose to be sure the troops don't get an hour off?
The function of all art is to disturb and awake.
- Now, if I may make a small analogy...
- You do that, sir.
Corporal Clearboy. Was your estimate
General Patton planned in advance...
...his breakthrough out of Normandy?
- I don't know, sir.
I wanted to hear you say that.
He was with General Patton.
He and I were never close, sir.
It makes my point.
There's the same kind of spontaneity in war as in art.
War is an art of becoming, a culmination.
An orgasm?
Yes, art is like a sexual experience.
And the sexual experience, like art, cannot be culminated alone.
You certain about that, sir?
You gentlemen recall the training film
Lieutenant Amberjack showed you?
- The one on sex, sir?
- I'd like to link that to the art of war...
...which the film didn't cover.
When you have a sex film, you can't cover everything.
No, but I mean seriously, gentlemen, sex without love...
...like art without feeling, is nothing more than masturbation.
- Shall we write that down?
- I'm just throwing things out.
Could we pursue that sexual thought further?
- No. No, no, no, no. My point is that...
- Sex is an art.
- No, no.
- Masturbation...
- No, no, De Vaca.
- Sir...
...what would you say if your best girl were sleeping with a 4F?
I don't have to answer that.
I want to get back to the war.
But I'll leave you with a thought that might do some good.
I'll say to you bums that if you ever lecture an hour to a bunch of idiots...
...then resign your commission.
- I'd like to be alone, Alistair.
- You're a fun guy.
- Your talk on art turned me on.
- I don't particularly wanna be fun.
- You mind if I sit down, sir?
- No, you can stand.
You took your lecture too hard.
Is war a subjective thing, sir?
That's a good point.
You know...
- You comfortable?
- Do you mean that facetiously?
No, I mean, you being a private and me being a captain and everything.
- And everything?
- Yes.
The enemy and the American Army is out there and we're talking...
Never underestimate the intelligence of the American soldier, sir.
- You get that in a training manual?
- You shouldn't be bitter, sir.
If a soldier didn't value art, he wouldn't be much of a soldier.
Napoleon before Venice said, " If my cannon destroy but one statue...
...I would rather not take Venice."
Did Napoleon say that?
- Doesn't sound like Napoleon.
- Oh, well, no.
- But I thought it would cheer you up.
- I appreciate that.
But Napoleon was a louse.
- I think soldiering is a bore, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
But I see you have the Purple Heart and Silver Star.
I got excited. For a whole year I was out of my mind, but I've recovered now.
But you'd fight for this castle.
Yes.
I don't know who.
I don't know which side would want to destroy it.
One thing more, sir.
Sorry I couldn't help during the lecture.
That's beyond and above the call of duty.
- Still...
- When you write your book...
...you can rescue me.
No, don't bother.
Just write well about this castle and how we kept it.
It's really not a bad title,
Castle Keep.
Thank you, sir.
Castle Keep.
We will try, sir.
Will that be all, captain?
That is all.
No one knew exactly when...
... Corporal Clearboy fell in love with the Volkswagen.
But there he was one morning...
... petting it, shining it up lik e a silver whore.
I understand you've been sleeping with the Volkswagen.
Yes, sir. Is there a regulation against it, sir?
Yes.
- Sodomy?
- That's animals.
There's a regulation against using enemy equipment. Creates confusion.
Sir. She's a beautiful car, sir.
You must love the Volkswagen very much, Clearboy.
Thirty-six horses.
No water, sir. Hides her engine in her rear, air-cooled. No water, sir.
Is the world suffering a water shortage?
Not now, sir, but suppose this war just goes on and on and on...
...destroys everything in the world.
Since the Volkswagen gets along without water...
...she'll survive when other creatures die off.
Someday the world will be populated with nothing but Volkswagens.
You've figured that out, Clearboy?
Very well, Corporal Clearboy, keep it.
Clearboy has a thing about the Volkswagen.
- Why doesn't he see a doctor?
- Think that's abnormal?
I think it's frustrating as hell.
- Amberjack. I want patrols stepped up.
- Yes, sir.
Be on the lookout for infiltrators slipping into town in advance of attack.
The place for infiltrators is the Red...
Exactly. That's where I'd go.
Sir, you want me to go to the Red Queen's?
No, come back here and play the flute while Beckman saves statues.
That's the way to fight a war.
Seen any infiltrators lately, honey, baby, pussy-lamb?
I gotta draw a lieutenant to lead a patrol who's a flutist.
Flautist.
I gotta draw a lieutenant who plays the "flaute."
Hey. Knock it off, you men.
I'm a German.
All right.
You knock it off too.
- May I a criticism make?
- No.
The " Brahms' Lullaby" goes:
Not:
I studied music in London.
- What are you doing here?
- Surrounding the castle.
- What century is it?
- 20th, for chrissake.
He means the castle.
Tenth.
Beckman says the north wing is 15th.
Lionel Beckman, the art historian?
- Yeah.
- Have you read his book...
... Twelfth-Century Iv ory Miniatures?
- It's wonderful.
- No, I haven't.
Right, tell him nothing.
If you will throw me your flute,
I will fix it for you.
I studied under Mayerhorn.
He's a good man.
He's liable to toss back a grenade.
Never trust a Kraut.
I'm not trusting a Kraut.
I'm trusting a colleague.
Suppose a high-ranking officer came and asked what you did with the flute.
What would you tell him?
The stops were not smooth.
Now listen:
What did you do that for?
That's what we do for a living, lieutenant.
- What were these old tunnels built for?
- Escape.
One branch there comes out behind Maldorais.
In the swamp. This one goes under the moat to the northeast.
Toward the German lines.
You're a collector, Beckman.
I try to be selective, sir.
Suppose you were without an education.
I'd probably collect...
...old string, newspapers.
Fallen women.
Don't judge her, Beckman.
She's not a work of art.
Hey.
- You guys hear something?
- Probably a goldfish spawning.
I hate myself for doing this.
I'll come back after the war and salvage it.
- What do we do?
- Keep our heads.
Volkswagen can't swim.
It's just showing off.
It's still showing off.
Look, if we put a bullet right below the water line, it'll sink.
Put one below the water line.
- Jesus Christ, reverend, it's still alive.
- Give me that.
It won't do any good. We're dealing with something supernatural.
Hey. My Volkswagen.
They're drowning her.
Through there. It's faster.
Damn!
I didn't know there's a stair here.
Probably a goldfish spawning.
What are you gentlemen doing down there?
Simplistic, lieutenant.
Play it simplistic.
- What's that?
- Tell him we're not here.
Who's that with you, Amberjack?
Private first class
Alistair P. Benjamin, sir.
- What does the P stand for?
- Pearsall, sir.
Have you been drinking?
We stopped at the Red Queen to look for infiltrators.
I want you to go home, sleep it off.
Will you see that Benjamin...
...gets to bed, Amberjack?
- Yes, sir.
Will you see the lieutenant home...
...Private Alistair P. Benjamin?
- Yes, sir.
- Sir, I have a report to make.
- Keep it simplistic.
Yes?
There are three Puerto Ricans at the Queen's.
- New girls?
- No, sir. All soldiers.
That's a very succinct report,
Lieutenant Amberjack.
- Good night.
- I haven't finished my report yet, sir.
Very well, lieutenant, finish your report.
The Germans have broken through in the Ardennes.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.
The castle is strong.
It has never failed.
No.
No, and you've never failed the castle, not in 1000 years.
- But the end of a castle must come.
- Civilization?
Falconer will try to stop the army of the Nazis right here...
...if it costs a castle.
What's one castle?
Major Falconer is mad.
He looks like a buffalo, doesn't he?
Well, they've been close to extinct for a long time.
He could be extinct.
He fights that way, out of a kind of desperate doom.
And I wonder who is mad.
Major Falconer has the war on his side.
And we have history.
We have the truth, captain.
The beauty.
How many guns does truth have?
How many troops, mortars, grenades, antitank weapons?
When does beauty fight?
And who the hell wants history on his side?
We could sit here sipping wine through the whole war and win it with words.
If the situation called for bravery,
I would be brave.
I am the bravest man I ever knew.
And yet...
...l've never committed what you would call a brave act.
And what wars have you won?
Therese is pregnant.
We are going to have a child.
My home is a ranch on the slopes of the Jemez Mountains.
Where you can see everything.
Almost 100 miles.
It's a country of red and white mesas, sharp arroyos...
...and mountain meadows that roll all the way home.
It's a country of mud houses and hogans and tents of the Apaches.
And a sky that goes straight up blue for a million miles.
It's a country where you see and feel so far...
...you think you've seen and felt everything.
Then they start a war and you come to another planet to end it.
And you see all these castles.
- What's that?
- What?
A plane?
Listen.
Don't do it.
Don't do it?
Don't defend the castle.
You mean you want to save it too.
I want to save you.
You wanna save me and you wanna save the castle.
I want to save you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Beckman.
- Yes, sir?
Go up on the roof. Man the.50 calibre machine gun, shoot that bastard down.
- Anything more, sir?
- Yes, I'll be up when I'm dressed.
- Beckman.
- Yes, sir.
Do I have to take you by the hand?
- No, but I was thinking...
- Don't think.
Yes, sir.

The word "surrender" is not in the dictionary of the Imperial Army!
We must fight, down to the last man!
Therefore, you bastards...
Therefore, you bastards...
But sir...
...there's been no orders, no command to mobilize from Shibuya headquarters.
Don't get wishy-washy on me!
You guys heard the news. There's going to be an important broadcast at noon tomorrow!
We don't have a moment to lose!
Immediately, let us unite in action!
The countersigning by all the ministers is complete.
Then, Mr. Sato, we can begin.
We're going to transmit the telegrams now. To all the Allied nations.
All right?
Bye now.
Do we...
Do we...
Send them.
Send them.
Understood.
Send them.
It's all over now...
It's been a long day...
Can't think of a longer one.
The Cabinet ministers, having met constantly since the 9th...
...were as one overcome by a deep physical and mental fatigue.
Most of them fell into a state of near despondency.
All kinds of tangled thoughts came and went in their torpor.
Some struggled to comprehend the meaning of the nation's first defeat in its long history...
Some could not stop thinking of the con- sequences of not ending the war...
Atomic bombs destroying city after city, one after another...
One million Allied troops flooding onto
Kyushu's Satsuma Peninsula...
...and Kanto's Kujukuri-hama Bay.
The Soviet Union in Hokkaido... no, the Soviet Union marching south...
...into the Korean Peninsulas, into northern
Kyushu, even as far as Chugoku.
Japan getting divided into parts... men, women, even children and the elderly...
...all falling and dying amidst horrid plumes of gunpowder smoke...
...the isles of Japan becoming isles of death, mountains built of 80-million corpses...
But physical exhaustion overwhelmed these vague thoughts.
As these thoughts faded, they were replaced by one last one:
"I'm tired. It was a long day.
It was a truly long day...
"...but this long day is finally over."
In this thought they were united, and they were all wrong.
The long day was far from over; only half of it had elapsed.
The Commander of the
Guard is with a guest?
What guest?
Lt. Colonel Shiraishi, from from the 2nd General Army Staff Office.
Colonel Shiraishi... isn't Colonel Shiraishi the Guard Commander's...
...brother-in-law. Yes.
...brother-in-law. Yes.
We don't have time for this!
Ida! While you're here, I'll go to the
Shibui Barracks in Surugadai.
The barracks in
Surugadai?
Yes! I'm going to appeal to Lt. Colonel Takeshita of the Military Affairs Section.
...and ask him to have the Minister of War take decisive action!
I am much obliged to you for many things.
No...
I'm just very glad that things resolved uneventfully.
Excuse me.
All during these meetings about ending the war...
...I have spoken as a representative of the Armed Forces...
...and have been quite obstinate in expressing my opinions.
I now want to humbly express my apologies.
My honest intent was a simple one, namely, to protect the nation. I had no other agenda.
Please understand, and forgive me.
I understand very well.
I want to thank you with all my heart for your frank opinions.
Whatever was said, it came from your passionate concern for the nation.
But, General
Anami...
The nation of Japan is at peace.
I do not feel much anxiety about its future.
I, too, believe the same.
This was sent to me from the Southern front.
I do not smoke, so I brought them, hoping that they might give you pleasure.
Anami, my friend, you have an eloquent way of saying farewell.
How loud should my voice be?
Your normal tone of voice would be fine.
We, after greatly considering the general state of the
World, and the specific conditions of our Empire...
...have decided that the settlement of the situation requires an extraordinary measure...
...which we now announce to our good and loyal subjects.
Holding our senior cadets
in high esteem...
Every time we hear of their distinguished
deeds, it gives us a thrill.
Firmly work up, work up
the spirit of attack.
No enemy is a match
for the Yamato spirit.
However, the conflict has now lasted for nearly four years.
The officers of the Army and Navy have lead a valiant war effort.
They have been diligently supported by our Servants in the Government.
They have been devotedly served by Our hundred million Subjects.
Despite the fact that each has done his very, very best...
...the war situation has developed in a manner not to the Nation's advantage.
I wish I could send my
mother a picture...
... of the splendidly sinking
enemy-ship.
And furthermore, should we continue to fight...
...not only would our Nation be destroyed and our Subjects obliterated...
...but eventually, all of human civilization would vanish from the Earth.
This being the case, how can we preserve the multitudes of our people...
The final Attack Squadron,
#12, is departing, sir!
Your Excellency.
The second infantry regiment of the Imperial Guard...
...is already in the palace compound, with military banners raised.
They are going to revolt at 2:00 and besiege the palace.
We are against the government defeatists who hope that we can arrange...
...for the Emperor to be retained as a mere figurehead.
Our Emperor a puppet?! Our people totally demoralized?!
Our homeland devastated?! Does this sit well with you?
To put it bluntly, they're letting His Majesty clean up the mess of the war they lost...
...while they themselves are trying to shirk responsibility.
That's what the current
Ministers are doing.
You can argue all you want, but now that the Emperor has made his decision...
...I cannot agree with any action that opposes the will of His Majesty.
But, Your Excellency!

It would be unfortunate if the lid came off... do you have an appropriate container?
I think something can be found...
We'd really appreciate it if you could find an appropriate container.
How about something like this?
Yes, that would do just fine. Thank you.
The broadcast will be at noon... Where should this be placed to keep it safe?

So Colonel Haga has agreed?
Yes. They're going to rise up at 2:00 a.m.
And besiege the palace.
In addition, four other commanders have also given proactive consent to our plan!
What about Guard
Commander Mori?
No, the Guard Commander alone has not agreed.
Ida and Shiizaki are even now trying to convince him...
...and that's just a matter of time.
Col. Takeshita, we want to ask of you to persuade Minister of War Anami.
No one else can do that but you.
But even if I explained everything to him, at this stage the Minister probably won't...
No, it will work!
As long as you're the one who goes to him, Col. Takeshita. Please!
There's no time, I have to get back to the Imperial Guards.
We've come this far, we'll do it by brute force alone if we have to.
Col. Takeshita.
We're not asking for you to agree right this minute.
But if everything goes according to plan, then please, join us!
Hatanaka. I'll go and see the
Minister immediately.
Yes?
I don't know if I'll ask him to take action.
But I'm a little concerned about him.
The broadcasting station is going to take it?
Yes, since the broadcast will be made from the station...
...I think that it is the obvious choice.
But...
...there is much cause for concern...
...in taking this record with us in the middle of the night. Besides...
...we heard that there is unrest among elements of the Army.
If that's the case, it might be best to keep it here, in the Imperial Household.
But there is no appropriate place here in which to keep it safe.
Maybe the Chamberlain and his men should care for it, as they attend upon His Majesty.
Chamberlain Tokugawa

I see. In that case, I see no problem with taking custody of it.
I see. In that case, I see no problem with taking custody of it.
Your Excellency...
I have said everything that I wanted to say.
No...
...one last thing.
If there is to be no decisive battle on home soil... if the war ends so ignominiously...
...wouldn't that be a craven betrayal of the heroic spirits...
...of the three-million and more who have given their lives at the front lines?
Even now as we speak, kamikaze pilots are headed out...
...launching an attack against an enemy fleet.
Instead of fighting to the last soldier...
...if we lay down our arms by command of the Emperor...
It sounds dutiful, but it's just a shirking of responsibility!
What will the people think of the military then?
Will they not consider us to be self- serving, double-dealing cowards?
Your Excellency.
I will say no more.
Now is the time for all military men to stake their lives...
...and the Imperial Guard ought to be in the vanguard.
Please...
...if I may have Your Excellency's resolution.
I now have a sufficient understanding of what you're all aiming at.
Frankly speaking,
I'm impressed.
I will now go to the
Meiji Jingu Shrine.
Yes?
As just a simple
Japanese man...
...I'm going to bow down in front of the Meiji Jingu shrine...
...and decide on the path I am to take.
While I'm at it, I will also hear what
Chief of Staff Mizutani has to say.
Yes sir! Goodbye!
We have with us Captain Kuroda of the pilot school.
How did it go?
I think he will take action. He's going to talk to Chief of Staff Mizutani.
Then he will...
I'll give you the details later. Shiizaki's here, too, go wait in there with them.
Very good, Sir!
Army Lt. Colonel Hatanaka entering!
Mr. Shiizaki...
What is happening?
His Excellency will be going to Meiji Jingu.
You're not going to Meiji Jingu, you're going to the palace!
What?
Who the hell are you?
Captain Kuroda of the pilot school.
I have come upon hearing the news of the Imperial Guard's uprising.
What uprising?
Your Excellency! With respect to rising up, what is your intent?
I have none!
Lt. Colonel Hatanaka, this is our last chance.
We can't just linger, we're running out of time.
Your Excellency! We implore you!
Reconsider! Please reconsider!
Importunate puppy!
Your Excellency!
Insolence!
Your Excellency!
You bastards...
Hatanaka! What have you done?!
I couldn't convince the Commander... no... there was no time...
...I had no time... so
I had to do it...
Ida! Together, quickly...
Imperial Guard Chief of Staff Mizutani
Ida! Together, quickly...

What do they mean by "uprising?"

Mori has been... killed!
What?!

As we have said, the aim of the uprising of the Imperial Guard...

It's very hot in here; may we take off our jackets?
No, and that's an order!
I'm going to the palace right away to suppress this rebellion!
Sir, please wait until we find out more... until we know what we're up against.
We don't know what the situation is.
All we know is that a group of armed
Imperial Guards have revolted.
We must first investigate the situation.
Can you contact the palace?
Sir, we're doing everything we can...
...but it seems they've cut the phone lines.
So the recording was done late tonight inside the palace?
Yes.
Where is the recording?
We have given it to the Imperial
Household Agency.
The Imperial Household
Agency?
To whom at the Imperial
Household Agency?
I don't know his name.
He is a Chamberlain.
A Chamberlain, you say?
We're done. Take them away.
Yes, sir!
The record is within our reach.
All that's left now is...
The uprising of the Eastern District Army, and having the Minister of War take action.
Has the Minister of
War arrived yet?
Lt. Colonel Takeshita has gone to fetch him.
He will be here shortly.
This is Captain Kuroda of the pilot school.
I have come to deliver a message to Lt. Colonel Takeshita.
What?!
They've killed Commander
Mori?
Hatanaka.
It's no good.
The Eastern District Army is frozen in place.
There's no indication they'll rise.
Give up and withdraw the troops.
If we continue the siege, it'll become a national calamity.
Then we'll have to battle the
Eastern District Army.
I have no fear of battle! We have control of both the palace and the Emperor!
We also have many prisoners, such as broadcast president Shimomura!
Don't be stupid!
How long will the Imperial Guards stand with us, now that you've killed their commander?!
Without their solidarity, how can we stand in battle?
When they find out about the Commander's death, their morale will plummet!
Don't you understand?
Withdraw the troops before dawn.
As for what happened tonight...
...we'll take the blame for it ourselves.
Hatanaka.
Just let it be.
What happened here tonight...
...the people of the world will probably laugh at us bitterly, and think of it as...
...a fleeting, final struggle by the Japanese Army.
A midsummer night's dream.
Now, I'm going to go and report the situation to the Minister of War.
Okay, Hatanaka?
You must withdraw the troops before dawn.
A bump in the road; looks like this might take longer than we thought.
The Eastern District Army is going to fight us? Don't make me laugh.
We have the Emperor; do you think they'll attack us with tanks and planes?

...because they didn't have the
Emperor in their custody.
But...
...our situation is the exact opposite. Those who attack us will be the rebels.
Besides, our orders remain in force.
If we can hold out long enough...
...the entire Army will eventually hear about it, and they will certainly side with us.
The final victory will be ours, no matter what happens.
And if anyone gets in our way...
That's right... That record... If that ever got broadcast, all would be lost.
We must find that record as soon as possible; every second, every minute counts!

Then...
...could you identify him if you saw his face?

That's why Minister Anami and the Commander of the Eastern District Army haven't arrived.
And maybe, it was you who murdered our Commander!

Quickly withdraw the troops and return to your original posts.
When that is done, immediately report back to me!
Yes? What?! Yes!
It's from the Eastern
District Army.
Yes, Major Hatanaka speaking!

Private Residence

Our target is Prime Minister Suzuki Kantaro!
Nobody else is to be harmed!
What? Not here? The Prime
Minister isn't here?!
Y... yes. We got a call from the official residence about you, so everyone left.
Where did they go?!
I... I wasn't told.
Burn it! The house of a national traitor is defiled! Burn it to the ground!
Yes, sir!
Fire!
But I'm begging you!
No, we won't authorize a broadcast.
I won't say anything about not accepting the Declaration!
Please, please, let me speak for the young officers who took a stand this night!
Just let me speak for five minutes, no, just three minutes only!
Hatanaka, that's enough.
You're obsessed.
"Obsessed?"
Right, we're done here!
Next, we go after the traitor who favors the U.S. And Great Britain...
...Privy Council President
Hiranuma Ki-ichiro!
Minister! Let me be your second!
Unnecessary.
Stand back!
Minister!
Minister!
Your Excellency!
Water... let me have a glass of water!
We humbly and respectfully announce that an Imperial Decree will soon be broadcast.
We have the honor to announce that His Majesty, the Emperor...
...has chosen to address the nation at noon today...
...and we are sincerely grateful for the honor of broadcasting his words.
Let each and every citizen of the nation attend to the voice of the Emperor.
Good morning!
Chamberlain Okabe
Good morning!
Chamberlain Okabe
Did I miss something?
To protect the nation, we soldiers who have risen up today, on August 15th...
...are making an announcement to all the soldiers and people of the nation.
We will protect the Emperor from the plots of the enemy...
...and keep the nation safe.
We don't care if we win or lose; we don't do this for ourselves!
We only wish to live in the righteous state of genuine loyalty!

Provisional residence of General Takao, younger brother of the Prime Minister
Ah...
I'm so glad... so glad that you're safe.
Mr. Sakomizu, does today's Privy Council meeting at the palace start at 11:00?
Yes.
After that meeting, I want to hold a Cabinet meeting...
...and call for the mass resignation of all Cabinet members.
It's time for us elders to step down.
From now on, Japan must be lead by much younger people.
All officers of the military and people of all stations!
We ask you to take to heart the original intent of our uprising...
...which was to expose the treachery of the ministers, to destroy conspiracies...
...and to protect the nation, defending it to the last man!
To protect the nation, we soldiers who have risen up today, on August 15th...
...are making an announcement to all the soldiers and people of the nation.
Hello, Mr. Togo? At 11:00 today there will be a Privy Council meeting at the palace.
Inasmuch as the end of the war has been officially decided...
Yes, I heard about it yesterday.
Yes, but afterward, the Cabinet will meet in order that they might resign.
That's correct, a mass resignation.
Thank you.
The broadcast bureau? Yes, we can deploy troops right away.
Huh? What?! The record got there?!
Both the original and copy, you're sure?
I'm going to the Parliamentary
Affairs Room.
Mr. Shimomura, I know you'll be able to coordinate the resignations.
I must go to the Palace to prepare for the Privy Council meeting at 11:00.
The Secretary General is very busy.
These last 24 hours, even two or three of him would not have been enough.
But why would they have a Privy Council meeting to decide to end the war again?
After all, the fact of the matter is that the decision has already been made.
No, not necessarily.
Yes?
It requires all kinds of formalities. It may be more accurate to call them "ceremonies."
After all, it's the funeral of the Japanese empire.
We don't care if we win or lose; we don't do this for ourselves!
We only wish to live in the righteous state of genuine loyalty!
All officers of the military and people of all stations!
We ask you to take to heart the original intent of our uprising...
...which was to expose the treachery of the ministers, to destroy conspiracies...
...and to protect the nation, defending it to the last man!
With respect to the conclusion of the war...
...starting today at noon...
...His Majesty's voice will be...
...broadcast to all the people over the radio.
Broadcast Bureau: Studio 8
Broadcast Bureau staff: Wada Nobukata
What a horrible time for my malaria to flare up...
...at a time of emergency...
...but...
...Atsugi Air Base will resist... resist to the very end!
Atsugi Air Base... to the very end! To the very end!
Everyone is assembled to listen to the Emperor's broadcast.
Since our kamikaze attack was unsuccessful...
...and the city of Kumagaya has been destroyed by B-29 firebombing...
...there are many who think that that's what the broadcast will be about.
That the Emperor is going to admonish and encourage us...
...to keep on fighting.
Broadcast Bureau: Outside Studio 8
His Excellency, the Commander of the Eastern District Army...
...will be entering to witness the broadcast.
His Majesty's broadcast will finally be made...
Be sure to maintain your vigilance.
I can't let them broadcast the end of the war!
I'll kill them all!
I'll kill them all!
Stop!
Stop!
Let me go! Let me go!
Stop!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
Stop!
How could they end the war?! Who cares about a broadcast?!
How could they end the war?!
If he acts up again, just cut him down!
No! Let me go!
Let me go!
How could they end the war?!
How could they end the war?!
There will now be an important broadcast.
We ask for everyone listening to please stand.
His Majesty, the Emperor, will now address the nation...
...and pronounce his great Rescript.
And now, with deep respect, we convey to you the Emperor's voice.
We, reflecting profoundly on
the state of the world...
... and the prevailing condition
of Our Empire...
... have decided that extraordinary measures
are required to effect a settlement...
... and hereby announce
to our loyal citizens...
... that we have ordered our Government
to communicate to the Governments...
... of the United States, Great Britain,
China, and the Soviet Union...
... that our Empire accepts the provisions
of their joint Declaration.
It was a long, long
24 hours.
But finally, Japan's longest day was over.
August 15th, 1945.
The day that the Pacific
War ended.
Japanese who fought as soldiers in the Pacific War:

In the dark days at the dawn of the 16th century, the conquering hordes of the Turkish Sultan spread terror throughout the civilized world.
The Ottoman Empire swept east across Asia Minor, south across the Mediterranean, north across the Crimea.
Triumphant, the Turkish Sultan turned west to the Ukraine.
Turkish spearheads threatened the frontiers of Poland.
The fate of Europe hung in the balance on the vast fertile plains known as the Steppes.
Your Highness, the Turks have broken our lines.
Call out the reserves.
We have yet to hear from our allies.
The Cossacks.
The whole army's probably lying drunk in the mud.
-The Cossacks will be here.
-We can't wait, Sire.
Zaporozhtzi.
Cutthroats, animals.
Devils with scalp locks.
But there are no such fighters in the world.
Prince Grigory will toast victory at the Royal Pavilion with the Cossack Colonel.
Tell your Prince, the hetman of the Zaporozhtzi only drinks with kings.
My Colonel, have a drink for me with Prince Grigory.
And you will represent me at the Royal Pavilion,
Taras Bulba.
Follow me.
Never set foot under a Polish roof.
Not even a tent.
Colonel Manfred, we will speak here.
It will spare us both embarrassment.
I give you a toast to our common triumph over the infidels.
I'll drink to that.
Gold.
Too bad we're fighting on the same side, huh?
You fight well, Cossack.
How are you known?
Armed guards behind my back.
Your name?
Taras Bulba.
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks.
Well, Taras Bulba,
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks,
His Majesty is pleased by the results of our alliance.
So pleased he has decided to do you the honor of integrating all Cossack troops into the Polish-Imperial Army.
Do you see this scalp lock?
That means you're speaking to the Zaporozhtzi.
Do you know what Zaporozhtzi means?
The Cossack Brotherhood.
Free men.
We fought with you to rid this land of the Turks because this is our land.
Now take your Polish honor back to Poland and leave us alone.
Leave us alone, Pole.
Colonel Manfred, the Cossack is right.
Honor has nothing to do with this.
We need the Ukraine as a buffer against the East and we need your grain.
We are here and we intend to stay.
That is why His Imperial Majesty is dispersing the Cossack troops before you can turn your horses against us.
That is why we held back our reserves till you had won the battle for us.
Zaporozhtzi !
Holy Father, blessed archangel, what have we done?
What is your will?
I've led you to dishonor, defeat and death.
No.
Devil take you, Mykola.
You are our hetman.
You did not lead us to defeat.
We trusted the Poles.
That was our mistake.
Before the moon changes,
I'm going to have a son.
He may already be born.
And I will kiss the Devil before my son wears the Polish collar.
So, start again, burn our farms, take to the forests, live in the hills.
Kubenko in the south.
Tymoshevsky in the east.
The scalp lock is forbidden.
There's my pledge.
It may take years, it may take a whole generation, but the Cossack Brotherhood will rise again, with fire and sword and repay the Pole measure for measure.
And take the Steppes back for our own.
And may God help us.
Zaporozhtzi, pray to your archangel.
With the burning of their farms, the Cossacks scattered across their beloved Steppes.
There, in the ancient hills,
Taras Bulba's vision was to take root and grow like the sons he bore, steeled from birth for the day when the Cossack Brotherhood would drive the Polish conquerors from their homeland and take back the Steppes for their own.
There, Andrei, there's your lesson.
Armor plate can stop a saber.
If you want to kill a man in armor, what you need is this.
Why don't Cossacks wear armor?
This is our armor, boy.
Faith.
And a good saber arm.
Ostap, watch your brother.
He rides like a Cossack, fights like a Cossack.
And soon, we'll teach him to drink like a Cossack.
Taras Zaporozhtzi !
When you see a Cossack with him is a Cossack
We the brotherhood we are one
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
We the brotherhood we are one
Hey!
Turn to your left then turn to your right
And faces shine brighter than the sun
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Faces shine brighter than the sun
Hey!
When you say Cossack you're saying brother
Cossack and brother mean the same
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Cossack and brother mean the same!
Hey!
We are the Cossacks
We are the Cossacks
Men that no one on earth can tame
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Men that no one on earth can tame
Taras?
In the holy name, are you mad?
-A Cossack scalp lock?
-Don't chatter, magpie.
You make the barber nervous.
You'll be hanged on sight.
The more you talk, the more you show your ignorance.
The scalp lock is the latest fashion imported from the court at Warsaw,
His Polish Majesty has forgiven us our sins.
Royal pardon to all Cossacks.
Watch what you're doing.
Shave me when you're through with papa.
I want a scalp lock.
How's that?
A scalp lock!
You'll wear a scalp lock when you've earned it, boy.
In battle.
You don't need a scalp lock to study Latin.
Latin?
The Poles have opened the Kiev Academy to all Cossacks, and the sons of Taras Bulba will be the first ones there.
Right, Father Mikhail?
The devil we are!
The King is spitting in our eye.
He's saying the Cossacks aren't worth worrying about anymore.
What the devil are you doing up there?
I am repairing the weathercock so that you can tell which way the wind blows.
Papa, what can we learn from the Poles?
Father Mikhail has taught us everything that a Cossack should know.
-A Cossack?
-Yes.
What do you know?
Pots and pans.
Petticoats and apron strings.
That's what you know.
A Cossack should be fighting Poles, that's what I know.
Send me to Kiev with a saber,
I'll teach them what I know.
But I won't go to learn to be a Pole.
You think you are ready to fight me, boy?
Anytime you say, Papa.
All right, Papa.
Come on.
So we go, the sons of Taras Bulba, to learn to be Poles.
I don't know why we go, Papa, but I follow your orders until the day comes that I can throw you in the well.
And that day will come.
So. . .
You don't know why you're going.
So you say you want to fight the Poles.
When you come home, when you've learned everything the Poles know and all there is to know about the Poles, then you'll be ready to fight them, and not before.
And that day will come.
That day will come.
Pigs, lepers and Cossacks around the back.
Follow me.
Andrei Bulba.
Ostap Bulba.
We have opened our schools to you in the hope that we may yet raise a generation of civilized Cossacks, worthy to be counted among the subjects of the Polish crown.
Let it be clear from the start, we will not tolerate the barbaric behavior to which you are accustomed.
You will remove your tunics and prostrate yourselves.
Brother Bartholomew.
I thought we came here to study.
Papa said we should learn everything there is to know about the Poles.
But she's the governor's daughter.
She'd spit on a Cossack.
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, thou lovest, he loves.
Rise ye shepherds on this winter's night
In the skies one wondrous star shines bright
Angel voices bid ye rise
Oh come ye all where Jesus lies
Oh come and greet your Lord!
Come, ye shepherds
Ye have traveled far
Ye have been guided
By his holy star
Gently, gently dawn is creeping
In the manger he is sleeping
Come and greet your Lord
Rise, ye shepherds on this winter's night
In the skies one wondrous star shines bright
Angel voices bid ye rise
Oh come ye all where Jesus lies
Oh come and greet your Lord
Oh, Natalia, your brother and I would like to share a toast with you.
Whoa, there!
Do you think it's funny to run people down?
I'm sorry.
You look so funny when you get angry.
It's hard to look angry with mud on your face.
That's the Academy bell.
You will be late.
They will whip you.
-I'll return this.
-Oh, it doesn't matter.
Tomorrow.
No.
Please.
I won't be here tomorrow.
But I can easily get another one, at the Thieves' Market.
Joseph.
Andrei. . .
Andrei, come on.
Come on, Andrei, the gates are closed.
-The Thieves' Market.
-What did you say?
The gates are closed.
Veni.
Vidi.
Vici.
I came.
I saw.
I conquered.
Make yourselves presentable.
Then report to the Abbot.
Ostap Bulba, you're dismissed.
Go to your studies.
I'm sure that'll be more painful for you than any flogging.
Do you know why I have decided to punish you and not your brother?
It's the Machiavellian theory of statesmanship you taught us.
Divide your enemy and conquer.
Ostap was born a Cossack, he will die a Cossack.
But you distress me, Andrei.
You have a fine mind.
It distresses you to find a Cossack can think?
On the contrary, you gave me hope for the Cossack kind.
To raise yourself out of ignorance and barbarism.
There's a real challenge for a restless spirit.
Must you waste yourself hating all Poles?
Not all Poles.
It's not so much that I hate Poles, sir.
I love the Steppes.
But the Steppes are Poland.
The past is dead.
The wheel of history moves forward and no one can turn it back single-handed.
Not even you, Andrei Bulba.
Well, it's a challenge for a restless spirit.
Remove your cassock and prostrate yourself.
Brother Bartholomew.
Tomorrow?
Where?
After vespers. At the cathedral.
-Are you out of your mind?
-Yes.
And she loves me.
And as soon as we can get out of this monk's trap she's going to be my wife.
Do you know what Papa would do to her?
He'll throw her to the pigs for slop.
Andrei, she's a Pole.
Don't let her make a fool of you.
This Cossack dishonored my sister.
We cannot allow him to disgrace any more Polish families.
Gentlemen, I'll need your assistance.
I'm not going to kill you, Cossack, but I'm going to make sure you never molest another Polish woman as long as you live.
Stand him up.
Stop the Cossacks!
-Brother Bartholomew!
-Brother Bartholomew!
Open the door!
Open the door!
They killed Captain Alex.
-The stables. We'll need horses.
-I'll find Natalia. Saddle three.
Thank you, Lieutenant, for coming here.
It was considerate of you.
Please wait.
My son is dead.
Your brother killed by your Cossack lover.
Tell your servant to pack your belongings.
I'll arrange for an escort to take you out of the city.
You cannot stay here after tonight.
You'll be taken to Dubno.
There you will serve as maid in waiting until you have been trained in the responsibilities of your birth.
Alert the patrol and apprehend my daughter as well.
Natalia!
Go back!
Go back, Andrei ! Go back!
Go back! Go back!
Go back!
Strangers.
Strangers.
Look at the way they ride.
Turn around, son. Turn around.
Don't move, son. Don't move.
Let's take a look at you.
What is this, a skirt?
My sons in skirts.
Let's see if you can run to the well without tripping over your dress.
Papa, the only reason
I'd run to the well is to throw you in.
How do you ride?
Sidesaddle?
Papa, please don't make fun of us.
And why not?
Because if you do, Papa, I'll hit you.
You want to fight?
Anytime you say, Papa.
-Fists?
-What else?
So you think you're tough enough to push the old cock off the roost.
Andrei, Taras.
Look at them.
Two years they haven't seen each other.
What do they do? Try to kill each other.
Well, you've learned to fight a little.
I'll say that for you.
What about you?
Andrei, you're hurt.
Come.
Sit.
So,
-who stuck you?
-A Pole.
Did you kill him?
My little brother did.
What did you fight about?
-A woman.
-A woman !
How do you like that?
Did you see the way he fought me?
With a sword hole in his shoulder.
If we drink we will die
And if we don't drink we will die
So we might as well say what the hell
And let our glasses clink!
Whatever your name you'll be dying just the same
So as long as we are going to die
It is better if we drink
Whatever your name is...
To Andrei and Ostap, sons of Taras.
What's the Latin for vodka?
-The Romans didn't drink vodka.
-That's why the Roman Empire fell.
Scholars.
Some men are lovers
They work under covers
And from lady's bed to lady's bed they leap
But I want to drink to the man nobody drinks to
The fellow who gets into bed and goes to sleep
If we drink we will die
And if we don't drink we will die
So we might as well say what the hell
And let our glasses clink
Go back.
Make room.
Andrei !
Ostap!
Take these horses with your father's blessing.
Kneel.
I am the oldest living Cossack, but I refuse to die sitting on an oven.
Now, you two start some fighting and give an old Cossack a chance to die the way he should.
Welcome to the Cossack Brotherhood.
God ride with you.
We're looking for Taras Bulba,
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks.
Filipenko! Korzh !
You sons of the devil.
-Shilo.
-Filipenko.
What more can a man want?
My sons and my friends.
My old partners and my future partners in battle.
So these are your young pups, eh?
Not bad, not bad.
Taras, you've done a good job, eh?
Nice pair, but too small for me.
I'd have to carry this horse on my back.
-I'd like to see that.
-With you on his back.
Let's go.
-Come on.
-Come on, Korzh.
Come on.
Who else can carry a horse on their back all the night?
Who else but an idiot would want to?
The time is at hand when Cossacks will have something better to do than carry horses around the house.
Lift your scalp locks out of the soup, Cossacks.
Pull your sabers out of the bread.
The hetman has raised the golden standard of the archangel.
The Zaporozhtzi are called to arms.
We are marching to war!
Women, more glasses. More vodka.
May God ride with the Zaporozhtzi !
Hey! When do we march?
Every hairy-tongued Cossack with powder in his flask will assemble at Chigirin on the road to Dubno by the first day of Holy Easter Week.
You can whet your blade,
Stepan Kanevsky, and prepare to die like a Cossack should.
Who. . . Who. . . Who are we fighting?
Or doesn't it matter?
Not a devil of a lot.
Who is there to fight except the Poles?
Right. The Poles.
Not this time.
The King of Poland wants an army of 10,000 Cossacks under the Cossack standard, led by Cossack officers, at full pay and booty, to march to the Baltic wars.
And after the war?
We bury our dead, clean our sabers, count our booty, and get drunk.
What the devil is he talking about?
You don't argue with an old pirate like Filipenko.
This we will settle with our hetman, Mykola.
Why must you always be so particular about whose booty you take?
Because the Cossacks fought for the Poles once before, or have you forgotten?
And do you remember, puppy?
You weren't even littered yet.
I'd rather be pulling the Turk's nose if I had my choice.
The plunder is richer and I like the smell of harem girls.
But they say these Baltic princes have slop pots of gold, too, and their women have hips like Percherons.
And what's going to be left of the Steppes when we get back?
Questions! Questions!
Is that what the Poles taught you?
I'll tell you what the Poles taught me.
That a Cossack is an ignorant barbarian good enough to kiss a Pole's foot or fight a Pole's war, but not good enough to walk Polish streets.
Or raise his eyes to a Polish woman.
Or rule his own land.
A Cossack does not question the word of a hetman.
Will you fight or not?
That is the only question.
Not for the Poles.
Devil's blood, Taras, it looks like you've raised a coward for a son.
No man on earth can say a Cossack is a coward.
That can only be proven by the will of God.
Tell him you didn't mean it.
It's only a word. You can't die over a word.
Taras, stop them.
There are words men must die for.
We will ride to the gorge at dawn.
The starting mark will be of your choice.
Take your positions.
Let the will of God be done.
-His shoulder, Papa.
-Return to your place, Cossack.
Your arm, boy.
Let the will of God be done.
Burn this in your memory.
The man who died was a great Cossack, and never forget it.
Was I wrong?
The hetman has called us to the standard.
Now, tomorrow you raise your companies and meet on the march to Chigirin.
Tonight, ride to the village and drink Korzh's soul to hell.
Flaming flatbread, Cossacks.
-Was I wrong?
-You were both wrong.
And you were both right.
Now, we ride to join Mykola on the road to Dubno and I swear it will all be settled.
Come on, Andrei.
Tonight, we sleep under the stars.
We'll be making our bed on the ground for a long while to come.
Women, take them and forget them.
A Cossack can't let a woman worry him.
Right, brother Andrei?
Right, brother Ostap.
Till you find your woman.
Then you take her.
You never forget her.
You try.
You fight, you get drunk.
You tell yourself you're a Cossack.
You tell yourself that Papa's right.
But you never forget her.
You never forget her.
All right, let's not waste time, bless your sons.
Bless you, my sons.
May God's Mother keep you.
Send some little word if you can.
May they always fight bravely, and if not, perish. So, we go.
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Welcome, Taras.
-Greetings, Mykola.
-So, we ride together again, to meet Prince Grigory at Dubno.
When I ride to Dubno,
I'm riding to fight the Poles, and anyone who stands with them.
Would you ride against the Zaporozhtzi,
Taras Bulba?
Let the Zaporozhtzi speak for themselves.
Colonels, form your regiments.
You heard the voice of the Zaporozhtzi,
Taras Bulba.
Ride and you ride to your death.
Let him hear your voice.
You swore to wear a patch over one eye until the Steppes were free.
Cover both eyes, Tymoshevsky, so you cannot see yourself.
Can we fight the whole Polish Empire?
-Answer him with your guns.
-Filipenko?
I'll have to shoot you, Taras.
We are sworn by our holy faith,
Taras Bulba.
Would you destroy that?
There's only one way to keep faith with a Pole.
Put your faith in your sword, and the sword in the Pole.
Look to the heavens, Cossacks.
The sun stands at the equinox.
The Holy Easter dawns.
Let the day of the Resurrection of our Lord be the day of the Resurrection of our land.
The Poles have put a sword in our hands.
Turn it on them.
Surrender the standard, Mykola.
Long life to the Zaporozhtzi !
Death to the Poles!
Cossacks.
I signed this covenant, by the holy faith, in the name of our brotherhood.
While I live, you are bound by that oath.
When you march, you have to march forward over the flesh and bones of Ivan Mykola.
Stand aside, Mykola.
Long live Poland !
I count only three regiments.
Three regiments.
To start.
You taught us, Pole.
Back, Zaporozhtzi, back from the wall !
Back, sulfur and oil.
So, you won't fight?
Then starve.
When you're eating cockroaches, then you will come out.
And we will be here.
Do you hear me, Poles?
We will be waiting.
Are we going to fight or weasel in the bushes, sucking eggs?
Why the devil fall back?
Let's go after them and storm the walls.
No.
Here we are. And here we stay, until Dubno is a Cossack city.
He's strong.
He will live, God willing.
First battle. You fought well.
With your eyes open.
He fought well, too.
Too well.
So. . .
How is your strength?
I think you should find out for yourself, Papa.
You're sure you're ready, Cossack?
Your stomach looks a little soft.
Soft?
Not as soft as I thought.
You're right, Papa, too soft.
Not ready.
Big horse.
A lake, a lake is as good as a well, Papa.
So. . .
Listen.
The death bell.
Do you hear that?
The death bell.
There's plague in the city.
They're burning their dead.
Hold your fire.
Wait till they're closer.
Fire.
A Cossack.
There's a Cossack in the city!
There's a Cossack in the city.
Raise the alarm !
Alert the watch !
A Cossack in the city.
Call out the guards.
There's a Cossack in the city.
A Cossack in the city!
-Natalia.
-Andrei.
-We'll get out of this city.
-Yes.
Stop.
The plague.
This part of the city has been condemned.
Let me go there. Please.
They will open the east gate to bury the dead outside of the city.
No.
No.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
-The Cossack!
-Take him.
-A Polish woman !
-The Lady Natalia.
Take them alive!
She had nothing to do with it. Let her go.
-She helped you.
-Let her alone.
Why did you come here?
To conquer Dubno single-handed?
-Let her alone!
-Or to spy?
Let her alone!
Don't tell me the son of Taras Bulba came into the city to rescue a Polish woman.
Let her alone.
Let her alone.
Aliosha!
You can't have that, you'll jangle like an Arab dancing girl.
What are you doing?
We're wrapping the horses' hooves, padding the wheels with sheepskin, and we're tying the axles of the wagons so the Poles won't hear us when we leave.
Why?
Listen to that iron bell, Taras.
Look at the smoke.
You can smell the stench of the Black Death even here.
Look at the sky, hetman.
The dawn is rising over Mecca this very moment.
The Sultan is getting ready to sail.
Dawn is rising over the Steppes, too.
How many good men have died to keep the Steppes free, and the Cossack Brotherhood alive?
But there is also another kind of brotherhood.
The brotherhood of wild beasts, who will desert their own kind.
I will shovel manure, Taras, but I will not eat it.
We followed you here to fight the Poles, not to wait like carrion crows over a rotting carcass.
I'm leaving by nightfall tonight with any Cossack who will follow me.
Will you turn traitor, Filipenko?
Will you give the order to shoot me down, Taras?
-I will shoot you myself.
-Now you listen to me.
You talk about wild animals, Taras, but if we fall killing each other right under the enemy's nose, that is like wild animals.
Is that what brotherhood means?
So. . .
The old man is right.
It is for each Cossack to search his soul and choose the way he will go.
So, they're going.
We stay.
Someday, in years to come, when the Steppes are free, minstrels will sing of this.
How a prince of the Poles surrendered to a meager three regiments of Cossacks.
May God help us.
May God help us.
Where is he?
You heard him during the fever.
It's that Polish woman.
He must have gone into the city to find her.
-You're mad, boy.
-He loves her.
She's been in his blood since the first day at Kiev.
No, not Andrei.
In fever, men dream of women.
But a Cossack could not love a Pole, no.
Death to her!
Death to her!
Death to the Cossack harlot!
Expose her shame!
Let her be purged !
Let her be purged in the fire of our wrath !
-It is difficult to stop a hungry mob.
-I'll get food.
That is easily said, Cossack.
Give me a company of men.
I'll get you the oxen.
Why should I trust the lives of Poles to a Cossack?
Because you're desperate.
And I know a way through the stockade.
You ask me to accept your word?
The handclasp of a Cossack?
I extended my hand to a Cossack once.
It was a Cossack's saber, but very much like this.
Come here, Cossack.
Come here.
Reduce her to ashes!
Burn the witch !
Extend your arm, Cossack.
We take our hands too much for granted.
My first concern was for my sword arm, but I quickly learned to use a sword with my left hand.
Set the torch !
She's your hostage. I'll get food.
You ask me to believe that the son of Taras Bulba would betray the Cossack Brotherhood, his country, his father, for the sake of a woman?
Could father and son be so unlike?
Not so unlike.
Both would be willing to die for the thing they love.
Give me 60 men to divert the Cossacks.
I'll stampede the oxen.
Your reserves can drive them into the city.
The power of love is a constant source of amazement.
If the military could control it, we would conquer the world.
Hear me!
The Cossack will bring food to the city.
Release the woman.
No!
-Burn the traitor.
-Oh, Andrei.
Burn the witch !
I love you, Andrei. I will always love you.
You know that. I love you.
But I can't let you fight against your own people.
I can't do it. Please don't.
-I'm just getting food for the city.
-The Cossacks will fight.
You're a Cossack, Andrei.
I'm a man before I'm a Cossack.
-I'm a Pole.
-You're a woman.
Don't let them use me, please, don't let them use me.
You're the woman that I love.
Don't let them use me to turn you against your own kind.
Natalia, you are my kind.
You are my country.
You are my love.
Cossack!
His Royal Highness is waiting for you.
No, Andrei, no. Don't do it, please.
Don't do it. No, please, it's not too late.
Please, Andrei.
Andrei, please.
Andrei.
There's sulfur and saltpeter in the air, so strong I could almost taste it.
They're filling their powder flasks.
They're coming out, Shilo, they're coming out.
-And we've less than half an army.
-They're coming out, pass the word.
They're coming out, pass the word.
They're going for the oxen.
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
Death to the Poles!
Zaporozhtzi !
Alert the cannoneer.
Prepare bombardment.
Fire!
Where's their strength?
Where's the Cossacks' strength?
They're hard-pressed to give battle to a handful of volunteers.
We won't send out our forces to round up the oxen.
We'll slaughter the Cossack Brotherhood once and for all.
Call out the reserves, we're going to attack.
Damn his soul to hell.
Traitor. After him.
After him. After him.
Get off your horse.
Take off that Polish helmet.
My son.
Why?
Why?
I did what I had to do.
From the day I plunged you in the river to give you life,
I loved you as I loved the Steppes.
You were my pride.
I gave you life.
It is on me to take it away from you.
The whole army is coming out!
-They're attacking in full force.
-Sound the retreat.
-Has your son made a coward of you?
-Sound the retreat!
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
Ride, Filipenko!
Filipenko!
Ride!
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
We will take him home.
-To be buried on Cossack soil.
-This is Cossack soil now.
Let Andrei be buried here.
In peace.
Now Dubno is a Cossack city.
We will not ravage or plunder.
There will be no more killing.
We will take this city in peace, burn out the plague, open the supply wagons.
We will feed all the people of our city.
THE WAR IS OVER
You made it.
Once again you see the hill of Biriatou.
Once again you have that stale, anxious taste of crossing the border.
You drove all night.
Your mouth is dry from too little sleep and too much tobacco.
Once again you cross this border in the shimmering early-morning light.
The sun rises behind you over the Elizondo peaks.
Once again, you'll make it over.
It's all right.
You'll make your train.
All night I was afraid we might break down.
But there was no reason.
I had the car checked.
An obsession.
You know how it is.
At night, the stretch between Burgos and Miranda... miles of desert around us--
No offense, but service stations in your country leave a lot to be desired.
I didn't dare push the car too hard.
I was afraid.
If it weren't for you,
I would have played tourist today.
A good meal in a seafood restaurant.
Crabe in a hot sauce with a nice white wine.
Or roast pig at Bottine's, behind the Plaza Mayor.
And in the afternoon, a bullfight, of course.
I generally don't get the time to see the towns I go to.
Believe it or not, I haven't even set foot yet in the Prado in Madrid!
I can tell you now... last night when you said we had to rush back, I was furious.
That wasn't hard to see.
We usually spend the night talking, but last night you acted like I didn't exist.
I'd arranged to be away three days.
My wife was going to run the bookshop alone.
Today the Prado.
Tomorrow Toledo and Aranjuez.
A three-day vacation, in other words.
So last night when you read the letter I brought you... and then said we had to set out immediately, I was fuming!
So I ruined your trip, eh?
Take it up with the Spanish police.
- There's a crowd already.
- Easter. They spend the day in Spain.
Easier for you.
They have less time to check passports.
- How did you manage it before?
- Before?
When the border was closed.
When there were no tourists.
We crossed over through the mountains.
Sometimes we ran into the Guardia Civil.
- And then?
- Then we'd shoot our way through.
- You're no problem at all.
- Why?
No one hearing you talk would take you for a Spaniard.
Even I forget sometimes.
The last buddy I drove over didn't speak a word of French.
He pretended to be asleep.
If they had asked him a single question, our goose would have been cooked.
With you it's a cinch.
Please park your car and step inside the station.
- Why? Listen, I'm in a hurry.
- Police check. Pull the car up there.
Come on, let's go.
- What's all this about?
- I've no idea either.
You think it's a random check?
You sure your papers are okay, Carlos?
Remember what we said.
It'll be all right.
Leave the key in the car.
Follow me.
- What about our bags?
- Never mind. Leave them.
Have you got something against Citroens today?
Thank you.
So that's it.
I bought some books in his shop.
We struck up an acquaintance.
And so, Mr. Rene Sallanches, you were there on vacation?
Yes.
- Alone?
- Yes, alone.
And you live in Paris at Rue de l'Estrapade, number 4?
No, number 7.
And you met Mr.Jude in his bookshop in Hendaye?
That's right.
And Mrs.Jude--
What's her first name again?
Marie. She's charming.
Do you have a telephone in Paris?
Of course.
Medicis 33-74.
Call this number right away.
It's Sunday morning.
You'll wake up Nadine.
I told her nothing's wrong, but she's worried and wants to speak to you.
What's wrong?
Did you run over another old lady?
- Everything's fine.
- Why did he call?
- A simple formality.
- Busybody.
These things happen, you know.
Are you staying in tonight?
Yes, I'll wait for you.
Then I'll see you tonight at the house. Good-bye.
Good-bye, darling.
- They searched the car.
- Of course.
So what did you tell them?
I said you were in the area on vacation.
You bought books in my shop and we struck up an acquaintance.
I agreed to take a little trip down to Spain to pick you up.
He asked, "From Madrid?"
"Yes," I said. "What of it?"
"Three hundred miles each way?
That's a long trip to make in 24 hours.
That doesn't leave you much time for sightseeing."
That got my goat.
I said, "Driving relaxes me."
- Is the next train an express?
- Yes. The 9:55. First-class only.
9:55. I have time to see Antoine.
- Shouldn't I give him our message?
- I have time to do it myself.
I'd prefer we not be seen at Antoine's together.
Let's do this: I'll drop you at my house, and let Antoine know you're here.
I'll tell him to meet you at the station
15 minutes before your train leaves.
It's safer that way.
All of a sudden, my memory failed me completely.
A total blank.
I forgot Sallanches' phone number.
"This is it."
I thought to myself,
"This is it.
We'll get caught over this tiny detail."
Besides, I had no way of knowing who would answer on the other end.
It the inspector had reached
Sallanches himself... it would have blown my cover.
So the passport is false but the phone number is real?
No, it's all real:
Rene Sallanches, his passport, his daughter, his phone number.
The only fake element in this story is me.
So all you do is switch photos?
You could put it like that.
See, Marie? It's nothing more complicated than that.
All right.
You know everything about the Sallanches family.
Your answers are correct.
But they know nothing about you.
That is, the person using the passport.
But on the phone they don't give you away?
No, they didn't give me away.
It's my lucky star.
Without my own little star,
I'd long since be dead or in jail.
Anyway, Nadine will explain.
Sallanches' daughter.
She's the one who answered the phone.
- Do you know her?
- No, I don't know any of them.
I know all about them, but I don't know any of them.
It's odd you should speak of a lucky star.
I've always thought some people have lucky stars.
- You've never gone to their house?
- No, never.
So you really think they stopped us by chance?
- Of course.
- Why?
Didn't you see? They stopped another black Citroen behind us.
- Are you sure? I didn't notice.
- A suspect car is reported... so they search all cars of the same make and color.
- Suspect? How?
- There's still smuggling going on.
I've seen them search our cars for gold, for example.
They found propaganda hidden in the frame.
What happens then?
That depends. If it's in France, jail, a fine, house arrest.
Nothing too terrible.
But if it's in Spain--
It's time to open up shop.
I'm going to get some sleep.
Antoine must be at the station.
- What if your guy's already crossed?
- Impossible.
- Do I know him?
- I'm sure you do. He goes so often.
But under many different names.
Something about this whole affair still worries me.
What?
- How did they know I was in Madrid?
- They couldn't know.
The inspector took a stab in the dark and just happened to get it right.
With all the arrests in Madrid, aren't you on the spot too?
If I were, do you think the Spanish police would have let me get away?
- Good luck, Carlos.
- Thanks.
Good-bye.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Greetings, friend.
- Greetings, Rafael.
- Has Juan arrived?
- Juan? No news of Juan.
- You weren't expecting him?
Sometimes I don't know who's coming.
They just ask me to get a car ready.
One way to Paris and a visitor's pass.
Have many been crossing lately?
Yesterday, two cars to Andalusia, using their vacation to work for us.
Today, the same car that goes to Bilbao every two weeks.
I've got a car ready, ordered by Paris.
No idea who it's for.
- For how long?
- The week.
- Maybe that one's for Juan.
- I think he'd go through Perpignan.
- Why?
- He's been using this side too much.
Perpignan. You don't know who handles the crossings there?
It's not my district. Anyway, what can you accomplish by going there?
Can you tell me what's going on with Juan?
The bookseller brought a letter saying Juan would arrive in Madrid.
He must be stopped from going.
Have there been arrests?
There's been no word in the press.
It's too early. It just started.
Anyway, if Juan shows up, have him wait here for new orders.
Okay, but I bet he's going to cross at Perpignan.
Perpignan. Here we are.
At 3:34 p.m., you leave Bayonne for Toulouse.
You arrive in Toulouse at 8:34 p.m.
You catch the train for Narbonne at 9:13 p.m.
At 11:01 p.m., in Narbonne, you catch the train to Perpignan.
You arrive in Perpignan at 11:55 p.m.
Not exactly an express.
No, not exactly.
Juan hasn't crossed over yet, unless he went through Perpignan.
You don't know.
You can do nothing alone.
Antoine's right. You don't even know who's in charge in Perpignan.
You should go to Paris.
Juan is probably still there.
You'll find him home.
You need to see your people-- today.
Explain the Madrid situation to them, that nobody should go there.
Eepecially not Juan.
He would be walking into a trap.
-If she hasn't told Lucienne, we're sunk.
-We are?
- How can she do it without Lucienne?
- She's used to it.
- Was she used to it at Royan last year?
- That's different. She wasn't at home.
Lucienne didn't leave just to be with her nephews. Something happened.
You always dramatize.
I know what I'm saying.
She is lost without Lucienne!
Didn't she ask Lucienne to come?
The Marcels make two.
Unless Pierre comes. Two or three.
Then there's us, Raoul, her two daughters, their husbands.
- And no Lucienne!
- Lucienne may be the first one there.
Without Lucienne, we're sunk!
Don't fret. Remember, it's a holiday reunion.
Holiday?
With everyone in a foul mood?
Lucienne's not even family.
Don't exaggerate.
So what if she's not family?
Without her, we're a pretty family!
- I was sent by Antonio.
- What?
- Madame Lopez?
- No, I'm Madame Pluvier.
Sorry, I'm looking for
Madame Lopez.
There's no Madame Lopez here.
Building G, 10th floor, number 107.
That's right, but there's no Madame Lopez here.
Then I've made a mistake.
I beg your pardon.
Is she a refugee from Algeria?
A refugee?
No, I don't think so.
I mean, on account of the name.
There's lots of them around here.
Thank you. Good-bye.
You came to see Juan a year ago.
Building G, 10th floor, number 107.
Care of Madame Lopez, you thought.
But there's no Juan now, no Madame Lopez.
Maybe it was some other Building G, some other 10th floor.
Perhaps Juan did go, and he'll walk right into the trap.
Roberto.
You must find Roberto now.
She'll wonder what's wrong.
She'll realize something's happened to her husband.
You'd rather not see her today.
And yet you need her. She's the one who can take you to Roberto.
Last Thursday at 6:00 p.m...
Andres failed to show up at the Botanical Gardens.
You had a beer at the Cafe Nacional.
You thought nothing of it.
You assumed you'd see Andres at the next meeting place.
But toward nightfall came signs of approaching danger.
The comrade who operates the print shop failed to come home.
His brother notified the others.
The closed little world we live in... became unsettled and full of snares.
Carmen?
You here?
What is it?
Is something wrong?
Andres?
What's happened to Andres?
By Friday it was clear that Andres had disappeared... and Luis and Jueto and Ricardo.
In the shadows we began to fight... the unpredictable progress of the police roundups... severing the links that bound one group to another... suspending all meetings, all contacts, setting new liaison networks.
But Andres had disappeared-- he has disappeared.
He could have disappeared any day now for 15 years.
Carmen had expected, already accepted, in anguish and rage... this disappearance that bursts upon her today.
Thursday evening at 6:00 p.m...
Andres did not show up at the Botanical Gardens.
But you must wrest her from her grief, her solitude.
She knows where to find Roberto today... among all these houses which empty as the weekend draws to a close... among all these lights on a Sunday night.
Roberto organizes the crossings.
Only he will know where to find Juan today.
He alone can catch up with Juan before he too vanishes.
Roberto hates bad news.
An arrest gets on his nerves... not just because it means losing a comrade... not just because of the months and years of work... to be done over from scratch... but becauee the reality of the world resists us... because our actions seem like a dream of indefinite progress.
He hates when reality clashes with his dream.
It's as if he blames you... for being the malicioue messenger of the opaque reality... that we cannot predict.
Ramon!
You have visitors.
I'll be damned! Carlos!
Why are you shouting?
What are you doing here?
You've put on some weight.
Getting old.
The easy life, you know.
Did Juan get away all right this morning?
At noon. I finished his car last night and he left today at noon.
- Which way did he go?
- Perpignan.
- And then to Barcelona?
- Yes, to Barcelona.
At noon?
Just at noon?
Where is he going to cross?
Where will he be tonight?
Perpignan.
Tomorrow he meets the contact who will pick him up in Madrid in two weeks.
Then he crosses over.
- We can warn him, bring him back.
- It's of no use.
Anyway, it's too late.
Why not phone him in Perpignan?
The phone is too risky.
Oh, come on!
Then send him a wire.
Or one of us can catch the night train and reach Perpignan in time.
Look, don't get so nervous.
In the morning we meet with our comrades.
Right. We'll see tomorrow.
BORDER - TWO MILES
What's going on?
Why does Juan have to come back?
He mustn't go to Madrid.
They're making arrests.
Who have they arrested?
Andres and three more from the Madrid committee.
The printer as well.
And it was still going on when I left.
Have you told Carmen?
We'll need to know more details to tell if it's really serious.
You know as well as I that they tend to exaggerate there.
It's natural. At the first sign of trouble, they think everything's unraveling.
They're too close to things to see the situation clearly.
And we see it better from Paris?
Yes. We have a broader perspective.
What about Juan?
He's in no danger. We have three days before he leaves Barcelona.
In Perpignan he would be even safer.
I'll take responsibility for keeping him in Perpignan.
No, I'm in charge of the trips!
He has important work to do in Barcelona.
Every minute counts now!
Are you all crazy here in Paris? Every minute has counted for 25 years.
Why speak to me of 25 years... with a general strike called for 12 days from now?
And May 1st is no joke either, so minutes do count!
May 1st comes around every year, but Juan won't.
If he's caught, he'll get 20 years, and you know it as well as I.
As far as the strike goes, we'll discuss that tomorrow.
Listen, if you need someone to go to Barcelona, I'd be happy to go.
- It'd get me out this rut.
- This rut?
Is your wife a rut now?
Are you having second thoughts?
These Breton women are amazing.
I talk about an undercover mission to help a comrade in danger... and you'd think
I was off on a vacation.
If anyone goes to Barcelona,
I should go.
We'll see.
Don't stand there all night.
Come in the house and have a drink
Good idea, but bring it out here.
I have to finish up this car.
- How did it start this time?
- Probably the same way it always does.
- Of course. It's always the same.
- No, it wasn't the same this time.
No, they struck several places at the same moment.
The printing press and the men working it-- all taken at once.
Andres and Luis were taken in their hideouts.
It's the first time that's happened.
So Juan could be in danger in Madrid?
The raid took place in his sector.
He's been going there for years.
He may have been spotted.
What about you?
You've been going there for years too.
Yet here you are, drinking wine with us.
Luis' wife heard the police say during the search... they had pictures of a Paris leader taken with a telephoto lens... they were sure to arrest next.
- It has to be Juan.
- Films, photos-- it's all fabrication!
The police spread these rumors to demoralize the opposition.
Thursday, the very day the arrests were made... didn't you have an appointment with Andres?
Yet here you are.
Because there is no photo, and Andres won't talk.
It's very simple.
They struck at us because they're afraid!
They want to nip our preparations in the bud.
They conducted a raid. So what?
They've been doing that for 25 years!
That's how war is:
They strike, and we strike back!
- Don't get excited.
- I'm not excited.
I may raise my voice, but it means nothing. It's this crazy life we lead.
What's crazy is that it's gone on this long.
All right.
Tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. at the Pierre Curie station.
Marianne must be waiting for you.
You didn't let her know you were coming?
She's probably left Paris.
Besides, I didn't come for her.
I came for Juan.
- Yes, she must be out of town.
- Why?
- Because it's Easter.
- So it is. You see? One forgets! if you find the house empty, come sleep here.
Maybe. Thanks.
- Is it you?
- That depends.
Was it you on the phone this morning?
Yes. I recognize your voice.
I waited for you until now.
Come on!
Your father isn't home?
If he were, God knows where you would be now!
You don't know how true that is.
But I do know.
They ask to speak to my father.
I say he's on a trip, which is the truth.
For once, the truth served a useful purpose.
What happened at the border?
A spot check. Mere routine.
But they picked us this time.
The phone call could have ruined it.
They mentioned Spain and I knew right away.
My father told me about the passport.
We have a weakness for Spain in our family.
So I pretended to be alarmed.
I asked lots of questions.
I even demanded to talk to my father.
I was admirable, full of daughterly anxiety.
In any case, you kept your cool.
You got me out of a fix.
It's not the first time.
So tell me, how was I in the role of the affectionate father?
When my father feels affectionate, he doesn't call me "darling."
He calls me "Nana."
I'm sure the border incident was nothing at all.
But suppose they were to make inquiries in Paris.
- When does your father return?
- Tomorrow night.
Then he must have his passport to show just in case.
- I'll bring it by tomorrow afternoon.
- You're leaving?
If I hurry,
I can just make the 10:00 show.
What do you do?
Besides this, I mean.
- Nothing else.
- Nothing else ever?
- Not for ages.
- And before that?
Long ago, I think I wanted to write.
Same as everyone.
What you do is far more interesting!
-So you're a professional revolutionary?
-That's it precisely.
A real professional.
What a terrific profession!
How is a passport falsified?
Can't they tell the photo was replaced?
No, they'd have to check police files to see whether the photo is fake.
But they don't keep those files at the border.
Show me.
So you could be my father.
That's right, Nana.
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.
Is someone expecting you?
Yes.
What's your real name?
Sometimes it startles me to hear my real name.
What is it?
Domingo.
That means "Sunday."
Hello, Sunday.
Hello, Nana.
What time shall I bring the passport by tomorrow?
After lunch, but no later than 3:30.
I have to meet somebody.
Nadine Sallanches.
Rue de l'Estrapade, number 7, third floor.
Born October 26, 1944.
Completed her secondary studies at the Lycee Fenelon.
Begins her university studies this year.
Speaks English fluently,
Spanish as well.
Lives with her father, civil service engineer for the government... who is often away because of his work.
Five feet five... brunette, brown eyes, appendicitis three years ago.
- Is that me?
- This data came with the passport.
You don't miss a detail!
No, not a detail.
It's the big picture we sometimes lose sight of.
See you tomorrow.
Good night, Sunday.
I'm not alone.
We're working.
And to think I took my time coming home.
I was sure you wouldn't be in Paris.
No one told me.
No one knew.
It was unexpected.
- Diego.
- Yes?
Nothing.Just saying your name.
You're here. I am happy.
I'm leaving again.
- You are?
- Tomorrow.
You know Agnes?
I thought you had already met.
- I don't think so.
- I'm sure we haven't.
You never saw Agnes at the office?
No, never. Impossible!
Diego is always traveling.
Always?
Every time I asked Marianne to introduce us, you were away on a trip.
I even began to wonder whether you really existed!
Now you see I really do exist.
Stay with us for a while.
We've finished.
Jeanine and Bill will be so glad to see you again.
We're doing a book on all the cities of the world.
That is, on the way a city speaks to its inhabitants... and how people answer back, and how this becomes a language.
It's complicated to explain, but in pictures it's simple.
We'll mix Bill's photographs with drawings by Folon and Topor.
Agnes and I are doing the layout.
Bill's off to Brazil... so we're choosing some of the first pictures before he goes.
We're taking advantage of the Easter holiday.
We've set up shop here, where it's so peaceful.
They'll wonder if you don't come and say hello.
Want something to eat, Diego?
No, I ate on the plane.
The weather was beautiful.
The fountains are still there.
Fountains?
What fountains?
On Piazza Navona.
The Pincio fountains.
All the fountains.
- Haven't you ever been in Rome?
- Rome? Yes, of course.
- What took you to Rome?
- Work.
Didn't you know that I work occasionally?
A conference sponsored by UNESCO.
Teaching in underdeveloped countries.
You haven't grown tired of working as an interpreter?
It pays well. No taxes.
You work six months a year.
You travel.
I'm not ambitious.
It's late.
It's time we left you two alone.
Yes, it is late.
It seems things in Spain are stirring.
Yes. As Marianne says, "It's forever stirring but it never changes."
And what do you say?
Nothing.
I'm your friend, Diego.
Nobody would like what I have to say about Spain.
I'm not even sure
I like it myself.
Poor, unhappy Spain.
Heroic, gallant Spain. I'm sick of it!
Spain's become the lyrical rallying point of the left.
A myth for veterans of past wars.
Meanwhile, 14 million tourists vacation in Spain every year.
Spain is nothing but a tourist's dream or a civil-war myth... all bundled up with Lorca's plays-- and I'm fed up with Lorca's plays.
Sterile women and peasant dramas!
And you can have the legend too!
I was not at Verdun, or Teruel, or at the front at Ebro.
And the people now doing what counts in Spain weren't either.
Twenty-year-olds, inspired not by our past, but by their future.
Spain is no longer the dream of 1936 but the truth of 1965... however disconcerting.
Thirty years have gone by, and veterans give me a pain in the ass!
I'm sorry.
It's all sort of muddled.
Working tomorrow?
I'll see you then.
Right. See you tomorrow.
- Good night.
- I'm staying.
- You are?
- Yes.
I should help Marianne put away the photos.
Then I'll drive you home.
Agnes lives in St. Cloud, and there are no more trains at this hour.
Good night all the same.
Why was that little bitch asking all those questions?
You talked about Rome and UNESCO.
Just ten minutes earlier, I said you were in Brussels with the United Nations.
If they think I'm a liar, too bad!
You? Why just you? if you lied, so did I!
It's our life that seems like a lie.
Didn't you hear Agnes?
A fake couple living a fake life!
Maybe that's what it seems like.
But it's not true.
For me it wasn't a lie.
You spoke of the fountains.
I was happy.
The Piazza Navona must be deserted now.
You can hear the water splashing.
- Where are you going?
- To take Agnes home.
Can't the little bitch take a cab?
She's broke. I promised.
St. Cloud is a long way away.
I wonder if it might not be better to tell the truth.
Sure. Let's put an ad in the paper!
But we can tell
Jeanine and Bill anything.
And your Agnes too?
You think they don't suspect when you go on like you did earlier?
No, Bill doesn't.
He's a photographer.
He does his work.
Anyway, we can't tell anybody anything.
- It's a question of principle.
- Your principles scare me.
There have been arrests in Madrid.
Many of my colleagues have fallen.
I want a child by you.
This is no life!
What is a life?
A child by you.
Can you imagine?
We'll discuss it calmly.
My child. It's not something to discuss calmly.
Afterwards you can go away, leave me, even forget me if you like.
This isn't the time.
Yes, it is the time.
Those arrests.
When did they start?
Thursday, three days ago.
What does it make you want when things like that happen?
Want? What do you mean?
Does it make you want to go on doing what you're doing... even if you're left all alone?
One is never left all alone.
We must let them know that we exist.
That the work still goes on.
That's right.
I'll be back.
Agnes? Are you ready?
"Hello, Patrick!"
Now, to remove the photo.
A lucky star, madame.
A tiny little star for personal use.
A starfish for every purpose.
All right. This goes here... and this goes over there.
My expenses.
Dinner in Madrid, 230.
Gasoline, 635.
Breakfast, 42.
For patience and irony... are the chief virtues of a Bolshevik.
"My name is Nana."
And mine is Sunday.
Six months without seeing you, Diego.
It's not possible.
If you had to stay here--
I don't know--
If things became too dangerous for you to go to Madrid, would you miss it?
I would miss Spain.
I really would.
Like something you would miss terribly... whose absence would be unbearable.
The people.
Strangers who open a door who recognize you and whom you recognize.
Being part of something together.
Spain. Your people.
That's your life.
The other day
I almost slept with a man.
Why?
I thought I wanted to.
No. I mean why tell me?
Would you tell, Diego?
I don't know.
Why didn't you?
Because... the moment always comes when you're through sleeping with a man.
When you're through making love.
At that point... he should be gone.
He should have disappeared.
To wake up beside anyone but you... is unimaginable.
It's only later that things get complicated.
Don't you agree?
I'm hungry.
I thought you ate on the plane from Rome.
Nine years ago,
I was the one you told your lies to.
A torrent of lies to hide who you were and what you were doing in Rome.
Of course.
You told me your name was Francisco... and then Rafael... and then Carlos.
I spent months, both in Rome and in Paris... sorting out your truth from your lies.
They weren't lies.
They were barriers.
Against what?
Falling in love isn't on the agenda for a professional revolutionary.
What is?
Patience.
Above all, patience.
I'm starved.
Don't you have anything to eat?
Next year, if you're still spending half your time in Madrid...
I'm going to move there.
Move there?
What do you mean?
Live there. Find some work that lets me follow you around.
I like having houses in different places.
In Madrid? You barely speak ten words of Spanish.
I learned French well enough.
Anyway, what kind of work?
Same as here.
They publish books in Spain too.
Well, we wouldn't get far on my 800 francs a month.
I thought you got a raise.
You're right. 875 francs.
And what do you make here?
Three thousand a month?
- You'd never make that much there.
- I don't need to make that much.
I need you.
Anyway, it's out of the question.
A girlfriend in the same city where I'm working in the underground? Too risky.
Was it serious this time?
Did they arrest people from Paris?
People I know?
- You know Juan--
- Juan was arrested?
No, not yet.
That's why I came back.
I'm sure they have his picture.
Ivry, Porte des Lilas, Six-Routes...
Quatre-Chemine, Aubervilliers... la Poterne des Peupliers,
Victor-Hugo...
Jaures, Paul Vaillant-Couturier.
You know these suburbs like the back of your hand.
You arrive from your own country... and at your every return you find this landscape of exile.
You see once more those desiccated, tireless, worn-out men... fastidious about detail but less clear about the larger picture... ready to die: your comrades.
You'll again find this comradeship... irreplaceable and yet eaten away by a lack of reality.
You'll spend whole days in Ivry or Aubervilliers... trying to rebuild your country... in the likeness of your memory.
Toiling stubbornly to force your dreams into the far-off reality of Spain.
Good morning!
How goes it?
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?
Fine.
- You had a good trip?
- Yes.
It's in the paper.
"According to official sources... the Spanish police has been carrying out... a vast preventive operation... against various extreme-left working-class groups in Madrid.
A printing press was seized and several dozen arrests were made... including ringleaders who entered the country illegally from France.
These measures appear to be directly linked to the unrest... during recent months among the working classes in Madrid."
- Here. I know you all like coffee.
- Good idea.
I'm going to run some errands.
If the doorbell rings, don't answer.
All right. We can begin.
I'll try to sum up the situation, comrades... based on the information we had received by Saturday.
You again have the feeling you've lived this before... that you've said all this before over the years.
How often have you come here after a wave of arrests, after a "fall"?
They call it a "fall" in Spanish.
They say a colleague has "fallen"... that a printing press or an organization has "fallen."
Sooner or later, say the old-timers, everybody falls.
The road is long and marked by falls.
How often have you come here to examine why these falls occurred... or to decide what measures to take next?
Andres did not show up for the meeting at the Botanical Gardens.
That's when it all started:
Thursday, three days ago.
We must therefore withdraw the call to strike in Madrid.
I must say, in general, I disagree with the directive in this case.
Carlos has given us a completely subjective view of the situation.
Carlos has given us a completely subjective view of the situation.
He exaggerates the consequences of the arrests currently being made.
Indeed, he seems to have lost all political perspective.
What is the situation that has led to these arrests?
A political offensive by the working class... by students and peasants.
A situation where the dictatorship is desperate and on its last legs.
Even the current arrests reflect... the regime's fear in the face of resistance by the masses.
Under these conditions, they cannot halt... the movement's advance, its spread, its progress.
We are on the eve of a general strike.
That is why we decided to send Juan to Madrid... with precise orders and instructions.
The mass movement must be organized and given a single goal.
That goal is the general strike.
The requisite conditions exist and we must act now.
A date had to be set and we have set it.
The strike is called for April 30th... with nationwide demonstrations on May 1st.
Carlos disagrees with the decision to call a general strike.
He says we must bear in mind the realities of the situation.
But what does "realities of the situation" really mean?
That we should allow the political situation to come to a head on its own?
That's mere opportunism, pure and simple!
I never said we should just let things develop spontaneously.
You never said we should just let things develop spontaneously.
You merely question certain forms of action under certain conditions.
A general strike is not the sole form of struggle... an inevitable finale.
Lenin voiced criticisms of a general strike... insofar as it tends to preclude other forms of struggle.
If you wish to discuss Lenin, then we'll discuss Lenin.
You accuse us of voluntarism, but Lenin proved precisely that... a dose of voluntarism, of revolutionary subjectivism, is indispensable.
Your criticism is purely negative.
What are you really proposing?
Criticism is always negative at first.
You try to make yourself understood... to explain it's not the idea of a general strike you're criticizing... but merely the specific situation to which it's being applied.
You oppose the call for a general strike on April 30th... because the required conditions are absent.
Another failure may discourage the masses from this form of action.
You oppose deciding from a position of exile... a plan of action and its date of execution in Spain.
We cannot be proxies for workers in Bilbao, Barcelona, Madrid... or decide for them.
Our underground can only organize and serve as an instrument... to carry out the will of the masses.
It cannot replace that will.
Why speak of exiles as if they were in opposition to those in Spain... the underground in opposition to the masses?
No, I don't.
I only mean one cannot replace the other.
It would be absurd to imply... that Carlos has been intimidated by the arrests.
Over the past ten years he has often proven he's not easily intimidated.
But he has been lacking in political insight.
Just what is the situation?
Juan is in Barcelona.
He is scheduled to meet Carlos in Madrid on Thursday.
But Carlos is here and Juan has been left to his own devices.
We must reach Juan in Barcelona... and set up another contact for him with the group in Madrid.
We're forced to increase the number of trips... and, as a result, the risk automatically increases too.
This is what Carlos' undue haste has led to.
But if Carlos had instead remained in Madrid... he could have followed the raid hour by hour.
He could have taken certain steps.
Juan would be protected by Carlos' presence in Madrid.
These are the results of an individual decision lightly taken... without taking into account the constraints of the act... or respecting the decisions made by the central committee.
You're not going to Barcelona.
You're staying here.
Ramon will go and accompany Juan to Madrid.
You just spent six months in Spain, in the hub of day-to-day action.
Perhaps the details of a partial reality have blinded you.
The dozens of tiny, true little details have clouded your vision.
You'll take a break.
You need to think things over.
Discuss matters calmly with others.
Let them set you straight.
You're staying here.
Let's go.
Let's go!
The passport.
Sal lanches.
Here it is.
Sallanches, Rene.
Born October 17, 1922.
It will just take a minute.
We need a passport for Ramon.
- When?
- Today.
- This afternoon.
- Always in a rush!
- Speak French, all right?
- Yes, of course.
The work going well?
Yes, let me talk to her.
I'm not leaving anymore.
Yes, I'm staying here with you.
Unhappy? No. Why?
A long time.
Maybe forever.
We'll take a vacation.
All right. See you tonight.
Good-bye.
ENJOY THE SUN AND SURF
VACATION AT LA PINEDA
Who is it?
- It's Sunday.
- No, it's Monday.
I know it's Monday.
I'm Sunday.
I expected you.
Aren't you coming?
I was busy.
I have that thing for you.
- I have to go out now.
- I know you have a date. Where?
What does that matter if you're not coming?
No, I was just wondering.
At "La Chope. "Know it?
- Yes, I do.
- What's so funny?
Nothing. How about 6:00?
Fine. Where?
The lobby of Bullier Hall, 6:00.
- Why not my house?
- I'd prefer somewhere else, all right?
6:00 then. Bye.
- What would you like?
- Coffee.
You wouldn't have a cigarette, would you?
Keep them.
This place is lousy with cops.
I wouldn't know.
I would.
I work for them.
- But nobody followed me!
- You're crazy!
- There were three of them in a car.
- Are you sure?
I should know-- it's my job!
A car? I can't believe it.
I even took one-way streets.
One got out and followed you.
I tailed him.
You saw nothing?
Some men did look at me, but not like that. It does happen on occasion.
- Why are the cops on your tail?
- You think it's the police?
I ought to know. What do you do that might interest the police?
- Nothing.
- That's not true.
- Why are you speaking to me like that?
- I have to know!
If they are cops, it's dangerous for you to meet me. They'll spot you.
They're still tailing your boyfriend at Edgar-Quinet.
- Miguel?
- Yes, the guy with you.
- At Edgar-Quinet?
- So you were hiding something.
Go on. Tell me what happened.
You split up at Maubert.
Your friend took the Metro.
The younger cop followed him.
We all got off at Raspail.
Raspail?
- Your friend went into a house.
- What about the cop?
The cop wrote down the number and left, unless he's still hiding nearby.
I've got to go. They may be planning to make a search.
You must help me. It's serious.
They're working for Spain too, you know.
I'm taking Papa's car to pick him up at the station.
- Would you care to explain?
- I can't, Domingo. Later.
Turn left, then continue along the cemetery.
I don't see anyone.
Turn on your lights.
Go ahead now.
- How long?
- I don't know. Five minutes.
I'll pick you up in ten minutes in front of the Delambre movie theater.
The registration's in the glove compartment. You have a license?
- Several.
- I mean a real one.
Yes, even a real one!
Go on!
Good evening.
- What's that?
- A suitcase.
Of course it's a suitcase.
- It looks heavy.
- Papers and more papers.
- I'll let you work.
- We're just finishing up.
Who was the woman
I passed in the hall?
Lola.
I want to say, about last night--
Well, If I can ever be of help--
A photographer gets around, you know.
That's all. I'm sure Agnes must be mad with curiosity.
All through?
Bill took Agnes home.
He said we've done enough today.
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Why?
You had a visitor. That dark, thin fellow who seems to hate me.
What are you saying?
That's my impression.
Or he distrusts me.
- You're crazy.
- I can tell.
He's suspicious of my work, the way I dress.
He must think I'm the wrong kind of woman for an agent like you.
So what did he want?
He seemed very agitated.
He came by twice and made me repeat the message. He must take me for a fool!
Anyway, plans have changed.
You're not staying.
You're going to Barcelona.
He expects you at 11:00 a.m. at the same Metro exit as today.
You'll meet to discuss your trip.
You'll eat there and leave directly from the meeting.
Take your things with you.
They'll bring a passport.
Barcelona?
He didn't say why I'm going?
It's not his style to give explanations.
I'm fed up.
Completely fed up!
This morning I'd lost all political perspective. I needed a break.
I needed to think, talk it over... which means engage in self-criticism--
That's what they really meant.
Now I'm suddenly fit to send to Barcelona, just like that.
Well, they can find someone else!
No need to get up at the crack of dawn, since you don't leave till noon.
Would you like to go out tonight?
I thought this was no life.
No, it's not a life.
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
A movie?
If you'd like.
- What do you want to see?
- Whatever you say. I don't care.
Would you mind driving me to the station before the movie?
I'd like to check this suitcase there.
Why?
- Because.
- But why?
- I prefer not to keep it here.
- You've always kept your papers here.
All the same, I prefer not to.
- There's nothing else?
- What else?
Something you haven't told me?
Nothing of consequence.
Just incidental details.
I love you, Diego.
I know you do.
Is that for us?
Yes, it is.
Well, now... what about your lights?
You're right. I forgot.
Your registration, please.
- Is the car yours?
- Yes, Officer.
- Are you the husband?
- No, I'm not the husband.
Your driver's license, please.
You're not French?
- What are you?
- Spanish. A Spanish refugee.
Your papers, please.
You have them. do you realize what driving without lights could cost you?
No, this is the first time it's happened to me.
You shouldn't trust your car to absent-minded people.
All right. Go ahead this time.
- But be more careful in the future.
- Thank you, Officer.
Don't you want me to go?
Didn't you hear him?
"Don't trust your suitcase to absent-minded people."
Do you really know how the lockers work?
"Are you the husband?"
"No, I'm not the husband."
You should have seen your face!
Do I have the face of a husband?
No, but I am a wife to you anyway.
Stop at that cafe.
- I have to make a call.
- Now? Before the movie?
I'll just be a minute.
- Did Manolo say 11:00?
- Who?
- The little thin man? 11:00 sharp.
- I'll be right back.
I'm sorry to bother you this late, sir.
May I speak to Nadine?
Thank you.
It's me.
I must see you and your friends tomorrow.
The afternoon is too late.
What's that?
Too late for everything!
9:00 sharp.
Same Metro stop as today.
On the platform, "Etoile" side.
Without fail, Nadine. Good-bye.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just had to arrange for someone to pick up the suitcase.
It couldn't wait?
Manolo could have come for it at the house.
Do you mind If I conduct my work as I see fit?
The truth is, it's not just the suitcase.
You want me to tell you?
I don't want anything, but you're going to tell me anyway, so go on.
Yesterday you wanted to go to Barcelona to head off Juan... but you were on edge.
You exploded in front of Jeanine and Bill.
You, who are always so cautious.
You think you sounded like a UNESCO interpreter?
By noon today, you weren't leaving.
You said,
"I'm staying here with you."
But you were unhappy.
What happened this morning?
- This morning?
- At your meeting.
You seem to be drifting, Diego.
It's like you're in a fog, no longer sure where you're going.
I know where I'm going:
Barcelona.
I suppose I'll accompany Juan to Madrid and then return here.
I must take a break, talk things over with them.
You see, in Spain I see things from too close-up.
Reality blinds me.
I must regain a broader perspective, even if it's unreal.
- I don't understand you anymore.
- It's very simple.
Our people live in the belief that it will all blow sky-high any day now.
And that's all right. No one can stand the idea of dying in exile.
But it's not true.
There's still a long road ahead of us.
That can't be!
It's true that it has to explode!
Listen.
"Various opposition forces in the Basque region... have jointly decided to call a general strike... beginning April 30th at 8:00 a.m.
Students will also participate.
The strike will last a week... but, if repressed, it will go on indefinitely."
It's meaningless.
Mumbojumbo, like carrying idols to make it rain.
No, I hope that general strike will really happen.
There will be isolated incidents, small factions. Nothing big.
It's an unreal action.
I hope you're wrong.
The general strike will take place!
Isn't this what you all have wanted for years?
Isn't that why your comrades are dead or in prison?
I hope you're wrong. 
I hope you're really blind!
Things have to change... so you can go back to Spain.
And so I can go with you.
So we can finally have a life together.
Crying and shouting won't help.
That's not going to change reality.
- Shall we go home?
- Yes, let's go home.
What are you doing? 
Nothing.
Just looking at the night.
I must have a child by you, Diego.
Otherwise, I'll go mad.
If I went back to Spain... if I started all over again from zero, would you come with me?
To Spain?
You mean, return to Spain, now, the normal way?
Under your real identity?
Yes, my real identity.
The normal way.
Anyhow, the place to be is Spain.
That's where things will happen.
I didn't become an agent to spend my life in Paris suburbs... going from one meeting to another.
It's not for me.
Do you think it's possible?
You think it's possible the police don't know your true identity?
I'm sure they've heard of Carlos... but they never heard of Diego Mora.
Well, then, we go to Spain!
Why did you open the suitcase?
- I don't like lies about these things.
- I didn't lie.
I just asked you to keep a suitcase for me. That's all.
- With explosives in it.
- Does that scare you?
Listen...
I've been handling them since I was 17.
Me too.
What got you involved with Spain?
What about you?
It's my own country!
So no one but you has a right to get involved with your country?
Every man for himself in his own little corner, is that it?
Should we confine ourselves to problems at the university... or the crisis in the artichoke crop?
I thought we were more internationalist!
Internationalism means putting your own country in order first.
Papa lends you his passport, and I carry suitcases.
Yes, let's talk about that suitcase.
Here's your father's passport.
- What floor is it?
- Why? Aren't you coming with me?
You go on alone. I'll follow.
You don't trust me?
My comings and goings are for me to decide.
I gather you don't like cemeteries.
But they clear the view. They bring a little sunshine into one's life.
What exactly do you stand for?
You don't collect explosives just for fun.
What's your group, your program?
Leninist Group for Revolutionary Action.
Everyone's a Leninist these days.
Let's not get bogged down in a discussion about theory.
Nadine gave you a suitcase that belongs to us.
What do you plan to do with it?
I should have tossed it in the Seine... but I'm curious about the tactics you advocate for Spain.
I've come here entirely on my own.
Explain it to him.
For 25 years, Spain has been in a latent prerevolutionary state.
To sum it up... tourism is one of the regime's main sources of income.
In addition, millions of people learn... to look on Spain as a normal country.
For them, Spain is a memory of a pleasant vacation.
This is an extremely dangerous political hoax... demobilizing antifascist action in Europe.
This is why we must strike a blow at tourism in Spain!
- Create a climate which will stop it!
- Why not stop the sun too?
We strike at the economy and awaken proletarian conscience in one blow!
- Because it's asleep?
- Sorry, I didn't mean that.
I say a revolutionary state exists in Spain, objectively speaking.
But there is no revolutionary policy or front. Lenin said--
Lenin's no prayerwheel!
Your peaceful methods amount to revisionism, pure and simple.
Objectively speaking, you're following in the wake of the Spanish bourgeoisie.
- Objectively?
- That's right.
And that's why, for 20 years, we've been hounded... jailed, pushed out of windows, shot... and given the stiffest sentences?
Because, objectively speaking, we're in the service of the bourgeoisie?
He said "in the wake of," not "in the service of."
He was using a political concept.
You turned it into a moral judgment.
You're right.
We do not question the ability or the heroism of your members.
- But we do question your approach.
- For example?
Issuing a new directive for a general strike on April 30th... and heading for a new failure.
You're very sure of yourself.
I judge from past experience.
Since 1959, every general strike called in this way has been a failure.
Since 1959?
That's what-- six years?
The validity of a strategic tactic cannot be judged over so short a period.
You're very impatient for people engaged in revolution.
Then let's talk about that suitcase.
Yes, let's! That stupid stunt nearly got me caught by the cops!
- Or perhaps the other way around?
- Who led the cops to Nadine?
You, the person who used
Rene Sallanches' passport.
They began to tail us from Nadine's house because of you.
Because of the incident at the border.
It's the only reasonable explanation.
The question is, how long were you tailed... and did the Spanish police alert the French?
In any event, they can't pin anything on us.
We've done nothing.
But all you terrorist groups get finished off in short order!
What in the hell would I do with your explosives? Eat them?
You'll find the suitcase in this locker.
Go blow yourselves up!
- You left, just like that!
- I'm late.
Will you give me a call tonight?
An old woman like me--
You could pay a little more attention!
Call me tomorrow?
Are you leaving?
Will you call me when you get back?
You are coming back?
- What happened to you?
- Nothing. I'll explain.
- Twenty minutes late!
- Okay, okay. I'm here now.
You didn't know Ramon was dead.
They're about to tell you.
He died Sunday night, a few hours after you saw him.
His heart gave out, as they say.
Ramon wanted to go to Barcelona to get away from the routine.
Tricked-up care, suitcases with false bottoms.
Working in the shadows for 15 yeare.
Now you're going to go.
You will take his place.
Because the work goes on and no single death can interrupt it.
Number 45, third floor right.
- And the password?
- "The sun rises over Benidorm."
When is the funeral?
We received a letter from Madrid today.
Things are not as serious as they seemed.
Ramon never saw Spain, the land of his parents.
You will see the trees of Gerona... and the vineyards along the road with Ramon's eyes.
On this trip you will feel the delight Ramon would have felt.
There will be a strike in Madrid as well on April 30th.
And on May 1st on the Gran Via!
You didn't know Ramon was dead.
There were shadows, trees, sunlight-- and Ramon was dead.
"Death brings sunshine into your life, " you were told a while ago.
You laughed, but you should have shouted at him to shut up... for Ramon is dead and his shadow has entered your life... the shadow of death which has followed you since the day you were born.
You think to yourself there will be no strike in Madrid on April 30th... but you're seized again by the comradeship of long battles... by the stubborn joy of taking action.
You'll find Juan and accompany him to Madrid.
Once again you'll knock on doors, which strangers will open.
You'll say something, anything--
"The sun is rising over Benidorm "... or "Almond trees bloom in Antonio's garden "... and they'll let you in, and you'll be together, for those are the passwords.
You'll see it all with Ramon's eyes: the sky, the vineyards, strangers' faces.
All Ramon's joys will be yours... as if it were your first trip and the battle were just beginning.
Your buddy's downstairs.
He's waiting with the car.
- Damn!
- What's wrong?
My name is Chauvin!
My name is Andre Sarlat.
Mine is Gabriel Chauvin.
Chauvin? Hell of a name!
- We can swap life stories.
- Shall we tell the truth or make it up?
Make it up.
The truth is of no importance.
We're supposed to make tracks, so let's make 'em.
You'll have to fill me in on things.
It's my first time.
You'll see. It's simple.
So let's make tracks.
- Papa came home Sunday.
- The concierge told me it was Monday.
She's old. She gets confused.
Indeed.
Too bad he's not in. I would have liked to take a look at his passport.
It's right here.
Everything's in order.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
Politics can be a tricky affair.
There's more than just smuggling taking place on the Spanish border.
Last Sunday we received an alert on a car and its passenger.
The man is wanted in Madrid.
They let him cross, along with his French driver... because they're sure they'll catch him when he returns.
At least, that's what they say.
But if your father's passport is here... it's not wandering around somewhere else, right?
Another false tip.
Anyway, politics are always a tricky affair.
Some of these underground characters... turn up one day as cabinet ministers.
Papa, you must warn your friends!
Domingo's friends.
They came about the passport.
You're right. I'll be right over.
You're lucky, madame.
We just had a cancellation.
No luggage? You can board right away. One flight up.
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
All set?
I've got my ticket.
Is everything clear?
You remember everything?
Perfectly.
The address of the house and what you have to say?
Rue Aribau, number 45, third floor right.
I ask to speak to Teresa and I say,
"The sun rises over Benidorm."
That they are not to go to Madrid. That they are both to come back, right?
That Juan and he should return by separate routes.
Right. That they should come back.
I don't know why Carlos didn't tell us... about that incident the other day at the border.
Anyway, we'll see.
But it will work out.
You have just enough time.
But it will work out.
Have a good trip.
Thank you.
THE END
NARRATOR:
Berlin, 1944.
 A secret radio message from Adolf Hitler
 personally to his spies in Great Britain.
"Kill General MacKenzie-Smith, please."
 There was terrible headaches, you know.
 Here in London, this is how the message was passed on.
 It's only now that we of
British Military Intelligence
 have been able to piece together fully
from captured German documents.
 We thank Paramount Pictures in Hollywood
 for having the courage to put this on the screen.
 I know we wouldn't.
 The German Secret Service didn't hesitate a moment
 in placing Hitler's orders into effect.
 MacKenzie-Smith was drawing up the plans
 for the Allied invasion of Europe
 and had to be stopped at all costs.
 Here come General Eisenhower,
Field Marshall Montgomery,
 General de Gaulle,
 and Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith himself
 wearing the familiar eye patch.
MAN:
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!
NARRATOR:
Dear, dear. We don't seem to be catching up.
 Well, after all, the Germans are in a Rolls Royce
 and our lads only have American Jeeps.
 Not that we're not grateful, mind you.
 Uh, it is better than walking.
Oh, come, come. Let's get those ruddy names off the screen
 Never heard of any of those chaps. Have you?
MAN ( over speaker ):
This camp area is now sealed.
NARRATOR:
That night MacKenzie sealed every military area in Britain.
 Nothing could move in or out.
Not even two American soldiers assigned to a British base.
MAN ( over speaker ):
...permitted to leave this base
 by personal order of the General Officer
MacKenzie-Smith, that so and so.
Boy, you can say that again.
Cheer up, Joe.
So we can't leave for home
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and smile.
Smile. Smile.
Sure. After all the trouble to get the Red Cross
My poor wife having
My mother isn't desperately ill.
She's on Miami Beach.
She sent me a picture of her in a bathing suit,
My poor sister works for the Red Cross.
Want to get her in trouble?
No, I don't wanna get her in trouble.
How many times have I told you
I'm on the salt-free, fat-free, high-protein low-calorie diet?
What's so difficult about that?
It's not easy to get it on a shingle.
No.
We don't even belong in this teabag outfit.
Well, I know that.
The, the--
Our company was just loaned to the British Army to show them how to open spam or something.
All right.
Why don't we see the captain?
We'll explain the whole situation to him.
He's a nice fellow.
He'll cut some orders for us, and then in a couple of days, we'll be home.
Ernie, this is the army, remember?
There are a couple of boys trying to get home from Gettysburg.
They'll make it.
Inspecting something,
I guess.
Why ain't they out fighting the war?
What do you want?
Why aren't we fighting the war?
Because we want our side to win. That's why.
Sit down, chaps.
We're all in the same leaky boat.
Not us. We're supposed to be sailing on one tonight.
Our sick ones are waiting for us.
This military camp is now sealed by order of the general commanding by order of
His Majesty's government, and by order of the Prime Minister.
Uh-huh.
( imitating MacKenzie ):
Hey! We shall fight them on the beaches. We shall fight them on the streets.
But, uh, how can we fight them if we can't get out of this ruddy camp?
Quiet, will you?
I've gotta think.
Now, there must be somebody we know that's got enough influence to get us out of here tonight.
( in normal voice ):
There's only one man.
( imitates Hitler ):
Sieg heil!
Now he'll run his whole
Luftwaffe for you.
He has a gamut of three.
It's because he was raised in the German section of Brooklyn.
( in English ):
There'll always be an England, but they will be driving Volkswagens.
We will have the--
Ernie, your mustache fell in the potatoes.
It looks right at home.
( in normal voice ):
Yeah, well...
See, without my patch,
I have one good eye with 20/20 vision and one bad eye uh, in case of extreme myopia, you see.
And, uh, I wrote a letter to my draft board about it,
He's jolly good, you know?
The life of the party.
Do an imitation of the boat sailing for the States without us.
( in rough voice):
When the saints go marching in.
Will you quit fooling around?
( normal ):
Honestly, we'll get going.
Of course.
I can just see
MacKenzie Smith, that one-eyed old slave driver giving you permission to go.
Yeah, so can I.
Yeah, here.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
Uh, um, speak up, young man.
Huh, what's his mother doing around in Rip Rolls. What?
Nuh-uh.
Good heavens, man.
Why didn't you speak up sooner?
Oh, yes.
I say unseal Britain, and let my people go.
Don't encourage him, please.
Oh, that's the old bird to a tee. your duty is merely to do your duty.
Do you understand?
Obey orders.
Now yours is not to reason why.
Ours is not to reason why either.
If any stops to reason why, we should all be in Miami Beach with Mother.
Ha, ha, I say, that's a rather witty one.
Well, uh, what?
Carry on.
Come on, chaps.
On the double.
Ernie.
Well, what for?
We're going out to the motor pool.
Grab a car. You'll sit in the back seat and I'll drive you out,
General.
I won't be impersonating an officer.
That's what I mean.
I'll impersonate an officer.
Ernie, it's dark outside.
Don't you see how you fooled that limey captain? wearing all that brass.
I'll make like your chauffeur.
It's a cinch.
You must be out of your mind.
You don't even know how to drive.
The incredible just takes just a little bit longer. and categorically no, no, no.
MAN 1: Hey!
MAN 2:
Who goes there?
Oh, sorry, sir.
I didn't know you were visiting the camp, sir.
But I have strict orders, sir.
Your orders not to let anyone
Quiet, sergeant.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
Um, very good.
But I've just revoked the order, and I am in a bit of a rush.
Open the barrier.
There's a good man.
Sorry, sir, but you must prove your identity.
Blasted man,
I have urgent business at Supreme Headquarters.
I have no time to play
Tin Soldier. Never have.
Now you know who I am.
Open the barrier or I shall have my man drive through it!
Open.
( in normal voice ):
Once we get out of sight,
I'll take the wheel.
I've got to hand it to you.
Maybe it was you who had the IQ of 185.
I guess it was mine.
Listen, you better get out and change that tire before they try to come and help us.
Where do they hide the tools in these things?
I don't even know where they put the motor.
I can't do that.
I'm the general.
So, be democratic.
Oh, stop worrying.
They didn't even notice us.
Hey, I think I found the jack.
Heh, look.
Look, I think I found a fuse.
Oh, what fender.
What to do?
Let me get out of here!
Lift up, so I can put the jack under here.
( screams ):
Yeah, oh, God!
Get this thing up--
We have transport for you, sir. Please get in.
We'll take you to Supreme Headquarters.
I've got a better idea.
Take me to jail.
MAN:
Yes, yes. A remarkable resemblance to the general.
But we must be absolutely certain.
The Nazis,
I'm sorry to say, escaped.
They've slipped through our fingers again, up our sleeve as a last resort.
Finally, we seem to have stumbled on a man who has a chance of carrying it off.
Yes, but yeah, you've seen the report on this fellow?
He's a hypochondriac, a malingerer, a confirmed grouser, he's got flat feet--
But it made a monkey out of the Sergeant Le Garde.
Nonsense. At night, and for a few seconds only.
Colonel.
We're both in intelligence and both understand that could get us committed to a booby hatch
There's something in that.
Now sometimes the long chance is the only chance.
Perhaps you're right.
Well, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll have this fellow,
Private Williams, brought in tomorrow and leave it to the general to make the final decision.
How's that?
The general himself?
Heh, one thing we've learned from you Americans, my boy, the higher you pass the buck, the longer it takes to come back to you.
NARRATOR:
Our code name for this chap was to be Dead Pigeon.
 Goodness, do you think he heard me?
Okay, Corporal.
We'll take it from here.
Come along.
Sir Lawrence, this is Project 402.
Good heavens.
Oh, please don't judge by his present unprepossessing appearance, sir.
Z-2 has investigated him thoroughly, sir.
This man has an amazing ability for mimicry.
Oh, jolly, we'll have to make sure.
Step forward, man.
Step forward, damn it!
Uh...
Turn around.
Faster!
I can't turn around any faster, sir.
If I turn around fast,
I get dizzy and nauseous and everything, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's like this, sir.
You see, sir.
It's a form allergenic vertigo, sir.
It's, uh, a deviation of the inner ear.
It's quite an interesting problem medically.
I wrote a letter to draft board, explaining the whole thing.
MACKENZIE:
What is this ruddy nonsense?
I say, stop it, you hear.
Halt!
I say there is a vague physical resemblance, but I do say, chaps, don't you think we're going a bit near the knuckle?
Oh, excuse me. MI-5 have also investigated this man, sir.
Tested him thoroughly.
His impersonation of you is skillful even uncanny.
Please don't judge too hastily, sir.
Yes, yes, yes.
Of course.
Mm, uh.
Uh ,what did you say this chap's name was?
Williams.
Private Ernest Williams.
MACKENZIE:
Yes, of course. Uh, you.
Let me hear you play
General MacKenzie-Smith in your uncanny and skillful way.
Would you mind putting out that cigar, sir?
I'm allergic to tobacco.
My sinuses simply are not equipped to handle it, sir.
It's all in that letter, page four, paragraph three.
Look here, man!
I haven't got all day!
General Eisenhower is waiting.
Oh, tell him not to, sir.
I don't do him.
Of all the blithering idiots,
I give you exactly five seconds to comply with my order or I'll ruddy well have you taken out and shot!
Or are you allergic to that too?
( imitates Mackenzie ) :
Of all the blithering idiots,
I give you exactly five seconds to comply with my order or I'll ruddy well have you taken out and shot!
Or are you allergic to that too?
Rather good, me boy.
Rather good.
I say, that's quite a remarkable resemblance.
I'm glad you think so, sir.
Yes, I do.
My congratulations, dear fellow.
Yes, yes.
Quite remarkable.
Blast me if I don't think he'll do.
( in normal voice ):
You're not going to shoot me
Have you been told about your assignment?
Assignment?
We'll take care of that later.
He hasn't been told a thing.
Face the general.
Oh, excuse me,
Sir.
Uh, what will you have?
What?
I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, sir.
Blast it, man!
Anyone who wants to step into my shoes better learn to drink my brandy.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. I think they let me keep it, sir.
I have it. Oh, uh.
No, that's the Hitler mustache.
I can tell by the mashed potatoes.
( imitates MacKenzie ):
All leaves casual forthwith for the fortnight.
That's the wrong eye, you idiotic nincompoop!
A mistake like that might be tragic.
Well, you see, sir,
I have one good eye and one eye with very poor vision.
When I imitate you, sir,
I always put the patch on the bad eye so I can see.
But if you insist on it, sir,
I can put it on the good eye,
Here, man.
Here's your drink. Drink up.
Sir, I have a liver condition--
There'll be steel through it if you don't.
Alcohol makes the enzymes in my blood have their own--
Be quiet, man, or I'll have you hanged for insubordination!
( stammers ):
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
If that's what you really want.
Sorry, sir.
I, uh, can't see a thing, so I should always wear it on.
Ooh, uh, say, huh...
For heaven's sake, man, drink up and get out of my sight.
Oh, uh, excuse me, sir.
Yes, sir.
Uh, yes.
Take him out and try to persuade him to desert.
Yes, sir.
Come along.
You've got him, Jeff.
MAN:
The enemy expect the invasion here.
Now, at all costs, we must confuse the German high command as to where the blow will really fall.
Already we've sent an actor who resembles
Field Marshal Montgomery on a tour of North Africa to convince the enemy that the attack will be launched from there.
Sound thinking.
Thank you,
Private Williams.
Very kind of you.
Now, General MacKenzie-Smith will shortly take off by air for Yugoslavia where the second front will really begin.
He must travel, of course, in complete secrecy, disguised.
Disguised perhaps as a private in the American army.
Private Ernest Williams.
I see.
And you want me to impersonate the general for a while so that the German high command will believe he is still in London?
Sound thinking.
Uh, thank you, sir.
Very kind of you.
Uh, I've been doing some more sound thinking, sir and, uh, ah, I don't think
I want the job, uh, sir.
ERNIE:
Well, sir, doing it for the fellows is one thing but in real life, day after day uh, heh, I'm not even British.
I honestly don't think
I could carry it off.
In that case, soldier,
I'll arrange for your Court-Martial immediately.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, Court-Martial, sir?
Uh, Court-Martial?
Impersonating an officer is a capital offense.
I think the fellow is quite right.
An American. How could he be convincing as an Englishman?
You did, of course.
When does a colonel listen to a private, sir?
I mean, uh, I've been doing a lot of sound thinking and I don't think there's anybody else
You don't?
Yes, sir.
Uh, certainly on the surface
I may appear American to you but dash it all, underneath, my roots go back to the Pilgrim fathers.
( imitating MacKenzie-Smith ):
You do realize I play cricket every Whitsuntide?
For old Genenid...
I don't know, sir, but I do know I'd like the job.
Under those circumstances,
I'll be happy to see that you get it.
You have nothing to worry about.
We'll give you a complete make up job.
Gray your hair.
We'll put you through a whale of a training program.
You'll study the general's actions, appearance, friends, the whole works.
When we get through, you'll not only look like the general
That may be necessary too.
I can't do that.
You see, Colonel?
I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-cholesterol low-calorie diet.
We'll cross that alcoholic bridge when we come to it.
Uh, I want you both to know that
I'm very happy to do anything that will make sure that the government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from this earth.
Thank you, Honest Abe.
Four score and seven years ago, or forefathers brought forth upon this land a low-calorie, cottage cheese, which is the only--
Don't you think perhaps we ought to tell him?
Tell him what?
That a spy ring of German agents are operating within our own headquarters?
That's already made three attempts on MacKenzie-Smith's life.
It may be wise to risk someone else's life for the generals but--
I don't altogether agree with you Americans, you know? ought to be told the truth and allowed to volunteer.
Colonel, in two years of army service
Private First Class
Ernest Williams has never volunteered for anything including volleyball.
My only regret is he only has but one life to give to his country.
Consider him our rebuttal for Britain.
All right, Jeff, my boy.
You may be right.
Here you are, then.
Heh. To Lend Lease.
Will you be needing the car again this evening, sir?
Uh, no.
That will be all.
You're dismissed, sergeant.
Thank you.
Yes, sir. Uh, the usual tonight,
I assume, sir?
Uh, yes, yes.
Yes, of course.
Very good.
You certainly fooled the general's driver.
Yeah.
How's the contact lens we fitted for you?
I had a little bit of difficulty with it at first, sir, but I see out of it wonderfully now.
Oh, good, good.
I was wondering, sir.
Can I have this contact lens after I finish this job?
Don't quite know how we'd be able to get it away from you.
By the way, have you got the spare lens we gave you?
Yes. Yes.
I have it right here.
Where is it?
Don't lose it.
The general's suite
Yes?
Sergeant Twickenham and his bad manners is waiting.
He's been told everything.
Tomorrow you make your
I do?
Launching the Joint
Allied Red Cross with General Zlinkov of the Red Army.
Don't forget
No, I won't, sir.
Go straight upstairs.
No, I won't.
Good night.
Good night.
I said "evening."
Pretty good, huh.
You should have caught me at the airport.
Ahem! Men, we have an enormous job of work to do. the Allied victories there is nothing in the world that we must value as highly as discipline.
Heh, pretty cute, huh?
The resemblance is absolutely astounding, sir.
But if I might suggest?
Head back.
Not too far, sir.
Uh, slight trace of a limp in the left leg.
Wounded in France.
Oh!
No, sir. Paris.
Lady in a spiked heel.
The general was barefoot at the time.
They told me he was married.
Yes, sir. That too.
Lady Margaret, lovely girl.
She's in Canada, you know, on a war savings bond drive.
That's good. I'll have to remember to keep my shoes on.
You forgot your briefcase, sir.
As usual.
Yes. Thank you.
Uh, yes, uh, quite.
Thank you very much.
Good night. Pip, pip.
Cheerio.
Thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.
You may go back to the motor pool, Sergeant.
Beastly night, though, isn't it, sir?
Double beastly, actually.
Well, good night, sergeant.
Carry on. Press on.
Pip, pip.
Tally ho, and, uh, you may fall out.
What?
What's wrong with you?
Of course, Larry.
You're the general.
Yes, of course.
Quite.
I must investigate this absolutely thoroughly.
I think you'll find everything where it should be.
Good night, sergeant.
Good night, general.
Sergeant!
As usual.
Twickenham!
Comman--!
What's wrong with you tonight, darling?
You're acting a little cold, aren't you?
Cold.
Yes, that's what I have.
A beastly...
You had better leave.
You might catch it.
I know a lovely way to break up a cold, Larry or have you forgotten?
You were very distant towards me in the car tonight, darling.
I, uh, hope you're not holding what happened last Thursday PM against me.
Not at all.
Not a bit.
Not a smidgen.
Not a wit.
No, no.
Not even Wednesday AM.
Wednesday AM?
Larry, you mad fool!
Ah, you haven't change a bit, after all, heh.
Do...
Do you really think she has a cure for the common cold?
I wouldn't doubt it for a moment, sir.
That's what my speech is about tomorrow.
I did try to warn you, sir.
Yeah. Well.
Uh, what am I gonna do?
It would be dangerous to arouse suspicion, sir.
After all, the general has got a reputation with the ladies.
I know that, but I'm on a salt-free, fat-free, high-protein, low-calorie low-cholesterol diet.
You better get me out of here.
Tell her anything.
Tell her something.
Tell her
I've, uh, gone to visit a war.
I'm engaged in a secret conference.
Tell her anything.
I've got to get out.
Oh, no, sir.
I once asked her.
It's Lady Margaret, sir.
The general's wife.
Lady Margaret? You told me she's in Canada on a bond tour.
What kind of a war is this, anyway?
I thought we were fighting the Germans.
Hey, you keep Margaret busy.
I'll get rid of Dr. Cronkite.
Sergeant. Sergeant?
Where are you?
Sergeant?
I say, Sergeant, where are you?
STANHOPE:
In here, Larry.
What? Oh!
Ah.
You impetuous beast.
I'm sorry, your baggage.
My wife, you know.
What am I supposed to do?
Out of the bath, into your clothes,
Hm, the usual.
Larry.
Maggie!
I say it's absolutely wizard to have you back, old girl.
Larry!
I--
Don't I do that to you?
I'm terribly sorry. I was absolutely overcome, you see.
Been ghastly lonely, you know.
Just me and Ike and Monty and Charlie de Gaulle.
Larry, you know I don't find you amusing any longer.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a bath
What?
I mean, there's been awful trouble with the plumbing.
I had to pitch in myself, you see.
Do you realize that all the good plumber are in intelligence now?
That, ha, ha...
That's a rather good one.
Rather I'll have it fixed straight away.
Now what, darling?
Oh, you are a bit slower this evening.
Quickly, dear.
On the double.
Oh!
You seem so different.
You've changed.
What's happened to all the passion?
Passion. Poetry.
Yes. Good night.
Good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I say good night till it be morrow.
Oh, Larry!
In dreams
I kiss your hand, madame.
But drink to me only with thine eyes.
I'd be down to get you in a taxi, honey, but you'd better be ready
Yes! Here, dear!
Sorry, I took so long.
I had a bit of difficult, but it's all fixed now.
Eh, dreeded it for.
Uh, drewed it for you.
Difficult language, isn't it?
Oh, capital idea.
Absolutely capital.
Yes.
Uh, I'm a bit fagged out myself.
I think I should turn in myself.
Come over here, Larry.
Come here.
What ever for?
Well, I want to talk to you.
Yes.
How are Toronto Maple Leafs doing this season?
And how is your dear mother?
Gears lock.
Absolutely smashing.
Received a letter only yesterday.
My dear Larry, your mother has been dead for over two years.
Well, the mails are terribly slow these days. and traffic lights and that sort of thing.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Twickenham!
Twickenham!
Your Ladyship.
You'll excuse my forwardness but
I took the liberty of calling
MI-5 military intelligence.
Colonel Somerset's on the line he'll explain everything to you.
Well, I certainly hope so.
Don't let him out of your sight.
I guess
I didn't fool her at all.
Don't worry, sir.
The general never does either.
Larry's where?
Yes, I did return unexpectedly.
Project 402?
Dead Pigeon?
What is this soldier supposed to do?
Now, Colonel Somerset, are you serious?
Does he know this?
He should be told.
Well ,yes, Colonel, if you say it's top secret, not a word.
Poor unfortunate fool.
Uh, her Ladyship.
Ah, sorry, sir.
She'll expect this.
That will be all,
Twickenham.
Ah, yes, my lady.
I'm sorry about all this. or I was supposed to try to convince you I was Larry or--
Oh.
You may put your hands down.
Oh, thank you.
I, uh, wouldn't like to cause any embarrassment.
I could sleep outside on the couch or something.
No, heh, we'll play the game to the hilt.
You sleep in Larry's bed.
He seldom used it anyway.
I still have the gun, soldier.
I hope you'll forgive my being a bit shaky, but, uh,
I mean
I've met a lady, but
I had a peculiar idea that you'd be wearing a crown or coronet or a halo.
Something like that.
Oh, I haven't worn a halo in years.
You could have fooled me.
Lady Margaret, I'm curious about something.
Did I play the part well enough to fool you?
I wouldn't mean permanently, but momentarily when we first met.
Oh, that's when you made your first mistake.
Because Larry hasn't kissed me hello in ages.
He hasn't? he never bothered to hide them from me.
That might be an expression of an inferiority complex.
It could mean that he loves you very much.
I wish I could be as forgiving as that but I came back from Canada to ask Larry to give me a divorce.
War hero or no.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Maybe all he needs is to go and see a psychoanalyst.
I once had an uncle who hated my aunt.
He went to see an analyst every day for six months at $25 a visit.
He learned to love her all over again.
Then he ran out of money, so she divorced him.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this, except that it has absolutely nothing to do with your situation at all.
If you're supposed to have fooled Larry's friends and I presume you are, you've got an awful lot to learn.
You have?
Yes. I've been down to the headquarters, and they've been showing newsreels of him and I've been reading biographies and I've been practicing too.
Yes.
Limping and swagger-sticking.
I ever put a mark on my eye where the patch is supposed to go over, heh.
Larry doesn't need any patch any more than you do.
He doesn't?
It's just that one eye has a tendency to become quite bloodshot after five or six brandies, his usual condition.
I don't like officers like that
They think they're winning the war.
You're winning the war,
Private Williams.
No, not me.
I'm not doing anything much.
I'll be finished in a few days.
I think you'd better get some sleep
Yeah.
Uh, good night,
Your Ladyship.
Good night,
Project 402.
NARRATOR:
Our man from Brooklyn remained a perfect gentleman all night.
( suspenseful theme playing )
What'd I say?
Ah, you said, "My old friend, Marshall Zlinkov.
It's been a long time since those gay old days in Moscow."
Yes, I've got that phrase down pretty pat, but suppose the general asks me something else in Russian.
I can't keep telling him about the gay old days in Moscow.
I shall be on the platform with you, and I shall tap you when you must answer.
Once for nyet, meaning no.
Twice for da, meaning--
Three times for mozhet byt, meaning yes.
We're getting close to the area.
Once for nyet, meaning da.
Once for da. Two nyets for mozhet, meaning--
Here, here. How about a spot of brandy for the nerves?
No, thank you. I don't.
You don't happen to have any yogurt in there?
Yeah.
None.
You better have the brandy yourself. Ah, twice for yeah.
I get out of the car and everybody cheers.
I step on the platform.
Everybody cheers.
I deliver the speech.
Everybody cheers.
I get back in the car, and they go out of their minds, cheering, heh.
We're here.
Ah, Twig, we're here.
Ah, Twickenham.
It's no time to fall asleep.
I've got to remember the nyets and the--
Twickenham!
Twickenham, say something.
Take him out.
Hurry, they're cheering you.
What's the matter?
Yes, yes.
Poor Twickenham.
High blood pressure.
And a touch of malaria.
Malaria, I believe.
But he had such a good complexion.
But he also had cirrhosis of the liver and a weak heart.
Cirrhosis.
You never know who's gonna go next, do you?
Sometimes you do.
You take care of him.
Go on. They're waiting.
Good luck.
Uh, maybe if he'd been on a fat-free--
I don't think that would have helped.
Look, I can't go out there.
Look at that crowd.
You've got to.
You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time.
But the first fellow who said that was shot.
MAN ( over PA ):
May I welcome you on behalf of the United States Army.
 Also on behalf of our distinguished visitors,
 Marshall Gregory Zlinkov of the Army of the Soviet Union,
 General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith
 of the British General Staff.
We gather here on the eve of the invasion.
You men will spearhead the attack and rest assured in the knowledge that today as we launch a new drive for the plasma that will bring to the floor--
Tovarish, doctor.
General MacKenzie-Smith, you speak the marshal's language.
Would you explain to your old friend
We're not taking any blood samples.
I believe he said this reminds him of the gay old days in Moscow.
I say, what are they doing there?
Da.
MAN:
Hero.
Carry on.
Men, we have further good news.
After intensive research, the medical corps of the United States Army is passing along to its allies
Those two enemies of seaborne landings mild burn exposure have finally been conquered.
One shot of serum D-104, and seasickness becomes an old wives' tale.
We have also developed S-604, a new anti-influenza vaccine.
Gentlemen, never has the army had two such distinguished guinea pigs.
Not at all.
Ready? Oh, yes.
Uh, pardon me.
Ah, no, sir.
These are in the arm.
Oh, terribly sorry.
I say, do be gentle.
Thank you.
Uh...
Molodets, heh.
Men of the invasion forces, the hero of Dunkirk,
El Alamein and Tobruk,
General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie-Smith.
As you are, men.
Men... no longer the discomfort of seasickness.
As you men are the spearhead of the invasion disembarked from your landing craft, you will be so healthy and so fit that your condition will come as a complete surprise to the German army.
And so I say to our gallant allies, hip, hip.
Achoo! Pardon.
Let me hip, hip, achoo.
I'm afraid
I'm not much of a cook, but this is the best
I could do without Twickenham.
Twickenham.
That was the fastest case of cirrhosis I've ever seen in my whole life.
What about that stray bullet that knocked my hat off?
Boy, that was really close.
You'd better eat properly.
I'm supposed to ride through
Trafalgar Square in an open car.
They want me to sit up on the back so that the people can see me when they cheer.
I'm a symbol, you know.
You're a target.
A target.
A sitting duck.
Do you know what the code name for you is?
German Secret Service has been trying to kill my husband and you've been set up to take his place.
No, no. He's going to Yugoslavia to open a second front.
All the English troops are going to Yugoslavia because he said that when he went to Yugoslavia, all the troops would be able to be able to attack behind the Danube.
Dead Pigeon?
Do you know why we're giving that party tonight for the officers of
Larry's old regiment?
No. You mean the MacKenzie
First Highlanders? No.
They've learned that the chief agent
And tonight, they've invited everyone they suspect of wanting to kill you.
I'm sorry. I'm getting out of here right now.
I'm turning in my eye patch, sir. And my mustache.
I figured out your whole cold-blooded scheme.
Pretty clever, wasn't it?
If they don't get me at the party, at Trafalgar Square.
You can have your pips back.
I'd rather be a private in the front lines under fire from shot and shell, sir.
Don't take that literally, too, sir.
I'm sorry, Colonel Somerset.
I suppose I've broken security but I couldn't let you do it to him.
That's all right.
I understand how you feel, of course but it's a matter of military necessity.
But there's been a change in the situation.
Why? Are they switching to knives?
No.
I'm sorry to have to break this news to you, under these circumstances.
What's wrong,
Colonel Somerset?
The aircraft that was taking
General MacKenzie-Smith supposedly to Yugoslavia was in point of fact headed for invasion headquarters in Kent.
He was going a roundabout route to confuse the enemy.
It was, I regret to say,
Everybody lost, including
I'm afraid, your husband.
You have my very deepest sympathy, Lady Margaret.
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you.
I'm all right.
It's strange that at a time like this you only remember the good moments.
So you understand our strategy has completely changed.
The sad death of
General MacKenzie Smith will delay the second front for weeks.
You must be at the party tonight for the general's old regiment.
Even though you think somebody at the party is going to try to knock me off?
We're sure of it, but this will make the whole thing work.
When they expose themselves, that will give us opportunity of breaking the spy ring.
I see. Before or after they try to kill me?
Oh, before, naturally, heh.
We hope.
Oh, look, sir.
I like to go to parties, but I'd like to go home afterwards.
Under the circumstances,
Williams, the decision must be yours.
This is not an order.
Oh. well, in that case--
But you must realize thousands of Allied lives may depend upon you.
We have no right to ask you to commit what might be suicide.
Well, in that case--
But the whole of the
United States Army is at stake.
Williams, what do you say?
Help!
Don't forget for a moment that you're in danger.
Be careful.
Heh.
Don't trust anyone.
Um, ahem.
Remember, if you want to convince them you're really Larry.
Fine.
How's it going, vicar?
At the end of the evening you'll get boring drunk.
And you and I must have a large family brawl.
How do you do?
We may even strike each other.
You must try.
How do you do?
Mm-hm?
If anything happens to me tonight,
I want you to know these have been nicest two days
I've ever had in my whole life.
Mm-hm.
MAN: And there he was
General Biff Browningham with only one chukka to play.
And I.
Pardon me.
Excuse me. Who's the gentleman that just arrived in?
Oh.
He was in the
MacKenzie Highlanders.
Just an acquaintance of Larry's -Mm-hm.
Been in the Middle East.
Hmm.
Well, that's good because
I couldn't stand all details.
MAN:
A drink, your ladyship?
No, thank you.
Um, look here, sergeant.
WOMAN: That's General
Brown Wiffingham.
Commanding South Hampton
Staging Area.
Oh, yes. I recognize him from the regimental photo.
Uh, we're supposed to be very good chaps.
And he calls me, oh, um, he calls me Binky, and I call him Puffy.
Puffy.
It's kind of nauseating.
Isn't it?
Well, you're very fond of him.
But you're not crazy about him.
Oh.
Binky, heh!
Hello, Penelope.
How are all the children?
Didn't you get my letter from New Delhi?
Oh, yes.
That was too bad.
What is too bad?
I mean,
I was absolutely overjoyed.
About what?
Em, eh, I save stamps, you know.
You can have you head blown off and still say something witty.
Have your head blown off?
Oh.
Good evening.
It's a pleasure,
Lady Margaret.
I don't think you or the general know my wife.
How do you do?
Head blown off.
We intercepted a radio message.
They've changed their plan.
I don't know what they're trying now.
No, no, no, no.
Uh, I'm following it up.
Nothing could possibly happen.
Oh.
I know everything about everybody.
Oh, my dear.
Now, what can we do for you, eh?
What would you like?
Oh, the usual.
WOMAN: Good heavens.
Lady Vivian.
I was hoping she wouldn't find out about the party.
She'll ruin everything.
Come on. Let's meet her.
Yes.
Yes?
What have you got to say for yourself?
Head blown off.
Oh, Aunt Vivian,
I'm so sorry.
Larry's favorite aunt and I forgot to invite you.
Yes. A complete oversight, but my apologies, dear auntie.
Auntie?
You've never referred to me as auntie.
I didn't?
Old Iron Drawers was the kindest word
Yes. Iron Drawers.
I know this was a deliberate slight.
It wasn't at all,
Auntie Drawers.
I mean the Larry, what's wrong with you?
Wrong with me? There's nothing wrong at all.
You know when I walk into a room your eye always twitches.
You see there I finally managed to over come it.
I don't twitch at all now that.
There's something strange about you.
I can't quite put my finger on it.
Well, you see,
Iron Drawers, I mean auntie,
I'm not quite myself tonight.
Oh, I have noticed improvement.
( stammering ):
Yes. I, uh, um...
A drink?
Well, I can't have.
Where's the bar?
What's wrong?
My contact lens.
She knocked it out.
No. Who are you?
Head blown off.
Must have gone under the table. -Everybody's looking.
Drop your earrings so we can go after it.
My goodness. I lost my hearing. -Oh, you clumsy fool.
You've dropped your earring?
Oh, where's the table?
Left rudder, you fool.
Pss. Pss. Pss.
Puss, come on.
Give me that lens.
I'll buy you a monocle.
Would you gimme. Gimme.
Pss. Pss. Pss. Pss.
What are you?
A German spy?
There you are.
Did you find it?
Where's the other contact lens?
But wait a minute.
There's a car in the street blinking its light and I think it's a signal of some kind.
Don't worry. I'll see to it.
Go and get the lens first.
You join the others.
Yes. I will.
Oh, good heavens. The cat.
Ooh.
No.
Where have you been all this time?
I have your drink ready.
No, but I'm not thirsty actually.
Yes.
A toast?
Eh, to the king.
ALL:
To the king. God bless him.
I shall be going back there then.
Come back.
God bless him.
I've forgotten, sir.
Eh, favorite what?
Why Captain Patterson, everyone knows Sir Lawrence only smokes these.
Eh.
Binky, you always had the finest taste in cigars and women.
Another toast.
To the, uh, regiment.
No.
To the regiment.
You have to sing something.
Okay.
The regimental song,
Larry.
Don't you remember it, sir?
Of course I do.
Yes. He always leads us into it.
Come on, love.
♪ Drink a toast ♪
A toast, Larry.
To the regiment!
ALL:
To the regiment!
To the regiment.
ALL:
To the regiment!
I tell you.
I think he's marvelous.
Yes. Isn't he?
Gracious heaven.
Larry! Larry!
( woman speaking indistinctly )
Stop, Larry! Stop!
You're making a travesty of the regiment.
And of our native land.
One thing you never made fun of,
Larry, was Scotland.
Well, look at me.
What?
There's something strange going on.
WOMAN:
Do you know what I think?
I think you're not even--
Not even sober.
Larry. How can you disgrace me like this?
Night after night?
Look here old girl.
I've had about enough of this.
I'll drink how I want,
Oh!
You sober fish wife.
No, I.
How dare you do that to me!
( crowd speaking indistinctly )
Ooh, that's our Larry, all right.
One thing Scotland knows how to make and that's whiskey. and you missed me and you hit Lady Vivian.
No, I was cheating.
I could see a little.
Heh, and what was the last thing I hit you with?
( in low voice):
The cat.
Yes.
Uh, is your eye all right?
Oh, no.
No, it's quite all right.
Just like old times.
Em, do you know that song I coughed tonight?
Yes.
It, eh, it's very much like a song we used to sing in the 4h grade.
Well, that's quite possible.
Many of these old Scottish heroes were used over the years with different person.
How did it go back in the 4th grade?
I wonder
If I can remember it.
♪ When the fine mist of
Scotland ♪
♪ Is over the land ♪
♪ I am dreaming of making
And remembering when ♪

Why not?
Well, it was all right before,
I don't think I should sleep in this room.
That doesn't make any sense at all.
It's not supposed to.
MacKenzie Smith here.
Oh, hello,
Colonel Somerset.
Well, that's wonderful.
Fine.
Good work. Yeah.
Well, I think they've got their man.
Tomorrow at this time, they think I'll be able to back to being
Private Ernie Williams again.
Just a minute.
Will you tell me something?
Do you want to go back to being Private Ernie Williams?
You can get used to almost anything.
Sorry. Go find a louse.
Yes. the entire show magnificently. would ever have been.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not as brave as Larry
I'd be brave enough to do what I really want to do.
And what do you really want to do?
But I'm too much of a coward to do that.
This.
ERNIE:
Who is it?
Sergeant Stanhope, sir.
An urgent message from Major Houston.
Ernie.
The eye patch.
The moustache.
Thank you, sergeant.
Hmm.
Ordered to headquarters immediately.
The car's waiting down below with the major, sir.
I'll be down directly.
Thank you, sergeant. Press on.
Well, I guess they got him. and the general's eye patch and the general's wife.
Well, for taking advantage of the situation just now.
I, uh, I guess we both had a little too much to drink.
Oh, uh, would you do me a great favor?
Of course.
Well, after the war, if you ever get to Brooklyn,
Yes?
Don't look me up.
Nobody'll ever believe it.
I say, this is silly bother, scurrying about at night like a ruddy obstetrician.
I'll wager there's no emergency at all.
Would you care to risk a fiver?
Three sheets of the wind, eh?
Aw, what you need, young man, is some, uh, tomato juice, raw egg,
Worcestershire sauce and...
Head blown off.
I say, the Major is dead.
Uh, would you stop...
The Major...
I say. Would you...
Uh, the Major is quite dead, you know.
I say. Would you stop...
Uh, look, the man...
Well, here, please.
You're out of uniform.
Uh, um...
The Major is quite...
Say something.
Say something else.
Don't attempt to escape or the Major will have company. but not quite clever enough.
You'll never get away with this.
I say, Stanhope, turn the car around.
Not tonight, General.
But if you turn the car around,
I'd promise you the usual.
I hated every minute of it.
Good show there.
NARRATOR:
I never suspected her for a moment. This is terrible.
Welcome to Berlin,
General MacKenzie Smith.
You are now the guest of the Third Reich.
Now, all we wish is a little information.
And we shall see that you are given a charming house in the country, servants, wine, frauleins.
Whatever you may wish.
And you will be able to sit out the rest of the war in complete comfort.
All we ask is that you tell us the truth.
MAN: Precisely.
You see, uh,
I'm an American soldier and my name is Private First
Class Ernie Williams, serial number, uh, 347236.
And I was supposed to go back to America because my mother is very sick.
Only she isn't very sick.
She's in Miami Beach with a bathing--
Oh! Oh!
What happened to the house in the country?
My dear General, you have a reputation for playing games.
We have not.
Unless you answer our questions honestly and quickly, we will have no alterative but to order you shot.
Oh!
MAN;
And we are waiting to hear it.
You see this eye patch?
MAN:
Oh. General.
And, uh, look at that moustache.
Oh. What ha...
Ugh. Must be the glue.
It got stuck in the sea air.
You see I haven't had it off for a few days.
Forget it . It's mine.
But you simply have to believe how it all got started.
You see, I was doing imitations for a couple of the fellas.
And uh, heh, I do imitations, you see.
Well, look. Maybe I can explain it to you better.
We survive them on the beaches.
We survive them in the villages.
We will never surrender.
Uh, I got a better one.
Oh, when the saints--
Ahem. Well, maybe this one will do it.
I got a real good one here.
We have, hmm...
ALL:
Heil Hitler!
Oh. Well, I...
Heh, nobody seems to like that one.
MAN:
General MacKenzie Smith.
Perhaps you do not understand us.
You have vital information on the timing and location of the second front.
I have?
But because of your respect for you,
I do not with to see you reduced to a shattered hulk of a man.
MAN:
Are you trying to make us believe
That's right. It was all a phony and you fellas fell for it.
You see this grey stuff they put in my hair?
It washes out with soap and water.
Look. I'll show you.
I told them it was no good.
I have to touch it up every night.
Even in the rain it comes out.
Here. I'll show you.
Maybe they used a new brand
It...
Oh, it's me.
I've turned white.
See you've done it.
Poisoning Twickenham and that shot through my head and, uh, the submarine.
Oh, if you fellas only knew what I've been through.
Oh, you do know.
Don't you?
It is only the beginning my dear, General.
Take him away.
Throw him in a cell.
Use the usual methods.
Not the usual.
MAN:
One more thing.
Our operatives in England are everywhere.
You understand?
Everywhere.
And they are led by a man so highly placed
British intelligence would never suspect.
It is not only your life that is in jeopardy.
But that of your wife.
Lady Margaret.
Heil Hitler.
You'll never get away...
NARRATOR:
The news spread through
 the German high command like wildfire.
 MacKenzie Smith had broken down
 and agreed to talk
 after being tortured continuously
 for three solid minutes.
MAN:
Good evening here, General.
Let us get this filthy business over with.
MAN:
This is a great moment for the Third Reich.
We have broken
MacKenzie Smith.
Heh, this will please the Fuehrer immensely.
I presume, gentlemen, he will go into his dance again.
Be careful, general.
May I remind you once more.
We have many operatives in England. Many of them.
The one who leads them is a very good friend of your family.
And of your wife.
It doesn't matter.
She will be safe enough.
If you talk.
Now, here, General.
We have here a most interesting map.
England, German, France.
All military objectives carefully indicated.
You shall be the professor and we will be your willing students.
The time, the location and the strength of the allied invasion.
Gentlemen, when I finish you will know as much about this blasted invasion as I do.
Perhaps even more.
Sorry. I was carried away, old chap.
Uh, bit of tear in the eye and that sort of thing.
I say, it's a bit of a blur to realize
ERNIE: Righto.
Well, a concentration of troops in Southern England actually is a ruse, you see.
Uh, we shall do the main attack in the soft underbelly of Monte Carlo, right here.
You see. I say.
Surprise, eh?
Caught you on a sticky wicket. What?
Well, you see actually, um, mm, right here is where we're going to a small attack of naval vessels.
The LCTs, the BBDs, the LSMFTs, the IRT and the CIO and the, uh, SMFR are our IUT.
What artillery? What infantry?
Who are their commanders?
What are their immediate objectives?
Okay.
Write this down over there.
I shall tell you in a minute.
You see, Captain, Brigadier
General, Father Ingrad,
( gibbering ): the Argyle Highlanders, have taken the largest one of the troops as a haven for...
And of course, there's...
Tech here, which, hmm, of course will terminate at the edge or tip.
And here, regarding the subways, they will have a remarkable incentive, and, of course, the troops are all employed and all the frontal assault which have nothing...
I suppose they...
Busy...
Than bottom, you see.
What have I done to England?
I simply can't go on.
Control yourself, General.
You are a military man as we are.
We didn't understand a word.
It doesn't matter.
Above all the signal.
Which signal do you mean?
Do not pretend, General.
Counter intelligence has told us a signal is to be broadcast over the BBC two days before D Day.
A meaningless phrase.
To the French underground to announce the date of the invasion.
I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey.
And the hour.
The hour of the attack?
You'd better be ready about half past eight.
We'll be ready.
I wish I could be there when the band starts playing.
But you won't.
If I had a gun,
I would shoot myself.
It's the only decent way left.
 Einen moment.
 Einen moment.

NARRATOR:
The German notes on this point were somewhat fragmentary.
 But bear in mind that Sigmund
Freud came from this country.
MAN:
Fraulein Lilly.
Oh!
I have to start the machine.
ERNIE ( speaking in English ):
Stop! Stop! Let me outta here.
Just in time.
Don't shoot. Oh.
( Ernie speaking indistinctly )
Sir, we've captured a German paratrooper attempting to infiltrate this headquarters.
He's demanded the right to see the commanding officer personally.
MAN:
Very well. Bring him in.
Bring in the prisoner.
Heh, Puffy!
Puffy, am I glad to see you.
All right.
I'll talk to the prisoner.
Prisoner? Puffy, don't you know me? I'm Binky.
ERNIE: I'm not really Binky.
Ernie. Yes. Private First Class
Ernie Williams.
Heh, I fooled you.
I fooled the Germans.
Heh, call Somerset.
He'll tell you.
Wilson. This seems to be a top secret matter.
I'd like to get to the bottom of this alone.
Dismissed.
Oh, Puffy, if you know what I've been through.
I've been in submarines, airplanes. I've been in Berlin.
I've even been at the Gestapo headquarters.
Know what I did?
I stole some of the papers out of the secret files naming all the agents in England.
People you would never suspect.
I've got them right here.
General Carleton Brown
Wiffingham. Sergeant, er...
General Carleton Brown...
Yes, my dear
Private Williams.
If that is who you are!
You'll never get away with this, Puffy.
Um, hello?
Open up, please, sentry.
Urgent.
I'm sorry, sir. You can't enter this headquarters.
Colonel Somerset is general staff.
He has my identification.
I'm sorry, sir.
Where's the Sergeant of the Guards?
This is a matter of life and death, Sergeant.
Open up, please.
Sorry, sir.
All entry permits have been cancelled for the day.
Orders of
General Brown Wiffingham.
We've had
General Brown Wiffingham under surveillance for weeks.
Wilson!
Hold that man.
The whole project, the Dead Pigeon.
Or I will be.
Yeah, hello?
This German paratrooper is masquerading as an allied soldier.
Under the king's rules and regulations he is guilty of espionage and subject to immediate execution.
CARLETON:
Wilson, the penalty for insubordination is still the same. Take that spy out and have him shot.
Shot? Uh...
But Puffy, you and I played
Rukka together for Scotland.
Ah, the MacKenzie Smith
Highlanders.
WILSON:
Firing squad is ready, sir.
Dismissed.
No. Not you.
Maybe she's forgotten who I am.
You will tell her, won't you?
I mean you'll tell her that
I wasn't scared at all.
I'll get word to Lady Margaret.
Cigarette?
No. No, thank you.
But I don't think one could hurt me.
Match?
That won't be necessary.
Prepare to aim!
Squad ready!
Aim!
Just a minute. I think I will have that blind fold.
WILSON:
Squad rest. Rest. Rest!
Uh, not too tight.
I get dizzy. See?
Squad ready! Aim!
MAN ( over radio ):
It is only fitting
 that Britain today should do honor
 to the valiant heroes
 who have made this day possible.
 are already familiar to you.
 General Eisenhower forthwith...
Good afternoon,
Lay Margaret.
Lovely day for England.
Huh? Thank you, madam.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you before.
Security reasons.
Anyhow we dashed down to the South Hampton staging area hoping to get there on time.
By jove, that's a pretty dress you've got on.
Never mind about the dress.
We were held up at the gate.
The firing party had raised their rifles.
I heard the command,
Yes?
Good Lord.
I'd love a cup of tea.
Oh, yes. Oh, tea.
Yes.
And what then?
Um, some milk and sugar if I may, please.
Private Williams.
Oh, yes.
Yeah. He's absolutely fine.
We only got there in the nick of time.
It was a bit of a do.
Where is he?
When can I see him?
How many lumps you put in here?
He can see you any time.
He's at the base hospital.
Not much matter with him.
Just shock and fatigue and the after effects of smoking.
( man speaking indistinctly over radio )
Wonder if you'd mind if I turned up your radio.
MAN ( over radio ):
General Sir Lawrence
MacKenzie Smith.
The architect of the invasion.
 The master planner
 whom we had believed killed
 in performance of his duties,
 actually survived
 and was taken prisoner by the Nazis.
 I rejoice along with all of England
 that he was liberated in the first among...
MARGARET:
Larry.
We've just heard the news that--
Yes. I know.
Do try to control your joyous hysteria at my return from the grave, Maggie.
I know how pleased you are to see me.
Oh, sir, Lawrence, you can't even begin to realize--
Oh, come off it,
Somerset.
You were just as pleased to see me
Oh, no, please, please.
Lawrence.
Will you get out of here!
I have a few matters of a very intimate nature to discuss with my dearly beloved.
You may listen at the keyhole.
If you'll pardon me,
I'm going over to the enemy.
Heil Hitler!
I see you haven't lost your charming ways with your subordinates.
I hear you haven't either, my dear.
What's this I hear about you and that American private?
It's all true.
Oh, come now.
A penniless common soldier.
A complete nonentity.
I've had my fill of entities.
Next thing you'll be saying you're in love with the blighter.
I am in love with the blighter.
Heh.
How did you manage?
I mean, how...
Well, look, you see.
They wanted to give me a medal, but all I asked for was a smart technician from the Signal Corp with a recorder and a microphone.
That's why you heard what you did on the radio.
General Lawrence
McKenzie Smith, the architect of the invasion, the master planner.
Did you mean it?
And I had you fooled every minute.
Every minute.

Prostitute, harlot, strumpet.
Harumi is one in Tianjin.
There she fell in love
with a Japanese man.
She loved him with all her heart
and hoped to marry him someday.
But the man she loved
brought a bride back from Japan.
Tomoda is my man!
If you don't go back to Japan right now, I'll kill you!
Tomoda isn't here. He's out.
I know how you feel, so I came to apologize to you.
Look, Harumi.
You're the only one I really love.
My getting married doesn't mean a thing.
The relationship between you and me hasn't changed.
Leave that woman... or I'll kill you.
Hey, mister.
When will we get there?
It makes me feel scared.
Since we left Tianjin, all we've seen is nothing. That's all.
Four billion people wait for us in China.
When do they start business?
- Tonight, they said.
- I see.
I'll get a special pass and be the first one to have a go.
She already said okay.
Hey, sis, how about me?
No, you're after me.
I don't care.
As long as I get my turn.
Disgusting.
Those mountain soldiers are like beasts.
They're just hungry for women.
This isn't Tianjin, you know.
How many women you got there?
You three make seven.
Kiminoya has six. All together, 13.
Just 13 to take care of a whole battalion?
They look strong.
The men in Tianjin can't compete with these soldiers.
I want to throw my body against lots of different men.
Nakahira!
Ohashi!
What are you going to do?
I can't stand this dangerous place.
I've only got one life.
Are you gonna walk all the way back to Tianjin?
It's better than dying.
Harumi, let's go.
I'm not going.
I've got no other place to live.
Damn! Isn't that the village of Airoson?
Yes, sir.
We've got to kill some men and set an example.
Look how they act like nothing's happened.
"If road damage, wire damage or minefields are not reported immediately, the responsible parties will be severely punished."
Good thing you weren't hurt.
The soldiers in Buken wouldn't be happy if anything happened to you.
Which company do you belong to?
- Battalion headquarters, sir.
- Going to general headquarters?
No. I was just released from the hospital in Peking, sir.
You were in the hospital?
You look pale.
Where were you hurt?
The left thigh.
I got it in the bone, sir.
- In which battle?
- The Joshachin attack, sir.
You must have been slow.
In another hour, we'll say good-bye to you girls.
SUNRISE PALACE
Most of the soldiers come here when they're off duty.
Almost the entire battalion will come.
An entire battalion.
A thousand men.
So that means I get a hundred.
I wonder if I can handle them all.
Look at us. We're still alive.
You'll find one you like, too.
How do you find time for that?
It's all in how you look at it.
We don't take it all so seriously.
It's the only way to handle it.
That was Takako, and the other two were Midori and Tsuyuko.
This place is like a washing place for the soldiers.
When the dirty stuff piles up, they come here to wash their minds and bodies.
When they leave here, they're as good as new.
And where do we do our washing?
Yuriko is crazy about washing.
It's the only time she's happy.
You mean real washing?
There's a river back there.
Plenty of water.
New girls?
Definitely Tianjin girls, all right.
Pretty good-Iooking.
Sergeant, please.
He's in charge of the Kempei troop.
He helps us a lot.
Be nice to him.
How do you do?
Hey, are you from northern Japan?
I'm from Miyagi Prefecture.
- Where is that?
- The village of Kurigoma.
Kurigoma. I'm from Ichinoseki.
Really?
They're right next to each other.
We must get together and talk.
Yes, let's do that.
Yuriko, you're lucky.
Rest today.
Tomorrow you start working.
What time do we start?
From 1:00 to 4:00 p.m., soldiers.
From 5:00 to 8:00 p.m., noncoms.
From 8:00 p.m. on, officers.
And Kempei Sergeant Akiyama is treated as an officer, understand?
Master, I'll start right now.
Who is it?
I've got a customer in here.
Never mind that! Open up!
What's all this about?
Stop that!
You'll break the door!
Who the devil are you?
Open up, you idiot!
Who are you calling an idiot?
- Don't get mad.
- Shut up and go away!
Are you the new one called Harumi?
I'm here for some fun.
- No. I've got a customer in here.
- Who is it?
Hey, get up!
Oh, it's you.
Adjutant.
You've had enough.
It's my turn.
I'm leaving with the detachment tomorrow, sir.
I don't know when I can get a pass again, sir.
I'll call you back soon.
Get out.
You don't have to go.
What could you want with an "idiot" like me? And I don't want you either.
Don't go!
Idiot?
A whore mustn't talk like that.
Don't you call me a whore!
Would the emperor use words like that?
They always say that officers repeat the emperor's words.
How dare your filthy mouth speak the emperor's name!
- I'm leaving, sir.
- All right.
You bastard!
Good morning.
What's that? Look at the sun.
It's right above your head.
Is Harumi still sleeping?
How can she sleep like that?
Just looking at a bed makes me sick.
Our bodies are all we have.
We can't afford to ruin them.
They've already been ruined.
Coming to northern China and selling our bodies.
Sakae, take that off.
Take it off!
The adjutant came to Harumi's place last night, you know.
He was drunk, as usual.
He chased Sergeant Kuramochi out.
Is this adjutant that important?
He's so brutal, always abusing his power.
He treats the soldiers like animals and treats us like dogs in the street.
He's more vulgar than the privates.
But you like it every time he comes.
You're crazy.
I hate to admit it, but every time he touches me,
I go out of my mind.
What? Is it time already?
Dismissed!
Hey, I'm going to Kiminoya.
Thank you very much.
How do you do?
Hey, get me a cigarette.
Yes.
The adjutant is coming tonight.
Don't take any other customers.
I'm not the adjutant's girl.
Tell him not to order me around.
Whether I take customers is my own business.
Are you the adjutant's orderly?
Do you think I'm filthy?
I said do you think I'm filthy?
You are not filthy, ma'am.
That bootlicker looked at me as if I were filthy.
Since I joined the military, you're the first to ever express your hatred towards me.
But when I take you in my arms, you turn affectionate.
You're a strange woman.
I hate myself for it.
There's a soldier who's like that.
He hates me but obeys me like a dog, because he's been taught a military man must obey in everything.
Look at my orderly... - Mikami.
He's a perfectly tamed dog.
He'll do anything I tell him to do.
He's the model soldier.
You'd better not offend me either.
I have the absolute power of the military.
You have no idea what that is, so just follow me around, wagging your tail.
Idiot!
What do you think a sword is?
I'm sorry, sir.
Those clear eyes.
Damn.
If I could make him
go against the adjutant.
Just watch.
I'll tear your power to shreds.
What's the matter?
You're bleeding.
It's nothing.
Stop being the perfect soldier.
If you do, you'll always be his orderly.
It's stupid to die in this war.
The brigade staff officer is coming.
The CO wants to see you, sir.
Hey, you.
How come you always look at me
as if I were filthy or something?
Am I that dirty?
If I am, what's it to you?
I hate your eyes.
What do you think I am?
Soldiers wag their tails and come to me.
Even that adjutant. If I weren't good, he wouldn't come to me.
Tell me: What am I?
What am I?
A dog? A pig?
Say I'm a pig... - I don't care.
I'll act like a pig!
What are you doing?
Get away from me!
Don't mock me!
Don't mock me!
What's this?
Hitting a woman?
Beating a woman... - is that what a man does?
You lecher.
You want to be Harumi's lover?
She has the adjutant.
You don't stand a chance!
It's not true!
Count off!
One is on guard duty,
and one is on KP.
Salute! Eyes left!
Salute!
Salute!
I'll explain the plan.
As Colonel Shibata said, the Hachiro army is becoming very active in this area.
In this region especially, guerilla activities are increasing.
To put a stop to this, we've decided to send a detachment.
How many men?
Two squads.
Just two squads
can't do much in an emergency.
Excuse me, sir, but our purpose is to determine whether the Hachiro army is there.
Two squads are sufficient for that.
You're drunk.
The adjutant will be here all night.
What's the matter?
I have a headache.
You'd better rest.
Listen to me: You should rest.
You'd better lie down for a while.
You coldhearted man!
You're shivering.
You've never had a woman before.
Forget about the adjutant.
No. How could I do something like this?
It's all right.
You've shown me true happiness.
I love you.
When you hit me and I saw the anger in your eyes,
I realized I was in love with you.
I truly love you.
What are you doing here so early in the morning?
He comes for the adjutant at first call.
I see. A hard worker.
Don't tell the adjutant you saw me here.
See you later.
What's wrong?
Why aren't you going?
You'll make him suspicious.
Sergeant, when are the new men coming?
New men?
Oh, you're in your second year here.
Yes, but if new men don't come,
I'll remain at the lowest rank.
Be patient.
Our country is having a hard time now.
The entire nation is fighting.
They're saying,
"We want nothing but victory."
Remember, officers are not fighting the war. We are.
Unless the noncoms and soldiers are strong, we can't win.
Welcome back.
Hey, probationary officer, welcome back.
How about a drink?
No, thanks.
Uno, won't you drink with me?
I'll drink with you, but not today.
DIDEROT'S PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHTS
You don't have to do that.
Uno, do it yourself.
Philosophy.
Isn't that a communist book?
No, it's not.
Don't try to fool me or you'll be in trouble.
You were an officer once, but now you're only a private. Understand?
Yes.
You were demoted for anti-military ideas.
You should have been court-martialed, but the commander helped you out.
Sergeant...
I was not afraid to be court-martialed.
The commander was just saving his own reputation.
You needn't feel sorry for me either.
Just court-martial me.
What are you saying?
I've been ordered to keep a close eye on you.
Remember that your life is in my hands.
Where are you going?
If the patrol finds you here, you'll go to prison.
That's right.
You're a strange man.
Let me read.
This is the only place I can relax.
You know, Uno,
I think I'll go to the detachments.
In the detachments, they'll pay me the same amount that a Japanese woman gets.
I wish they gave me the same amount here.
I know it's dangerous, but my debts are growing.
Are you leaving?
- Yes.
Wait a minute.
It's all clear.
You're the only one who pays me the same amount as a Japanese woman.
Thank you very much.
- Is the adjutant up?
- I tried to wake him, but it's no use.
Try again, please.
I must show him that telegram now.
Now or later, it doesn't matter.
Hold me.
But you were with the adjutant just now.
So what? The reason I take him is because I want to see you.
Hold me.
But when I think of the adjutant...
I told you to forget about him.
What's the adjutant?
He can drop dead.
Aren't you jealous?
Don't you hate him?
He's a high-ranking officer.
No matter what he does...
I feel nothing.
So you feel nothing, no matter what I do with him?
Don't you feel anything?
No.
I can't help it.
Reporting for service, sir!
Coward!
You're a coward!
Why don't you hate him, despise him, kill him?
Are you a man?
I don't understand.
I only know your body.
I can't understand what's in your mind.
Mikami!
Don't go, please!
Mikami!
Fool!
Why didn't you wake me?
An orderly has his duty!
Our detachment was attacked!
Please send this to my father.
I don't want the military to inspect it.
Going on another punitive expedition?
I'm leaving with the advance squad.
The main force leaves tomorrow.
It's quiet.
It might be a trap.
Shall we wait for a while and see?
We don't have time. Let's go.
Mikami.
Sergeant Major Kuramochi!
All ammunition and weapons are gone.
Damn!
They attacked at 2200 hours last night.
The battle lasted two hours.
The inhabitants were evacuated before the battle started.
At least they died in battle.
If the Hachiro army captures you alive, they'll torture you to death.
Salute Sergeant Major Kuramochi and his 26 soldiers!
You informed on them!
I'll teach you a lesson!
A deserter!
Go over there!
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
Harumi, which side do you take?
I see you're all here.
A present for you.
We can't take men all day long, you know!
What are you talking about so seriously?
Marriage?
Sachiko is... -
Has anyone looked inside Sachiko's suitcase?
No.
Guess what's inside.
Spoons, a knife, a cutting board and some cups.
So she's been planning this.
That's right.
Wonderful.
So she finally decided?
If she needs money, let's all put some up.
Here.
How I envy her.
Thank you, but a Kempei is an unpopular role.
I honestly think you're lucky to be a Kempei.
Why is that?
Because you don't have to go on punitive expeditions.
When are they coming back?
You must be worried about Corporal Mikami.
What?
You know about that?
If I can't find out who loves whom among 12 or 13 girls,
I can't be a Kempei.
Muraki, I wonder if he's safe.
My lovers all die in battle.
When are they coming back?
You see, no one marries a pioneer's son.
My son's getting old now.
At his age, if he can't find a wife,
I feel sorry for him.
I heard someone else married a girl from this kind of place.
It's all right if you pay her debts, but will Sachiko make a good wife?
Master, the soldiers are coming back!
The master will never understand how much we want to get married.
Muraki!
Muraki, where are you?
- Muraki is dead.
- Idiot! I'm still alive.
Harumi, I'll hold you tonight.
Wait for me.
Now we can drink all we want.
I really miss white sake.
Harumi, you look excited.
I'll see you later.
Letting Uno desert in spite of
your order was strictly my fault.
Uno is dead.
On the road or killed by the Hachiro army. Don't worry.
Private Uno died in battle.
That will do.
"To the country which doesn't allow ideals, farewell."
If it takes you too long
To make yourself pretty
Your guests will grow impatient
Jealous?
Too bad. He's a captain.
Don't be stupid.
I know I can't please you like Harumi, but please let me try.
You coldhearted man!
I went to meet you, but you wouldn't even look at me.
Do you realize how I worried about you?
Stop it!
One more word and
I'll never come to your place.
Harumi!
Where did Harumi go?
Reporting for service, sir!
- Bring me some water.
- Yes, sir.
I may be tough, but tonight I'm really exhausted.
Mikami, remember this:
Women get really hot if you keep them waiting.
Here's your water, sir.
Go get some sleep.
Keep in step!
Squad, halt!
Sentry relief.
Situation normal.
Hey! She's not here!
Hmm...
She was drunk and felt sick.
What's so funny?
It's the first time you've acted brave.
You know, at first I took you just to spite the adjutant.
I wanted to ruin you.
But now I'm the one who's ruined.
I don't want to let you go!
Halt!
What's your unit?
Speak up!
Harumi, I heard Mikami is in the guardhouse at the west gate.
Guardhouse?
For five days. Akiyama told me.
Thank you.
If it was anything else, we could ask the adjutant for help.
Mikami.
Are you all right?
I'm the guard now.
You can see her all you want.
What did you say to Mikami
with these lips?
How many times did you kiss?
How many times
did you sleep with Mikami?
Three times? Five?
Who is it?
It's Sasaki. Forgive me.
Adjutant. Enemy attack, sir.
How many are there?
I don't know, sir.
They're attacking the west gate, sir.
Is the commander up?
Yes. He's in the command room, sir.
I see. I'll be right there.
Very well, sir.
I wonder if Mikami is safe.
Idiot!
You're a slut!
Mikami!
What are you doing?
Take all valuables and evacuate the camp!
Mikami, get out!
Die as an honorable imperial soldier.
Where are you going?
Harumi!
Where is Mikami?
They took him out a while ago.
He's not in the guardhouse anymore?
We need a machine gunner.
Mikami is an excellent gunner.
Harumi, he might die tonight.
Harumi, don't go!
It's dangerous!
Who's that?
Drop to the ground!
Get up! Come on!
Do you know Mikami?
- Corporal Mikami of headquarters.
- I don't know him.
Hey, wait!
Mikami!
- Do you know Mikami?
- No.
Harumi!
Where's Mikami?
He's wounded.
He might die.
Where is he?
In the trench, a mile out.
We were surrounded.
We could only get the machine gun out.
Stop! Idiot!
Mikami!
Mikami... you're dying.
At last we're all alone.
You're mine... and I'm all yours.
I'm with the Hachiro army political division.
Does it hurt?
We don't hate Japanese soldiers.
You have rights under international law.
I know the Japanese military forbids you to become a prisoner.
But if we send you back, you'll be court-martialed and executed.
I think you'll be safer staying here.
Of course, you must cooperate with us.
All right?
Let's do as they say.
I know how you feel, but we have no choice.
I thought it would be the first time we could be alone.
I felt very calm.
You know what I thought about?
About a festival day, and about the shrine my mother took me to, and the plum blossoms there.
For the first time in years,
I felt calm.
In here
I think I can hold on to that feeling.
Don't talk nonsense!
A court-martial will sentence you to death.
I don't like that... - death.
I won't let you die no matter what.
I won't let you die.
Harumi, stop singing that song.
I said stop it!
Stop it!
Mikami!
God, please help Mikami.
Mikami!
Mikami, don't throw your life away.
There's no shame in being a prisoner.
Are you still Japanese?
Mikami!
Just think.
What are you trying to accomplish in China?
Have you done any good?
China will govern itself.
Live with the Chinese for a while.
It's a good experience.
The Japanese are attacking again, so we're evacuating.
Come with us and recover your strength.
You'll be killed by your own people if you go back.
You swear your loyalty and that's how they repay you?
Come. We'll go together.
I won't!
You don't understand.
I'm a Japanese soldier.
I don't trust the words of a traitor.
Let's go with Uno.
If we stay here, we'll die.
Fool!
Japanese soldiers would sooner die than be taken prisoner.
Uno!
Wait!
He's leaving.
He's leaving.
What will we do now?
Everybody's leaving!
They're leaving!
Everybody's leaving! Let's go!
Mikami!
Wait!
They're leaving!
Mikami!
Wait!
Wait!
We finally made it.
Harumi, go back to your house.
- No, I won't.
- Go back!
- Wait!
- Stop!
You'll make things difficult for Mikami.
Do as they say.
If they court-martial him, is it true he'll be shot?
I think so. Poor man.
Don't worry. They won't.
They're afraid they'll lose face.
Why did they only bring back the machine gun... and leave him there?
Because the machine gun is property of the emperor.
Yuriko, how did it go?
He's been taken to Kempei headquarters.
Akiyama told me he'll be sent to Daigen the day after tomorrow.
Daigen? For a court-martial?
That's right.
And you didn't do anything?
You couldn't help Mikami?
That's terrible!
Don't take it out on me!
I went there to ask about him, didn't I?
We should have gone with them.
It's Sachiko!
Sachiko!
What happened, Sachiko?
His son was a madman.
There's no hope for a decent marriage!
Harumi, you can take the day off.
No, I don't want to.
You're tired.
You should rest.
I want to be exhausted!
If I'm tired out,
I won't have to think.
Harumi, is it all right now?
Come in.
How dare you make a fool of me?
Mikami was wounded and taken prisoner while he was unconscious.
If he hadn't been unconscious, he might have fought to the death.
After he was captured, he tried to escape and to commit suicide.
It's all true.
So please don't court-martial him.
Please, I beg you.
Please.
Are you crying for him?
He's not a true Japanese soldier.
He deserves to die.
Harumi, bring me sake.
A man of honor is strong.
Remember the country's honor.
Do your best not to disgrace it.
Never allow yourself to be taken prisoner alive.
Never sully the reputation you'll leave behind after death.
Never let wine or women distract your thoughts from battle.
That Mikami came back to die.
That's right.
Being captured is bad enough, and with a girl, too.
The idiot.
Sergeant!
He's worse than an idiot.
One or two missing can be forgotten.
But by coming back, he's forced us to court-martial him.
Because of him, the battalion's name has been stained forever!
It will haunt us everywhere we go, as long as this battalion exists,
Die before you come back.
Understand?
Yes.
Attention!
He was taught never to be a prisoner, so he came back to die.
You see, this is from Harumi, so please... -
I know.
Really. Poor, poor, Harumi.
Mikami, you have a visitor.
I'll overlook kissing, but nothing more.
Mikami.
I'm sorry.
Did a medic examine you?
He wouldn't do it.
That's ridiculous!
What will happen to me?
Will I be court-martialed?
When? Tell me when.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
What time?
Don't worry.
Tell them the truth.
You were taken away while unconscious.
It's useless.
If they don't believe you,
I'll get you out of here.
I won't let you die.
Harumi, do me a favor.
Tell me.
I'll do anything for you.
Get me a hand grenade.
A hand grenade? What for?
To escape.
Escape?
If they court-martial me, that will be the end.
I don't want to be executed as a criminal, so I'll escape.
I need a hand grenade to do that.
There are lots of grenades in the offices.
Please steal one of them.
You'll live!
You've decided to live!
Do it before the truck leaves here.
Hey, where are you going?
To meet the adjutant.
All right?
All right.
What do you want?
Wait outside.
To avoid staining the battalion's honor, what should we do with Mikami?
Once we send him to Daigen, we can't do anything. What do you think?
Kimura, you take care of him.
Our commander is very troubled.
Then Mikami will die an honorable death in battle?
Right. He will die an honorable death.
Salute!
Tell me... what time will you send Mikami to Daigen tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
Harumi.
Forward, march!
Squad, halt!
Corporal Shinichi Mikami, to be transferred to Daigen.
Mikami!
Mikami, get out.
A court-martial will dishonor you.
Your parents won't like it either.
Are you ready to die an honorable death for your country?
Understand?
Dying here will make everything all right.
Turn around!
I said turn around!
Enemy attack!
That's the signal for us to get back!
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
You idiots!
You shoot him!
Give me that!
Take care of him.
Out of my way!
There's a hand grenade in my robe. Quick!
The south gate, quick!
Soldier, to the north gate!
Harumi, go back!
It's dangerous here.
Aren't you going to escape?
I can't do it.
I'll show them I'm not a coward.
I'll show them!
Don't die!
Mikami, you fool!
Don't die!
No, don't die!
Don't die!
Get away!
I'll die with you!
Long live the emperor!
Long live the emperor!
Never let wine or women
distract your thoughts from battle,
nor lose your mind and ruin
the imperial army's dignity.
Never bring disgrace to the military.
Discipline yourself and live up
to a warrior's honor.
Control your anger and suppress your dissatisfaction.
Consider anger the enemy.
Do you understand why you've recited the field service code?
A man from this battalion lost his mind over a woman.
When the enemy attacked, he was taken prisoner, and when he came back, he committed suicide with the woman.
What did he think of the divine military code?
He was a stupid idiot.
An ungrateful traitor.
He was a brave soldier.
Harumi had a great figure.
It's a pity to lose her.
I gather the one called Harumi was quite a woman.
She drifted all this way into China.
Just a professional prostitute.
I see.
Corporal Mikami died of pneumonia.
The battalion attack plan.
The enemy has moved south.
We should keep the soldiers' morale up and allow them to follow in pursuit.
Narita...
China is a vast country.
All right.
Commence the attack plan at 1600 hours tomorrow.
Mikami and Harumi could have both run away if they'd wanted.
The Japanese are in such a hurry to die.
No matter how hard it is, we must go on living.
To live is the difficult task.
It's dying that's cowardly.
The Nile was always there.
Long before Cairo, long before the tombs of kings... it was the reason for everything.
It's a little hard to grasp how far this river's been flowing.
This is the rain that fell on Abyssinia.
These are the waters drained from central African lakes... that have flowed 4,000 miles to make Egypt green.
The Nile has its memories.
The story of Khartoum is a recent one... less than a century old.
That's yesterday in this part of the world.
But however far back you may go... all the Nile's recollections have several things in common.
There's always God, for instance.
Or, if you prefer, the gods.
It seems to have been quite impossible... to live beside this river... and not to have visions of eternity.
And there's always mystery.
You never quite know.
You wind up with a few questions that no one can answer.
One more thing.
Why is it that everything was always so big... outsized, larger-than-life?
Vanity? Perhaps.
Or visions.
Vanity was always mixed up with vision.
And that's part of this story, too.
But it's the Nile that remains the original fact.
The Nile and, of course, the desert.
Move up, up the Nile.
Leave Egypt behind and the green land.
Enter the Sudan.
A million square miles of desert and scrub.
It was here out of the vast, hot African nowhere... that a man of the Nile, a man of vision... and mystery and vanity rose up in the 1880s... to challenge first Egypt, and then the world.
He called himself the Mahdi, the Expected One... and he gathered about him his desert tribesmen... and he cried out for holy war.
Egypt hired an army of 10,000 men... and a professional English soldier to command them... and sent them 1,600 miles up the Nile to Khartoum... and on into the desert to destroy this man, the Mahdi.
Our history might have taken a quite different turn... had Colonel William Hicks not forgotten, if he ever knew... the Sudan's great fact... its immensity.
The Mahdi led him on and on... and on.
- Keep those men back!
- Right you are! Keep order!
Back!
Bugler!
Deploy!
Get those rifles to the high ground!
Mahdi!
Beloveds, you're men of the desert.
My Lord Mohammed, blessings and peace be upon him... commands me to speak... for I am the Mahdi, the Expected One... and I am sprung from the forehead of the family... of my Lord Mohammed, blessings be upon him.
My beloveds, did I not promise thee... a miracle would fall from heaven from the Prophet Mohammed?
And was not this so?
We fight a holy war against the fat and the corrupt... and the sinful and the unbelieving.
We fight a war to restore to a disobedient, forgetful world... the laws and commands of the Prophet Mohammed... blessings and peace be upon him... whose instrument on Earth I am.
Exalt ye not that men are dead, since more must die tomorrow.
My beloveds, in a vision... the Prophet Mohammed has instructed me.
Let mountain and desert tremble.
Let cities shudder, and let the fat and the rich... and the corrupt in far places mark this moment... and turn in fear of all those miracles to come!
And let none in all Islam, from this victorious hour... believe I am other than the Expected One... the true Mahdi.
Beloveds, it is the hour of prayer.
Explain to me, somebody, where in heaven's name is Wolseley?
Explain to me how a rabble of tribesmen... armed only with spears and swords... can destroy a modern army?
Not a British army,
Prime Minister.
- To the last man.
- An Egyptian army.
I don't care whose army.
10,000 men... a British officer commanding.
Why did Egypt have to hire an Englishman?
Colonel Hicks was a fool.
Clearly. A fool.
That's not the question.
Why did he have to be English?
"Avenge Hicks."
"Uphold Britain's Honor."
Wolseley, I have the press at my throat.
I was summoned to Scotland to explain to Her Majesty.
Will you explain to me...
Mr. Gladstone,
Colonel Stewart... recently attached to military intelligence.
The colonel's just back from Khartoum.
He will be able to explain better than I.
Colonel Stewart, sit down.
Are these bulletins from Khartoum true?
It's over a month's travel from the Sudan, sir... so, obviously, I left before these events took place... but I assume they're true.
Why?
I was sent to Khartoum to assess the Egyptian capacity... to deal with the uprising.
I assessed it as nil.
Military intelligence?
There's intelligence for you.
After the event, they knew all about it.
My reports were delivered to Sir Evelyn Baring... in Cairo before the event.
I was aware of the reports.
I just didn't believe them.
- I'm Granville.
- My Lord.
The reports still don't explain to me, however... how a modern army could be slaughtered... virtually to the last man.
Colonel Hicks and his men, sir, were fighting for wages.
The Mahdi and his men were fighting a holy war.
Also, Hicks made a very bad mistake.
He thought he was fighting an ignorant savage, and he wasn't.
The Mahdi is the most extraordinary man... the Sudan's ever seen.
And he knows his people.
He promised them a miracle.
He had to deliver it.
Even so, Colonel Stewart, the extent of the disaster...
The disaster, sir, has little to do with the loss of 10,000 men.
It's their arms.
Egypt was unequal to a horde of desert tribesmen... when they'd scarcely a pistol to call their own.
What does he do now... now that they've captured
10,000 Remington rifles... five batteries of artillery... and very nearly five million rounds of ammunition?
And I must add what will become of Egypt... if the Mahdi occupies Khartoum and the Khartoum arsenal?
What a jolly day you'll have with Her Majesty tomorrow.
Gentlemen, let me make one thing clear.
I'm sending no armies up the Nile.
You, Hartington, your imperialist friends... you're looking for any excuse to move into central Africa.
We are discussing Egypt.
We have a moral responsibility to Egypt.
A moral responsibility.
We have the Suez Canal.
Say it.
Egypt protects Suez.
We protect Egypt.
Why in heaven's name can't Egypt protect herself?
We've just heard from Colonel Stewart.
She's not up to it.
Colonel Stewart?
I've no doubt he's like the rest of you.
He can see himself leading a British army...
1,600 miles up the Nile, flags flying, glory for all.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Before I'd accept such a command...
I'd resign my commission.
I wouldn't spend one British life... to oppose the Mahdi, not in the Sudan.
I assumed you were for intervention.
You didn't ask my opinion, sir.
Well, I want it, by heaven, if it agrees with mine.
Gentlemen, I shall suggest... to Her Majesty in Scotland tomorrow... that we shall discharge our obligations to Egypt... by evacuating all the Egyptians from Khartoum.
How, without either a British army... or loss of British honor?
I shall entertain suggestions as to just how.
Gordon.
Chinese Gordon.
What's Gordon doing now?
He's made a contract with the king of the Belgians... to take over the Congo from Mr. Stanley.
We can arrange that with Brussels.
Send Gordon to Khartoum.
The man who led the Chinese Emperor's armies... to victory after victory carrying only a cane... send him to Khartoum.
- Without an army?
- Gordon doesn't need an army.
Yes, remember, without a single British soldier... he ended slavery in the Sudan.
He's a hero... to the Sudanese... to the English, to the anti-slavery people... to the churchmen.
Send him to Khartoum, and you'll be applauded... from Land's End to Inverness... and Her Majesty.
Granville, you're wasting my time.
The man's a mystic.
He's an idealist... with ideals strictly his own.
Give him an instruction, he treats a military order... as if it were a birthday greeting.
Besides, I trust no man who consults God... before he consults me.
May I speak, sir?
In my opinion,
General Gordon would refuse.
After all, when he went to the Sudan... as Governor General and put down the slave trade... with nothing but his own audacity... and a few loyal lieutenants... sir, he didn't face the Mahdi.
He didn't face a holy war... and he didn't face
10,000 Remington rifles.
If you send him to Khartoum on his own now... he'll simply fail.
What a pity.
Sir, if General Gordon accepted your proposal... and the conditions of today, my respect for him would end.
He'd be the vainest man alive.
Thank you, Colonel Stewart.
Now, would you leave us to our deliberations?
My congratulations on the excellence of your report.
Good day, sir.
I like that man.
Did I understand you correctly?
If we send Gordon to Khartoum...
Gordon, a national hero... and he fails... then the blame will fall on him, not on the government?
It could happen that way.
It's the most abominable proposal...
I have ever entertained.
Granville, the colonel had a point.
Just why would Gordon do it?
Because he's a patriot and a man of conscience... or perhaps the vainest man alive.
I dislike everything about this.
Worse, I distrust it.
I know nothing about this conversation.
But let me know in Balmoral what Gordon says.
Her Majesty would be so pleased.
Apologize for the secrecy,
Gordon.
Politics.
Let's not waste time with formalities.
Sit down, please.
I can't keep the train for Scotland waiting forever... or there'd be curiosity.
We need few words.
Granville will see you tomorrow... with a proposal so disreputable... that I can have nothing to do with it publicly.
Privately,
I ask you to accept it.
Why?
Because it will provide me with political comfort.
I can conceive of no commodity, sir... that could interest me less.
I'm not a free agent, you know.
I leave for the Belgian Congo within weeks.
Granville could arrange that.
Gordon, the Sudan was your child.
I don't need to inform you it's in the gravest danger.
You don't need to inform me.
Gordon, I cannot and will not... send military forces up the Nile... but I admit Khartoum cannot be left to its fate... without some gesture.
Am I the gesture?
The whole country knows your capacities.
You've done before alone what an army of blunderers can't do.
What's the proposal?
That you go to the Sudan... supervise the evacuation of Khartoum... do what you can to leave peace and order behind.
- With what powers?
- None.
Egypt will give you some ribbon or other.
Politicians.
And when the Mahdi floats me down the Nile... the government will assume a pained expression... and say to Her Majesty and the churchmen... and the anti-slavery people,
"We sent Gordon.
"We did the best we could."
Precisely.
That'll be the end of Gordon, but not of Gladstone.
In a nutshell.
I must say, Mr. Gladstone, you're hardly a bore.
You don't bore me either,
Gordon.
You're illogical and insubordinate.
I know if I send you to Khartoum... you'll play tricks, you'll exceed your orders... and in the name of some mystical necessity... apparent only to yourself... you'll do your ingenious best to involve this government... up to the hatband.
But you're in a very poor patch... and you have no one to turn to but me.
Again, in a nutshell.
I'll take a chance on your tricks. That's all I can say.
I'll see Sir Evelyn Baring in Cairo... brings pressure on the Khedive... to appoint you Governor General of the Sudan... but I cannot and will not back you up.
This must be understood.
No British troops will come up the Nile.
I will not assume a British obligation to police the world.
If you can help the Sudan, your country will be grateful.
If you can't...
My country will understand.
I'll go.
You'll come back safe.
Gordon, first, last, and above all... you'll come back safe.
Do you hear me?
I hear you.
You'll need an aide.
I have a good man in mind.
Isn't such a choice my prerogative?
Not in this case.
He'll be useful to you.
And to you.
Naturally.
Well, Gordon...
God go with you, and I don't envy God.
Put my luggage aboard, please.
Very good, sir.
Yes?
Your second-in-command, sir,
Colonel J.D.H. Stewart.
So.
This is for you, General.
You'll find my report in here.
It'll bring you up to date.
Am I to understand that Gladstone has cursed me... not only with a spy, but with a subordinate... who thinks he knows more than I do?
I was brought here in chains, sir.
I don't know what to think.
Brandy and soda, sir.
B & S? It sounds as though you'll need one.
- Thank you, sir.
- Right. Sit down.
You are Gladstone's spy, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Would it be indiscreet of your commanding officer... to inquire as to your instructions?
Not at all, sir.
I am to report to Mr. Gladstone... any actions you may take which, in my opinion... conflict with your instructions.
I am to inform you and the government if necessary... of any situation which, in my opinion... places you in physical danger.
And if anybody in the course of this mission... must risk his life, then I'm to do it, not you.
Apart from that, sir,
I'm yours to command.
Tell me what, in your opinion,
Colonel Stewart... are the chances of my sacking you?
If they existed, sir...
I'd be the first to point them out to you.
Drink your brandy.
Thank you.
We seem to have sailed.
Farewell, England.
So you and I are definitely stuck with each other.
Yes, sir.
For heaven's sake, man, sit down.
May I ask a question?
If it's impertinent,
I withdraw it.
Why did you let them talk you into this mission?
As is well known, I regard myself as a religious man... yet, I belong to no church.
I'm an able soldier, but I abhor armies.
I could even add that I've been introduced... to hundreds of women, yet I've never married.
In other words, no one's ever talked me into anything.
Does that answer your question?
No, sir.
Then let me suggest that my life is not an open book... to you, to any man, least of all to myself.
With your permission, General,
I think I need a turn on deck.
Send a telegram as soon as we reach Calais.
Sir Evelyn Baring, Cairo.
Locate immediately whereabouts Zobeir Pasha.
Signed, Gordon.
That's spelt Z-O-B-E-l-R.
Yes, sir.
I expected outrageous nonsense from you, Gordon.
I expected the worst, but Zobeir Pasha.
Even the Khedive was appalled.
I see nothing outrageous,
Sir Evelyn.
Zobeir's a Sudanese.
He used to be the most important man down there.
He's able, wise, still has a powerful influence.
You'd like to take Zobeir with you to Khartoum... to give him control over the Sudan.
Gordon, the man is a slave trader.
Was a slave trader.
My instructions are to evacuate Khartoum... and leave some sort of order behind.
How?
Well, most of the chiefs...
Ioyal to the Mahdi today used to be loyal to Zobeir.
I think they'd come back to him.
Sir Evelyn, I cannot go to Khartoum without a plan.
- I insist on seeing Zobeir.
- Why would he see you?
You not only put him out of the slave trade... you killed his son in the process.
I must take the chance.
One must always take chances.
Why is Towfik making us wait?
Well, Sir Evelyn, it's been my experience... that when you're giving orders to sovereign princes... you have to expect a little humiliation.
It makes them feel better.
Humbly, Highness,
I accept this command... as Governor General of the Sudan... and I swear to you my devoted service.
Do you understand,
Gordon Pasha... that your wages will only be £6,000 a year?
It is all I can afford.
I'll take 2,000.
It's all I need.
What about a B & S?
Sir.
God be with us.
Zobeir Pasha, you are well?
General Gordon goes to Khartoum... as Governor General for the Khedive.
He pays you his compliments, and he would speak with you.
This is my aide,
Colonel Stewart.
We come from London, Zobeir.
My government is determined to lend Egypt no support... in the face of the uprising and to prevail on the Khedive... to relinquish control over the Sudan.
Sir Evelyn will confirm what I say.
This is unwise.
There will be ruin... and death, and tears, and little else.
It is my government's policy.
I have no authority beyond evacuating... all Egyptians from Khartoum.
I could wish otherwise.
But you have the power and the influence... and the ability to oppose the Mahdi.
Will you come with me to Khartoum... and accept the Sudan from my hands?
Do I receive this offer... from the British government,
Sir Evelyn?
No, my government renounces all influence over Sudanese affairs.
This is a matter between you and General Gordon.
If I give you my word that there will be no slavery...
I regard the institution as ended... does my attitude influence your government?
I understand.
My reputation.
But what would your Christian world say... if the slaver Zobeir received ten million Sudanese... from the hands of the great Gordon Pasha?
My government would oppose you... publicly.
I would defend you.
Publicly.
The general will defend me.
The great Christian hero will defend Zobeir the slaver.
Before I receive my country from your bloody hands...
I shall see it die.
You killed my son.
I executed him.
Do you have sons, Gordon Pasha?
Do you have sons?
No.
You killed mine.
God forgive me, Zobeir.
But let the dead bury their dead.
You killed my flesh!
My blood!
My suleman.
Get thee from my house, and may ye die in the desert untended.
May vultures consume thy flesh, sands thy blood.
Go back. Go back to London.
There's too much danger, too little hope.
I'll report my news to Gladstone.
I'll stand by you.
Thank you.
You said you had to have a plan.
What can you do now?
Get up the Nile to Khartoum.
Stewart, just how far into the Sudan would you say we are?
We'll reach Berber in an hour or so.
In your report you said that the Mahdi's people... wore jibbers covered with patches.
That's correct, sir.
And his main force is still beyond Khartoum?
Yes, sir.
Look there.
We haven't even reached Berber.
Gordon Pasha!
Ali lbrahim!
Gordon Pasha!
No, Ali. No!
Sheikh Ali lbrahim of the Manasir.
My friend before God.
Ali, please.
I weep for joy.
We are saved! We are delivered!
- Delivered?
- Berber is surrounded.
I am cut off from my people, except by the river.
To the east, to the south, to the north.
Mohammed al Khalia, the villain, he has gone over to the Mahdi... taking all the tribes along this shore.
We saw a band downriver.
Did they get their guns from the Mahdi?
Since the terrible disaster of Hicks Pasha... it seems all have guns.
But you return, and we are saved.
- We are delivered.
- How? I bring no army.
You will find a way,
Gordon Pasha.
You have always found a way.
My friends, we must drink coffee and speak of the old days.
Sir, I've prepared a telegram for London.
I request that you read it.
I have an official responsibility... to advise you to turn back to Cairo.
The situation has changed.
Situations always change.
Sir, Berber is surrounded.
The uprising spread this far while we traveled.
You could be caught in a trap.
Give me a camel,
I can get out of anything.
You're a responsible spy.
Send your telegram.
You're bringing these people nothing but false hopes... and false expectations.
There are still 13,000 Egyptians to be got out of Khartoum.
If the government had known that by now... there'd be armed Mahdis tribes on both sides of the Nile...
400 miles north of Khartoum...
They wouldn't have sent me.
Then you cannot proceed further.
If Her Majesty's government... at this moment wants to run out publicly... on the Egyptians, send your telegram.
Get them to recall me.
But you have to make the decision. They won't.
I've made my decision,
Colonel Stewart.
But what is your decision?
General, when you left London, your only hope was Zobeir.
So, if you have any further plan... beyond vague self-confidence, you haven't confided it to me.
Was I instructed to confide in you?
I don't recall.
Are you willing to delude the Sudanese... gull the Egyptians, and compromise your country... just to satisfy your own vanity?
Next time I'll shoot you.
I've shot men before.
Now send your telegram.
The boat is coming!
Look at that!
Isn't that marvelous?
How exciting!
Everyone in Khartoum must be on the coast.
Gordon Pasha!
Welcome back, Gordon Pasha.
Thank you.
It's good to be home again.
You can't see anything from down there.
Gordon Pasha will be with us shortly.
Sheikh Abdul Rahim.
Gordon Pasha will be with us shortly.
Mr. Frank Power, Her Majesty's counsel in Khartoum.
Also the "Times" correspondent.
Where is he?
Gordon Pasha will be with us shortly.
Monsieur Herbin,
French counsel.
Gordon Pasha will be with us shortly.
- Khaleel, B & S.
- Yes, master.
B & S.
Thank you.
Now, master, it has been a very long time.
So you cannot expect me to remember all things... without confusion.
For if you had left me this Bible... then it would be different.
I could not have read it, but even so...
- Khaleel.
- I'm here, master.
Khaleel, there's something
I want you to do for me.
And I shall do it, master.
Now, this great Jesus Christ, sometime, master...
I do not understand this man.
For He announced, and He was very clear about it... for once He was very clear... almost like the great Lord Mohammed... bless him and peace be upon him.
But I do not understand this Jesus Christ.
For as I remember, you told me,
He announced most clearly... as I have said...
Khaleel, there's something
I want you to do.
You have only to speak master.
Now, He say when a man is struck upon one cheek... he must turn the other.
Do you? No.
You don't.
I must inform you, Khaleel, as delicately as possible... that I am not Jesus Christ.
Wait! Will you first find out for me... where the Mahdi's camp is at present?
Khaleel.
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
Send a messenger to Mohammed Ahmed... who is called the Mahdi... and tell him that Gordon Pasha...
Governor General of the Sudan, has entered his camp.
It is a lie before God!
He is not Gordon Pasha!
Abdullah! Gordon Pasha is here!
How does he appear?
The skin is pink.
The beard is only here.
It is gray.
Khartoum.
Holy person, we saw him yesterday in Khartoum.
It is Gordon Pasha.
How many are his soldiers?
He is alone with one black slave.
I fear it. He makes magic.
We saw it yesterday in the streets.
Kill him.
You're all so innocent.
Who makes the magic that brings him... to my camp alone with one black slave?
He... or I?
Bring the great one to me.
Is it because you are an infidel, Gordon Pasha... that I feel myself in the presence of evil?
I doubt it, Mohammed Ahmed, for you are not an infidel... and I smell evil.
I have 30,000 soldiers in my camp.
Is it because you are so brave... or so foolish, that you come here alone... unarmed, with only a black slave to hold your robe?
Khaleel is not a slave.
He is a free man.
He comes with me out of love.
And he does not hold my robe, but a gift for you.
Years ago, Mohammed Ahmed...
I led the armies of the Emperor of China... at a time of great trial.
And when his enemies were crushed and confounded... and his throne was again secure, he made me this gift.
I have brought it from London for you.
It is most exquisite.
When the Emperor of China ceases to be a non-believer... and accepts me, the Expected One... as the true Mahdi... then I shall be happy to receive such a gift.
Khaleel?
You will wait just outside.
Abria. Real abria.
I've had none in five years.
Your meeting with Zobeir Pasha was less than happy, I believe.
Your intelligence service... has an excellence beyond my expectations.
How much you must regret having killed his son.
I executed his son.
I have no regrets.
It was a necessary object lesson... in my campaign against the slave trade.
And it was successful.
I brought peace to the Sudan.
But since you have come back now... with instructions to evacuate Khartoum... most happily, the peace of the Sudan... no longer concerns you.
What a pleasure it is to negotiate with a man... who knows even my instructions.
We need waste so little time on preliminaries.
What are your instructions concerning Khartoum?
I have been instructed by the Prophet... blessings and peace be upon him... to worship in the Khartoum mosque.
There are those among the
Sudanese who will oppose you.
I welcome in peace all those who worship with me.
And the others?
Mohammed Ahmed, may I suggest... that when first
I came to the Sudan... its body was sick, stricken with hunger and abused by war.
I cured it... and this land...
I'm not a loving man,
Mohammed Ahmed... but this land became the only thing that I've ever loved.
I cannot, under my God... do you understand?
I cannot leave it to the sickness... and the misery in which I once found it.
I respect you, Gordon Pasha.
I make no war on you.
Make no war on your own people.
I'll take the Egyptians back to Egypt.
I'll leave the Sudan to the Sudanese... and be happy and contented, but if I'm to leave Khartoum... to sickness and misery, to death...
The Egyptians must remain in Khartoum.
I am a poor man of the desert.
But I am the Mahdi, the Expected One.
On my cheek is the mole.
Between my teeth... the space.
And so that all men may know that I am the true Mahdi... the Prophet Mohammed, blessings and peace be upon him... makes miracles.
Do you understand?
I begin to.
Gordon Pasha, do you believe that the Prophet... blessings be upon him, has instructed me... to pray only in the mosque at Khartoum?
No. I am to pray in the mosque at Cairo... and at Mecca, and at Baghdad... and in the mosque at Constantinople.
He has commanded me to make holy war until all of Islam... acknowledges the purity of his biddings... and all the world trembles before me.
But all Islam must know who I am.
And believe.
Gordon Pasha, for tasks of such greatness... great deeds are needed.
Egypt opposes me... and so the Egyptians must remain in Khartoum.
For I shall take it in blood... and the streets will run in blood... and the Nile will taste of blood for a hundred miles... and every Egyptian will die... every child, woman, man.
Sudanese, too, who opposes the will of my Lord Mohammed... will die.
This is how it must be in Khartoum.
Great and terrible thing.
Or I shall not pray in the mosques of Cairo... and Mecca, and Constantinople... nor will the world ever tremble before me.
I had thought in my lifetime that I had witnessed all things.
And you have.
You have described to me how it was an object lesson... when you slaughtered the sons of the slavers... and brought peace to the Sudan.
You have no regrets.
What is the difference,
Gordon Pasha?
An infidel object lesson, or a holy miracle?
If Khartoum is sacrificed... then all Islam will tremble and bow... and in peace I shall proceed... to all the mosques where I must pray... and the lives of millions will be spared.
Whisper to me, Gordon Pasha... if they are different.
This is how it will be.
This is how it will be.
Stewart Pasha.
He's back, sir.
Excellency, he has had no sleep.
General!
You have... been to the Mahdi.
He plans to lay siege to Khartoum... take it by force.
To slaughter all the Egyptians and those Sudanese who haven't accepted him.
But there are 35,000 people in Khartoum.
Those are his purposes, and I believe him.
The man is sincere.
He believes utterly in the divine necessity... for what he's doing.
How could I have been such a stumbling fool?
I'm a man who will question anything... except my own religious convictions.
The Mahdi's no different.
There's vanity for you.
I seem to have suffered from the illusion... that I have a monopoly on God.
It's the failure.
There are so many things
I'm not afraid of... but... to fail...
You haven't failed, sir.
Who else could have found out the Mahdi's intentions?
If I'd known about this in London... would I have recommended against sending an army?
How could any British government survive a massacre like this... without making some attempt to forestall it?
Yes. Get off a telegram to Cairo, immediately.
If the government moves on this, they can...
Sir.
The telegraph's been cut.
- Where?
- Below Metemmah.
- When?
- Today.
Sir, Mohammed al Khalia attacked Berber at dawn.
Your friend
Sheikh Ali lbrahim... escaped downriver at 10:00 this morning... and since then there's been no message.
We presume the city's fallen.
If so, the Nile is closed.
The evacuation.
We must get these people...
Sir, there isn't going to be any evacuation.
If they hold Berber, they've closed the Nile.
Sweet Jesus.
There is no alternative.
Gladstone must send an army.
If they've closed the Nile at Berber... we can get messengers across the desert as far as Debba.
The telegraph must be working there.
Yes. They can't have got that far.
Call your staff together,
Stewart.
We must check the food supplies.
We'll manage till help comes.
I've been an engineer all my days.
If I can't fortify a city with rivers on two sides of it...
I should be broken to the ranks.
- Go on.
- Sir.
Save Gordon.
Prime Minister, how many more of these debates... can we survive?
We must do something.
If Gordon can get messengers out of Khartoum... he can get himself out.
Prime Minister, please.
Who is the government,
Gordon or I?
I've been talking to Wolseley.
He can send a small detachment into the Sudan.
He promises no further than Debba.
I'll make no compromises with this man, Granville.
I've distrusted him always,
I distrust him now.
A small detachment, for communication purposes only.
A gesture.
We are in trouble!
Well, a small detachment.
But I will not turn this government... to overseas adventure.
Not for all the Gordons, the sentimentalists... the plots, the intrigues.
Save Gordon.
Now then, we are here.
You see, here's the city wall right there... with your guns emplaced all along.
And this is the ditch we're digging... connecting the white Nile to the blue Nile.
Now, when it's flooded, the city will become an island... and if the Mahdi crosses the river... and attacks from out here, the ditch will stop any charge.
But you must have your guns emplaced... so that their fields of fire overlap... then if one gun is knocked out... the next will still cover the same field.
- Do you understand?
- I understand, Gordon Pasha.
I sincerely hope so, Major.
Off you go.
I've been wondering, sir.
The Nile's aflood at the moment.
What happens when it falls and our ditch goes dry?
That won't be till next winter.
If they haven't sent an army by then... we'll all be dead of old age.
I don't think the Mahdi's waiting for that.
I just saw them putting up his personal tents over the river.
He's moving up.
Well, I could have the ditch flooded in a few days.
Good. I don't think he'll attack for a while.
He'll try to tighten the siege first, weaken us.
I want you to help me plan a giant-sized raiding party.
I want to take it upcountry between the rivers... and bring back every head of cattle... every measure of wheat for a hundred miles.
It might have to last us quite a while.
Sounds like a dangerous job, so I better do it.
It's in the orders.
Forget the orders.
Finish your ditch.
Flood it when you're ready.
Meanwhile, let me have a little fun.
Stewart Pasha.
Gordon Pasha is ten miles from the city... with a great convoy of grain and cattle.
A spy brings news the Mahdi is attacking him at dawn.
They're out there somewhere.
We'll make a stand and hold them... while you take all the cattle and grain into Khartoum.
If we divide, they'll have to divide.
You take all the cavalry with you... but don't let them turn you.
You must get the convoy into Khartoum.
- Good luck to you.
- Sir!
Hurry!
You, up the pace. Come on!
Now then, we can hold them here while the convoy gets away.
But keep your men low.
Don't give them a target.
Dismount yourselves.
Get your horses down, too.
Let them charge through us.
Once they've passed us, we'll have them against the light.
Well, good luck then.
Be quick.
Re-form!
Re-form and prepare to fire!
They're coming out of the light this time.
Stand fast.
Prepare to fire.
Fire!
Move forward!
Ready... charge!
They'll come at us again from the dark now.
Take cover!
Re-form!
Nearly three hundred dead.
How much of the convoy did we lose?
None. You must have brought in all the loose grain and beef... this side of Abyssinia.
It'll have to last us till relief comes.
This came yesterday via Cairo and Kitchener.
- I've read it.
- Who's Kitchener?
He's a major who's arrived at Debba with an army.
Precisely twenty men.
"You exaggerate the danger, sir.
"Suspicion still exists, sir...
"that you've created a situation...
"to fit your own personal inclinations.
"Leave Khartoum at once, sir.
"This is you last, final, ultimate order."
Obey the order, General.
Go to London. Explain to them.
You'll come back with an army.
I'll come back with an army.
They wouldn't listen to me.
If they did, they wouldn't believe me.
If they believed me, they'd keep me in England... if they had to lock me up in the tower of London.
You're the one to go.
They'd believe you if I stayed here as a hostage.
They'd believe you because they must!
I'll give you Khaleel.
He knows the route through the desert and the wells.
We've enough food here now to hold out for months.
The Nile's too high for the Mahdi to attack.
You must do it.
Yes, sir.
Let's get back.
Kitchener.
I'll take cholera, dysentery, sunstroke, fleas in my bed...
Arabs in my hair, but I cannot take politicians.
I wish you well, by heaven... but I don't envy you what you're up against.
Your man better stay with us until you get back.
Colonel Stewart, sir.
Get out of the way!
Say nothing, sir.
Your carriage is there, sir.
Clear the way, please.
Say nothing.
Sir.
I wasn't prepared for all this excitement.
The prime minister's waiting for you.
I want you to know before you see him... that he missed a vote of censure... in the House of Commons yesterday by only a few votes.
I want you to know also that
I'm on General Gordon's side.
You mean there's hope, sir?
I mean nothing of the sort.
Let's put all that aside.
There's just one thing that matters.
Did Gordon or did he not receive a direct order to return?
He did.
Could Gordon or could he not be standing there in front of me?
He could.
Then, Colonel Stewart... does your presence here confirm or deny...
Gordon's total disobedience?
- It confirms it.
- It's blackmail!
A man... one man... in the middle of Africa... is blackmailing the British government... into a course of action... it wouldn't otherwise choose to take.
I don't agree, sir.
You don't agree?
Is it really blackmail when one man... a long way off in a besieged desert town... calls to you and says...
"Allow these tens of thousands of human beings...
"to be slaughtered, if you will.
"It's your decision.
But allow me the privilege...
"of being slaughtered with them"?
You see, sir, if Khartoum is allowed to die... then Gordon will die with it.
It may be blackmail... and if it is, then I'm for blackmail.
Send in Lord Wolseley.
When I think how history will record someday... that the decisions of an empire were made only... by greedy businessmen, scheming generals... and conniving politicians...
It's up the Nile for you,
Wolseley.
Up the Nile to save one stubborn madman.
But let me tell you, if you do a Billy Hicks on me... if you take a British army into central Africa... and present me with any portion of a disaster... then don't come back.
Am I clear?
You are clear.
Colonel Stewart, inform your General Gordon... that a British army will be sailing... as quickly as possible for Cairo.
Thank you, sir.
Sir.
Khaleel.
Get me Colonel Stewart's man,
Khaleel.
Sir.
We didn't want to come to the palace.
This is informal, but it's serious.
General, people are afraid.
They have a right to be.
What about this relief army?
Why the hysteria?
There's still enough food.
What we're short of isn't food.
It's hope.
Power, you're English.
You know the government... how long they take to make decisions.
You all know how many weeks it is to London... how many weeks back.
It could be another month before we have word.
I'm an old friend, you believe me.
I tell you, in the bazaars,
I hear things.
It isn't good.
What am I supposed to give them, promises I can't keep?
Tell them lies to keep up morale?
Maybe small lies. Just a few.
Little ones?
Khaleel!
Yes, master? Good morning.
It is such a pleasant thing to...
Khaleel, what are you doing here?
Where is Colonel Stewart?
Yes, master, I do not know.
But as I was saying, that little place, Debba... by the river, is the most boring place...
- Khaleel!
- I'm to be home.
Yes, the Major Kitchener sends his greetings.
Most interesting man, the Major Kitchener.
It's Stewart.
He's sailed from England... with Wolseley and 7,000 men!
They're coming!
The British are coming!
I do not have the ingredient here, Gordon Pasha... but if you will come back to the palace...
I will make you a B & S.
Squad, attention!
Stand the camels.
Mount!
You... did you come here on holiday?
You think you've come to Egypt on leave?
Look at those buttons... filthy.
Look at this. Disgraceful.
What would Her Majesty say?
You there, stand up.
I don't say it isn't necessary, sir... but we've been in Egypt for six weeks now... and the Nile is falling.
What I feel I must point out... is that the fall of the Nile in Khartoum... comes two months earlier than here in Cairo.
And that when the Nile has fallen sufficiently...
Khartoum will be defenseless.
Thank you, Colonel Stewart.
But you know as well as I do... that men who have not been fully conditioned... to the tropical climate simply cannot fight.
They'll die... by the platoons, by the company.
I agree, sir, but couldn't you send ahead... a detachment of your best-conditioned men?
No, Stewart.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Don't be too hard on Wolseley.
You haven't seen his instructions yet.
I was there.
He's to relieve Khartoum.
Colonel, I've seen the orders.
He's to bring out Gordon.
There's no mention of Khartoum.
Wolseley knows.
He's to proceed up the Nile as slowly as possible.
He'll move up to Wadi Halfa shortly, yes, but he knows.
He's to give Gordon every chance at the last minute... to come out by his own choice.
But Gordon won't come out.
You know it.
I now know it.
I'm sure that Wolseley knows it.
They've been friends always.
That's why I say... don't be too hard on him.
It's the government that's unconvinced.
I can well understand why you haven't told me this before.
Why do you tell me now?
Because it's on the cards,
Colonel... that this expedition will be too late.
Gordon should come out.
There's no one to tell him but you.
Didn't he say where they're mounting them?
He does not know, Excellency.
He saw the guns arriving, that is all.
You were Gladstone's gesture last year.
This year, it's Wolseley.
Sir, I failed.
I thought
I'd made it clear to them... that you'd never come out.
- I didn't.
- You probably did.
Gladstone's a gambler.
He's gambling.
No, they all think you should come out.
So do I.
Sir... what's the absolute limit of time we can hold out here?
I don't know.
The Mahdi's brought up the guns he captured from Hicks.
That means he'll start a bombardment.
- How low is the ditch?
- It's low.
And the news'll be all over town by morning... the steamer arrived and no army.
There'll be a panic.
Sir, you haven't got a chance.
I haven't got a choice.
If Wolseley's orders are to save only me and not Khartoum...
I'm left with no choice.
How could I leave? Tell me.
What purpose is served if Wolseley's too late... and Mahdi attacks?
There are worse ways to die.
Many.
That's the essence of it,
I suppose.
Every man has a final weapon... his life... and if he's afraid of losing it... he throws that weapon away.
That's what they can't quite grasp... that I'm not really afraid.
And that's what they must understand, isn't it?
No one can make them understand it except me.
You must be tired.
Meet me at the dock tomorrow, early.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
To get her through the blockade, we'll have to armor the rail... set up troop guns here, another one up forward.
We'll carry the extra fuel behind in a couple of luggers.
I want every European in Khartoum on this boat... the wives, children, counsels, too...
Frank Power and Herbin... and every Egyptian civilian you can stack on board.
You must get them all out.
You mean I go with them, and you stay here?
Khartoum is my problem.
Getting these people out is yours.
How else can I convince London that I will not leave?
But you'll be completely alone.
It's a gesture.
Come, little lady.
We'll take you back home.
Mr. Gladstone must understand... that I am capable of gestures, too.
Hassan!
I don't ask you to be unafraid, simply to act unafraid.
How are you going to handle Khartoum... when the word gets around that we're gone?
How are you going to handle Berber... if Mohammed al Khalia has heavy guns?
We sink.
We'll both take our chances.
There are several letters in here... appeals to Her Majesty the Queen, the Pope in Rome... the Sultan in Constantinople.
They're all for public display.
There's only one appeal that matters... Wolseley.
And through Wolseley,
Gladstone.
Perhaps now you can convince him.
Get through.
You'll get through.
Good luck.
Gordon Pasha, we are ready to sail.
Thank you, Hassan.
Why didn't we go, Gordon Pasha?
Why wasn't I on the boat,
Gordon Pasha?
I should've gone on the boat.
This is Metemmah.
We'll refuel.
Beyond here, the shore is held solidly... by Mahdi's tribesmen... so you better go ashore and stretch your legs.
Be your last chance.
Firewood? We have no firewood.
Well, trees.
Trees? Do you see trees?
Yes, a mile or two from the town... and Egyptians hanging from them...
I need fuel.
Tear out the dock!
Come on!
This is all we have left?
This is all we have left.
Excellency, do not blame the superintendent.
Someone presented orders for grain... with your forged signature and seal.
He sold it in the town for profit.
Find him.
He will be executed.
For how long shall we eat?
The garrison will eat for about two weeks.
The town...
Requisition all stocks of grain in the hands of merchants.
There is little, Gordon Pasha.
All privately-owned livestock, donkeys, goats, camels.
We ride beneath no more desert stars, then.
All things must end.
Take him, too.
We reach Berber tomorrow morning.
This is the main point of blockade... so we'll be attacked from both shores.
If we get through... it'll be luck, discipline, and surprise.
Pray for surprise.
And pray also that Mohammed al Khalia... has no heavy guns.
Can't we move any further from the shore than this, Captain?
I'm sorry, Stewart Pasha.
We're already too close to the sand bank.
Full speed.
Number one, fire!
Number two, fire!
Fire at will!
They have no heavy guns.
We'll make it.
They're coming.
Below.
Salaam Malachim.
Malachim Salaam.
The Mahdi and l... we look at each other across the river... we assault each other with assurance.
Mostly the assurance that we're still here.
I'm late. Forgive me.
Where is the army?
For whom do you speak,
Sheikh Osman?
For myself, for the leaders of our people.
We do not come to you,
Gordon Pasha... with cries and wails...
"Why did you not send us down the river...
"beyond the fringe of danger?"
We are not of Egypt.
We are Sudanese.
And this is our country... and this is our people within these walls.
When does the army come?
Good sirs, I can only tell you what I know.
I sent Stewart Pasha downriver to urge all possible haste.
It has been ten days.
He should have reached
Major Kitchener in five or six.
It should not be long.
How long?
The Nile is low, Gordon Pasha.
Bellies grow empty.
Men feed on fear.
You do not have this fear of death yourself, Excellency?
It's a luxury
I've put behind me.
You are exceptional.
Gordon Pasha, when we accepted your protection... for ourselves and for our people... the Mahdi marked our souls for damnation.
We were not afraid.
We trusted you.
Did we choose correctly?
You could not choose otherwise.
It was against your convictions.
We now speak of life and death, not convictions.
Do you propose going over to the Mahdi?
We propose nothing.
We ask, "Where is the army?"
I don't know.
I am wondering, is there an army?
Don't call me a liar!
I beg of you... or I shall have to lock you up.
We are locked up now.
Sheikh Osman... you are Khartoum's most respected citizen.
If you leave, the city's spirit will break.
It will surely fall.
And you will be responsible for its massacre.
I have no choice but to stay.
I repeat... you have us locked in.
- Gordon Pasha...
- Wait!
If you were given the choice, you still could not do this.
You could not leave Khartoum.
When one cannot choose, one can never know.
But you will understand, will you not, Excellency... that there are those among us... more afraid of death than yourself.
We cannot all be exceptional.
Gordon Pasha, the police.
They have the man who stole the grain.
Awaan, is this true?
Tomorrow morning.
Firing squad, take aim!
Fire!
As Governor General of the Sudan...
I issue the following proclamation... at dawn tomorrow... the city gate to the south will be opened.
It will stand open for three hours.
All inhabitants of the city who wish to leave... and seek the protection of Mohammed Ahmed... known as the Mahdi... will be free to do so.
No hindrance will be placed in their way.
I can't believe it.
When did you say the others passed through?
A month ago.
An armed steamer called the Abbas... passed through Metemmah downstream a month ago... and is since unreported.
General Gordon had placed all of Khartoum's Europeans... aboard the steamer... with instructions to run the blockade.
Colonel Stewart was in command.
Stewart!
Are you quite sure that
General Gordon wasn't on board?
General Gordon remained in Khartoum.
Sir, the Nile is falling.
What he's done is to make a public announcement, sir... that cannot be misunderstood.
He'll never leave.
Gentlemen... if you please.
We move instantly on Khartoum.
Only the camel corps is ready.
You, Sir Herbert, will take command.
I will stay here with the main force... moving up as soon as possible.
But you will go ahead by water to Debba... make a formation there... and then take the desert crossing to Metemmah... there to embark for Khartoum.
Kitchener knows the route and the wells.
Move, gentlemen.
Stand your camels.
Mount!
Advance in a column of sections from the right.
Walk!
Did you pack the powder tightly?
Yes, Gordon Pasha.
All right, then.
No, not too much sand on the fuse, men.
Give it plenty of air to burn.
Now, you see, by firing this pistol into the tinderbox... we can set off as many fuses as we have running into them.
Like this.
Come along.
- Call your men in.
- Right. Over here.
Quickly.
Good. Should be able to set off about twenty fuses... from each tinderbox.
I'll want at least 400 pots.
The whole approach to the city must be mined.
Yes, Gordon Pasha.
Halt!
Form battle square.
Take up action stations.
Down!
By now the Christian soldiers are on the river.
- Attack, beloved one.
- Attack now, holy person.
There is no more time.
It is the moment.
Beloved one, give me the word.
Do I make my preparations?
Send me the one who writes English words.
- Wonderful!
- Gentlemen, what is this?
Excellency!
From Major Kitchener, a message at last!
British soldiers have crossed the desert at Metemmah.
They approach Khartoum on the river!
And Stewart Pasha?
He's safe, Excellency.
Their bus was delayed, but it is safe.
But the messenger says, so you'll know the news is true...
"Stewart Pasha still has the ring you gave him."
Give the man money, something to eat.
The messenger from the Major Kitchener... eats and says thank you.
He's very brave.
I said to the messenger,
"Is it true that...
"the Major Kitchener has big dark eyes...
"like flies in the night?"
And he say it's true... that his eyes are like black daggers... and before them, all men tremble.
The Major Kitchener has eyes as blue as little flowers.
The man was bragging.
He'd never seen Kitchener.
He didn't want to say so.
That's true, master.
If he was lying... how could he know about that ring I gave Stewart Pasha?
Anyway, if the Mahdi wanted to send me a false message... why would he say the soldiers were coming?
It makes no sense, Khaleel.
That is right, master.
Tell Abdullah he may make his preparations.
Then he must come to me.
Where did you get this?
The Mahdi asks you to come to his tent in peace.
A faluka awaits you at the ivory trader's dock.
I am his first Khalifa Abdullah, and I remain here.
I am your hostage.
You will not regard it as a discourtesy, I hope... if I lock you in.
If I'm not back by dawn, you'll be shot.
Welcome, Gordon Pasha.
Come in peace.
How did this come to you?
It came to you with the greetings of your friend... far down the river,
Sheikh Ali lbrahim... of the Manasir people.
Sheikh Ali lbrahim has been induced... by my friend and great emir
Mohammed al Khalia... to acknowledge me as the Expected One... the true Mahdi.
He sends you assurance... that should you care to proceed down the Nile... he will offer you safe passage.
You are my guest.
Why do you invite me here now?
Because the Prophet Mohammed, blessings be upon him... has appeared to me in a vision... and instructed me to attack
Khartoum with fire and sword.
20,000 angels will proceed my men into battle.
And terror will afflict and subdue my enemies... as far as Mecca and Baghdad and Constantinople... for all will know what a truly great miracle... has been done by my Lord Mohammed.
I should prefer, Gordon Pasha, that you leave Khartoum now.
You are not my enemy.
Why should your blood sweeten the Nile?
What you are saying is this... so long as I am in Khartoum you dread to attack... for a British army is close, and you know it well.
A British army.
The message.
I sent the message.
There is no British army.
Your soldiers are in Egypt.
They play cards, drink the liquor, pursue women.
Why would you send me a false message?
It is sometimes wise,
Gordon Pasha... to provide a man with a few sunny hours... of fraudulent hope so that when night comes... he will have a more perfect inward vision... of the truth of his hopelessness.
I sent the message.
There is no British army.
You are alone.
Quite alone.
If this is true... then what difference can it make to you... if one man leaves or stays?
It is important to me.
Please explain to me the importance.
Because I am a man of mercy!
And I tell you go!
Leave in safety. Now.
You are not a man of mercy... for your visions have not revealed to you what mercy is... and so why do you do this?
You are not my enemy.
But I am.
You should understand,
Mohammed Ahmed... we are so alike, you and I.
You would welcome death, wouldn't you... if death could be the servant of your life?
Wouldn't you?
I, too.
If my life has a single point, it's this...
I've learned to be unafraid of death... but never to be unafraid of failure.
If by the act of surrendering my life...
I can bring down the world on your head... then it's an arrangement
I welcome.
Do you understand?
I'm sure you do.
If you, as a servant of your God... must use 100,000 warriors to destroy me... a solitary servant of my God... then you whisper to me,
Mohammed Ahmed... who will be remembered from Khartoum... your God or mine?
But Gordon Pasha, why should you be remembered?
You are forgotten.
Already.
Is it possible you still do not believe me?
I do not believe any infidel, even you, Gordon Pasha... can face a lonely death without terror.
Is it the Englishman whose name was Frank Power?
Is it the Frenchman whose name was Herbin?
Is it not your own ring?
Do you leave Khartoum?
I cannot leave Khartoum...
Mohammed Ahmed... for I, too, perform miracles... and you shall witness one.
While I may die of your miracle, you will surely die of mine.
Sir! The river!
So.
Here we are.
All right, then, gentlemen.
Fire!
Get back!
Fire one!
Well, Khaleel.
Take it away!
That is Abdullah.
I forbade it.
The relief came two days late.
Two days!
And for fifteen years, the Sudanese paid the price... with pestilence and famine, the British with shame and war.
Within months after Gordon died, the Mahdi died.
Why, we shall never know.
Gordon rests in his beloved Sudan.
We cannot tell how long his memory will live... but there is this...
"A world with no room for the Gordons...
"is a world that will return to the sands."

Why bury their clothes only?
- Because they were killed at the front.
Didn't they bury them there?

Lieutenant!
Yes, Sir!
What's that?
Attention!
Bayonet drill! Stab forward!
Road clear!
Hurry up!
Go!
Good evening, Lisa!
- Good evening
Lefterova died last night.
Typhus?
- Yes.
It's an epidemic.
Thank You!
The Stone!
Pass me the sea salt.
This leg is tormenting me.
It's your wound, it's sensitive to weather changes.
Old age coming, my girl!
You've been drilling before the recruits again.
Michael...
How dare you enter?
For God's sake, madam, don't!
You should have asked.
I'd have picked you some.
You know there are patrols.
When one is hungry one doesn't care for patrols.
Come along!
Sit down!
Please!
Thank you.
- I have nothing else to offer.
Excuse me!
Why leave the peaches?
Take them!
Thank you, madam!
What's your name?
- Ivo... Obrenovitch
Good bye
Obrenovitch!
Wait!
Sorry, you can't have from these.
Go see the captain, then.
No, wait.
Obrenovitch
You know stealing is forbidden...
You make me punish you.
Would you like to work?
No, I refuse!
- Are you rebeling?
I can't work for my enemy.
You're forgetting that you are a P.O.W.
An officer, my captain.
All right. Five days confinement!
Nanev.
Yes, Sir!
Take the peaches to the hospital.
Yes, Sir!
Hey, you!
Hold this!
How could I know it would happen?
Gandev, take this.
Thanks, lieutenant!
I'll come back tomorrow.
"...There, far, far away from home there is my village..."
Obrenovich!
You here, my captain?
- Yes, my dear, I'm here again.
What happened? - I hit somebody. - Whom?
I can't remember. But my hand still hurts.
You had one too many?
- on the contrary...
Do you bring me something?
- My company for five days.
Not bad! It's boring to play chess alone.
I don't feel like playing.
Why?
- Just so...
Oh, I see... It's a woman, isn't it?
And she let you kiss her?
- No.
Or gave you a smile?
No...
She must be beautiful!
- I shouldn't say so.
Then I don't understand.
There!
Kavarnaliev is back from Dobrudga.
Being transferred to the Southern front.
He's brought two boxes of sugar.
I am sure he's smuggled kerosene from Romania.
Smearing the uniform! Villains!
Starting tomorrow you sleep in the orchard.
And shoot anyone that shows up.
General Hubenov has been relieved of his post.
We've retreated at Yarebitchna. The idiots will let the front break down.
A new requisition decree again.
The government's gone crazy.
What about the prisoners?
What prisoners?
From the camp.
You haven't been to see them, have you?
You know I don't go out.
You needn't.
It's no sight for a decent woman.
They aren't humans, just...
Couldn't we be more human with them?
Don't talk like that.
Our boys are dying at the front, while you care here about the slaves.
They're hungry and tormented.
They would mutiny if they weren't.
Sorry!
Good afternoon!
I'm here again.
What a moment.
These boots are for you. I hope they fit you.
Oh, they're fine.
Are you always alone?
No, my husband works downtown.
I know him. He's the town commandant.
Who told you?
- The soldiers.
Why do you hide that?
He is very strict.
But you are so kind!
You aren't any safer for that.
I would have come the very next day!
Why didn't you?
- I was... how do you say it?
Because you ran away?
Yes, for that. Yes, but mainly because of the peaches.
You should've said they were a gift.
And tell them from whom?
Of course not!
Will you give me some food?
And some brandy if possible.
What are you looking at?
- Veliko Tarnovo
I thought you loathed it.
I'm admiring it despite the barbed wire.
War brings hatred but the work of man remains to incite love.
An absurd paradox.
A sad paradox.
Take this!
Thank you!
I don't even know your name.
Elisaveta
Elisaveta
I beg you not to come here anymore.
I see!
Good-bye
The chimney doesn't smoke.
Auntie, Radi's painted some smoke.
Wait!
What's this volcano?
This is the front, can't you see?
Come, let's try them on.
There.
I can't buttoned it.
Thank you.
- Come on!
I violated your order.
You take a big risk.
Tou think so.
The patrols might kill you!
A pity for the fine boots.
Must you talk like that?
You are an officer, aren't you?
Let me present myself. A teacher, trained, in uniform.
Three years in trenches, two in camps.
What regrets could I have?
Still it's thoughtless of you.
What about you? Why did you come?
I was afraid something might happen to you.
I didn't know you had children.
They're not mine.
Whose are they?
Orphans...
Perhaps it's better that way.
Forgive me! Children become men, then are sent to be killed.
Or to rot behind barbed wire which is the same.
You think it'll always be like this?
I wonder...
If it was up to me...
Sorry to bother you.
You're not.
But I'll be coming again...
Please, don't, I'll send you some food.
You know why.
Don't!
I must see you.
I can stand everything when thinking of you.
Even the camp is not so horrible.
You bring back my faith in life.
Oh, why do you talk like that?
I love you! And you know that.
I must go!
Stay a while, please!
No... I can't.
Are you really going?
Yes.
Good-by.
Elisaveta!
Where have you been?
Lisa, what's wrong with you?
Nothing. I went to church.
Colonel!
Colonel!
Don't you remember me?
Varenov!
Petio!
Peter!
I didn't know that you went to the front
I was in father's division.
Why?
At war all are equal, sir.
Excuse me.
Good day madam!
Good day!
Thank you!
May I report, here?
Please, listen to me.
What is it?
Catastrophe is round the corner. The soldiers are hungry.
They're in rags. No officers, all killed.
They're angry.
If something's not done now the soldiers will leave the trenches.
All will be in vain.
Bulgarian soldiers have seen worse than that!
Our hopes are with them.
They're tired, sir.
They're dead tired.
Well Varenov, thank you for your honesty.
Now go and rest.
Why do your torture yourself?
You've done your bit.
Be silent. You don't understand.
Peace is the banner of the weak.
The strong raise it only to justify an offensive.
To justify absurdity!
- No...
War has been and still remains the normal state of our poor human race.
Not a very attractive philosophy.
I'm afraid for you, my friend.
Love makes you idealize things.
You could forget what you are.
It's what I want!
Too selfish on her part.
- Why?
She doesn't suspect how hard it is for a man in love to be imprisoned.
What if she is a prisoner too?
- Even then...
Women seek only their own slavation.
Let's drop the subject.
Is it so serious?
- Yes.
You're being a fool.
Have you never been in love?
Never!
- Never?
Good luck! And watch out!
What are you doing here? Are you crazy?
What's happened?
Why stare at me like that?
Am I to blame for something?
- I'm rather the one to blame.
What's with you?
Don't Mr. Obrenovitch!
Please, go away.
There can be nothing between us.
No, you're not right!
You say this on purpose...
You suffer... I felt it the first time.
This is what brings me here.
It wasn't out of compassion then...
Forget it. Leave me alone.
And don't think of it anymore!
It's useless.
I won't leave. Even if you ask me to.
You aren't happy.
It's absurd to talk about happiness.
You have the right to be. You have!
You don't love this man.
You have no right! He's my husband.
Yes, indeed, he's your husband.
It's good you've realized it.
I thought you were different.
You've fooled yourself.
You've fooled me!
Rudeness doesn't fit you.
Now please, go!
I will but you take off that mask of kindness and suffering.
Someone else might be fooled
Come on, man it's your turn.
What's going on there?
Sergeant, here comes... the colonel.
Now we have it coming!
Lieutenant Obrenovitch!
Why didn't you salute?
Regulations say: "Wherever he may be a Serb officer is always on service."
Too much drinking?
I was waiting for you, my friend.
Did you attack?
- No.
So you think like me?
She thinks like you.
- What?
That there's no use.
Forgive me, my friend. She deserves...
You don't want to talk?
It's a pity.
Listen then,
I was five, when...
I know!
When you were 5 years old, your father, Major de Greville, took you to the cadets.
I know this!
No more of it, please!
No, Iv...No.
When I was five my grandpa,
General de Greville, sent me to buy him...
Cigarettes...
It was raining like now. Such a rain...
The streets were real torrents.
And do you know what I did?
I tore up the pack and dropped the cigarettes one by one in the water.
They floated far, far away...
Tired... when the whole nation lies in the trenches.
One can't think of resting.
Perhaps it isn't so hopeless?
The papers say nothing. Say what?
They just deceive the people as usual.
You used to believe them.
I'm afraid we'll loose this war too.
Hope it doesn't happen like in Russia.
Do you remember how you said it?
"The mask of kindness and suffering."
I was not myself.
Why?
They're ugly.
- No, lovely!
Rough and crooked.
It was your fingers
I fell in love first.
The special way you spread them when saying good-bye.
I'm not going yet.
Ivo!
Why?
- I'm ill...
Your hands are hot. Might by typhus.
I don't want to live without you.
My love! My treasure!
English, Serbian, Romanian...
And this eagle?
Austrian.
Why an Austrian too?
Buttons don't fight each other.
What's wrong?
My head will simply burst.
Say again...
- What?
Do you love me?
- Don't you know?
Tell me!
- I love you. For ever! To the end!
Want me to say it again?
No...
Does it hurt?
- No.
Lisa, we must decide.
We must get away from here.
You're a child, indeed.
Let's run away one night.
Will you? The war will soon be over.
I've waited so long now, that
I can't believe it will end.
He's obedient, isn't he?
Like you.
True, I'm tied too, hands and feet.
You protest?
Soldiers don't protest. Its forbidden.
I won't stand in your way.
No, you misunderstood me.
You are free indeed.
I meant something else.
What?
I've often thought before protesting one should grasp the truth.
Get rid of the lies that mislead us constantly.
May be finally people will realize this?
Yes, that happens quickly despite those that are against.
Who?
Of your husband, for example.
Why are you offended?
It's not that simple.
He suffers too.
Sometimes I feel sorry for him.
Courage, ideals, valor...
It felt good listening to him, and I believed it.
Then came this chaos.
And you were disappointed?
I thought all was lost.
When you came I learned there was something else in this world.
That's why I fell in love with you, naughty Serb!
Lisa!
What're you thinking about?
Who, me? Nothing...
No, your mind was far away.
Why not tell me?
I was thinking of old age.
Of mine?
No...of my own.
Your old age is a long way off.
You've changed so much lately! Even your gait...
What's bad about it?
No, but why now?
Where have you been?
I went for a stroll.
You're touchy, why?
Leave it.
Try to explain...
What?
This change... You've estranged yourself.
It's your imagination.
Yes,...the way things are it will soon be over.
Of course, we shan't starve.
We still have time to live happily.
You think I ever lived happily?
What do you mean?
Nothing...
Attention!
Soldiers, go straight to the barracks.
And hand in your weapons.
Women seek shelter indoors!
Go!
Scaring whom? You bloodsucker's S.O.B!
How long will you go on torturing the people?
Calm down! The war's not over yet.
We'll end it ourselves.
Down with war!
Brother, don't go!
What are you doing?
Haven't we suffered enough by so many foreigners?
Heroes, brothers, you've fulfilled y our duty on the battlefields.
Your exploits will go down in History.
These decorations which H.M. has...
Don't want your medals!
We want to know who's running this country.
Far away, away from the sea there's my village where my bonnie lives...
Why?
You're incorrigible!
A song, a couple of shots and you triumph!
It's not the first time mankind is trying to overthrow those who shape its fate.
It still keeps trying.
And be disappointed once again.
What about the events in Russia?
I'm afraid they've forgotten 1871.
The Paris Commune.
There can be no game if each figure isn't in its place.
People might come up with a new game, with new figures, new rules.
It's possible... If everybody were in love.
Petio!
Varinov!
Come to your senses!
Luckily it was the wooden leg.
Take him home!
The P.O.W.'s should not leave the camp!
Organize their evacuation to Shoumen.
This very night.
Gentlemen, events took place that - might be misinterpreted.
The Bulgarian army had to retreat.
I hope you know that.
But keep in mind that a nation which for 500 years has been fighting for freedom, a nation that amazed the world with its heroism cannot be defeated!
Farewell, gentlemen!
The Bulgarians have shown great courage.
Gentlemen, it's time!
Don't go, Ives, it's risky!
- I'm going anyway.
Good-bye!
Good bye, captain!
- Good luck!

[SPEAKS IN POLISH]
What's the odd smell in this house, inspector?
The smell of war,
Major Grau.
Good morning, inspector.
Major.
I'm sorry to call you at such an ungodly hour.
Not very nice, I'm afraid.
The work of an amateur butcher, I should say.
Why have you called me?
The dead woman's Polish, isn't she?
This is not a case for the German authorities.
Her name was Kupiecka.
Maria Kupiecka.
Kupiecka?
Oh, yes, she was a prostitute and a good friend to us.
She was also a German agent.
Killed by a Polish patriot?
Providing the Polish patriot was also a sexual degenerate.
Patriotism has been known to have its vicious side.
One hundred knife wounds goes beyond normal patriotic zeal.
One hundred?
That's just my guess, sir.
It would be impossible to count.
As you can see, the focus of the murderer's attack was on the woman's sexual organs, using what appears to have been a large clasp knife...
Thank you, doctor, there's no need to be vivid.
[SPEAKING IN POLISH]
Find anything?
No, not yet.
Who reported the murder?
A voice on the telephone.
A man. He heard screams at about 11: 10.
Identify himself?
No.
Who lives in this house?
One of you...
One of you heard a scream and telephoned the police.
One of you knows something about the way in which this woman died.
If that person does not tell us everything he knows, we shall assume that her death was political.
That she was killed by a member of the Polish underground and that you are all accomplices.
In which case, it will be my sad duty to turn the whole lot of you over to the Gestapo.
The man who telephoned the police has one minute in which to make himself known.
I heard the scream.
This one terrible scream.
And then, well, I...
I hid in the lavatory.
Then later, perhaps 10 minutes later,
I telephoned the police.
That's all.
You did not give the police your name.
That means that there was something you didn't want them to know.
What could that something be?
Well, there's a...
There's this crack in the door to the lavatory.
And naturally, you put your eye to the crack and you saw...?
I saw a man coming down the stairs.
Describe him, please.
Well, it... It was dark.
Describe him, please.
I couldn't see all of him.
Just the lower part, the trousers.
Why are you so frightened by what you saw?
Because it was a uniform, sir.
Like yours.
Like mine?
A German officer?
The man's a liar.
German officers can commit murders like anyone else.
Is that all you noticed?
That the trousers were like mine?
Exactly like mine?
No.
Not exactly, sir. No.
There was a...
There was a red stripe running down the leg.
He's lying.
Are you aware that only German generals wear the red stripe?
Yes, sir. That's why I was afraid.
I see.
It's impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
A German general.
Well, well.
I don't think we need to take this testimony too seriously.
After all, it was dark on the stairs.
Sir, I swear...
I swear, I'm telling the truth.
And I believe you, until there's evidence to the contrary.
Why would he tell a dangerous lie?
I want a complete investigation.
But what happens if the murderer really is a general?
What happens? Well, justice is blind, my dear inspector.
Justice cannot see the red stripe or the gold braid, but justice can sometimes hear the cry of a murdered woman.
If a general is responsible, why, we shall have to hang him.
Don't worry, Liesowski, the responsibility is mine.
Good night.
LIESOWSKI: Well, Inspector
Morand, you can't blame me for not quite remembering a case that occurred almost a generation ago.
But as they say, it's the long arm of the law.
It's... It's 23 years ago.
My God, how time passes.
When I left the police, right after the war
I managed to keep some of my files.
Always glad to help a colleague.
Ah, here we are, inspector.
"Kupiecka, Maria.
Murdered. Unsolved. "
The suspects were...
Oh, yes. Yes, now I remember.
A German general was seen allegedly leaving her room.
And of all the generals in Warsaw, only three had no alibis for the night in question.
Here, this is the Lichnowsky Palace. 
It used to belong
to the Polish kings. 
Then later it became a museum. 
As you can see,
today it's still a museum. 
During the war,
the German headquarters
in Warsaw was located here. 
As I was saying,
we were quite thorough, I thought,
in the way we eliminated suspects. 
Had to proceed tactfully, of course. 
They were generals, after all,
and it was war. 
And Poland was occupied. 
SOLDIER:
Ready for inspection, sir.
One of them was
General von Seidlitz-Gabler,
7th Corps commander. 
He was a Junker of the old school. 
He lived like royalty in the palace,
with his wife and daughter. 
The night of the murder,
he was not in his quarters. 
His chief of staff,
Major General Klaus Kahlenberge
also had no alibi that night. 
Of all the generals,
he was the least disagreeable. 
An interesting man. 
No wife, no children. 
General Gabler, a message.
Yes?
A message from General Tanz, sir.
Thank you, Fräulein Neumaier.
It seems we have failed to keep proper order in the city.
You have read it?
Oh, yes.
And because of our notorious incompetence...
Incompetence?
They don't realize that this is a garrison post, that I am given only the dregs of the army, the misfits.
Well, that was General Tanz's word.
"Incompetence. "
Not to mention subordinates who shirk responsibility.
And because of our failure, the Führer has ordered
General Tanz to solve the problem of Warsaw.
How?
Meticulously.
In three phases.
Using the most drastic means, I suppose.
Drastic?
Monstrous.
LIESOWSKI: Lieutenant General Tanz
commanded the Nibelungen Division. 
He was the youngest
Wehrmacht general. 
A hero at Leningrad, a pet of Hitler,
a remarkable officer. 
We Poles detested him. 
He arrived in Warsaw on the day
the woman was killed. 
He, too, was unaccounted for
that night. 
First roadblock, set up there.
Yes, sir.
The sniping last night came from a street two blocks away.
The entire quarter is to be sealed off.
We shall take a leaf from the fisherman's book.
First, we'll mark out a wide perimeter, then we'll start combing the outlying streets.
That should set the fish in motion.
Of course, they'll try to make off in the opposite direction, but we'll have roadblocks there to cut them off.
By the time we've closed the net, we'll have them exactly where we want them.
With their backs to the ghetto wall.
Excuse me, general, what about the civilian population?
The latest estimate, this section of the city contains about 80,000 inhabitants.
One can hardly talk of a normal civilian population in this place.
I regard the experience to be gained from this operation as absolutely indispensable.
Hold it at 20.
Now, about those flamethrowers, sir, to be on the safe side, I've requested three times as many as needed.
What are you scared of, children?
I think they're hungry.
What food do we have?
Some sandwiches, sir.
Bring them to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, you're quite right, they do look hungry.
Poor little devils.
Your lunch, sir.
Open.
Yes, sir.
Filth.
[CHILDREN YELLING]
Your hands.
Look at those nails.
Not even Polish children should be given such muck.
Make a note.
Food and sweets to be carried at all times for the children.
It does no harm to win their confidence.
As for him, he's relieved as my orderly. Home leave cancelled.
Filthy pig. Last week he offered me an unwashed glass.
Now he enters my sight looking as though he just exhumed his grandmother with his bare hands.
Absolute cleanliness, that's what
I demand from the people around me.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
As for our immediate requirements, see they're fully met.
Once they are,
I shall seal off the district and put the inhabitants through a sieve.
All 80,000?
General Tanz, forgive me, but just as a matter of curiosity, what do you feel is the exact purpose of this exercise?
You've read the memorandum.
Oh, yes. Yes, I have...
And what does the memorandum say?
That phase one is intended to intimidate the population to search houses, to find and arrest resistance.
Then that is the exact purpose of the exercise.
An excellent plan, by the way. Much like my own when I first came here, only I was never given the ultimate authority to implement it.
But am I to understand that if there is resistance during phase one, you would then go to phase two and even to phase three, which would mean the destruction of the entire city?
You are to understand exactly that.
Well, uh, isn't that somewhat excessive?
Excessive.
You will be aware that we are
30 miles from Moscow.
We are moving ahead on a 5000-mile front.
Every available soldier is needed if we are to conquer Russia.
Yet here in Warsaw, three divisions are rotting, because of a few thousand criminal
Poles and Jews hiding in slums.
It is excessive to permit this state of affairs.
[KNOCKING]
Who is it?
You have my full list of requirements.
Eleanore, come in. Come in, my dear.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
My wife arrived early this morning from Berlin.
How was Berlin?
Eager to hear the good news that always follows in the wake of a good soldier.
When I heard you were with my husband, I came straight here.
I wanted to tell you myself what an inspiration you've been to us all at home.
I am flattered, ma'am.
Oh, no, I'm not flattering you.
I'm honoring you as you deserve.
If you're not too busy,
I shall need your help with the arrangements for the soiree tonight.
In your honor, General Tanz.
I'll look forward to it, ma'am.
Oh, incidentally, our daughter,
Ulrike, is here in Warsaw.
She'll be at the soiree too.
Yes?
Well, you remember her, don't you?
In Berlin, at the garden party at General Jodl's house.
Oh, yes, I do remember her.
My compliments, ma'am.
Sorry. I suppose that was obvious.
But you know how mothers are.
Anxious to become mothers-in-law, I should think.
A splendid officer, no doubt of that.
A mother would be proud to see her daughter...
Married to a war memorial?
Excuse me, ma'am.
I shall continue to study
General Tanz's plan.
With sinking heart.
I detest that man.
What does he mean,
"with sinking heart"?
Oh, the black book.
What were you saying, my dear?
I don't dare say anything when you've got your book out.
One must protect one's reputation.
Another mess like the one you've made here in Warsaw and you won't have a reputation to protect.
What's the date?
The 13th.
Fortunately, I still have some influence at Supreme Headquarters.
Indeed you have, for which I am grateful.
How nice that you are here at last.
I want to talk to you about Ulrike.
And I want to talk to you about the soiree tonight.
I think you should know that this morning Ulrike was extremely rude to me.
Considering where you are sending her, I'm not surprised.
[KNOCKING]
Excuse me, general, but there is a Major Grau from Intelligence.
He would like to see you.
What does he want?
He said it was personal.
He's most persistent.
Tell him, some other time.
Yes, sir.
By the way, what did you do to your uniform last night?
Do? To my uniform?
Yes, there was a stain on the jacket. A red stain.
But since you obviously didn't cut yourself shaving, it could only have been lipstick.
Shall I match the color with the seductive shade Fräulein Neumaier wears?
Don't be absurd.
Anyway, the evidence is destroyed.
I've sent everything to be cleaned.
Aren't you glad that I am here now to look after you?
Of course I am, dear Eleanore.
We are well-suited, aren't we?
[DOOR SLAMS]
I wish you'd remember to knock.
Sorry, sir.
Major Grau of Intelligence just rang from downstairs, sir. He asked to see you.
What about?
He wouldn't say, sir.
Tell him I'm busy.
I already told him, sir.
I took the liberty.
Good.
Well?
Apparently, he rang the motor pool this morning.
Wanted to see the log for last night to see if anyone had used the car.
I told the officer in charge that no information could be released without clearing it first with us.
Good. Yes, that's very good.
Thank you, sergeant.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Yes?
Sir, um, about my cousin Hartmann.
Your cousin Hartmann?
Yes, sir.
You have his record, sir.
On your desk, sir.
Oh, yes.
He's just out of hospital, sir.
He was wounded at Voronezh.
He's on temporary duty in Warsaw.
I had hoped that we could make his duty with us permanent.
And by some extraordinary coincidence, he's waiting in your office to see me.
Yes, sir.
Show him in.
Thank you, sir.
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal.
Reporting as ordered, sir.
At ease.
Well, it's a distinguished record, corporal.
I see from your press clippings,
Otto is obviously keeping a scrapbook for you.
I see that you are
"the reincarnation of Siegfried, a German hero from the golden age. "
Do you feel like Siegfried?
Well, I'm not at all certain, sir, how Siegfried felt.
Well, that's a sensible answer. I see they've given you the Iron Cross.
He killed 40 Russians single-handed, sir.
Splendid.
Well, now, as to your future,
I imagine that, as a university man, you'd want to become an officer.
Therefore, I shall be happy to send you to...
Erm...
You don't want to go to officers school?
I should prefer to remain a corporal, sir.
Actually, general, he doesn't mean that.
What he means is...
What do you mean?
I mean, I don't want to become an officer. That's all, sir.
I'm shattered.
My world is toppling.
What is the point of being a general when corporals prefer to be corporals?
He's still a bit shaky, after the hospital.
Yes, apparently.
Now, your cousin suggested that you join us here at headquarters, but I should think you'd be anxious to get back to the fighting.
No?
No, sir.
General, what he really means is...
Leave us, sergeant.
I, um...
I don't seem to understand you, corporal.
I want to survive, sir.
I want to live through the war.
Well, naturally. We all do.
But we are soldiers, we must fight.
Yes, sir. And I have.
And you don't want to go back.
Is this the " reincarnation of Siegfried"?
I'm sorry, sir, but I have a horror of death.
Even in a good cause?
Let me see now...
According to your papers, in civilian life you were a student at Dresden?
Music conservatory, yes, sir. I studied piano.
Music, piano, yes. Yes.
Yes. I think I have an assignment for you.
But one which requires great courage.
Only a man who has killed...
How many was it? Let me see.
Yes, 40 Russians single-handed, would be equal to the task.
Now, what about Chopin, wasn't he Polish?
Didn't he write the Polonaises?
Can you play them?
Yes, madam.
You don't sound very enthusiastic.
Well, madam, they were patriotic pieces, celebrating the glory of Poland.
Well, the glory of Poland isn't precisely what we're here to celebrate.
No, madam. So I thought that perhaps we might play...
Wagner.
I remember the Führer saying to me after a performance of Parsifal,
"There's no such thing as too much Wagner. "
After Parsifal?
I must say, it's unusual to find a fighting man who also knows about music.
Thank you, madam.
Oh, no, don't thank me, wait until I've thanked you.
And I won't until after the soiree.
I dislike being a bore, major.
You never bore me, Engel.
But I can't help wondering what you're trying to prove.
Just what do you think you're doing?
My job.
But if you say anything to any of them, he'll know...
The murderer will know that you're after him.
That's the point of the exercise.
Good evening, sergeant.
Sir.
But look, sir, why do you care who killed that bitch?
She's better off dead anyway.
Have you ever heard of the Eumenides?
The what?
Greek mythology.
A number of disagreeable ladies, sometimes known as the Furies.
They believe that spilled blood calls out for vengeance.
That's how justice began.
Well, we don't want it to end, do we, just because there's a war on?
Wait for me here.
I'm afraid I won't be long.
Mad.
MAN:
Grau.
Colonel Mannheim.
What on earth are you doing here?
You must be out of your mind.
If the generals won't see me,
I must come here to see them.
Well, God help you, Grau.
I won't.
Better have some champagne.
You'll need it.
You may be right, sir.
General Tanz, to my mind you're a model man in every respect.
Except one.
You've not married.
May I ask why not?
No opportunity. Greatly regret it.
Well, perhaps you've allowed opportunities to slip by.
My dear, General Tanz is a young man whose life has been spent as a soldier.
His generation has been denied the pleasures of domesticity.
We live in a period which makes great demands upon us.
Consequently, there is little time for what is commonly known as private life.
Quite right. Champagne, general?
Water.
Water?
A glass of water for General Tanz.
Ah. Here comes Ulrike.
You remember her from Berlin.
Good evening, general.
She's been with me over a year now, as a soldier.
An excellent soldier.
Thank you, Father.
I must say, I still find it hard to get used to the idea of young girls in the army.
We're building a new world order, and women should not be exempt from playing their part.
I knew you would understand, general.
Ulrike has now decided to become a nurse in a military hospital run by an order of nuns in Bavaria.
We're very proud of our girl.
Tell me, general, is it true that in the battle of Leningrad you used frozen bodies instead of sandbags for your artillery?
The story is exaggerated.
Oh, I am sorry.
Some soldiers lie and rot in the battlefield.
I thought it most imaginative, putting the dead to work, you might say.
Nobody rots with me.
Your water, general.
Thank you.
My compliments. I liked the bit about the frozen bodies.
Oh, thank you, general.
Be careful.
Ulrike has a most original way of expressing herself.
Needless to say, I shall miss not having her with me.
Then why let her go?
Come along, general, let's have some supper.
You'll join us, too,
Kahlenberge?
Courage.
Is not enough.
How dare you speak like that to General Tanz?
It serves you right, Mother, for what you're doing to me.
Whatever I do is for your own good.
I think only of you.
Only of me?
You have changed.
When did I begin to interest you so much?
Good evening.
You've become vicious.
Yes, it's the war, Mother.
Well, the nuns will soon improve your manners.
Suppose I refuse to go?
You will be ordered to go. I have seen to that already. You have no choice.
You really are a terrible woman, Mother.
I suppose we deserve each other.
Colonel Mannheim!
Good evening.
Yes, I'd love to dance with you.
In my memoirs,
I keep a record of everything.
Yours will be the place of honor in the Warsaw chapter.
GRAU:
General von Seidlitz-Gabler?
Sir.
Oh, yes, you are Major...?
Grau, Intelligence.
Under Colonel Mannheim.
I tried to see you today.
In fact, I tried to see each of you, without much success, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry, major, but general officers are sometimes busy, you know?
Of course.
What was it you wanted to see us about?
Last night, a prostitute was murdered.
A prostitute? That's an occupational hazard, isn't it?
When you hear the details, I'm sure you'll agree it's a unique case.
Unique?
You can't be serious.
We live in an age in which bodies lie around streets like cobblestones.
What's so unique about this case?
All right, all right, come to the point, major.
Last night, a woman was murdered.
Yes, general, in Bulkowa Street, number 27, fourth-floor apartment,
Maria Kupiecka, a prostitute, also one of our agents.
She was stabbed to death most brutally. Cut to pieces, in fact.
A charming story.
But what has that to do with us?
Preliminary investigation has established that each of you was... well, unaccounted for last night.
To whom should we be accountable, major?
I fail to see what my...
What our movements should have to do with you or with this woman's death.
Well, the murderer was seen leaving the woman's room.
In that case, you must know who he is.
Not exactly. The face was not visible, but the uniform was.
It was the uniform of a German officer.
In fact, a German general.
This is a serious charge.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Oh, yes, sir, my duty.
Then consider your duty done, major. Good night.
Are you, by any chance, using perfume?
I occasionally use a strong eau de cologne after shaving.
Good night, sir.
I will, of course, want to see each of you tomorrow, if I may, in line of duty.
It is quite possible we've been misled, but we don't want to leave any loose ends dangling, do we?
Until tomorrow.
Good night, generals.
Astonishing behavior!
Who invited him?
Not I.
Socially, Major Grau has not been a success.
I'm sorry, general.
I should have had him arrested.
Why? He was merely doing his duty.
Yes.
Well...
Now, there are some officers
I should like to present to you.
Some sauerbraten, general?
Make yourself comfortable, inspector.
This is my third restaurant in Berlin.
That's if you count the sausage shop I had down by the station right after the war.
We were really on our arse then.
Now look, Germany is booming.
We made it.
Well, come along, inspector, do sit down.
One large Munchen, please.
Now, then, you asked me about General Kahlenberge.
Well, I don't suppose there was anyone who knew him better than me.
Hartmann's doing a good job, isn't he, sir?
Yes. What?
Oh, yes! Apparently.
OTTO: Of course, inspector,
as I said before,
I haven't seen Hartmann
since the war. 
Don't want to see him,
after what he did. 
But I'll say one thing, he had the most
extraordinary effect on women. 
I don't know why. 
Well, he wasn't what you'd call
really handsome. 
Too skinny. 
But whatever it was he had,
it work ed out all right with women. 
I think they must have got together almost from the first moment they met. 
Well, things were like that
in the war. 
I remember once in Paris,
meeting this girl in the Metro. 
Well, anyway, you didn't waste time,
not with knowing maybe tomorrow
you'd be sent to the fronts or the damned Allies would drop a bomb on you. 
Oh, worry, I didn't mean that
about the Allies. 
After all, where would we be now
without Americans?
Nice.
I'd forgotten how nice.
Would you say there were no girls in Russia?
Girls? I was too scared.
I'm hopeless when I'm scared.
Well, it's a good thing
I don't scare you, isn't it?
Yes, it's just that this room makes me nervous.
Nervous?
Mm.
Oh, you have no sense of history.
Do you realize this used to be the bed of the king of Poland.
Did it really?
Mm-hm.
It's like sleeping on the floor.
It's freezing in here.
Ah, but the king and the queen never slept. They just made love.
They were never cold.
Do you like the war?
Do I like the war?
Good God, no. Do you?
If it weren't for the war, I'd be on the marriage circuit now, living on some army post, making conversation with dreary young officers.
Instead of making love with dreary young corporals.
Oh, not dreary. Not at all.
In fact, the best so far.
Oh?
Do you specialize in corporals?
No.
Only heroes like you.
Just think, all this bravery in my arms.
It must be very inspiring.
What's the matter?
You know, we mustn't like each other too much.
Why? Because I'm a corporal and you're a general's daughter?
No. It's because...
It's a man, a girl, a war.
Two boys I knew are already dead in Russia.
It's funny.
In the dark, you feel just like them to me.
And you like this war?
No. I like this.
[CLOCK CHIMES]
[ENGINE BACKFIRES]
No, no!
What's wrong?
Nothing. I thought they were firing at me.
You're shaking like a leaf.
I'm all right now.
What's it like having people try to kill you?
Noisy bastards.
Good morning.
Good morning, king of Poland.
What's it like having people try to kill you?
Well, what do you think it's like?
Terrible.
Yes.
I'm glad...
Well, I'm glad that you're here.
So am I.
But you'll be going back soon,
I suppose?
Not if I can help it, I won't.
Can you bear the truth?
Probably not.
I'm a fraud.
Impossible.
When they opened fire on us at Voronezh, I ran away.
It's as simple as that.
Then, I've no idea how, I was hit.
It was like a door slamming in my head, and I thought I was dead.
Next thing I remember waking up in the hospital and there was this general congratulating me on having killed 40 Russians single-handed.
You see, they were all killed that day, the whole company.
Everyone was killed except me, and I suppose it didn't look too good in dispatches, a whole company being wiped out, so they decided to make a hero of the survivor.
The one who ran away.
So now what do you think of all that bravery?
Well, that's a lovely story.
I think it's marvelous.
Marvelous?
Yes.
For once, the joke's on them.
Come, make love to the queen of Poland.
I must say you are, well, unexpected.
It's lucky we met.
What's lucky is right now.
You know, when this war is over...
Mm-mm. It will never end.
Well, what happened?
Did you see them?
Generals Gabler and Kahlenberge are in conference and cannot be disturbed.
I told you they wouldn't see you.
Where's General Tanz?
Look, why don't we forget about this?
It's not as if we don't have other things to do.
Where's General Tanz?
In the old city, conducting a tactical exercise.
I don't trust him.
Naturally, in the field, he must use his discretion.
He has no discretion.
He is ruthless.
Now, now, you exaggerate.
He will only go to phase two if phase one should prove to be a failure.
What is a failure?
Well, if the Poles, the Jews try to retaliate.
What constitutes retaliation, a rock thrown at his golden head?
Is that sufficient warrant for the demolition of the city?
You always overstate things,
Kahlenberge.
General Tanz is a responsible officer...
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
Sorry, sir. Colonel Mannheim to see General Kahlenberge, sir.
We'll discuss this later.
And don't worry about Tanz.
I'll take care of him.
Colonel Mannheim, sir.
You wanted to see me, general.
Yes, yes.
Yes, I did, colonel.
I wanted to see you about...
Damn it, what was it about?
Yes.
Yes, I remember now.
You have an officer on your staff, a Major Grau.
Halt! Halt!
Major Grau to see General Tanz.
Major Grau?
Just a minute, sir.
Get me CP,
Colonel Sandauer, urgent.
Roadblock 4 calling CP.
Roadblock 4 calling CP.
Can you hear me? Over.
Get your hands up.
Hands up.
SOLDIER 1: Colonel Sandauer on the line, sergeant.
Colonel Sandauer, there's a Major Grau here.
Wants to see the general.
My orders were...
What? Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
You may pass, major.
Stop!
Go ahead.
Well, at least you have one friend.
So it would seem.
Hands up!
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Have them over here.
Over here. Over here.
Get back!
Name?
First name?
Profession?
Halt!
Major Grau.
Go ahead, sir.
Wait for me here.
This is Wehrmacht's radio unit assigned to the Reich's general government of Poland.
This broadcast is coming to you directly from Warsaw.
A few yards from where I am, I see
General Tanz, the hero of Leningrad.
He is conducting maneuvers in the streets of the city.
An entire area is being temporarily evacuated in the interest of public order and safety.
Sector one reports phase one successful.
Sector three, no resistance encountered.
Thank you, Sandauer.
ANNOUNCER: The soldiers, of course, are dedicated to their commander.
He is a superb craftsman of war and his presence alone inspires men to extraordinary valor.
The exercise is being carried out with meticulous precision according to plan.
The population is extremely cooperative and friendly.
SANDAUER: Sector four reports phase one operative.
Sector two, flamethrowers ready to action.
Phase one to continue until further orders.
Yes, sir.
All sectors, from commanding general, phase one to continue until further orders.
Main sector, flamethrowers ready, sir.
Go ahead.
Forward march.
General Tanz?
A few more minutes.
SOLDIER 2: Halt!
SOLDIER 3: Stop!
Get him!
Stop! Fire!
[GUNSHOTS]
Sandauer!
SANDAUER: Sir?
Stand by for phase two.
Phase two, sir?
Stand by for phase two.
Yes, sir.
Notify all units.
Phase one completed.
Stand by for phase two.
Yes, sir.
CP to all sectors, stand by for phase two.
Phase two!
Phase two.
Yes, sir. Phase two.
Phase two.
Fire!
Fire!
Now the major may put his questions.
He's gone, sir.
That maniac is blowing up half the city.
Let's go.
Did you say there was no real resistance?
No, I was there.
One shot from one sniper, that was all, and he blows up the city!
Now, now, we're not the generals.
It is their business, you know, not ours.
We're here just to keep the papers moving.
And yours have arrived.
Congratulations.
For what?
You've been promoted to lieutenant colonel.
Promoted?
And transferred to Paris as of this date.
Lucky fellow.
Transferred, but why?
Who signed the transfer?
General Gabler, naturally.
What are you doing?
I'm going to find out where the order originated.
On whose recommendation here.
Calm down. I've already checked.
General Kahlenberge.
He recommended your transfer.
Did he indeed?
You must have made quite an impression last night.
It would seem so.
Thank you, colonel.
It's just as well, you know.
That's a matter of opinion.
Above all, Major Grau, not too much zeal.
I have a zealous nature, sir. I can't help it.
Yes, inspector, I was in Warsaw with General Tanz.
And I resent those cheap journalists who try to make him out to be some sort of inhuman monster. He was not.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Forgive me, inspector. We hire a lot of foreigners nowadays.
We can't get Germans any more, not for real work.
I've seen General Tanz in the field, with the wounded, the dying.
He was extraordinary.
Compassionate, gentle.
Do you know that after Leningrad,
Hitler ordered the general not to expose himself to enemy fire.
Of course, he found this a great hardship. He was only happy in battle.
[KNOCKING]
Yes?
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Ah, gracias. Gracias.
I'm also learning Spanish.
Well, soon everything will be automated.
Except the manager, of course.
And then in July 1944, we were transferred to Paris.
The Allies were in Normandy by then and Hitler ordered us to stop them in front of Paris.
We nearly did too, except that the army was betrayed, as usual.
But we mustn't talk politics.
It's bad for business, isn't it?
You asked me about Paris.
It was a paradise to us,
particularly after Russia. 
I remember that summer
as though it were yesterday. 
The empty streets,
the heat, the quiet. 
Everything cheap. 
By the way, I was in Paris last
summer, and my God, the prices. 
When they gave me my hotel bill,
I couldn't believe it. 
But in July '44,
Paris was still our city. 
I suppose that's a tactless thing
to say, but we did love Paris. 
In any case, General Tanz and I
were due to arrive on July 20th. 
But at the last moment, the general
decided to come a few days early. 
So I sent a messenger to 7th Corps
headquarters at Versailles
to say that we would be in Paris
on the 17th. 
I think you know why I'm giving you
the exact dates. 
As it turned out, it was a good thing
we arrived when we did. 
However, there were those
who were not at all pleased
to learn of our early arrival. 
Thank you, that will be all.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Oh, I shall be with General Gabler in the War Room.
What about my pass?
Is it all right?
For God's sake, relax!
Operation Hartmann, phase one, will begin tomorrow, 18 July, at 0915 when the lance corporal reports to the railway station.
With a car.
With a car duly requisitioned from the motor pool.
Phase two, the lance corporal will then meet the secret consignment from Berlin.
Then?
Then phase three.
A 24-hour pass for the lance corporal will begin tomorrow at noon.
You've got it?
Here.
A corporal and a general's daughter.
You know, you really are asking for trouble.
But it's your funeral, not mine!
OFFICER: The British second army has been advancing towards the left, trying to cut off two of our panzer divisions from our main supply route.
During the last 48 hours, the enemy has succeeded in crossing the Ohm River, here and here.
However, we were able to stop them here, with help from the
12th SS Panzer Division, which is counterattacking at the moment.
Well?
Now what do we do?
To be precise, what do you do?
We. You're in this too.
General Gabler.
The field marshal will see you at 4:00.
Thank you, major.
I admit that it's inconvenient for you.
It's a good deal more than that. Why?
Just why is General Tanz arriving three days earlier than was planned?
You suspect something odd?
He comes straight from Hitler.
Isn't that odd enough?
I want to hear this.
The American 1st Army occupied the town of Saint-Claude.
Our troops are withdrawing to new positions south and southeast.
GRAU: General Gabler,
General Kahlenberge.
I never had the opportunity to thank you for my promotion.
I'm sorry. Grau,
Intelligence, Warsaw 1942.
Oh, yes, yes.
Good to see you again, colonel.
You once had the vision to transfer me to Paris.
We do our best to give pleasure, colonel. Good day.
I understand we're soon to be joined by General Tanz.
Quite like old times.
Excuse me.
I just wanted to greet you.
General.
Tiresome fellow.
Strange, isn't it?
Everybody seems to be aware that Tanz is coming here.
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
Obviously not.
It's always disagreeable when the cat gets back to find the mice have been playing.
We could, of course, distract the cat by suggesting that he take a few days off to play a little too.
Particularly after all...
After all that you've been through, my dear general, these past few months in Russia,
I know it must have been perfect hell for you.
I want 4,000 men by the end of the week.
And you shall have them.
Your Colonel Sandauer has been working closely with General Kahlenberge.
We are scraping the sides of the barrel, but you'll have 4,000.
Meanwhile, why don't you take a few days off?
Rest a bit, see the sights of Paris. It's your first visit.
I want only combat troops, no decaying old men or children.
Yes, sir. We are making good progress, General Kahlenberge and I.
After all, it may be your last chance to see Paris.
It may be anyone's last chance. Such a pity.
A necessity.
But of course.
Of course it's necessary.
Stern measures, the only thing people respect.
All I'm suggesting is that you leave everything to us.
A commander does not...
And your excellent Colonel Sandauer.
We've arranged a suite for you at the... Kahlenberge?
At your hotel.
At the Excelsior.
You'll have a car, a driver and whatever else strikes your fancy.
One must relax occasionally, general.
I can't afford to.
You give me no alternative but to compel you to enjoy yourself.
Must I order you?
Because if I must,
I'm afraid I shall have to.
Yes, sir.
Evidently, you are not ready for me.
Very well.
I shall devote one day to seeing the city.
I shall return to headquarters at
0800 hours on the morning of the 19th.
Heil, Hitler.
GABLER:
Heil Hitler.
Well, that wasn't so bad.
You now have one day's grace.
We need two, until the 20th.
Come and have dinner with me and Eleanore tomorrow.
Ulrike's arriving.
This is bad luck.
Naturally, she forgot to say which train she'd be on.
I assume you are with us now.
In spirit, of course, but...
You'll have to make up your mind. Soon.
Making up one's mind is one thing, speaking it is another.
You worry too much.
Patience is one of the few virtues that I possess.
At ease.
Sergeant, get me the military governor's office on the telephone.
Corporal?
Sir.
I have an assignment for you.
Come in.
Get me the military governor's office.
For General Kahlenberge.
You're to stay with him every minute of the day.
24-hour call, do you understand?
Yes, sir.
He may want to go out at night.
Do you know anything which might interest General Tanz?
Nightclubs or girls, that sort of thing.
A few, sir.
But I don't really know what the general's taste is, sir.
Let us hope that whatever it is, it is not you, corporal.
However, if it should be, remember that you're serving the fatherland.
I'll try to remember, sir.
Should he ask you to take him to his headquarters, you are to telephone me.
Either here or at my hotel.
Yes, sir.
You'll report to Colonel Sandauer for specific instructions.
Sir?
What is it, corporal?
I'm sorry, but I was supposed to have a 24-hour leave starting tomorrow.
That's impossible.
Could I have one hour free in the morning, sir?
No.
Sir.
Hartmann?
Sir?
This is important.
All right.
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes. Childhood diseases?
Measles.
I can't remember.
Nothing serious, I think.
Chickenpox.
Bed-wetting?
No, sir.
Fear of the dark?
No, not particularly.
Venereal disease?
No, sir.
Good.
Now, what about books?
Books?
Do you read books?
Yes, sir, I read books.
What?
War and Peace. 
Nietzsche,
The Decline of the West.
Books on psychology, pathology?
No, not much.
Show me your hands.
All right. Now, you'll have a room assigned to you in the general's hotel.
He'll want to see the principal sights of Paris.
You will prepare an itinerary and submit it to me.
When not in the field, the general goes to bed at 11:45.
He seldom drinks or smokes, so you will probably have an early evening.
Now, this is my private number, in case you should need me.
Need you, sir?
If anything out of the ordinary should happen, ring me immediately.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Incidentally, avoid all cemeteries, tombs, any mention of death.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Inspector Morand, please.
Third floor, room 158.
Who shall I say is here?
Thank you. I can find my own way.
[SPEAKS FRENCH]
Welcome, Colonel Grau, to the spider's web.
How did you know it was me?
What other German colonel would enter unannounced?
Almost any SS colonel would.
Actually, I saw you reflected in the window.
Impossible, it's too dirty.
I hope you're not allergic to dust.
Old crimes, colonel.
They generate a good deal of dust.
Unsolved crimes.
The dust has settled.
We can always unsettle it.
Is that why you came?
Do sit down, colonel.
I must apologize for the heat, but it's nearly August, when most Parisians leave Paris.
Let's hope Germans have the good sense to do the same.
Saint-Lô fell to the Allies this morning.
BBC?
Coffee?
No, thank you.
You have dossiers on everyone, don't you?
On everyone interesting.
German as well as French?
At the specific request of German Intelligence, we keep an occasional eye on interesting Germans.
Like me?
I have always found you interesting.
Thank you.
What about German generals?
Well, what about them?
Generals are interesting?
Then, to the degree that they are interesting, we keep an eye on them too.
Good. Here are the names of three generals.
I want to know everything about them.
Everything may be too much.
What specifically are you looking for?
One of them is a murderer.
Only one?
But murder is the occupation of generals.
Let's say what is admirable on the large scale is monstrous on the small.
Since we must give medals to mass murderers, let us try to give justice to the small entrepreneur.
Nicely put. I shall be glad to help you if I can.
I realize that nothing is free in this world, even between colleagues.
Especially between colleagues.
In exchange for your information,
I shall arrange for the release from prison of three French resistance.
Thank you.
Have you a favorite suspect?
Not really, no.
You see, on the night of the murder, each general had something to conceal.
The night of the murder was...?
December the 12th,
1942, Warsaw.
And just as I started my investigation,
I was transferred to Paris.
By the murderer?
Possibly.
For two years, I've wanted to reopen the case.
Now I can. As of today, all three are in Paris.
General Gabler.
He's partial to the sort of girl who was killed.
Oh, a girl. A crime of passion, as we say.
Passion, yes, but only in the sense of your distinguished Marquis de Sade.
Oh, a sex crime, I see.
Is that why this case excites you?
The girl was also a German agent.
She may have been killed because of something she knew.
That's why Kahlenberge intrigues me the most.
He seems to have no private life and yet he disappears from time to time.
No one knows where or why.
And General Tanz?
A perfect maniac.
I saw him destroy an entire quarter of
Warsaw for the sheer pleasure of it. 
On the Eastern front,
he was known as The Butcher. 
He lost most of his division
in Russia. 
He revels in death. 
Which is why, in a curious way,
I don't think he's the man
I'm looking for. 
Anyone who has the power to destroy
a city whenever he chooses
does not need such minor sport
as killing a girl. 
I could be wrong, of course. 
Hartmann?
Yes.
I'm Sergeant Kopatski, the general's orderly.
For the time being, that is.
I forgot to take his laces out before cleaning his shoes this morning.
For God's sake, where are your gloves?
You'll get finger marks on it.
I haven't got gloves.
They never told me.
Take mine.
These are the general's holiday rations.
One bottle of cognac, one Thermos of coffee at 40 degrees centigrade, two hundred cigarettes.
Does the general drink?
Like a sponge, only he never shows it.
Put the briefcase on the back seat.
On the right side.
Whenever he leaves the car, clean out the ashtrays.
He smokes like a chimney.
Clean everything in sight.
Clean everything out of sight, including the engine.
If you don't, he'll tear your head off.
It's now one second to 9:00.
Here he comes.
I've given him full instructions, sir.
Name?
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal, sir.
Show the general your hands.
Well, don't stand there like a fool.
Put your gloves on.
He seems to know Paris.
He's prepared an itinerary of the sights of the city. I have endorsed it.
I shall see you tomorrow morning at headquarters.
Yes, general.
Sergeant Kopatski is relieved as my orderly.
This morning he smeared polish on my shoelaces.
Fourteen days confined to barracks.
Yes, general.
We've just passed the Place Vendôme, sir.
The column is 142 feet high and was erected in 1810.
It's made of bronze from 1200 cannon captured at Austerlitz.
There's a statue of Napoleon on the top.
In front of us, sir, the Tuileries Gardens.
The Tuileries Palace used to be in the middle of the gardens.
In 1792, at the time of the French Revolution, the Paris mob attacked the palace, forcing the king and queen to escape.
It was burnt down in... in 1871.
We are now coming into Place de la Concorde.
One of the most beautiful squares in Paris.
It was here, in the middle of the square that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were beheaded during the revolution.
The guillotine was there, in the centre, where the obelisk is now.
Keep your eye on the road, corporal.
Yes, sir.
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
Fräulein Gabler?
Yes.
I'm Sergeant Kopke from your father's headquarters.
How did they know which train I was on?
They didn't.
May I?
You see, I'm Hartmann's cousin.
We got no secrets, Hartmann and me.
More like brothers, really.
He's all right, isn't he?
All right? Never better.
No, it's just at the last moment he was assigned to drive General Tanz.
Only for today. That's why he couldn't meet you.
Well, how are things in the fatherland?
Any cities left after all the bombing?
A few, yes, here and there.
There's one good thing about Paris.
It's an open city, no bombs.
I hate bombs.
This way, Fräulein Gabler.
I have a car for you just outside.
I'll take you to your father's hotel.
Hartmann's staying there too.
With General Tanz, just for tonight.
So I suppose you'll run into him sooner or later, in the lobby or something.
The gallery is shut to the public, sir.
But special permission has been granted for you to see the paintings.
Most of them have been confiscated and assembled here before being sent to Germany.
General Tanz.
You've been notified.
Yes, corporal.
Here's all the information.
On your right, sir, paintings by Boucher, the 18th-century
French master.
All these paintings have been selected for Reichsmarschall Goering.
What's in there?
Paintings requisitioned from private collections by the reichsmarshcall. 
What kind of paintings?
Modern, sir, and some impressionists.
Decadent?
I suppose so, sir.
HARTMANN:
Light.
Toulouse-Lautrec, Le Divan.
Renoir, Nude, painted in 1910.
Gauguin, On the Beach, from his Tahitian period.
Another Nude by Renoir.
Soutine, Le Garcon d'etage.
Degas, The Tub, painted in 1886.
Van Gogh, Vincent, Self-Portrait. 
Sometimes called
Vincent in Flames, painted while in an insane asylum during the last years of his life.
Here, sir, a painting by Cézanne.
How dare you touch me?
Excuse me, sir, but...
Never do that again!
I told you to get out.
Then why did you marry me?
I told you I was sorry.
Damn it!
A raft.
Damn it.
Salt!
It is.
Wait!
Hey, wait!
Damn it!
Come down!
You rascal!
Damn it!
You will be dead soon!
No.
Look, all I want is some water.
You got plenty there.
Enough for everybody.
You know, they got rescue boats out looking for me... and if I tell them that you wouldn't give me any water...
Boy, they're sure gonna give it to you.
I mean...
Come on.
Just some water?
Damn it!
Come on out, Yankee!
Come on and get it!
Damn it!
Come and get it!
Come on and get it.
You'll be sorry!
Quiet!
Shut up!
I said shut up!
Just a closer walk with thee
Nearer my God
All clear to thee
When I fail, I feel so bad
Sir.
Now hear this!
"Watchman...
"what of the night?"
I am real strong, but thou art weak
Damn it, dirty.
Damn it.
Dirty.
Yes!
Okay.
Yes. Yeah.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Get up!
Stand up!
Stand! Stand up!
Under the name of the Imperial Japanese Navy...
I demand absolute obedience as a prisoner of war.
You understand?
Don't look!
Don't look over here.
I said don't look!
I will tear your eyeballs out!
I said don't look!
Win a few, lose a few.
Keep going.
I have this.
Tweet-tweet.
Let's see now.
"The Gourmet's Guide."
"The wild form of the water chestnuts.
"It is often found..."
"Reference, Figure 33."
Well, that's enough of that, all right.
"Enemy personnel and unfriendly natives.
"A man fighting for survival in a jungle...
"is in no position to maintain prisoners of war.
"Destroy them if they are captured.
Immediately."
Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
Okay.
Don't you understand? I throw, you go.
Right? Fetch.
You get the point?
You're the dog, I'm the guy. Right?
Look. You ready?
Right?
Fetch!
Look, you do it this time. I'm tired.
Okay, I'll show you one more time.
And never again, right?
You understand that?
What is he doing? Fool.
Then you pick up the stick, right?
Then you bring it back.
There's nothing tough about that.
What's so tough about that?
You gonna do it, or ain't you gonna do it?
I don't know. Some guys never learn.
I don't know.
You know, it's just ridiculous.
Okay, we'll try it once more.
One, two, three. You go, right?
I know. Okay, look.
Right?
You understand what I'm talking about?
I am sick and tired! I've done everything!
I feed you. I fish for you!
I take you to the head, and what do you do?
You just sit down and get fatter!
I'm not putting up with any of that anymore!
So from now on out, you can do the cooking, 'cause I am through!
Oh, boy.
Well, do something!
Hey!
Damn it!
What are you trying to do?
Give it back!
Fifty-fifty, right?
I said give it back. Why don't you go and get some for yourself?
You damn thief!
That is my log!
It's my log. Not yours. Mine!
It's my log.
That is my log!
Look, if I told you once,
I told you a thousand times!
That is my log. Now keep your hands off it!
You want my log, you can have it!
I said you can have it!
Look, you can do anything you want to do around here.
But just don't be sneaky about it.
'Cause I can't stand a sneak!
You wanna build a raft, build a raft!
A raft.
You call that thing a raft?
It's a piece of junk!
Now, you wanna build a raft... you gotta talk to somebody who knows how to do it.
You wanna build a raft?
Look.
"Sailing, sailing over the bounding main."
Raft.
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.
Okay.
Yeah.
This is a map of the Pacific Ocean.
Do you wanna build a raft?
A raft.
And you're in it, so that's...
This is you in a raft. And you wanna go...
Now, you gotta have some floatation, like bamboo.
Where did you get all your bamboo?
Well, where do you find it?
Throw them high, old man.
We have to have a lubber line.
It goes straight through the keel.
Otherwise, the ship goes either way.
Nobody knows...
No! I said no!
You're not listening to me.
But we gotta do it.
Use these bamboos here.
Come on, come over here!
All right, take these bamboos and select only the big ones... and put them together in bundles.
Then make the basic frames with them.
The frames.
No, you're not listening.
And we put this mast...
You have to have a couple of sweeps down the side, and a tail. Otherwise... around the one-third of the raft's length from the aft.
That is the basic plan.
You gotta have something strong enough to get through the reef!
I'm telling you.
If you keep talking like an amateur, we'll never make it!
I can't talk any sense to that guy.
This is our island.
In our north-east-north... there must be a big island.
North-east-north.
If we go north-east-north riding a good tide... we should find a big island.
Let's get out of here as soon as we can.
Let's do it.
What do you want me to do?
If we stay here, both of us will be dead for sure.
How many times do I have to tell you?
You might as well dry up on this island and drop dead!
Not me. I'm not going to die.
No, not me!
Now wait, don't get mad. Okay.
All right.
All right, we build a raft.
Down in the canebrake, close by the mill
There lived a colored girl
And her name was Nancy Dill
I told her that I loved her
I loved her mighty fine
And if she would come with me
I soon would make her mine
Come along, come
Won't you come along with me?
And I'll take you down to Tennessee
Come along, come
Won't you come along with me?
And I'll take you down to Tennessee
The mast!
Hold this with your other hand!

Island!
Hey, island!
Hey, is anybody there?
Anybody home?
Hello!
Are there any Japanese?
It's Japanese.
Any Japanese troops here?
Pipe down!
Be quiet, that's a Japanese camp.
Any Japanese troops here?
I am a navy captain, Kuroda!
Any Japanese troops here?
Navy Captain Tsuruhiko Kuroda!
Isn't there anybody here?
No!
Don't shoot!
He's my friend! Hold your fire!
Don't shoot!
What's the password?
We don't know the password!
Don't shoot!
Hold your fire!
We surrender!
No!
For a second, I thought you were a Jap.
Oh, yes.
Jesus.
Hey, white beard!
Come up here.
I found food. I got sake, too.
Look, I got some cigarettes, and some malted milk tablets... and a lot of other junk, too.
White beard, let's have a shave.
Then you are indeed the true
Kuroda Samurai
What's the matter?
My log!
Look, never talk to anybody that close in the face. It's rude.
You might have bad breath or something.
Yeah, I'll let you go home.
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
And there he is, the Zero.
Then I get all laced up.
I'm smoking and burning. I'm going down.
So now I know I gotta ditch the thing, see, in the water?
Forget it, all right?
When you hit the water like that, you flip and it's over.
It worked out okay. So, boom, down I go.
The canopy's open, of course, and so then I bail out... and that's when I pull the life raft and...
Thank you very much.
How about you sing a song or something?
It didn't make any difference, anyway.
My crew was already dead.
What's the matter?
Sing.
Okay, I will do it, then.
When I go on sea
I will become a corpse in water
When I go on hills
I will become a corpse with moss
If my spirit can be near the Emperor
I would not be regretful about myself
I'm sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to...
All right, don't worry.
We have plenty of sake.
Here, have some more.
Thank you.
You know, I was thinking...
Suppose I ask you...
Well, I guess it doesn't make much difference anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah. You know, they told me...
You know, how come you guys don't believe in God?
You listening?
No God? Why don't you...
God!
Will you listen to me?
God.
Why don't you?
I'm talking to you.
G-O-D, God!
Heaven? Christ?
Jesus Christ!
Shut up.
What?
Shut up!
I said God.
You'd better watch how you talk to me.
Be quiet!
Be quiet!
You son of a bitch!
You rotten bastard!
There are times when it's not pleasant
to see your picture in the paper.
This was one of them.
The article was direct
and to the point.
It said that Cordell Hull, the secretary
of state for the United States,
had released a list
of certain Swedish citizens
who had been giving economic aid
and comfort to the Axis powers.
In other words, I was considered
a Nazi collaborator.
I had been trading with Germany.
There was no secret about it.
I'd been importing oil for years
from all over the world.
That was my business.
And even now with the war on,
there was nothing illegal about it.
Sweden was neutral
and traded with both sides.
When I went to my office that
morning, I received a call
from a friend of my brother's who
was in Stockholm on business.
He was staying at the Grand Hotel.
I went over.
I knew the blacklist would be
printed in the American papers,
and it was sure to embarrass my
brother and parents
who lived in New York.
I wanted to explain
a few things to this man
so that he could take
back my side of the story.
The lobby of the Grand
was a busy place.
Like Lisbon and Istanbul
and other neutral cities,
Stockholm was crowded with what
were euphemistically called "visitors".
They came
from every country
and babbled away
in a dozen different tongues.
Some were there to buy Swedish
ball bearings and Bofors guns,
and the rest were espionage
agents trying their best
to see that the shipments
never reached their destinations.
Come in, come in.
Sorry not to have finished,
I slept late.
- Let me take your things.
- I'll put them here, thanks.
- May I offer you something?
- No, thank you.
Please sit down.
- You're British.
- Have been for years.
You didn't sound it on the phone.
I didn't call.
Cigarette?
Thank you.
- How's that brother of mine?
- I really don't know.
You see, I've never met your brother.
Oh, I say, this is a delicious bit of bacon.
You must forgive me for using the "friend of the family" approach.
I didn't want you to tell anyone you were coming to meet a stranger on business you knew nothing about.
Who are you?
I'm one of the few so-called intelligence agents who's not in the lobby at the moment.
But, so far as the hotel, immigration and taxi drivers are concerned,
I'm here to buy special steel products.
Please remember that, in case anyone should ask you.
Now that I'm here, what do you want?
Why, you're in a bit of a mess over this blacklist, aren't you?
I'm a Swedish citizen.
Sweden is neutral.
She trades with both sides.
Every drop of oil I import is turned
over to the Swedish government.
Every ton has
been contracted for.
And that's what they refuse to understand.
You don't know too much about my background but...
I think I do.
You were born in New York...
He knew things about me
that even I'd forgotten.
And he ticked them
off like a telegraphic report.
Graduated Cornell.
Oil salesman,
Yokohama and Shanghai.
Transferred to Stockholm, 1927.
Started my own business, 1929.
Largest importer
of German oil in Scandinavia.
When I tried to explain the reason
for doing business with Germans,
he cut me off short.
I'm not here to debate your case.
I'm here to ask you one question:
Would you like to get off the blacklist?
Well, naturally.
I think I can arrange that.
Provided you cooperate.
Not now, of course.
When the war is over, you'll be given a clean bill of health, retroactively.
You're from US Intelligence?
No, not...
Not really.
I'm sort of lend-lease in reverse, if you know what I mean.
Since I've had more experience in recruiting, they thought it best that
I had a go at you.
Besides, the Americans don't seem to trust you very much.
And for the oddest of reasons.
Simply because you gave up US citizenship in 1930.
When I decided to spend the rest of my life here,
I thought it only decent to become a Swedish subject.
Of course.
Are you interested, Mr. Erickson?
That all depends.
- What do I have to do?
- Oh, nothing much really.
Just a businessman keeping his eyes and ears open.
You know more about German oil than anyone in Sweden.
And you travel back and forth on business.
Occasionally.
You're making a trip tomorrow, I believe.
Baron von Oldenbourg, of the German Oil Commission,
- is an old friend of yours.
- That's right.
You may be able to pick up some useful information here and there.
Now I think I understand why I was put on the blacklist.
So I'd be forced to cooperate with you.
Oh, now, Erickson.
You don't honestly think we'd do a thing like that?
Oil will undoubtedly be one of the deciding factors of this war.
When they can't put planes in the air or tanks into the field, it'll be the end.
You might be able to help.
Being a Swede, I would be violating my country's neutrality.
If Swedish Security Police find out about it, they'd throw me in jail.
And we won't be able to help.
For diplomatic reasons we'll have to say we never heard of you.
And of course, if the Germans catch you, they'll shoot you.
So you're asking me to risk my life to get off a blacklist that I didn't deserve to be on in the first place.
It's not a very enviable position, is it?
Collins, I always thought that oil was a dirty business without scruples.
- But you people are...
- I couldn't care less what you think.
Fortunately, in this work, people don't have to love each other.
My job is information, and in order to get it, I will deal with thieves, liars, procurers, traitors, sluts, the lot.
I don't care if you're Goebbels' half brother or if you sell heroin.
You just bring back the information, and we'll get along splendidly.
Let's leave it that way.
Tell them you got me in a vise and
I'm going along to save my business.
Good.
We'll see you after this trip, then we decide where we go from there.
Any questions?
No.
Yes, one.
How does a person get to be so cold-blooded?
Watching German planes bomb
London helps enormously.
Well, what do you think?
How do we know he won't go to German legation and tell them?
We don't.
It'd be a perfect spot for high-class double-dealing.
That's why I wanted that recording.
If he tries to work both sides of the street, you can have that fall into the hands of the Swedish Security Police.
Now I can eat in comfort.
The next day, I flew
to Berlin to see the baron.
I'd been there many times
since the war began,
but this trip was different.
Now that I had something to hide,
I felt every passenger staring at me,
that every gun
was trained on me,
and every man in uniform
was suspicious.
The baron was there
to meet me.
After dropping my bag at the hotel,
he took me to dinner at Wannsee.
You can expect to hear that your imports will be cut even more.
Baron von Oldenbourg?
Frau Möllendorf.
A pleasant surprise.
How nice to see you again.
May I present an old and dear friend, Eric Erickson.
- How do you do?
- Are you alone? Will you join us?
No, I'm meeting
General Bacher and his wife.
- But I seem to be a few minutes early.
- Then please wait here.
- May I offer you some sherry or...?
- No. No, thank you.
Erickson?
You must be Swedish.
Yes. From Stockholm.
I just arrived.
And will you be with us long?
Afraid I have to leave tomorrow morning.
Oh, that's a pity. Just now when the weather's so good.
I wish I could say the same for my business.
I have just had the unpleasant task of telling Mr. Erickson that our petroleum exports are going to have to be reduced.
Oh, but I'm certain that's only temporary.
The moment the Russians are whipped, and that can't be long, the führer will be generous with Sweden again.
Would you mind coming to Stockholm and telling my investors that?
But surely, your countrymen are more than willing to make such a small sacrifice to beat Russia.
After all, she's been your enemy as well as ours for a long...
Oh, here they are.
Sorry to have interrupted your little business conversation.
Not at all. It's the most pleasant moment I've had since I arrived.
Well, perhaps when you come to Berlin again, we'll have another talk.
Looking forward to it.
Good evening.
Sorry, Eric.
She and her husband are...
She gets around quite a bit.
In Germany today, it's wise to be nice to such a person.
You never know into whose ear she'll be whispering next.
I'm sorry about your oil, Eric.
Well, I know if there's anything to be done, you'd do it.
The shortages in the coming year are going to be more acute than anyone is willing to admit.
I'm doing a survey now on the possibility of building refineries in Italy and France.
But the only trouble is, they'd be more open to bombings and sabotage than our own.
Suddenly, a solution occurred
to me. The baron was interested.
If they wanted
bombproof refineries,
what about building
one in a neutral country?
Sweden.
The moment I got back to
Stockholm, I told the plan to Collins,
who immediately
spotted the one big flaw.
The Swedish government would never approve.
It would hardly be considered a neutral act by the Allies.
That's the weakness.
And von Oldenbourg pounced on it.
Maybe you could arrange for the
Allies not to object too strenuously.
How far do you think you could nurse this along before it'd collapse?
Oh, with discussion of finance and construction,
I'd say...
...five or six more trips.
Provided the German officials here in Stockholm don't torpedo the idea from the start.
Since I'm American-born, they don't trust me...
...any more than you do.
No.
Perhaps you might have to spend time in developing a little character... or the lack of it.
What I mean to say is this, that now that you are on the blacklist, wouldn't it be logical to express your anger and indignation by beginning to say some nasty things about the Allies?
And from there, the Germans wouldn't be too surprised if you gradually became pro-Nazi.
The people who know me would never believe it.
You wouldn't be the first businessman to let profit color his politics.
The best friend I have is a Jew.
Max Gumpel.
For a time, you'll hurt one Jew deeply.
You might help save the lives of thousands.
You'll be hated for a while, no doubt about that. You'll be a quisling.
And you'll just have to live with it.
You won't be able to tell anyone.
Not even my wife?
This is more than I bargained for.
I know. That's the trouble with this sort of work.
The simplest little thing often leads to such complications.
- When do you have to know?
- I take the plane to London tonight.
The Americans take over from here.
Heavens, I'll have to rush.
Don't become pro-Nazi too fast, Erickson.
Handle it slowly and subtly.
I haven't said I'd do it yet.
Oh, but I think you will.
We have a most interesting recording of you accepting our first proposition.
Cheerio.
There wasn't much choice now.
It was either go along
or go to jail.
The next night I invited
my closest friend, Max Gumpel,
to have dinner
with my wife and me.
If I could get by them, the chances
were I could convince others.
I started by ranting about
the unfairness of the blacklist
and then tried
my first anti-British remark.
We like to feel that Sweden is free and neutral, but she's not.
I hate to say it, but we're occupied just as surely as Denmark and Norway.
Not by German military.
By Allied officials.
Eric, I know how angry you must be, but don't talk like that.
Max.
These men are determined to capture us economically.
Watch and see.
England will involve us in this.
Ingrid was merely surprised,
but Max was hurt.
I hated to do it to him,
but apparently he believed me,
and that was the most
important thing.
Now I began to drop remarks here
and there with associates and friends.
Nothing too obvious at first.
That Germany was
only trying to recover
what had been stolen from
her at Versailles and Locarno.
As months went by,
I kept hammering away
at Churchill's treatment
of the French.
I took my time
but never lost an opportunity to drop
a little poison whenever I could.
Friends began avoiding me,
and I was alone most of the time.
I didn't try to contact
the German Embassy crowd.
I figured, sooner or later, they'd hear
about my attitude and try to woo me.
And they did...
... and eventually offered
me a membership
in the Swedish-German
chamber of commerce.
At one of the weekly meetings,
I made a speech paraphrasing an
editorial from a German newspaper.
And someday, even those countries who now oppose him will realize who their true enemy really is.
And then they'll join the Third Reich, in a combined front against international exploitation and racial degeneration.
Thank you.
Remember Ulrich and I are here as representatives of the Third Reich to help Swedish businessmen.
So if you have any problems, please call on us.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Oh, excellent speech, Eric.
- Yes, good.
Very much like an editorial
I read in the Frankfurter Zeitung.
Have you had a chance to study my letter on the refinery?
Yes. I feel it has great possibilities if certain questions can be answered.
And I have the first question.
Are you planning this to help the Third Reich or to help yourself?
Well, I admit that personal gain has a great deal to do with it.
National Socialism is sacrifice, not profit.
And business is profit, not sacrifice.
It's amazing how well the two get along together if they have to.
I hate opportunists.
Whether they are
Swedish or German.
Heil Hitler.
On behalf of my government, my apologies.
His beer-hall manners are disgusting.
He should have a job requiring muscles rather than brains.
I'm working on just that.
Without consulting me, he requested a transfer to Copenhagen.
Without consulting him,
I demanded it.
He can wear a uniform.
That should make him happy.
He was born distrustful.
But I must say, in this case he has reason.
To retain 50 percent of the stock for yourself makes you appear rather greedy.
Permissions are going to be costly.
I am reserving many shares for... helpful friends.
Why don't we have a drink, play bridge and talk it over.
Good.
Willy, this is the fifth time in a row that I've done the paying.
And for 3,000 crowns, you'd better write a glowing letter to Berlin for me.
- Hello.
- Hello.
We're in here.
It's been a long time.
The last six months have...
I thought we'd managed to lose you.
London felt that since you and I hit it off so well at the start,
I ought to run this little show.
I must say I'm delighted.
The food in England these days is ghastly.
Well, it's good to see you, Red.
- Red?
- Yes.
Your code name from now on.
He's Memphis and I'm Dallas.
Don't ask me why.
Anything less like a Texan you couldn't imagine.
It sounds rather cloak-and-daggerish, but it's necessary.
Fix yourself a drink.
I hear you've done a smashing job.
Even the little children hate you.
Yes.
I've lost most of my friends.
Been dropped from every club except Book-of-the-Month.
Good.
Your refinery.
What do they call those things now in the advertising business?
Visual presentation, that's it.
The Germans admire thoroughness. It might help.
It looks so good I might even invest in it myself.
But London thinks we ought to protect ourselves on this, in case they turn you down.
In order to assure a flow of information, they feel that on this coming trip, you ought to recruit some friends in the German oil industry.
I agreed to take the personal risks, but I am not going to put anybody else in jeopardy!
Many of your German friends went along with Hitler because it was good business.
They thought it would be a quick war and they'd profit by it.
They might, as you did, be willing to pay the price of cooperation in order to buy protection for themselves after the war.
- You'll guarantee that protection?
- Definitely.
What about your friend
Otto Holtz in Hamburg?
He runs a refinery, doesn't he?
Yes, he's a possibility.
London will select somebody in Berlin.
I leave day after tomorrow.
If it doesn't come through by then, our agent will contact you there.
Don't tell me I'm going to meet a little old lady wearing a beard in some dark alley.
If someone should find an excuse to use your handkerchief and return it to your pocket like this...
...you'll know you've made contact.
Three points showing.
Just a businessman keeping his eyes and ears open.
Oh, Red.
Are you in good physical condition?
We just want to make sure you won't collapse on us.
I had my yearly checkup at the clinic a few days ago. Anything else?
- No.
- What about these?
Oh, we'll see that they get to you.
Just... good luck, Red.
And... do be careful.
Your sudden concern for my safety touches me deeply.
Have the chap at the clinic get his dental x-rays for us.
I got them this afternoon.
This one of the bilaterals on the right side was the best.
During the months before,
I had written regularly to the baron,
keeping him excited about the
possibility of the refinery in Sweden.
Now, loaded down
with the fraudulent charts
and a briefcase full of forged
documents, I flew back to Berlin.
The baron had to put
in an appearance at a reception
for a Japanese trade
commission, and I went along.
It was a chance to meet
Albert Speer, Herman Goering
and Joseph Goebbels,
the minister of propaganda.
He was oily and over-polite,
and so was I.
There was no telling who might
prove helpful later on.
- A bit young, isn't she, Gerhard?
- That's my tragedy, they all are.
Baron von Oldenbourg. General
Schroeder would like to see you.
Excuse me, Eric.
Frau Möllendorf.
- Mr. Erickson.
- Excuse me, please.
So nice to see you again.
You've come back on a happy day.
The news from the eastern front is most encouraging.
A 50-mile advance into the Caucasus.
Ah, yes.
Now that the Wehrmacht has crossed the Don,
I'm sure that we can look forward to more glorious victories.
Shall we drink to them?
Here.
Thank you so much.
Thanks.
I think you missed a drop.
Thank you.
No, no, it was so much more attractive the other way.
Allow me.
I haven't been in Stockholm for years.
Has it changed much?
No, it's still as beautiful as ever.
We seem to be standing in the center of Martini Street.
Shall we try someplace with a little less traffic?
- Good evening, general.
- Frau Möllendorf. Good evening.
Good evening.
- Good evening, general.
- Who's that?
You remember, we met her at Albert Speer's.
She's the wife of Friedrich Möllendorf.
Since we'll probably be seeing each other from time to time, we'd better establish a reason for it right now.
The obvious and most acceptable one is that we immediately found each other irresistibly attractive.
I don't know how believable that would be to my German friends.
- You see, I'm married.
- So am I.
Unfortunately, that's exactly what will make it credible.
Glance around.
In Berlin today, there's a feeling of almost desperate urgency, which somehow seems to settle in the glands.
Now, if you could capture some of that urgency,
I have something to tell you.
- How's this?
- Oh, now there's candlelight and champagne in your eyes.
And your smile has just the right amount of lechery.
Do I look convincing?
Convincing?
You look convinced.
Now, I'm told you're here to recruit some of the oil officials.
Whom did you have in mind?
Werner Albricht.
But London said no.
Oh, they're so right.
Werner Albricht has been currying favor lately.
It would be quite a feather in his cap to turn you in.
No, no, no. Your best bet is the man you came with this evening.
- The baron?
- Smile.
Well, he's as patriotic as Wagner.
With a name that goes back even further.
His family means everything to him.
He'd do anything to protect them.
That's why he can't refuse you.
I couldn't do that.
He's one of my oldest friends.
I know.
There are many things
I've had to do that I can't explain to my conscience.
- Frau Möllendorf.
- Baron von Oldenbourg.
I should have warned you, this man has as many conquests to his credit as Genghis Khan.
If you hadn't interrupted,
I might have been one ahead.
If we don't get out of here,
I'm going to have to explain the Fischer-Tropsch process to the Japanese delegation.
Would you join us for dinner?
I'm sorry, I'm with friends.
- Oh, I'm so sorry. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Erickson.
- Goodbye.
I hope I'll see you again soon.
Now, Gerhard.
Assuming I could get approval of the Swedish government, you think your oil commission would be interested in exploring the idea?
Yes.
I think they would be very interested.
How much do you figure it would cost?
Not a penny.
I have no intention of building a refinery.
All I want is a sound, legitimate reason to travel to and from Germany.
I'm working for the Allies, Gerhard.
Eric.
Sometimes friendship makes me deaf.
I didn't hear what you just said.
Please leave now.
And don't contact me again.
I can't.
I'm here to ask you to work with me.
I wouldn't do that.
Remember, you have a son in a Russian prison camp.
All they'd have to do is send a message.
I'm not a Nazi, Eric.
You know that.
But at the moment, they are Germany...
...and I am a German.
Don't ask me to betray my country.
You're their choice, not mine.
I have to do it because they've got me in a vise too.
I'm sorry, Gerhard.
It's a stinking, rotten business.
He was trapped.
There was nothing
he could do but cooperate.
He called a meeting of the oil
commission, explained the project
and suggested that the commission
meet with me periodically
and keep abreast of any
future developments.
When the members
nodded agreement,
I knew I'd be making
weekly visits to Berlin,
and that's all I wanted.
I had expected opposition
from the man next to me,
who was a Gestapo colonel
in charge of Scandinavian countries,
but he went along
without too many questions.
Later in his office, though,
he called Kortner in Stockholm,
just to check
on me firsthand.
Kortner assured him
that I was trustworthy, loyal
and that the refinery plan
had great possibilities.
Kortner's enthusiasm, of course,
was based mainly on larceny.
A little graft, it seemed,
could open more doors
than a passkey.
Colonel Nordoff
and I had a pleasant chat.
When it came time for me to leave,
I felt I could ask an important favor.
Oh, one more thing.
I was wondering if on my return trip I could go via Hamburg.
I'd like to say hello to Otto Holtz, old friend of mine.
You seem to have many friends in the oil business.
Oil is a fraternity.
You've been in it for a while, you know all the members.
I think it can be arranged.
Please.
- Thank you, you've been very kind.
- Thank you.
It's comforting to know that we have such loyal Swedish friends.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Have him put under surveillance.
Express train to Hamburg
departing 8:10 on track 11.
Train to München departing
8:20 on track six.
The trip was slow and uncomfortable.
We were sidetracked a dozen times.
It gave me a chance to see
the condition of the rolling stock.
By the time we pulled
into the main station in Hamburg,
I'd been able to make mental notes
on troop trains and marshaling yards.
I hadn't found out
too much about oil yet,
but I was picking up other bits of
information that might prove valuable.
Otto!
You didn't have to come to meet me.
Those are the people I like to meet, the ones I don't have to.
I even brought an honor guard.
My son, Hans.
- Hello, Hans.
- Heil Hitler!
Herr Gunderscharf.
Please contact the stationmaster.
There's a message for you.
I had never been
to Otto's new home.
After his first wife died,
we'd always gotten together
in his office or my hotel room.
When I met his second wife,
I understood.
Klara was not
someone to be proud of.
She flaunted her sex,
was tawdry and rather stupid.
I wondered why
he ever married her.
And then I found out.
How long have you been married?
Eleven years, but for Hans' sake, we say 12.
Papa!
Papa!
I heard just now on the radio that six people here in Hamburg were arrested for treason.
- Jews?
- No, Germans.
A boy in our class does treason.
- What are you talking about?
- It's true, Papa.
Every morning, our teacher says,
"God strike England."
And we answer all together, "He will."
Well, this boy Klaus does not say it.
I watched him.
He opens his mouth and makes movements, but he doesn't say it.
Maybe his father and mother like the English.
That's ridiculous, Hans.
The boy's probably just daydreaming.
No.
I think soon I must report him and his parents.
You'll do nothing of the sort!
Go to your room!
Otto, you must not discourage the boy.
If he really has such an idea, it's his duty to report it.
Klara, Klara.
What are you teaching him?
The boy will grow up to be...
If they're guilty, they should be taken. If they're not, no harm will be done to them.
In either case, it's good for Hans' record.
My Jugendführer said if I report things like that,
I will get the star for my uniform.
Ah, your Jugendführer is a...
Go on, go on.
We'll talk about it later.
Mr. Erickson and I have some business to discuss now.
Eric.
- You mind if we talk in the garden?
- Of course not.
After dinner is the only time
I have to work on my vegetables.
I'll get my old clothes on.
Otto was not hard to recruit,
but difficult to satisfy.
He didn't want any money, but he
insisted on some kind of document
stating that he was
cooperating with the Allies.
I tried to dissuade
him but he...
No.
When the Allies march into Hamburg,
I want something
I can take to headquarters.
I'm sorry, Otto, I can't do it.
It's too risky.
It's the only way I'll cooperate.
Papa.
You think about it tonight.
I'll meet you in my office in the morning.
- At the refinery.
- No, my office in town.
Come about 10.
I have an appointment first.
Mama says you should come in now.
You'll catch cold.
- What are you doing sitting out here?
- Just changing my shoes.
By the next morning, I had decided
to give Otto the letter he wanted.
It was a death sentence
for both of us if anybody found it.
Otto was willing
to take the risk, and so was I.
On one condition:
I want to be sure that where you put that is really a safe place.
Eric, for a long time, I've been withdrawing money from the bank.
Little by little.
Not enough to create suspicion, but sufficient to live on for a time when the war is over.
Somewhere in these cabinets are 200,000 marks.
If you can find them, you can have them.
What if this building is bombed?
Someone goes through the debris, finds a piece of paper...
If this building is hit, the chances are a hundred to one that it'll catch fire.
And if the office is searched?
They'll break open the safe, tear up the rug, smash the desk.
But I doubt if they'll wade through all these files.
But they might.
They might also find the money.
I might also be arrested... and talk.
I honestly don't know how I'd react under torture.
Those are risks you have to take, Eric.
Well?
All right.
Wait a minute.
This is dated March 5th.
Today is September 5th.
You see, I have to be protected too, Otto.
If tomorrow you should get cold feet and decide to turn the letter over to the Gestapo, they'd wonder why you held on to it for six months.
Otto gave me the two-dollar tour, and
I saw the refinery from top to bottom.
When I got back to Stockholm,
I talked into the recording machine
for what seemed to be hours,
trying to remember every little detail.
During the air raid of August 23rd, the distillation plant was burned, but not extensively.
The damage was repaired in six hours.
Good. Have those transcribed and sent up to London right away.
- Good work, Red.
- How about a drink now?
No, thanks.
Red, I was hoping you might come back a little more enthusiastic about the Allied cause.
When you force me to blackmail von Oldenbourg, one of my closest friends, don't expect me to whistle the "Stars and Stripes Forever".
- What about money?
- I'll send you a bill later.
Meanwhile, I want Holtz and the baron taken care of immediately.
Documents acknowledging their cooperation will be filed at the legation tomorrow.
Incidentally, I gave such a document to Holtz.
You did what?
I had to, he wouldn't help otherwise.
It's in a safe place.
Why didn't you file it with the Gestapo?
It'd have saved them all that trouble of looking for it.
It's awful damned easy for you to sit here figuring out how brave and smart I should be.
The only danger you're in is getting a bad lobster.
All right, I made a mistake.
But if they find that letter, it's my neck, not yours.
Curious chap.
The most amazing combination of intelligence and stupidity.
Willy!
Hello, Eric.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
I was going to call you.
I wanted to tell you about my conference in Berlin.
Any time. I'll be waiting.
- Your office, 3:00?
- Splendid.
Eric! Where have you been keeping yourself?
I called you a dozen times, but you never answered.
I would think that you'd finally get the idea that I want nothing to do with you or your propositions.
I don't do business with Jews, Gumpel, so stop bothering me.
That, I think,
was the loneliest moment of my life.
When other people hate you,
it's unfortunate,
but when you hate yourself,
it's unbearable.
And hurting Max the way I did
filled me with self-contempt.
Of course, news that
I'd publicly insulted him
didn't take long to spread.
My wife called me at the office
and berated me for what I had done.
I went home and tried to mollify her,
but it was hopeless.
I couldn't tell her why I had to do it.
I could only plead rather guiltily
for understanding.
All right, you've made your bed, but don't expect me to share it.
Dear Eric, I cannot believe
you have changed to this extent.
Your outburst this noontime
only strengthens my conviction
that your conduct
has some special hidden purpose.
Because I trust you implicitly,
I shall consider our friendship
only temporarily interrupted.
If I can ever be of help, let me know.
Every good wish. God bless you. Max.
They seemed greatly interested.
Providing, of course,
I could give them some promise of Swedish government approval.
Perhaps if you wrote a letter to Nordoff...
I have just one question.
What were you doing at 20 Stortorget last night?
I'm glad my wife didn't ask that.
Yes, infidelity is difficult to explain...
...but not nearly as difficult as espionage.
I have to send that lady some flowers.
She recommended the restaurant.
A lovely place.
I'm amazed at American intelligence sending two such incompetent men.
But that's not my worry.
My problem is, what do we do with you?
I could turn you over to the Swedish Security Police, but I can't see what would be gained by that. Can you?
I think the best procedure would be for you to continue to work for the Americans, with one slight difference.
The information you bring back from Germany will be supplied by us.
Have you told Berlin about me yet?
Oh, no.
I haven't told anybody yet.
I wanted to talk to you first, to see if you'd be reasonable.
It's not often we are able to get an Allied agent working for us.
These are five canceled checks from me to you.
An Allied agent has paid you over 20,000 crowns in the last few months.
I doubt whether the Gestapo will consider these... gambling losses.
You can destroy them if you want, they're only Photostats.
The originals, in the meantime, are in the hands of these two incompetents.
Now, I think you'd better write that letter to Nordoff, saying that we've discussed the refinery plan and you'll contact the more influential members of Parliament and...
We can discuss the details later, can't we?
You realize if I'm arrested...
...the originals will find their way to the Gestapo.
So if there are any other members of your department who are suspicious of me, tell them... I'm a real nice fellow.
Oh, Willy.
You didn't honestly think I was that bad a bridge player, did you?
Kortner was most cooperative.
We collaborated on the letter.
I wrote it and he signed it.
It was a perfect opportunity to move
on to the second phase of my plan.
The letter requested that
I be allowed to make a survey trip
of all the refineries in Germany.
After all, since I was going
to help the Third Reich
by building a refinery in Sweden,
it'd be to their advantage
if I became acquainted firsthand
with all the latest technical
developments
and methods of production.
So on my next trip to Berlin,
I went to Gestapo Headquarters
to see Nordoff once again.
He had referred the request
to the Oil Commission.
The baron, who was the chairman,
naturally could do nothing
but recommend it.
With such auspices,
Nordoff was willing to push it up
the ladder for Himmler's approval.
When I got to the hotel later,
I received a cryptic message
telling me to meet a contact
on the embankment of the Spree
River near the Oberbaum Bridge.
Hello...
Well! There hasn't been a welcome like that since Lindbergh landed in Paris.
Just in...
In case you're being followed.
Keep it up.
The whole Gestapo's behind me.
There was someone following me in the subway, but I think I lost him.
We'd better go.
Is this...?
Now, good evening.
Good evening.
Wagner seems to be popular tonight.
Hitler speaks in a moment.
When they told me to contact you, they didn't tell me why.
My courier has had to hide out.
And I have some information that must get back as quickly as possible.
Just a businessman keeping his eyes and ears open.
Why this place?
Well, if our romance were to be convincing, we'd better have a rendezvous.
I rented it shortly after we met.
Since we're both married,
I think it's only logical that we wouldn't want to be seen in my home or in hotel rooms.
But you're ruining my reputation for being generous and gallant.
In Berlin today, not even Lothario could do any better.
Now, if you're ready.
How about a drink before we start?
How about a drink after we're finished?
Now...
The third bomber group is being transferred from Lesmont in France to Brok in Poland.
Third bomber group transferred from Lesmont in France to Brok, Poland.
I can't concentrate with that going on.
Look, I have a visual memory.
If I can write it, I can remember it.
Do you have some paper?
Yes, of course.
Now, third... bomber...
Lesmont... to Brok.
Now, I overheard a senior officer in the construction corps mention that just north of Regensburg...
Repeat again.
And the special fuel for these experimental jet planes is believed to be manufactured someplace in northern Germany.
That's all.
Now may I have that drink?
Excuse me.
How should I get rid of these?
You'd better burn them in the sink here.
Although our job is just to get the information, not evaluate it, if they can get those jet planes in the air in any great numbers, it might be disastrous.
And fuel is the key to the situation.
Well, that's not our worry.
But we do have one.
In case either of us should get arrested and questioned,
I think we ought to know a few intimate details about each other.
Now, for your information,
I have a scar, appendicitis here.
And a birthmark there.
Wine-colored.
White or red?
Vin rosé.
Well, I haven't anything quite as glamorous.
Just a cut on my thigh, which you probably never noticed in the dim light.
I'm very observing.
So is the Gestapo.
What's it look like?
Well, a horse bit me on the a...
Just a bite scar.
Your hair is most attractive.
Is that the natural color?
Yes.
Now, what else should we know about each other?
Well, although you probably had the good taste not to praise your wife in front of me,
I think you would have mentioned her name.
It's Ingrid.
And she doesn't understand you.
Oddly enough, that's true.
They wouldn't let me tell her, and she couldn't stand the thought of being unpopular.
She left me just a few days ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
At least I found out who trusted me and who didn't.
Now, what about your husband?
His name is Friedrich.
He's a colonel with the occupation in France.
Well, don't you think that sometime during our passionate love affair, you would have told me more than his name, rank and serial number?
I mean, for my own protection,
I would have found out if he were jealous and apt to take a shot at me.
No, Friedrich wouldn't care.
Legally, we've been married ten years.
Actually, just about a month.
Very early, he told me
I was one in a million.
And I discovered he was telling the truth.
Why didn't you divorce him?
I'm a Catholic.
It's worked, though.
People take pity on me, and I'm asked to the best parties, where I pick up the best information.
Do you mind?
I'm curious.
Ever since I met you,
I wondered what they have on you.
The Allies, I mean.
They've got me handcuffed.
If I don't work for them,
I lose my business.
Oh, I see.
Yes, I have something to lose too.
If I don't help them,
I lose my self-respect.
But haven't you ever opposed anything for the simple reason that it's wrong?
Morally wrong?
Not when my life depended on it.
You've got connections.
You could go to Switzerland, Sweden.
I could, but I can't.
- Well, what's stopping you?
- My faith.
He's the Antichrist,
I'm a Christian.
If I don't oppose him, my religion becomes a mockery.
Your religion also tells you to love your enemies.
I try to be a Christian,
I never hoped to be a saint.
You don't think hanging that paranoiac is going to end persecution?
Another greedy psychopath will come along...
But this is now, and I'm here.
And I must do what I must do.
- And risk your life doing it?
- Yes, if necessary.
You certainly are a businessman, aren't you?
You look at war in terms of hundreds of tanks and thousands of planes and millions of men, like some sort of a wrestling match on a gigantic scale.
Try thinking of it in terms of a single truck on its way to a concentration camp and what's shivering inside it.
I feel sorry for those people, deeply sorry.
- I suffer for them.
- But not with them.
That's the difference.
Someday, though, you might.
You'll see a stranger, a complete stranger, being bullied and beaten.
And suddenly, in an agonizing moment, he'll become your brother.
I guess I've always been an opportunist.
And the women I've known have been too.
I've never met anyone quite like you.
You're either very foolish or very wise.
I can't decide which.
But I can tell you one thing.
Your husband must be an idiot.
Good night.
After our conference yesterday,
I was exhausted.
I went to bed early.
I'll wager you did the same.
Now, colonel, you know that isn't true.
One of your men followed me out of the hotel.
- But not very far.
- Yes, he was a bit obvious.
So I managed to lose him in the subway.
You shouldn't have done it.
You hurt his professional pride.
I was on my way to visit a beautiful woman.
I didn't feel it was any of his business.
Frau Möllendorf is a charming person, isn't she?
And I thought I was being so clever.
The man following you was obvious because he was supposed to be.
To give you a false sense of security.
You see, there were two men.
You gave the slip to the wrong one.
I was delighted to learn that your nocturnal prowling was for the purpose of romance and not intrigue.
And now, on my recommendation,
Reichsführer Himmler has approved your inspection tour.
This will allow you access to all refineries.
To avoid suspicion,
I suggested that a team
of technicians go along with me.
Nordoff thought that one man
would be sufficient,
and the baron was selected.
It was comforting to know that
my only watchdog had no teeth.
The baron grew to hate me,
and I certainly couldn't blame him.
But then, one day while we were
touring a small plant near Leipzig,
his attitude changed.
And so did mine.
The workers had gone
on a sit-down strike.
Who are they?
They are Polish volunteers.
Why do they refuse to work?
They say too long hours and too little food.
You'd better wait upstairs in my office.
If you refuse to work,
I'll hang you, one by one!
Don't misjudge me.
I have no mercy!
Now, get back to your posts!
So you are going to test me, are you?
Well, which one of you is going to go first?
Let me see.
You! Come here.
Help me. Help me.
Help me, please!
- Take that man.
- For God's sake, someone help me.
I didn't do anything,
I didn't do anything!
I just sat down because I was hungry.
Oh, please, please help me!
I'll go back to work!
I'll go back to work, don't hang me!
Don't hang me,
I'll go back to work!
Now, are you going back to work?
No? I'll give you ten seconds.
One... two... three...
Strange.
You can read about a hundred atrocities, hear about a thousand, but you only have to see one.
And suddenly... he becomes your brother.
So far, I have cooperated because I had to.
Now I do it willingly.
So do I.
They want me to find out where you're manufacturing and storing fuel for those jets.
I'll find out.
And every place we went, it was the same.
Factories, refineries, railroads.
All beginning to show the effects of the bombing.
Did you drive through Regensburg?
What was left of it.
I hear the raid was very successful.
The chemical plants were completely destroyed.
So was a school and 120 children.
- Well, those things can't be helped.
- That doesn't console me.
I provided the information on those chemical plants.
- And so did ten others, I'm sure.
- I don't care if there were a thousand.
I am partly responsible for killing those children.
And maybe partly responsible for shortening the war.
Don't you think I've told myself that?
Don't you think I've tried to rationalize what I'm doing in every possible way?
But even a good end does not justify evil means.
You were willing to give your life to that end.
I still am, but the lives of others are not mine to give.
All the convictions I have, you gave me.
And because of them,
I'm willing to live with fear.
And now I find out that you have doubts.
I discovered there's something worse than fear.
There's guilt.
- But you must have known...
- First, it was quite impersonal.
I relayed names, dates and conversations, and I knew somewhere, sometime, somebody was going to act upon them, but I never foresaw that gnawing feeling of...
-Finished.
-PIay the last few bars again.
-Was it better today, ma'am?
-Yes.
-When can I come again?
-Your mother said...
... you had to leave.
Aren't you?
Papa says there's no need.
We're quite safe in Paris.
The day after tomorrow then, at 4 o'cIock.
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Give my regards to your mother.
-I will. Goodbye.
-Go straight home.
Oh, how are you, ma'am?
She's just left.
I can try, but she walks so fast.
Yes, I'll go at once.
No, ma'am... HeIIo?
Hello?...
Come on! Quickly!
Out, or I'll shoot!
Stay here by me.
Don't go! Don't go!
Mama! Mama!
Edith!
Go away! Go away!
-Get on!
-You too!
Regional train number 4327.
Lead all the prisoners...
... to the main square!
Get off!
Come on!
Quickly!
Everyone off the train!
Mama! Mama!
Get out!
Come on!
Move!
Come down!
Hurry up!
Left!... Right!...
Left!... Right!...
Attention, pIease!
-No! Mama! No!
-Edith!
-Edith?
-Yes?
They'll kill us all at daybreak.
-How do you know?
-I heard them.
I can speak German.
They'll kill the children and the old people.
Two SS said that near me.
God, if only
I could see them again!
Shut up!
Stop yelling!
Come here!
Where are you going?
-Let's escape, Pierre!
-And go where?
I want to see my mother and my father again.
The door's open.
You come too, let's go!
It's no good.
Hold him.
Goodbye, Pierre.
And who are you?
Where are you off to?
-Let me come in, please!
-What, in here?
Don't send me away.
They want to kill me!
Quiet, stupid!
-You're Jewish?
-Yes.
Well then!
You won't need this any more.
Come. Maybe we can both be of some use to each other.
Hurry!
-What is it, Sofia?
-I brought you this one.
She arrived tonight. Jewish.
They've seIected her... for the gas chamber but they haven't registered her yet.
All right, Sofia. Go now.
All right my hat!
What do I get?
-I haven't even any bread.
-Give me some alcohol.
-No, it's bad for you.
-Who cares!
You're sick, Sofia. Go now, I'll give you something next time.
My bIock's being transferred to a labour camp. I leave tomorrow.
Bye, Doctor.
They say it's a good camp.
Try to get her into our convoy.
Remember, block 1 2
-How old are you?
-Are you here on your own?
-No, with my mother and my father, but they split us up.
Wait here.
You're in luck.
If no one had died tonight,
I couldn't have helped you.
Take your clothes off.
Quickly now.
I told you to strip off.
Everything, unless you want them to spot you at once.
Hurry up!
Put this on. Come on!
Please yourself, but if you want to live, you must put...
... this smock on, now.
We don't have much time.
Come on, hurry!
That black triangle on your smock stands for criminals.
Political prisoners wear a red triangle, like mine.
The Jews have a yeIIow star.
But black triangles get the best treatment.
The SS pick them as camp oversees.
They call them ''Kapo''.
Beware of them.
They're mean and they can do what they like to the prisoners.
But you stand a better chance with your black triangle.
You're taking the place of a French thief.
I haven't reported her death.
Her name was NicoIe.
Number 10099.
You're name is Nicole now, understand? Remember that.
Come on, what's your name now?
-Nicole.
-Nicole Niepas.
-Nicole Niepas.
-Number 10099.
In German it's...
Remember that. And don't show this for a few days.
Wait for it to heal.
I'll be right back.
I have to see if I can get you assigned to a hut.
Nicole's is out, they'd be on to you at once.
Come here!
March!
Join the others!
Come on!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...
... of the blocks number
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 appear... before the Commander for general roll call!
Come on! Move!
Mama! Mama!
No! No!
Mama! Mama!
Mama... Mama...!
You've got to live, Nicole, and think of nothing else.
Just live, that's all. Come...
I managed to get you assigned to block 1 2.
That's where Sofia is, the girl who brought you here.
Block 1 2. The number is on the hut, you can't miss it.
Tomorrow you'll leave for a labour camp.
It's better than this.
Nobody will know you.
Your name is NicoIe, always remember that.
If they ask anything, say you left the infirmary today.
You're not Jewish any more, understand?
You hear me, Nicole?
Off you go.
It's up to you now.
Try to live. Good luck!
Good luck... Go on.
How many days will it take?
If you chew it well and close your eyes, it tastes like bread.
Don't think about it, girl.
Shrug it off.
You forget everything here, except cold and hunger.
The rest is a lot of rubbish.
Isn't that right?
No, I don't think so.
-How long have you been here?
-Over six months.
Wait then. We'll see in a year... if you're still alive.
You listen to me, girl. In here the cleanest one stinks.
-What can you see, Isabella?
-Still nothing but woods.
-What kind of woods?
-I wouldn't know.
-Looks like oak.
-Still god-awful Germany then.
Right, who'll give me some bread for a cigarette?
Where do you get all that stuff?
It isn't like that, you know.
There's one thing they can't take from us against our wiII.
Our seIf-respect.
I'm positive of that.
What's wrong? Are you sick?
Go on, cry...
Stand up!
-Back!
-Get out of here!
Come on! Move!
Quick! Quick!
It's stopping again.
Take a look.
-What can you see?
-A station...
-but there's no name.
-Another train full of prisoners.
This damned war will never end!
-They're not speaking German.
-You sure?
-Can't you hear them?
-What's next to Germany?
-France?
-You'd Iike that, wouldn't you?
Poland!
Open the wagons!
Come down!
Move!
Quickly!
Hurry up!
Come down!
Get off!
Line up!
Stay stiII!
Now, move!
Come on, march!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Keep in step!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Any news from Warsaw?
How are they there?
Better than you, Iass...
Better than you.
Good luck.
Back!
Go back!
Go now! Go away!
Line up!
Come on!
Look what you've done!
Give me another ration!
Nicole...
I realized from the start you were a nice girl
... in spite of your black triangle.
Who sent you along with us?
The infirmary doctor, right?
He's a good man. He has saved a lot of girls like you.
You're Jewish, aren't you?
No, I'm not Jewish.
Attention, please!
General roll call!
Line up!
Attention, please!
General roll call!
Line up!
-How many are the politicals?
-About 50 percent, but you...
... can't trust them. Most of them have been here at least 2 years.
-They renegade?
-They adapted.
One's even been made a Kapo.
The woman on block 10.
She was a good partisan once, then bit by bit...
I speak fluent German.
-Could that do me any good?
-Probably.
If they make you an interpreter, you couId be useful
... on a lot of occasion.
All in all, this is far better than Auschwitz.
Yes. We sleep better, we eat better. You've seen that.
They want to get the most out of us.
It's obviously in their interests.
But there's still the screenings nightmare.
-Here too?
-Yes.
The SS doctor examines us every four months.
The oldest and thinnest are sent away.
A sore's enough, the slightest wound, and you're replaced.
You came to replace
100 other women.
-Where did they take them?
-Nobody knows.
But you can be sure... there's a gas chamber there.
What's wrong, silly?
Go to sleep!
I don't want to die!
Come on! Work!
Quicker!
Move!
No mill, no meal!
Idiot! Can't you look where you're going?
Damn you! I'll teach you to leave your work!
I'll warm you up!
1 5 days in solitary!
-Hi, Carole.
-Hello.
-What on earth did you say?
-I don't understand.
-What are you, anyway?
-Russian.
She hasn't been here long.
She's a bit...
Anna, the Red Army's coming, right?
Yes, yes, it's coming.
Interpreter!
Well done, they let you go.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Did they bit you up again?
Have you understood?
Now go and tell them!
Attention, please!
The Kapo said...
Who took my potato?
Give it back, Nicole.
It's mine.
-Nicole...!
-I gave it to her.
-I traded my undershirt for it.
-Who cares!
It's mine! I put it on the stove a few minutes ago!
You must have eaten it without reaIizing.
If it really was stolen, get it back.
I'm suprised at you.
You're a political!
You mean the politicals are better than us?
You heard her ladyship?
She's scared though.
Yet she was in the Resistence.
I wonder how her ladyship resisted back home?
Hey, Georgette, stop that, will you!
I wouldn't brag about being here for stealing.
Come here and repeat that if you dare!
-I'm coming.
-Attagirl, you show her!
-Come on, stop that, girls!
-Let me go!
Blocks number 1 and 2!
Wash yourseIf!
What a spring! The water gets colder every day.
Her ladyship expects hot water? It's melted snow.
Aren't you going to wash, Nicole?
That's what they want.
That's just what they're after.
To cancel us... turn us into animals.
We have to hold out.
-By washing?
-That too.
It's a way to make us feel like human beings.
To stop ourseIves turning into brutes.
Come here! All of you!
Out!
I've got through three screenings. Last time...
... I had a sore on my foot.
They didn't notice.
Luck, that's all. If they don't like the look of your face...
... being healthy won't heIp you.
-Does the grey still show?
-No, don't worry.
I have good hands, good feet.
Why worry about my teeth?
You'll see why, you'll see.
-You know you have to go.
-You're all right.
Shove her out, or they'll take it out on us.
Good luck... be brave.
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...
... of the blocks number
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 appear...
... before the Commander for general roll call!
-Do I look less pale, now?
-Yes, that's a lot better.
You think I shouId take the bandage off?
Sure, they'll see that first thing.
Stand up straight and smile.
And stick your chest out.
If it shows a bit, all the better.
-Hide your hands.
-They're not that stupid!
-What hope have you got like that?
That's you. Smile... smile.
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...
... appear before the Commander!
Get dressed.
-Left!
-Come!
Interpreter! Come here!
Feet... Your feet!
The other one.
Good... your hands... Hands!
Turn them over!
-Left!
-Go!
Next one!
Come!
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...
-Here she is!
-Which is the good side?
-Left or right? Tell me!
-I couldn't find out.
Left or right?
-I tell you, I don't know.
-It's easy to find out.
We'll just ask where they sent the oldest women.
Well, Ninette?
Left or right?
Why are you asking me?
Maybe I made it.
Sure, maybe you did.
But was it left or right?
Right.
Hell!
Don't cry.
They won't send you away.
You'll see,
Red Army come in time.
Right?
I fooled them!
Look at my hands!
I made it!
Look!
I showed you!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Stay back!
Hey, you! Line up!
Drop dead!
Well, aren't you going to say goodbye?
Now you're scared of saying goodbye to me, you bitches!
Cowards! They've turned you into a bunch of sheep!
Cowards!
You too! Cowards!
Damn murderer! Scumbag!
Scumbag! Scumbag!
You don't scare me any more!
I know where you're taking us!
Vultures! Brutes! You'll die too!
They'll kill your kids!
Your damn mothers!
Damn your mothers!
You, you and you!
Come with me!
In step!
Hitch her up!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Take the lime!
What are you doing?
Her socks...
Good.
Hey, you!
I have to send another girl to the SS.
I'll take her after roll call.
Tell number 10099. It's worth her while, tell her.
-But she's a child!
-Exactly.
Nicole!
Alice wants to make you a ridiculous proposal.
She'd Iike you to go...
... to the SS tonight. You don't want to, of course.
-You don't, do you?
-Why not?
-What has she said?
-Nothing.
But you have no experience.
Have you ever been with a man?
-No.
-No?
But if I go, will they give me something to eat?
-Nicole!
-Ask her that.
Ask her!
Anyone play cards with me?
-No.
-Play on your own.
... and good night...
Look what I brought you!
Like her?
What can you do with that?
Are we supposed to adopt her?
She's pretty, isn't she?
I had her cleaned up.
-But she weighs 60 pounds!
-I like them like that.
Right, baby? Come on...
Have fun then!
-Did it come out?
-The hell it did!
-How did it go?
-Just great.
I was right. She's a virgin.
She was a virgin!
Hey you... Why are you still here? Scram!
Excuse me, you said you'd give me something to eat.
-What did she said?
-She wants to eat.
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow...
Attention!
The Camp Commander...
... wishes you all a Merry Christmas.
Now sing!
How is it you've come today too?
Your mates sent for me.
Guess they changed their minds.
They're in town getting drunk.
-Why didn't you go with them?
-I don't like drinking.
What do you like, Karl?
Just the war?
Where were you last Christmas?
In Cracow. And you?
Here. And before that?
-In Paris.
-Do you like Paris?
It's just another city... only a bit noisier.
It was good the first day, when we entered.
And the Champs Elysées, the day of our parade.
Out.
Do you mind... not being at home?
Because it's Christmas?
Nonsense!
What things are important for you?
My country, I think. Only my country is important.
What if you lose the war?
Impossible.
But if you do lose?
Your turn, Karl.
We can't get news from the front any more.
Morale is pretty low, even among the politicals.
I told the women in my hut to sabotage the work.
-They just laughed.
-It's the same in the factory.
We need the right arguments.
-They'll listen to talk of escape.
-Let's talk of escape then.
That's useless, since escape is impossible.
It's not useless. Look...
They're as thick as thieves now.
Are you nuts?
That was a wollen shirt.
At least two more packs, or I'll have it back.
-Okay, I'll try tomorrow.
-How about some more jam?
-Civilians go for that.
-Karl says nothing must be... wasted because his mates at the front are starving.
Rubbish! What does he care about his mates at the front!
He'll have forgotten by tomorrow.
-All right, I'll try again.
-Nicole!
Hurry up! Go inside!
The block leader's leaving.
I might get picked to replace her.
If so, they'll need a new Kapo for this hut.
I could put your name forward. Tell your friends...
... about all I do for you.
And get busy!
If one of them steps in, it's your lucky day.
Good evening, Miss! How are they at the command post?
-What do you mean?
-Just asking how they were.
Mind you own business in future!
Line up!
Prisoners, attention!
You are prisoners of the German Reich.
You work for the German Reich
... and in return the Reich feeds you.
It's a cIear-cut relationship.
Whoever betrays this relationship is punished.
The prisoner 871 1 sabotaged the factory work, by attempting to damage the machines.
The prisoner 871 1 was caught in the act.
Sabotage is punished with death.
Translate.
Translate! Translate!
It is right...
It is right that such criminaIs should hang. Is that clear?
Yes, Sir!
Now proceed!
Hey, you! Look up!
1 5 days in solitary and
3 months on half rations.
-Is it time?
-Five minutes.
Good.
I've applied for the front again.
Even one-hand men should be needed now. I hope so!
-Don't you like it here?
-No, I'm bored.
-Why, do you like it?
-I do now.
I eat well, I sleep weII.
No work, no screenings.
-Is that all you care about?
-What else is there?
When are you going to eat that?
At night, or else I can't sleep.
You know it's less nourishing when it's stale?
And the effort not to touch it, that's bad for you.
It weakens you, you know that?
You're still on half ration, huh?
The Russians sing now.
One of your songs.
We don't know what we're allowed to sing.
Whatever you know, just sing it well.
-''Holy War''
-Don't be funny.
-You want to get us killed?
-We don't know anything else.
''Holy War''. Let's sing!
The Russians!
You were right...
The Red Army's come.
One moment... Show them the empty bunks! Go on in.
Come on... Come on...
My boys...
My boys!
Well? Aren't the rest of you going to hug us?
Where have you come from?
Say something to us.
Pilot.
-Quiet... quiet!
-She's right, they'll hear us.
Hold on.
Show us the bunks that need dismantling.
We'll answer your questions while we work, okay?
It won't be long. The Allies have landed in Normandy.
The Germans lost Stalingrad, the Red Army's at the Dnieper.
-Couldn't they counter-attack?
-No, not any more.
The whole front's on the move.
You'll see.
-And the Red Army will get here.
-What?...
-The Red Army will get here.
-Yes...
They'll get here and free us all.
-Is that really true?
-Sure!
They brought us here to build fortifications, because they're...
... retreating and we'll see them all run away from here.
We'll skin him alive and dunk him in vinegar.
-Who?
-Faust!
You'll do what?
-Nothing. I was joking.
-Watch it!
And you men, get on with it!
-Who's that?
-Our Kapo.
Don't you have them?
No, we just have a hut representative.
You're not scared of a kid like that?
You'll see, son... You'll find out what a Kapo is.
-Is he Faust?
-Yes.
-What does it says?
-''Touch Faust and you die''.
-The SS wrote that?
-Yes.
-They're nice to cats.
-Are you nice to everyone?
No... not everyone.
Come on, get your mates.
It's roll call soon.
-They haven't called us yet.
-I'll take you.
-Attention, please!
-Roll call! Roll call!
-All the Kapos must...
... count the prisoners and wait for new orders!
Come on, you, get moving.
You ate the lot!
Give it back, you bitch!
-Give it back!
-What's going on?
She stole my bread!
Nearly half a loaf I'd put by!
She scoffed the lot!
Bitch! Scumbag!
Tough luck!
Now go to roll call.
-What am I going to do?
-Go!
Is it true?
-I couldn't stand it any longer.
-Let's go, it's roll call.
-Let me be, NicoIe.
-Let's go.
See? Washing every morning didn't do you any good.
Leave me here, please.
-You preached so well.
-Leave me here.
Remember? You kept repeating it to me.
''We mustn't let ourselves go, we must react''.
And look at you now!
-Exactly like all the rest.
-One! Two! Three! Four!...
But it's natural. You preached a load of rubbish.
Now what's got into you?
Where are you going, silly?
Kapo, come here and bring three prisoners!
Come on, Boris!
Get moving, Boris!
-Come on, try!
-I can't do it.
On your feet! At once!
Get to work!
What are you doing?
Come here, you filthy prisoner!
Come on! Go on working!
Come nearer!
See that?
Stay here and rest.
-They won't notice if I go.
-Thank you.
They say our advance stopped and they are counter-attacking.
-They'll be in Moscow by June.
-That's what they say.
Meanwhile they just shot another man and we've waited 3 months!
-What do you want to do?
-Anything, whiIe there's time.
-Before we get to be like them.
-Hey! Wait!
Could you take this to...
What are you doing there?
Damn you!
-Read it! It's for my mother!
-It's forbidden!
-Give me the address.
-Alma Rudnicka, Hoza 1 2...
-Bitch! You're like an animal!
-Hands off, you idiot!
Letters are forbidden,
-and speaking to civilians!
-Who are you? One of them?
Why do you do it?
-Just because.
-What happened, Nicole?
-If they saw you, you're dead.
-What did he do?
He wanted to send a letter home. I tore it up.
Stand here and don't move.
All night. Stand to attention.
If you lean forward, there's the high voItage.
If you step back, the sentry will get you.
If he moves, shoot!
Good night... comrade!
This is how they should dress us Kapos. Nice, isn't it?
-Look!
-They're going steady!
In other lagers Kapos can wear civilian clothes, did you know?
We should ask to do that too.
Nice! What did you give for them!
Not much, three packs of cigarettes.
What are you waiting for?
Want a cigarette? Catch!
Go on, have a smoke!
Pick it up, I won't shoot you.
I won't shoot! Go on!
Don't you like smoking?
You need it to move a bit, to rest your muscles, or else you'll never make it.
You can't make it.
Come on!
Don't you trust me?
You won't make it.
You'll never make it.
You'll croak anyway!
Sentry post number 7.
Changing of the guard.
-Is he still alive?
-That one's a stayer.
Want to bet?
No, not like that. Let's wait and see what happens.
Okay. Come!
Attention, please!
All the prisoners...
... in the main square!
All the prisoners...
... in the main square!
Attention, please!
All the prisoners...
... in the main square!
All the prisoners...
... in the main square!
Come... come!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Join the others!
You must work!
In step!
Come on, quickly!
Join the others!
Here, bread and margarine.
Go on, blow your whistle!
Call your pals!
You think a bit of bread is enough to put everything right?
Hey, that's artillery!
That's our men!
Hear them? 100 kilometers.
Less than 50!
It's a matter of days now.
The war's over, Nicole.
We'll go home, we'll go back to our old lives, we'll forget.
Come on! Get on with it!
Wonder how it will feel to be free again?
To do whatever we like... anything at all.
They celebrate in my town when any of us go home.
They welcome us with music and flowers.
And we dance all night... we sing... we shout...
Nobody sleeps that night.
Do you like dancing, Nicole?
Yes, I used to love it.
Run for it, Sasha! There's only one German on the bank.
I'll distract him, so you can run to the river and get away.
But why? It's only a matter of days now.
They'll have to let us all go.
No... who knows what they'll do.
There won't be another chance. Today's the last day...
-they'll bring you out to work.
-Get moving!
With two hands! Hurry up!
What about my mates?
There'll be a reprisal.
Why worry about them?
Come with me, but be carefuI.
I don't know the area.
They'll catch me.
The partisans are over there.
We hear shots now and then.
Let's wait for him to move away.
What will you do?
Me? What can I do?
I'll stay with them.
-Don't you want to get away?
-And go where?
But where will you go when the war's over?
I don't know,
I haven't thought.
Where do your parents live?
Dead... they're dead.
-Go now, Sasha!
-No!
I can't do it.
Attention, please!
The Blocks number
18A, 24B and 1 3C...
... go immediately...
... to the Commander!
Attention, please!
... 18A and 1 3C...
... go immediately to the Commander!
Look! They're pulling out!
Get off! Get off!
Stay back!
Go away!
Come on! Quickly!
Stay back! Back!
Look at them! They're worse than animals!
Animal sense when they're about to die,
-but this lot...
-Die?
-Yes.
-Who told you that?
They transfer us to Germany to a suitably equipped camp.
Seems they can do away with over 5000 a day.
Not you, silly! They'll make us auxiliaries in the Wehrmacht, with a uniform, pay, and a clean police record.
Good. You had me scared for a minute.
-Coming with me?
-No, I'm busy.
Georgette! Here she comes!
Excuse me, Kapo,
I was on cleaning duty today and I found this.
This is how I found him.
Poor Faust!
He was so sweet.
You know they're going to kill you too? All of you!
Sasha! Come here.
-What's up?
-Sasha...
-Tuesday?
-Yes, the day after tomorrow.
-We've got to try.
-You know it's sheer suicide!
We can't escape from this camp!
We can't escape from the gas chamber either.
We've got to find a way to cut the high-voltage Iine.
We must prepare some tools to cut the fence.
I'll sharpen some stakes, but it'll take 3 days.
-Too long.
-But they watch us!
What do we do about the high voltage?
The powerhouse is near the camp gate.
A Brit worked in there after that woman killed herseIf.
-We've got to talk to him.
-I did. He's willing to help.
But he said we can't get near the powerhouse and the high voltage is never off.
-The powerhouse is locked?
-Sure.
We need an imprint of the lock.
-You go and get it, cIever!
-Hush!
Maybe they're moving out.
Are they really going?
-Yes, yes, they are.
-Quiet, I can't hear a thing!
Maybe they're leaving and they'll let us go.
You, you, you... and you.
Get to work!
Come on, idiots, move!
The imprint of the lock.
-Thanks, Nicole.
-How come you all trusted me?
-We weren't wrong, were you?
-Do the women know about me?
-Not yet.
-Load the truck!
Move! There's no time!
Sasha...
I want to tell you another thing.
It isn't true I'm a thief.
And my name isn't Nicole.
I... I'm a Jewish.
-Nicole!
-See you later...
... at the washhouse.
They'll be too busy to notice.
Yes, Sir!
Yes, Sir!
-Will we make it, Sasha?
-Yes, you'll see.
We'll make it, Nicole.
Come.
You'll really take me home with you?
Sure, you'll come with me.
What will your family say?
Let's see...
My father will look at you silently, then he'll say to me: ''Who is this, Sasha? Your stuff?''
He'll shake his head and go, saying he's busy.
-He won't like me then.
-Very much, but he won't say it.
-Some old peopIe are like that.
-My father was the same.
My mother, though, she'll start crying.
She'll ask if you're hungry, if you're thirsty.
If you're warm enough, if you want a rest.
And if you answer no to all her questions, she'll smile and she'll say to me...
What?
She'll say: ''She's a nice girl, Sasha. Well done.''
I'm not a nice girl, and your mother won't like me. I'm different.
-I...
-Nicole.
You still haven't told me what your real name is.
-Edith.
-Edith, listen. That's what...
... my mother will say and I'll say: ''Sure, she's a nice girl.''
And she'll leave it at that.
We'll be able to go out, and I'll show you my town.
You'll like it, you'll see.
And in the evening we'll dress up and go out again, the two of us together.
We'll go wherever you like.
All right, Edith?
-We'll go dancing, Sasha.
-Yes...
-What time is it?
She'll be here any minute.
-The stakes?
-Ready in the workshop.
-Yanko's coming soon.
-I can go, Salomone.
No, Igor Borovin and
Yanko Milovic will go.
We have work to do here.
So, by 10 at the latest, if all goes well you and Yanko...
... will bring the guns here.
Nicole goes to the powerhouse.
By 10:1 5 he shorts the circuit.
At 10:20 the Brit has to check the power's off.
There's no need to check, we'll hear the siren.
-What siren?
-When the high voltage...
... is turned off, the aIarm sounds.
The powerhouse is next to the sentry post.
... in front of the main watch-tower.
The SS will run up, but she'll have knocked out the system.
-And then?
-Everyone can get away.
But not Nicole.
They'll kill her.
She doesn't stand a chance!
What do you want to do then?
Get us all killed?
-You like life, don't you?
-Like anyone who's alive.
-Would you do it?
-That's a silly question.
You know I'd never get near it.
They'd stop me midway.
But if you were her, would you do it, Salomone Reitman?
-Maybe...
-Maybe!
And you're a man.
You have an idea, you fought.
But Nicole... she's only 1 6.
She knows nothing about these things. She's suffered so much.
-It's not up to her to die.
-I'll go, Sasha.
-Let me try.
-That's impossible.
I've seen Anna. She says the women are going berserk
... praying, crying, talking about rebelling.
A few nearly lynched an SS who walked in, but fortunately...
-Where's Anna?
-She's waiting near the fence.
Tell her to pass it on about the escape.
The orders stand except the signal will be given by a siren.
When they hear it, they have to run to the fence.
Come straight back, it's nearly time.
There are 2000 women in the camp.
They've all suffered and they have a right to live.
And us? You say we fought and we have an idea.
What do you mean by an idea?
It's 6:40.
What are they doing, Sasha?
Are they standing for me?
It's settled then. Let's go.
Can I have a word with you?
You mustn't tell her anything.
Swear you won't.
She'd refuse.
Why should she agree to do it?
-Swear, Sasha.
-Yeah. Why should she agree?
Her life in exchange for so many others.
But it is right to reckon like that?
-No.
-Well then?
Yes, it's monstrous, forcing men...
... to reckon like that.
But in this case, it becomes necessary and even right...
... to kill someone in order to save many others.
We're killing her, you know that?
No, Sasha, it's not us.
We're not the ones to blame.
Come on... swear.
Swear.
I swear.
Aren't you busy now?
We have 5 minutes left.
Come, there's still so much to say.
We must decide how we'll find one another.
I thought about it all night, you know.
As soon as I've cut the power, I'll come here.
-You'll wait for me, Sasha?
-Yes, sure.
And we'll escape together.
But if we miss each other...
There, see the tallest tree down there? Can you see it?
-The tallest one of all.
-Yes.
We'll meet there.
I want to tell you something too.
The first times we met...
I wasn't thinking about escaping, you know?
I didn't say all those things to persuade you to heIp us.
It was only because I was falling in love with you.
I love you...
I love you so much!
You can feeI it, can't you?
Yes, Sasha.
Thank you for everything.
No... you mustn't thank me.
You see, things happen that we can't do anything about.
There shouId be love and happiness for everyone and instead, we're forced to kill and hate.
-Will you understand?
-What? I don't understand.
Sasha, it's time.
Yes.
What?!
Yes... yes.
Yes, Sir.
They're not sending the trucks.
-We have to eliminate them.
-But it takes too long!
Have them start digging a pit at once.
Hide these documents!
Thank you.
Good luck...
Good luck, Yanko.
Attention! Attention!
GeneraI roll call!
We'd better go back.
Come on! Get on with it!
-Just our luck!
-Why is that?
HQ didn't send the trucks.
We'll have to bury them too, afterwards.
-Nice, huh?
-Alice, come here!
Get moving!
Are you sleeping?
Hurry up!
I'm off then, Sasha.
And remember, the tallest tree.
-Edith?
-What is it, Sasha?
Quiet!
As soon as you cut the power... the siren will go off.
They'll come and they'll kill you.
That's how it is, but I have to ask you to go anyway.
None of it's true any more then?
You must go.
What should I do now?
What should I do?
You must go.
You... you want to get me killed?
You must go. You must.
The lives of everyone depend on you alone.
-Yours too, right? Yours too!
-What's going on, Nicole?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
-When do we go?
-When it's all over.
-Where to?
-Germany.
The war's over now.
They conned you, Karl.
They conned you too.
What will you do now?
I don't know. And you?
I don't know.
Living isn't all that necessary.
True... it isn't necessary.
-Go on working!
-Traitor! Scumbag!
She'll go.
I'm sure she'll go.
You'll see, she'll go.
Nicole!
Nicole!
They conned us, Karl.
They conned us both.
Take this off me.
The land of Israel is enlightened...
God is Israel...
God is the light.
Lord, my Lord...
... you who break the chains of the slaves...
All right, you mothers.
I'll show you who Richardson is!
Come on. Come on.
- What's the record?
- You gotta beat 20, babe.
- Hey, you got any doubts?
- How you gonna beat me, Rich?
You gotta be kidding!
- Here comes your second Purple Heart.
- All right!
Three...
...four...
...five...
Get the head, somebody!
What is this?
You never missed my head when I was up there. Come on!
Yeah, two times.
Got his ass, both cheeks.
Forget the butt. The head.
Right in the brain. Come on.
- Here you go, Rich.
- Is that the best you mothers can do?
For Christ's sake, Dick Ennis!
How the hell are you?
Hi, Wally.
- Where are they sending us now?
- I don't know. I just got here.
I got a fantastic story for you.
Human interest...
I write only clean family news, not pornography.
Where these creeps sending us?
Civvy or Rome?
- You find out, you let me know.
- Lf you don't know, who knows?
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen.
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
- Knock it off. You got it, Rich.
- The winner, and new champion!
Richardson, the greatest!
And you're all cruds.
I'll be damned.
Mon cheri, you are fantastique.
You have the qualities of a Madonna, a saint...
That's a lousy Charles Boyer.
Why not stick to Bela Lugosi?
It is Bela Lugosi.
- What does he want?
- Nothing. He says I'll destroy you.
He's right. Go.
I'll ruin you as I've ruined hundreds of women from Salerno to Cincinnati.
Wait. First...
...let me look at your neck.
Dick! I thought you were covering the Cassino front.
I was. I ran out of material.
They all died on me.
Peace!
Peace.
- The Black Devils.
- I want the first crack at Rabinoff.
Peace.
Crap on that. Get the mothers!
Let's get the hell out of here.
Listen, I heard about that Rapido River thing.
Listen, I heard about that Rapido River thing.
- Must've been a real slaughter.
- That's what it was, a real slaughter.
2000 Texas cowboys spinning around in rubber boats and the Germans...
...sitting on the other side, flat zeroed in on them with machine guns.
Hey, Ennis.
Ennis, you son of a bitch.
I remember you from Sicily. The first day, remember? I was up a tree.
I think he used a pipe on me.
Hey, I got something for you.
Here, sarge.
"Admit one" where?
Paradise. All high-class women there.
Use it fast, Ranger, before your number's up.
Do I know him?
Corporal Rabinoff. Sure you do.
He keeps it up, he'll be the most famous corporal since Hitler.
He's got a footlocker full of medals for the guys he's bumped off.
When's this show gonna hit the road?
I'll just never understand you at all.
Seven years, from China to Italy, you haven't got enough of this crap?
- You bucking for a white cross?
- What are you talking about?
You don't have to be here.
I'd like to be in your shoes for five minutes, just five minutes.
You've got a one-way ticket out.
Why not use it?
- Where would I go?
- Home! Back to the U.S., man.
That's where they make the real sacrifices.
You said it.
I'll take that under advisement.
Listen to me.
From a friend...
You're starting to talk a little funny.
If you were one of my guys, I might put you in for a Section Eight.
- You're kidding.
- I think you've begun to like it.
No, I'm not beginning to like it, but I must admit it does get easier.
You're liable to give them hangovers.
Attention!
All right, it's time to dry out.
Prepare to embark in six hours.
Your briefing will be aboard ship.
All right. Dismissed.
See you at halftime, Dick.
- They're all troublemakers.
- Later.
Oh, Mr. Ennis...
I saw your column on the Rapido mess at headquarters...
...in the wastebasket.
A one-star general went home today.
That's not why I wrote it.
Not just to knock somebody down.
It's a pretty emotional piece of writing.
Those Texas boys didn't have to die.
They died before they could say it. I could, so I did.
- You're a fierce friend to have.
- What time's the landing gonna be?
You know better than to ask that.
You'll be told when we're aboard.
Anzio! Many pretty girl at Anzio.
American PX, first-class.
Nylon stockings, Joe!
Nylon stockings, first-class.
Nylon stockings for Anzio.
The Germans will hear him to Berlin.
Buy! I make special price for Anzio.
Cigarettes. Sigarette. Cigarettes.
Candy, si. Sigarette, no.
Here.
Shut up.
Not now, I'm trying to drive this wagon.
All right, all right. Here.
Here, eat this and be quiet.
Hot stuff here. I got hot stuff here.
Move it back.
Police! Pack these guys up there, they're all diseased.
Easy, easy. What's the trouble?
I tell you, the whole outfit's infected. I wouldn't lie to you.
Cut out the din. What's your unit?
First Special Service Force.
Canadian-American.
Black Devils. Weren't you the men in Sicily who...?
We're the guys.
Seriously, I got a man in the back in bad pain. I gotta get going.
All right.
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.
All right, move it out.
That's right, come on.
Outstanding, outstanding work.
God save the King. Here we go.
By yourself, sing by yourself.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who here loves me?
Huh? You love me?
Give me one right there.
That's right. You love me?
You love me?
All right.
Because everybody told the truth...
...everybody is going to get money.
Sing... soft, soft...
There's a lot of money there, baby.
Buy yourself something nice.
A lawn mower...
...or Sicily. Something substantial.
Come here.
Who, me?
You buy something extra.
Come here. Because you're the best.
You're the champ.
Yeah, "champion." I bet you say that to all the girls.
- Marty.
- What?
Why not? You had a good year, didn't you?
She hit 330, stole 24 bases.
Who's got a better right?
I got a surprise for you.
Look at this.
Look at this here. Here's candy.
Don't eat it. You sell it. It's worth about six million dollars.
- What did she say?
- She wants to go with you.
I want to take you.
I think it's a hell of an idea.
But the sergeant, he caught us.
You know what the sergeant said?
"No whores on the invasion."
He's a sick man, you know?
He needs mental care.
Look, Anna, listen.
Sergeant say no.
Sergeant is son of bitch.
Right, right, all together, huh?
Sergeant is son of a bitch.
Sergeant is son of a bitch.
That could be the general.
You know the man suffers from a severe case of piles?
It's a terrible thing.
It's starting to affect his mind.
He said to me,
"Rabinoff, where the hell are you?"
"Sorry, I was busy trying to get some whores on the invasion boat."
"Oh, really? Good thinking, soldier. Good thinking."
Hey, keep it quiet out there.
People are trying to make love.
I gotta go.
Come here.
Take care of her.
I mean it. Take care of her. Not three days. Until it's all over.
Now, get my jacket.
Come on. Come on!
Thattagirl.
You see, it's easy.
Welcome aboard, general.
- The area's secure, sir.
- Very good.
General, one more shot.
This way, sir.
This way!
May we have a statement, sir?
Well, gentlemen, at last.
Sorry to keep such a tight lid on this, but it's big.
At 0200 tonight...
...Gen. Jack Lesley will bypass the
Cassino line...
...which is stalemated, and put an army corps...
...on the beach at...
- Anzio!
- Goddamn it! Who said that?
- Dick Ennis, sir, International Press.
Mr. Ennis, where do you find your information?
In the streets of Napoli, general.
Looks like a real turkey shoot.
- How does that affect your plans?
- In no way.
When 70,000 men come ashore, they're bound to make a splash.
The enemy's bound to hear it.
Dwyer, Chicago Post.
This to General Lesley.
What opposition are you expecting, general?
There are two German divisions there.
Kesselring should have them on the beach in two hours.
Do you plan to make a run through Rome, sir?
No, I intend to drive into Rome very slowly.
We'll be the first conquering army...
...to enter Rome from the south in 1500 years.
Hold it, general.
Could we have General Lesley too, please?
- Thank you, sir.
- Jackson, London Post.
The hills behind Anzio, if I remember my Horace...
...pose a dangerous obstacle. Do you propose to go for those hills first?
It's your answer, Jack.
The first duty of a general is to secure his position.
I'll strengthen the beachhead against
Kesselring's counterattack.
General Lesley...
...they used to say a general's first duty is to succeed. How about that?
In my book, being safe and being successful aren't contradictory.
Right. Don't stick your neck out like I did at Salerno.
First secure the beachhead, then you can be a wildcat.
That's all, gentlemen.
Thank you. Good luck.
How do you spell this name?
A-N-Z-O, right?
Oh, that's not it. That's "Anzo."
It's "Anzio" we're going to.
Why worry? They'll spell it right on your white cross.
A-N-Z-I-O.
That's "Anzio," right?
Cellini, tell him how the ginzos pronounce it.
Sorehead.
Where do you write when the battle starts?
Up there on the line with you guys.
You get enough protection with that thing?
No, not much.
- How soon before we hit shore?
- About four hours.
I'd better check my equipment.
At ease. At ease. You fellas get enough to eat tonight?
Good, good. See you on the beaches.
- You get enough to eat tonight?
- Yes, sir.
Let's hope the Krauts have indigestion.
If not, sir, we'll give them a real case of the Gls.
Oh, Mr. Ennis.
I don't ordinarily court newspapermen...
...like some generals I know.
However, I would like to set the record straight on a few points.
Do you know what success in battle really means, Mr. Ennis?
It's not simply territorial gains.
Many battles have been lost after the objectives were won.
I believe that every foot of ground gained must be balanced by the cost.
Cost per foot in terms of human lives.
The invasion tonight will be successful.
Most large-scale landings are.
The difference between a real success and failure...
...will be spelled out after we hit the beaches.
I have two responsibilities tonight,
Mr. Ennis. One to my mission...
...and the other to my men.
Human lives are important to me.
You can print that.
Wasn't it Napoleon who said...
..."A general who worries too much about his men is doomed to failure"?
I may be a cautious man, Mr. Ennis, but I am certainly not a pacifist.
Tell me... You know, I've followed your work now for many years.
Why do you make a trip like this?
I make them because that's what I'm paid to do. It's my job.
I know, I know, but...
Also, of course, I have to.
I have to answer a question that's been asked of me...
...since I saw my first dead face:
Why do we do it?
Why do we kill each other?
How can a perfectly ordinary, good-natured guy...
...who wouldn't slap down a mosquito...
...sit up in an airplane and bomb 1000 sleeping strangers down beneath him?
We do it to survive, Mr. Ennis.
In war, it's kill or be killed.
Come on, you don't buy that.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
What's your answer?
I haven't found an answer.
But when I do...
...I promise you'll be among the first to know, general.
Your coat, sir.
We're changing course for Anzio.
It's cold.
Yeah, landings are always cold.
Excuse me, Mr. Ennis.
- Can't they shut up a little?
- At ease.
What time? Now?
14 seconds.
Soon you can pin another battle star to your tunic.
Screw it. Right now I'd trade it for a stateside ration card.
Now it's Rome's turn.
What do you mean?
It was here at Anzio that
Nero fiddled while Rome burned.
Now it's Rome's turn to watch the glow in the sky.
All right, Rangers, let's go.
Pull it up.
All right, move it out.
Let's go, boys.
There you are.
Quiet night.
Yeah. Just like it was at Salerno.
- They let us get in, in, in...
- Knock it off.
- That's how it was at Salerno.
- Knock it off.
I can feel it coming.
Any second now...
Hold it.
All right, let's go.
Let's go!
Three o'clock!
At least nobody can say that the landing was unopposed.
Let's move in, sergeant.
- How are things up here?
- It sure isn't Salerno.
Funniest thing I ever saw.
We're to move up three miles and dig in.
- And if we don't meet them?
- Move, and we'll wait for them.
- Let's go.
- Colonel...
...a favor?
- Give.
I'd like a jeep to snoop around a little.
Whose neck are you after now?
- Get him a jeep and a driver.
- Okay. Sergeant, a jeep and a driver.
A jeep and a driver.
- I'm not sure about a driver.
- We have a driver.
Him we can spare.
Watch out for him, he's a virgin.
Let's go.
Wait, stop the jeep.
What is it?
Something back there.
Let's see what it is.
It's one of theirs.
I wonder what got to him?
I bet he goes back to using safety razors.
Small world.
- What are you doing?
- Fooling around.
That could be dangerous.
You seen any Germans?
- No. You?
- A couple of strays.
They all look like that one?
This was a crucial defense position.
The man had to go.
- You want a ride?
- Why not?
Where are all the Germans?
I don't know, but if this keeps up we'll hit Rome.
Hey, look at that!
I'm beginning to think they actually didn't know...
...and that we've surprised the bejesus out of them.
We have nothing.
They can go where they like!
Not as much as a minefield to stop their walk.
Two days ago when the Goering division was here...
...l'd have burnt them.
General field marshal,
General von Vietinghoff.
Kesselring. Yes.
Yes, you heard right.
They are pouring in, and we have no one to put against them.
They can scoop up Rome.
Of course it's the hills.
The hills are why they are here.
Highway 6 and 7, and the railway.
Our arteries.
No, you may not.
Listen, I will not shorten the Cassino line.
I'm sometimes surprised, but never panicked.
You're very complimentary.
Now, who can you give me?
The 3rd Panzer Grenadiers?
They must be up by tomorrow night.
Tanks, flamethrowers.
Yes, they must move by day.
I know they will be bombed and must suffer casualties.
And I want the Hermann
Goering division back.
I'm going to take the 19th...
...out of the line of hill 165.
I've taken them.
If you are afraid of gaps...
...put the cooks and the generals into the line.
General field marshal,
Air Reconnaissance.
Of course I was joking.
Hold, please.
Man can't even take a bad joke.
Kesselring. Yes.
What?
Five kilometers?
You're sure?
You said five kilo...?
You are sure?
Five kilo...
Thank you.
As a soldier I'm ashamed of them.
They're digging in.
They're going headfirst into the ground.
Now be fast. The 71 st Infantry, get them moving in an hour.
No, no, cancel. In half an hour.
Von Vietinghoff, I have nothing here at Anzio!
For now, I must do what I can with my own hands! Heil Hitler!
I'll wake him at 6.
They could sleep in the hotels of Rome tonight.
My only defense is, they don't know it.
Rome must be close.
This looks like Westchester County.
Sure as hell ain't Philadelphia.
The Krauts really hit this place.
- Movie, that's the way Rome is.
- Rome?
I'll be a son of a bitch.
- I'm getting out of here.
- Let's go in.
This is crazy...
You'll be the first conqueror to enter from the south for 1500 years.
- Me?
- You're the man with the sword.
- You're the man.
- Feel like another Julius Caesar.
Better. He didn't have to risk his life in a jeep.
Germans.
Pull in that alley, quick.
Hey!
Quiet.
Quiet!
Keep it to yourself.
Look, the Germans?
What is that?
He said the troops left a few weeks ago.
Nobody left there but the SS and the military police.
- This is an open city.
- What are we gonna do about it?
We're gonna jump in that jeep and run back to tell Mama.
Movie, come on.
- I'm in love.
- Let's go!
I shall return!
I've a good mind to take a chance and go.
You missed the Salerno clobbering.
We're a new kind of animal now.
Like tortoises, we keep our necks in.
Where are their tanks, their lorries?
Only three hours to Rome.
Doesn't he see the possibility?
Why don't you ask him?
By God, I will, sir.
Doing a fine job.
This will give Kesselring a surprise.
- General Lesley?
- Yes, General Starkey?
Permit me to put out a patrol to Rome.
I can't afford an attack.
- But, sir...
- Denied! Luke.
What do you think?
Our luck has run good, Jack.
We might try a small gamble.
- Couple of hundred men?
- Something like that. Just an idea.
It might give them a taste of our blood...
...and bring him down before we're set.
I still have that beachhead to build.
Without it I have nothing.
This silence is a clever way of dealing with us.
We've planned for everything but this.
But it's just a bit too clever.
It's given us what we need, time to get ashore.
And General Starkey...
...no doubt Kesselring's strategy is to draw us forward.
I'm sure he's prepared quite a welcoming committee for us.
Well, Marshal Kesselring will just have to sit and wait.
All our moves will be made down here on the beaches.
What if he isn't yet in strength and can't attack?
Then, general, in five or six days, after careful planning...
...based on sound intelligence, we'll go out and look for him.
Here it is, just as I thought.
Herr Kesselring is getting worried.
And I can't say that I'm sorry.
Smack into the port.
Heavier than anything we've got, Jack.
- American jeep coming in.
- Where?
From our front lines.
- You said Rome, Mr. Ennis?
- That's right.
We went in at 40 miles an hour, came out at 50.
The roads weren't jammed with Kesselring's troops?
No, if it hadn't been for the SS and a few police, the city seems open.
Would you like me to have a look, sir?
He wouldn't spring a trap for one jeep.
No, we stay put.
Don't worry, we'll catch our fox...
...but in our time, not his.
Thank you, Mr. Ennis.
The 64th Infantry are coming through.
Good, we have caged them in.
I'll never understand this.
They came ashore only to fall direct on the beach.
Anzio is the cheapest
POW camp in Europe.
50,000 men who feed themselves.
I feel I am present at a farce in a theater.
We sit comfortably in the dark.
They are on stage.
We can see every gesture of the actor.
If he lights a cigarette, we puff out the match.
They are so young.
Some of them are what, 15?
Yes, but with spirit, pride.
If pride alone could win battles, we could take the world.
But wars are won by machines, gasoline and oil.
You and I must beg for our supplies.
There, a sergeant's call is enough.
Still, we have reason to hope for the best.
Then let us prepare for the worst.
I want a new line, more impenetrable than Cassino.
Minefields as thick as wheat fields.
Every house a fortress.
I want bunkers, pillboxes...
...a wall of steel and concrete clear across Italy.
Draft every Italian you can get.
Be careful.
Work only at night. Camouflage everything so nothing can be seen.
The enemy must not know it is there.
Yes, sir. And what code name, sir?
It defends Rome...
The "Caesar Line."
Sir, there is a movement of trucks on the enemy right.
Yeah, I can see them opposite Cisterna.
They've good intelligence.
It's our weakest point.
Then make it our strongest.
Here's one I've been working on. Who's this?
- "Mammy!"
- Shirley Temple calling her mother.
Funny.
- Hey, Mr. Ennis?
- Yeah.
Before you forget, would you write down that address?
What address?
In Rome. Rome, the girl...
Just give me the name of the street.
- I was looking the same place you were.
- I knew it.
- I'll be waiting for some good news.
- Yes, sir.
- An unexpected pleasure.
- Just came to wish your men good luck.
This infiltration is a bold venture, colonel...
...but we know there's a gap there up to Cisterna.
Your Rangers travel light.
- Yes, sir.
- Except for me, sir.
Play merry hell coming out of that ditch.
You'll be on your own.
When the tanks come to you...
...this front will crumble fast.
- We'll do our best.
- That's the ticket.
- See you all in the morning.
- Yes, sir.
- You don't have to go along, Ennis.
- I know, colonel.
- You want a weapon?
- No, thank you.
- Things could get rough.
- I've been there before.
If I do get it, I won't be around to write about you.
That's a consolation.
The 1 st and 3rd Battalions are ready, sir.
Very good. Move your men out to the kickoff point.
A guide is waiting there to lead you up. Don't lose him.
If he's such a good guide, he'd find us.
Sergeant?
We managed to make it this far out of Africa...
...without any special help.
I know how you feel.
But those are good men.
- They're usually behind enemy lines.
- Yes, sir.
- Pete, move them out.
- Very well, sir.
- Fall in!
- Fall in!
- Fall in!
- Fall in!
Down!
Anybody faint?
Hey, Ennis! Small world.
I take it you're our guide.
That's right, just keep your mouth shut and follow my ass.
Corporal...
...consider yourself busted.
Whatever you want, captain, but I didn't mean no harm.
I'm gonna take care of everybody...
...no matter how rough it gets.
So just trust me.
I'd trust him, captain.
From this point on we're behind the lines.
Pass the word: no talking, no whispering, just walk quiet.
All right.
From this point on we're behind enemy lines...
- Sure you don't want to go back?
- Made it this far, Dad.
All right. Suit yourself.
- You like doing this?
- I don't mind, really.
It's a great thing you're doing.
- I can't resist a good story.
- You do it for the story?
- That's a hell...
- I don't know why I do it.
Well, I know why I do it.
And someday I'll tell you.
And it's got nothing to do with democracy.
Hold it.
Wine, fresh fish and women four miles up. Pass it on.
That's Cisterna.
Open country.
Deploy your men, sergeant.
- Mr. Ennis?
- Yeah.
As soon as this is over and we take Rome...
...I take out an ad in the paper.
What did you say?
An ad. I'll take out an ad that really describes her.
- It'll never work, Movie.
- Why?
Must be a thousand girls in Rome with hands like that.
Haystack!
Down!
- It's bad. Bad.
- It's a setup.
We've been had.
Get through to command, quick!
Tell them we're trapped.
Tell them "tanks."
I've got nothing to fight tanks.
Put down your weapons and stand up.
Put them down and stand up.
You'll be well treated.
You're protected by the Geneva Convention.
We will wait 20 seconds for your answer.
Beachhead, this is Ranger one-niner, over.
Fifteen.
Ten.
Five.
Negative!
He's had it.
- Beachhead, this is Rangers Nine...
- Get up, damn it!
He's had it.
Keep trying, Andy. Keep trying!
We got tanks on every side.
I repeat, tanks.
Medic! Medic!
They got Ennis!
Everybody's dying.
Do you read me? Over.
You're okay.
They don't shoot dead people.
I found that out.
You goddamn son of a bitch.
Look, we can't play dead, Ennis.
We got guns.
Every man's got his own way.
Tell that to the guy who gets killed sticking his neck out for you.
Those bushes at four o'clock.
Let's try for them.
- Hey, Rabinoff!
- Shut up.
- We're gonna try for the bushes.
- Who's we?
Me.
Good luck.
Let's go.
- You want this?
- No.
Flamethrower!
- It's gonna get hot.
- They'll get to us soon.
Let's see what's out back.
If we make it over to that thicket, we might make it.
Hold it!
Minefield.
Gently, just turn around and try to find your way in your own footsteps.
We gotta take this bastard on.
Maybe we can blow a track.
- Save the grenades, gather some rocks.
- Why rocks?
We got no chance with it.
Better odds in the minefield.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Everybody fall down!
Again! Hit it!
- Where'd you learn this?
- From an old Chinese.
- Did he make it?
- No.
But he might have.
Okay, let's give him a hand!
- Anybody watching that tank?
- Yeah!
Down we go!
Hit it!
I recommend surrender. Pass it on.
Everybody down!
He heard that one!
All right, come on, let's go.
God is love, God is love.
Hey, you crazy mother...!
It's easy.
The fool made it!
Let's go!
That's where we were.
776 of us.
For nothing.
- Get that thing working.
- It's been beat to hell.
Fix it.
- Where are we? Any dispatches?
- Nothing.
- We're running into heavy opposition.
- Beachhead, this is Rangers one-niner.
- This is Rangers one-niner.
- Come in, Rangers...
Where are you?
I got somebody.
I don't know how long it'll last.
Hello, Beachhead, this is Dick Ennis.
I'm on the Alban Hills with the survivors.
Sorry to interrupt your game, general...
...but I thought you should know you lost a few pins off your chart.
First and second Rangers battalions have been wiped out. Do you read me?
Of 767 men, there are seven survivors...
...left to see the result of one more royal foul-up.
This one's unique. This didn't happen because a general was too reckless...
...but because a general was too cautious, how about that?
An entire outfit wiped out because the general was timid.
I know it rarely happens that way, but it sure as hell happened here.
A timid general.
He walked them into a park and left them in a graveyard.
We are losing your signal.
Graveyard.
- That won't quite get it, will it?
- That's it. We lost them.
That doesn't begin to put across what's going on here.
- They can't hear you.
- Yeah, I know. They never did.
Ain't that a bitch?
A dumb, dirty, stupid, useless bitch.
What are you doing, sarge?
But the guys are dead.
That's part of the job.
Why take it out on the radio?
I just hope we don't have to make a call.
They're dead. What're you gonna do?
Here it comes.
Hold your breath, boys.
Is that ours?
That's ours. That's ours!
That's one of ours!
Drop bombs, baby! Drop bombs!
- Get down! Get down!
- Come on, baby! That's my baby!
Stay down.
The woods are full of Krauts.
I don't see anything.
They're there.
Believe me, they're there.
It looks like trucks.
- It could be a supply depot.
- We're 30 miles from nowhere.
Looks more like a prison camp.
See that break in the trees?
- That's a wire stockade.
- Jesus, those woods are walking.
- It's a construction job.
- Forced labor, thousands of them.
- What are they laboring at?
- Roads, bridges, maybe a railway.
With all those men and equipment, it looks big to me.
- I think we ought to take a look.
- Is that what you think?
I'll tell you what I think.
My job is to get us out of this mess.
Those trucks could be going anywhere.
Rome, even Yugoslavia.
It's 6:00 at night.
Why do they have concrete mixers?
Because the Germans have got no air cover. They gotta work at night.
Boy, these patrol specialists gripe my ass.
- You're fighting instinct.
- No, I get tired of...
Yeah, maybe I am.
Rabinoff, come here, will you?
Okay, but we do it my way.
We all go look in groups.
Cellini, you and Andy.
Doyle, Movie, come with me.
Richardson with Rabinoff. Dick?
- Sure, I might get 800 words out of it.
- Stick with these guys.
This might come in handy.
I doubt it.
What the hell is it?
It's a great big trap.
Look, that's better than the Cassino line.
When the fellas get off the beach, it'll be waiting for them.
How about that?
Now you see it, now you don't.
No sirens, no whistles, no nothing.
It's too secret for sirens.
All right, now we've seen it.
What do we do about it?
Look close, memorize all we can.
You go down that end.
I'll cover it from over here.
Be nice to have someone in the middle.
You go right ahead on.
I'll meet you back here.
You got in here.
Come on, get me out.
I surrender!
Surrender!
We almost gave up.
Where's Richardson?
Don't wait up for him.
- Why? What happened to Rich?
- He got shot.
- How?
- What's the difference? He's dead.
Simple, huh, sarge? Just like that?
When you're dead, you're dead.
That's all.
Remember that.
It might keep you careful.
Just be glad this one wasn't you.
- You okay to move?
- Yeah, why not?
If the bombed house is safe, we'll put up there for the night.
Movie, Cellini, look in the cellar.
Doyle, take upstairs.
Rabinoff, come here, will you?
Let's take a look at this thing.
This is the coast.
Here's Anzio, Rome, Cisterna.
This must be the line of defense.
Where are we?
About there.
Our main objective is to get to Anzio as quick as possible...
...preferably in one piece.
I say we go south.
Try to break through around Cassino.
That'll take a month.
The line'll be hard.
Only one way to do it quickly: direct to Anzio.
We'll be crawling over the dead.
I worry about the living.
They get the wrong ideas.
This war's shaping up.
I gotta show you something lovely.
This war's shaping up.
I gotta show you something lovely.
Take a look what your old dad found.
Don't be afraid.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.
Come on, let's go.
Don't be afraid, let's go.
The setup here's very cozy.
Who are they?
What are they doing here?
Emilia Sibilio.
They live here. It's their house.
Have they seen any Germans today?
Ask if she knows anything about what's happening in Anzio.
The Germans are attacking.
They're driving.
They're driving us back into the sea.
Anna.
Excuse. I speak a little English.
Not too good.
My mother say you welcome to stay.
We are alone, three women.
The food is poor but...
...lo divideremo with you.
It's the best offer I've had this war.
Thank you, Diana.
- Wait, you're Anna.
- Anna.
Come on downstairs.
Bring your family.
C-Ration-o.
Mucho good-o.
- Where'd you get that?
- I found it.
Made in Germany.
They make good toys.
- Blackbird?
- That's right.
Non capisco. Action?
Somebody better capisco and quickly.
Your house, this casa, is right in the middle of a war.
The sooner you tell your mother, the better.
Not possible to leave.
My family always live here.
Always the same house.
Four generazioni.
So cannot leave.
Also, we must wait for my father to come.
- Where is your father?
- Tedeschi take him for to...
...how you say...?
The Germans drafted him to work on that new line.
Yes. Five day past.
One day he with us, one day he not.
I'm sorry about that, Anna.
Everybody, from the top.
Here we go, tutti, tutti, tutti.
One time.
Cellini, come on.
What's the matter?
What's the matter? What is this?
Give me that jacket.
Hang on, bite down.
Just hang on. Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Just stay there. Just stay there.
Look, fellows...
...I think he can use the air more now than the company. Okay?
- Anything anybody can do?
- No, unless you have a Band-Aid.
Very funny.
Oh, that's murder.
No, it's the stomach...
...a Japanese grenade.
Ripped my insides.
Got all metal in there.
Under tension it contracts and...
...all hell breaks lose.
I must have been tense.
Good thinking. You belong in a hospital, not in a war.
They said that when they sent me home.
You got out, then you went to Canada and joined this outfit?
That's right.
- How'd you get past the doctors?
- Lied about my age.
You've gotta be crazy.
Your guts blown out and you're back here? What for?
- Great time for an interview.
- You got something better to do?
- Why did you re-enlist?
- Why?
Because I like it. You know,
I missed it, Ennis. I want this.
With the mud and the pain, these clowns giving orders...
...there's nothing like it.
A guy sells shoes for 40 years,
I live more in one day.
I see more and feel more...
...I taste more, I think more.
I'm more.
Understand? I'm more.
There's more to living than just breathing.
- Capisce?
- Capisce.
You're the same way.
That's right. War is part of you.
When this one's over...
...you'll find another, and I hope I'm with you.
Man, that was a rough one.
What the hell is this, a wake?
Sam, where are you?
Come on, we've got work to do.
Come here.
From the top, one time.
Lovely skin, eh?
Quiet!
Kill the lights and fire!
You got an attic?
Attic! Attic! Attic!
Open up, signora.
- Come on, you can't stay here.
- Ennis, come on!
Come on.
- I cannot go.
- Anna!
Do you know what they'll do to you?
- No, I cannot go.
- Let's move!
- Will you come?
- You go.
Your men are waiting.
- Come on!
- What about them?
They're not our problem. Let's go.
Anzio's this way, remember?
Boy, this guy is good.
Get a move over.
Leave him alone.
- He's hit.
- He's dead.
Come, we can use him for cover.
- Sure he's dead?
- He is now.
He's good, all right.
You better believe it.
Where the hell is he?
He's about 50 yards over there.
How many are there?
I'm not sure. I think four.
- Where'd that come from?
- Eleven o'clock.
They're all around us.
- Abe!
- Yeah, Dick?
How are you?
- No score.
- I see dust on your right. Watch him.
Check!
Let's take out the guy at eleven o'clock.
That's your grenade.
The same time, let's move to get around them.
All right.
Now?
- Now.
- Now.
Movie. Movie!
Yeah, I'm okay.
Stay put.
You can cover Stimmler from there.
Hell, this is no good.
Let's get back to the ditch.
- Hey, Andy?
- Yeah?
We're going back to the ditch.
Okay, get moving.
Let's go.
Okay, Andy!
- Andy!
- Wait...
- Cellini.
- Yeah.
Make your way down this ditch 20 yards.
When you're behind him, signal.
- When I yell, you get him from behind.
- Okay.
Now!
Hey, Abe!
Hey, Abe!
Yeah, Dick?
You all right?
I'm hit. Dick?
Andy and Cellini are both dead.
They're taking us out one by one.
I'm going out after him.
- Movie!
- Yeah.
There's one at four o'clock.
First hole this side of the ridge.
I'm going out after him.
Give me cover.
You got it.
Going out!
Go!
I hope it's a good story.
Keep your head down.
Hey, Rabinoff.
Okay, Rabinoff. Move!
I see him.
All right, Movie.
Keep him in your sights.
You got it.
I got him. I got him!
There's another one, Movie.
Keep your eye on him and cover me.
Right here, German.
Welcome to the club, Mr. Ennis.
This all of us?
Come on, we still got half a mile to go.
They have artillery here...
...machine gun posts all through here...
...tank traps here and up through here.
These are minefields here, here.
The whole area is mined.
Bunker, bunker, bunker, bunker: all bunkers through here.
I'll be damned.
You got the picture.
I want that line hit around the clock.
Not another shovel of earth turned.
That line mustn't get solid.
Put everything you've got over it.
Mr. Ennis, thank you.
Jack, we're going up to the line.
Want to come?
- I'll finish here first, Luke.
- Very well.
- You did a great job.
- Thank you.
I suppose you'll be taking a good long rest in Naples?
No, I'll stick around with your show a little while longer.
It's no longer my show, Mr. Ennis.
I'm going home.
I was relieved.
I was replaced the day before yesterday by General Howard.
It would seem as if you and Napoleon had a point.
My epitaph...
...written by no less a person than Winston Churchill:
"I'd hoped we were hurling a wildcat onto the shore...
...but all we've got is a stranded whale."
- He knows how to use words.
- Yeah.
Had I a few more days...
...I might've gotten out of Anzio with a little honor.
At least you are getting out with your life.
I guess that is something.
- Well, what happens next?
- Next?
How does it work out?
Oh, we'll win. It'll take considerably more time now...
...more lives, but we'll drive
Kesselring back.
General Carson will have his day in Rome.
And then?
Then? We defeat the enemy.
We win the war.
What happens then?
We just choose up sides and start all over again?
- You think of this as a game?
- General, is it not the ultimate game?
And not for survival?
Not for survival, to secure shelter or to appease hunger.
Oh, you've found your answer then.
I believe I have, general.
Men kill because they like to.
Because they like to? And that's it?
That's it. Plain and simple.
They love to.
War has never solved anything, history teaches us that.
But you face a man with a gun in your hands...
...you live more intensely then, than in any other moment in life.
You're scared and you have to kill him.
We kill each other because we like to.
That's a hell of a condemnation of mankind, Mr. Ennis.
I'm afraid it is, general, but maybe if we recognize it...
...and admit it, we might learn to live with each other.
We hope.
Hey, Mr. Ennis!
- She's mine!
- Hey, Movie!
- Hey, Movie!
- Mr. Ennis, look! On the arch!
Two thousand years later.
Nothing changes except the uniforms and the transportation.
Major Frick!
Major Frick!
Tell the town commandant of Rjukan that an attempt has been made on the Reichskommissar's life!
He'll arrange for 15 civilian hostages from the district of Telemark to be shot in reprisal.
Like the look of it, gentlemen?
Most interesting.
We are well-informed of what you do here, Herr Nilssen.
A little experimentation with heavy water, that's all.
With deuterium oxide.
Yes, yes, we know.
Nilssen.
I must tell you, the time has come to make a decisive transition from theory to practice.
You've done enough experimentation, my dear fellow.
This room has more significance for us than you can possibly realize.
Oh, well, one day perhaps he will realize.
Don't you think, gentlemen?
Forget about fertilizers.
This factory is required by the Reich to increase its production of heavy water by 400%.
We want 10,000 pounds of heavy water by Easter next year.
That's impossible.
It's not at all impossible,
Herr Nilssen.
What is necessary will always be accomplished.
All the more so when the whole future of the Reich is at stake.
All the technical details have been worked out in Berlin.
Here, take a look.
And notice also our modification of the deuterium formula.
But what is the reason?
I don't understand.
That was a firing squad, my dear Nilssen.
Let it be a warning.
Major Frick here will be in charge of security.
And it will be the maximum.
Halt!
Stupid fool!
Dr. Pedersen.
No, I'm sorry, he's busy.
He's working in the darkroom.
Hey, you can't go barging in on Professor Pedersen, you know.
How long is he likely to be there?
Could be there all afternoon.
I'll wait for him.
Shut that door!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Can't you see the red light's on?
I'm sorry.
I'd like to speak to you.
Don't you know the damage you can do barging into a darkroom when the signal light's on?
I've got to give you a message.
All right, I'll be in touch.
Now, what do you want?
I come from Telemark, near the Norsk Hydro factory.
I didn't ask where you were born.
I come from Chief Engineer Nilssen.
He wants your opinion on something.
He says only you would understand it.
- Understand what?
- The message.
It's in here.
What's this, some sort of student joke?
It's not a joke.
And I'm no student.
It contains an undeveloped photographic negative.
Open it.
Who are you?
Knut Straud.
I used to work on the sawmills, but now I fight Nazis.
One of those.
Get back to your sawmill.
I'm not interested in your messages.
My work is here.
You understand?
I've just seen you at your work.
I'd rather embrace one Norwegian than kill a dozen a day, friend.
Look at this.
Every time you people play boy scouts and blow up a few Nazi trucks,
12 hostages are shot.
That's your great work?
Keep it.
Get out of here and take your toothpaste with you.
A lot of boy scouts risked their lives to get this to you.
I must get to England.
We've contacted London.
They're expecting us.
How are we for fuel?
I'm sorry. My wife is a little clumsy.
No, no, it's my fault.
How far you going?
Kristiansand? Further up?
As far up as she'll go.
How far will she go?
We'll make it.
I've counted 12 in the crew and eight passengers, plus the Quisling.
All we need now is a little fog and the trolls on our side.
Don't tell me a big boy like you believes in trolls.
You all know what to do?
Well, Doctor, press this little thing here and the bullets come out there.
Get off the bridge!
We're taking over this ship in the name of the Royal Norwegian Government.
This ship's going to England.
Like hell it is!
You've got a choice.
Sail under the King as free men or be prisoners for the rest of the war.
Good evening.
Stay where you are.
We're taking over this ship in the name of the King.
Look out!
- Quisling bastard!
- Serves him right.
What can we do for you?
Give us a hand.
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- What's going on?
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
There's just been a slight change in our itinerary.
Change! What?
Now, instead of going up the coast to Kristiansand, we'll be going to England.
England?
Now, don't be alarmed.
Now or never, Captain.
Fools. You'll never get across the North Sea alive.
Enemy planes will spot you.
That's the chance we're going to take.
There are mines, thousands of them.
And neither the British nor the Germans happen to have given us a map.
- You believe in the trolls?
- Oh, yes, he does.
Well, so do I, providing we've a sharp lookout.
England, Captain?
South, southwest.
South, southwest, sir.
Thank you, Captain.
Mines! Mines!
- Full astern.
- Full astern, sir.
Hard aport.
What's going on?
What's all the commotion about?
- Something about mines.
- They said mines.
- Stop engines.
- Stop engines, sir.
- Slow ahead both.
- Slow ahead both.
It's too close.
You trying to blow us up?
Get that pole.
- Full astern.
- Full astern, sir.
Hang on this line.
The next time you want to play billiards with a mine, remember my job is to get you safely to London.
Your passes, sir.
What the devil is heavy water?
It's a liquid with a heavier hydrogen structure than ordinary water.
It also possesses properties useful in the study of atomic energy.
Yes, but what's the significance of the Germans ordering this vast increase of the stuff?
In the formula that Nilssen sent me, the Germans have added a new component to the accepted equation.
Look, I'd rather wait till that formula's been examined by Professor Einstein and
Dr. Oppenheimer in New York.
But, Professor, surely it's something more than just a doubt that brought you all the way to England?
It is. It's a very great fear.
And if it's justified, we'll know about it soon enough.
Thank you.
- I'll lead the way, shall I?
- Thank you.
Good morning, George, Charlie.
I wonder, gentlemen, would you mind?
Thank you so much.
This is Professor
Sir Roderick Logan, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, perhaps I should tell you or perhaps
I should not tell you that we have just come from a very brief and equally a very painful session with the Prime Minister on this.
Ah!
Aye, well, at any rate, here is the report that came from Washington this morning.
Following their initial reading of the data brought by Dr. Pedersen from Norway, um, plus certain other indicators, incidentally, Professors Einstein,
Fermi and Oppenheimer concurring, the scientific and military consensus in America is that the Germans may be ahead of us in the race to achieve controlled atomic fission.
If they are ahead and they get their atomic bomb, they've won the war.
Ah, there you are, Knut.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
Come in.
Come on in, Mr. Straud.
Thank you.
- Come on in. Take a chair.
- Thank you.
We've examined the situation very carefully, and it's been agreed in London and Washington that the factory making heavy water must be destroyed without delay.
Personally, I agree with you, Bill, that bombing is, in this instance, the most obvious method.
Right.
At the same time, we wish, if we can, to avoid large-scale civilian death.
This is also clearly the wish of the Norwegian government.
I suggest, gentlemen, that Dr. Pedersen, who knows what's at stake, and Mr. Straud, who knows his country backwards, be asked to return immediately to Telemark, in order to resolve this question.
That is, to determine, with objectivity, whether a ground attack by commandos is practical or not.
Agreed?
Agreed.
How do we get back to Norway?
The simplest way, by parachute.
We're miles off course, but I know where we are.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, if you're a reindeer.
Where do we go from here?
I'm taking you to one of my radio operators.
He's our contact with London.
Now what?
Over that mountain.
A farmhouse.
Another one of my operators.
I know this place.
Oh, Knut Straud.
Come in.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Wonderful to see you.
Hello, Anna.
Good God, what are you doing here?
Well, just dropped in for a cup of coffee.
Uncle.
- Uncle.
- What is it?
Rolf is here.
Oh, damn!
Hello, Uncle.
Hello, Rolf. What on earth are you doing here?
Oh, Mr. Straud.
It's always good to see you.
- You know each other, too?
- Yes, we've met.
What a surprise.
I had no idea you were all such good friends.
Hadn't you?
Listen, I think you'd better know that we've put you in some danger by coming here.
What?
Well, we're working for the resistance.
You? You're not serious?
Well, he got me into it.
Was that wise, Knut?
You seem to know each other quite well.
Oh!
Everybody knows everybody here.
Let me introduce you to my ex-wife.
Can we have some coffee now, Anna?
I've no time for coffee.
I'm working for the resistance.
Well, we both can't be working for the resistance.
- It's ridiculous.
- You look terrible.
He's been dragging me around the Vidda for two days.
There's some pajamas and hot water upstairs.
You two had better go along up to the bedroom.
I... I take it you know the way.
Yeah, I know the way.
- Follow me.
- Thank you.
It's odd, isn't it, to have him in the house again?
What's odd about it?
You and he shared the same bed for two years, and as far as I remember, you damn seldom got out of it.
You should be asleep.
Oh, I just thought I'd drop in, all in the line of duty, to discuss resistance tactics with a fellow fighter.
By the way, how's your resistance these days, hmm?
Fine. How's yours?
Mine?
Well, I was great until I met that boy scout Knut Straud.
Well, I was content.
I had a good life, and now look where I am.
Yes, it's exhausting to commit yourself to others.
You still commit yourself beautifully, like you always did.
I'm not your wife now, Rolf.
I know.
You're not anybody's wife. Are you?
Go to bed.
Sure.
Yes, you would like that, wouldn't you?
Do you mean you would?
You know what you were born for.
No.
Yes, you know what you were born for.
Tell me.
Say those things to me.
Your voice, never out of my head.
You're the same, you're my life.
Yes, you are.
You've got the words wrong, Rolf.
You see, it's not so easy seducing your ex-wife.
Students are much easier, aren't they?
I just don't believe in you anymore.
- Anna.
- Will you please go?
Please.
Sleep well.
We'll make this our main transmitter hut.
Can't risk the farm.
It's getting too dangerous.
I'll make sure that Nilssen is at the church this morning.
Good.
Uncle, be careful.
The town is full of Germans.
Merry Christmas, Uncle.
See you in church.
Merry Christmas.
It's Sigrid.
Oh, that's Arne's wife?
I've got a message for you from Arne.
He's in England. He's fine.
Will you see him again?
Tell him I've a message for him, too.
He'll be a father in the spring.
They'll have their 10,000 pounds of heavy water by Easter.
The marker, microfilm of the factory, exact details.
Ammonia and hydrogen pipes.
You see how close it is to the village.
Look how near the factory is to their homes.
Look at the rabbit!
Land mines.
Come on.
Oh, excuse me.
I don't think
I've seen you in Rjukan before.
Who are you?
Well, I've come to visit my fiancee for Christmas.
I see. Your fiancee.
How very charming indeed.
And what is his name?
- Well, my name...
- I'm asking her.
Jan Kristansen.
Mmm-hmm.
Let me see your identity card, please.
Certainly.
Excuse me.
Here it is.
Oh.
A-ha.
Your text, I believe?
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
And the compliments of the season to both of you.
How did you like our town, Rolf?
Oh, I liked it.
You should have seen the torchlight parades we used to have.
Yes, every November.
It was wonderful.
Flaming torches, you could see it from miles away up in the mountains.
The snow was whiter then.
Yes. It was all the lights on the snow.
Then we made snowballs and threw them at the torches.
Remember, Knut?
This is a detailed layout of the factory.
Well, they've got 3,000 pounds of heavy water in there right now ready to be shipped to Germany.
Well, let's decide on what message we send to London.
There's only one message.
"Examined area.
"Consider ground attack totally impractical.
"Recommend alternate method."
You mean, to bomb it!
Yes.
That would destroy Rjukan and everybody in it!
Possibly.
Bombing is impossible.
The factory is deeply imbedded in a gorge.
The only way across that gorge is a narrow bridge, 75-feet long.
Two men with machine guns could hold off a battalion.
I can get inside that factory with ten men,
Ten men, and blow it sky-high.
They've got millimeter guns on every hill.
And without destroying an entire village in the process.
Barbed wire. Land mines.
Six thousand lives.
Do you realize what...
Anna, keep out of this.
We're talking about something that affects the world.
Look, I don't give a damn about the world.
I'm talking about my town, her town, his town.
Now we live there!
I'm talking about people.
Do you understand that? People!
You weren't so squeamish when hostages were being shot.
They're people.
This is a hell of a lot more important than blowing up a few Nazi trucks.
I was fighting a war, Doctor, and I was doing my job.
And I'm doing mine.
I don't like it.
And I didn't ask for it.
Anna, you live here.
It's natural you want to save your own people's lives, but this is something that has to be done.
It's important.
Important enough to kill 6,000 people?
Yes.
Look,
I want to know what's so important about heavy water.
I don't make the rules.
I can't tell you.
I want to know, Doctor, and you're going to tell me.
I'm telling you nothing.
Do you think that
I'm going to sacrifice the lives of 6,000 people on the opinion of a playboy scientist?
And for what?
I want to know, Doctor, and you're going to tell me.
You want to know what it's all about?
All right. I'll tell you.
That's what it's all about.
You understand?
- Of course you don't. Stupid...
- Why you...
Stop it! Stop it!
I thought you boys were here to fight the Nazis.
Why don't you both send in reports and let London decide?
- All right.
- Fine.
See, Anna?
Knut and I fight, but we still manage to live with each other.
I know you fellows are anxious to get back to Norway.
Knut Straud and Rolf Pedersen are on the mountains of
Telemark waiting for you.
The main assault group, the Royal Engineers Commando, will come in two or three days, weather permitting.
We are counting on you to get a glider landing strip on the lake ready for them.
Well, happy landings.
Best of luck.
For God's sake, where have you been?
We've been looking for you halfway around the Arctic Circle.
What are you talking about?
We've been waiting for your message for the past five weeks and it hasn't come.
I'm starving.
We're expecting more company tomorrow.
Yeah, 50 British commandos.
From the Royal Engineers, they land tomorrow night.
I've got a message for you from Sigrid.
You're going to have a baby in the spring.
Well, how is she?
She's pregnant.
Rolf!
Who are you?
My name is Jensen.
- What do you want?
- I'm on a hunting trip.
Hunting for what?
You'd better come with us.
I won't say a word.
Ever. On my honor.
Look, my village is Haukeland.
Anyone there will tell you who I am.
Listen, I hate the Nazis, believe me.
My wife is in a Gestapo prison.
Listen. Listen, her father's name is Jon Trendt.
- That's why she's in prison.
- Trendt?
The resistance leader?
Yes.
It fits.
Shoot him.
No, we'll keep him.
We can't risk the whole organization because of one man.
- I'm with Knut.
- And me.
I think Rolf is right.
So do I.
We'll have a show of hands.
Those against shooting him?
We'll have your skis.
Take them off.
Listen.
I still can't believe it.
They weren't even Norwegian.
50 British commandos.
In a flash, the whole operation's over.
A waste.
That's what I can't get out of my head.
They're not going to be wasted.
We're going ahead, tonight, now.
As if they were with us.
It's the same plan.
We all know it.
What are you talking about?
We're going to get into that factory and complete the mission ourselves.
Knut, I'm sorry, but you're mad!
- There's only nine of us left.
- We'd better wait.
We can't wait. It'll be months before they can mount an assault of the same scale.
- But, Knut, if we...
- It's our only chance.
If we win, those men won't have died for nothing tonight.
There were 50 of them and only nine of us.
- You won't even be nine.
- What do you mean?
I'm sorry, but I'm not going on such an impossible mission.
Oh, yes, you are, Rolf.
You're coming with us.
You're the only one who knows exactly where that dynamite must be placed.
Look, Knut, after what happened tonight, that factory's going to be jumping with guards.
- He's right.
- Now, listen.
Now, listen to me.
They have completely wiped out our entire assault force.
Right?
Now they'll be feeling completely safe.
You don't have a chance in the world.
Look, 50 men died tonight.
They came here to help us.
They weren't even Norwegian.
Now, who's coming with me tonight?
It's 11:50.
This is a military operation launched by the British.
We'll have British uniforms so the Germans won't shoot
Norwegian hostages afterwards.
The attack will take place at 3:15.
Arne, you and Henrik will be our cover party.
You'll move forward and cut a hole in the fence.
The actual demolition party will consist of...
The demolition party will consist of Knut, Oli and myself.
Jensen, inside.
Hello? Hello?
Be careful with those wires.
You'll blow the whole place up.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
My glasses! My glasses!
I lost my glasses!
They're on top of your head.
Come on! Come on!
Well, gentlemen, your next mission is to find out how neutral Sweden is.
Especially the girls.
Where's Arne?
Down in the gorge.
Let's get going.
The Vidda'll be swarming with Germans in half an hour.
Excellent.
Excellent work, is it not, my dear Nilssen?
An extraordinaryjob, one might say, of sabotage.
Oh, naturally you had no knowledge of this.
Destruction. Sabotage. Waste.
All of this is against your thrifty, scientific nature, is it not, Nilssen?
In that case, answer me this.
How long will it take before production gets back into high gear again?
A year, at least.
First, new containers have to be built, a new store of heavy water accumulated, before production flows at full speed.
A year, he says.
What do you think we
Germans have been doing?
Sleeping?
What do you think your two friends from the Berlin Institute have been doing since they went home?
Playing golf?
Oh, the British fancy themselves very much after what they've done here.
Winston Churchill is puffing an extra-big cigar today.
And we laugh at him.
Why?
Because all these containers, which the British did so much to destroy, have already been pre-fabricated in Berlin.
They are already on their way here and will be installed by tomorrow.
That is, I must say, that is fantastic efficiency.
Don't you ever make the mistake of underrating the Germans, my dear Nilssen.
By Easter, we will have not merely 10,000 pounds of heavy water, but 12,000 pounds of heavy water.
Because from now on, no one leaves this building, not you or anybody, unless it's to go to
Grini concentration camp, where all suspect employees are being sent.
But I absolutely protest against this.
Protest as much as you wish.
But get used to the idea.
You built this place.
Well, you will now work in it, eat in it and sleep in it until our victory.
Heil Hitler.
Major Frick, this is one of the most disastrous security breakdowns of the entire war, and you are responsible for it.
I leave you in charge of the only factory in Europe making heavy water, and a dozen men in British uniforms calmly walk in and blow it up right in front of your eyes.
So, get up into those mountains and get back every one of those men.
Dead or alive.
And if it turns out they're Norwegians,
I want 100 hostages rounded up and shot.
I don't want even a rat left alive up there.
Go on, get out!
You say you can take us to them?
You'd better be telling the truth.
You keep your part of the bargain,
I'll keep mine.
You were right.
We should have shot that Quisling bastard.
Forget it.
Knut, go down that side.
Why?
Why?
My wife.
Your wife.
What the hell do you mean, your wife?
I made a bargain with the Nazis.
Who are you?
I was helping track down the saboteurs.
I got hurt in the foot.
Then you'd better come with us.
Saboteurs going to
Grini concentration camp.
I think I'd better go see my doctor.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, wait a minute.
We have a doctor right here now.
Come and see him.
I think I'd rather see my own, if it's all the same to you.
Oh, nonsense!
Our doctor will look after you for nothing.
Why pay a civilian?
Who is this fellow?
One of the men helping our patrols.
- If he's helping us, we must help him.
- Thank you.
That's only fair, isn't it?
Nasty. We'd better have that seen to.
I think we've got another passenger for your bus.
Doctor?
Do you remember me?
No, I don't.
We met at the university, Dr. Pedersen.
Afraid you're mistaken, ma'am.
You know this man?
No. I thought I did, but I don't. No.
You know him.
What did you say his name was?
No, please, I don't know him.
His papers say his name is Kristansen.
What was it you said his name was?
His name!
My name is Dr. Rolf Pedersen,
University of Oslo, as Gestapo headquarters no doubt will be delighted to confirm.
Doctor.
I'm so sorry.
Pederson.
Pedersen, not Pederson.
I'm very proud of my name.
Here, let me help you.
Here, oh, here it is.
Pedersen, Rolf.
Doctor of physics, believed escaped to England. England!
Well, even the Gestapo can be wrong sometimes.
How long will it be, Doctor?
I've got to leave here.
Do you hear me, Doctor?
I can't stay here long.
I don't know who you are, and I don't want to know.
But if you leave here, you'll be arrested.
And so will I and my staff.
You will, therefore, please stay here until I make the arrangements.
Anna, I told you
I don't want you using that transmitter set.
I'm trying to contact London.
They must know where Rolf is.
I can't risk it.
Why don't you go out and try to find him, then?
Because I'm not a member of the Missing Persons Bureau.
I can't jeopardize the whole operation.
I'm a bad ex-wife, Knut.
Why, because you love him?
Yes.
You haven't much use for that, have you?
Not in this sort of war.
It softens you up.
But sex, now that's something different.
It seems Rolf makes the same distinction.
But you don't, do you, Anna?
I'll get some wood.
They're in this area somewhere.
Leave that alone!
It's not for anyone, do you understand?
That transmitter remains silent until I give the order.
Now, you see, Anna, that's what I was talking about.
Morning.
Hello, Doctor.
A friend of yours is here.
Room 7, down the corridor.
Sigrid!
Hello, Dr. Pedersen.
I thought you were locked up in the factory.
We are, unless we're very ill or having a baby.
There's something that
I've got to tell you...
Nilssen found out you were here.
Listen to me.
- I've got to tell you about Arne.
- I know.
The Germans have installed new containers, so heavy water production is at full level again.
Sigrid.
When can you deliver the message?
Right now.
We've got to contact London.
Why? What's the matter?
The Nazis have completely restored heavy water production.
What?
Instead of two years, it's taken them two weeks.
We're right back where we started.
Then we'll have to bomb.
I'm afraid we'll have to take his appendix out.
In that case, one of our security officers must remain with him, day and night, until he leaves.
Then I shan't be lonely.
By the way, Doctor, how are Sigrid and her baby coming along?
Oh, excellent.
As a matter of fact, she's bringing him here this afternoon for a checkup.
I'd love to see her.
No one is allowed to communicate with Nilssen, Doctor.
"67 civilians killed.
"Factory virtually untouched.
"The Nazis..."
Well, the Third Reich is going to last for a thousand years.
Well, let's all go down into Rjukan, have a good Nazi dinner
- and see a nice Nazi film.
- Rolf.
Let's start getting used to it.
"The Nazis are shipping their entire stock
"of heavy water to Germany
"by rail and ferry
"under the guard of
1,000 picked troops.
"The railway tank cars
"will leave the factory
Saturday evening,
"be placed on the Hydro ferry
"Sunday morning."
And Nilssen had to lose a perfectly good appendix to deliver that message.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Maybe now, at the very moment we've all dreaded, when they take the stuff to Germany, by ferry, this is where we finally get them.
But, Rolf, 1,000 picked troops.
But there's one place you can't use 1,000 picked troops.
Knut, do you want to do a little dying with me?
I've just thought up a nice way to go.
It left at 9:00.
Yes, and it's got to be the deepest point, at least 300, 400 meters.
Now.
You know what we're talking about?
Yes, we're talking about murder.
Why two clocks?
If one doesn't go off, the other will.
It'll sink the ferry in less than a minute.
It has to be done, Anna.
It's all been calculated, hasn't it, Rolf?
Nothing left to chance.
Not even the hope that one of the children on that boat isn't going to drown.
Now, look, Anna, try and get it into your head, what counts is not who is going to die on the ferry, but how many millions will be saved if the ferry's sunk.
A nice equation, Rolf.
Put it on the blackboard and sign it.
It's not a nice equation.
And I didn't invent it. It exists.
So do people, Rolf.
People exist, too.
What the hell are we doing here if it isn't for people?
You don't do things for people, Rolf.
You never have.
Look, Anna, this work is tough enough even without you.
One day, after the war, a woman is going to come and ask why her child had to be drowned.
I won't know the answer.
It's as simple as this, we have no choice.
What are you going to say to that woman, Rolf?
We'll radio the Norwegian government in London, tell them the plan, all its risks, the Prime Minister, the King, the whole lot.
Then, if they approve, at least we've shared the responsibility.
It works.
Let's contact London.
Number one truck reports a contact on 2-4-7 degrees.
Contact 73 degrees.
West, southwest.
Not more than six kilometers from here.
All right. Heini!
Shut that door, will you?
That's better.
I'm glad you think so.
Stand up!
If we're not back in two hours, don't wait for us.
If you hear any shots, leave immediately.
How many do you want?
Come on.
There's nine minutes left.
You'd better go on to the boathouse with Knut.
Where are you going?
I've got to see that the ferry leaves on time.
Then I'll cut across the point and join you.
Be careful.
I will.
The explosion time is 9:45.
We won't make a move until then.
- Tickets.
- I'll have to pay.
Tickets.
Sigrid. There you are.
Hello, Doctor. What a nice surprise.
I want you to understand...
I don't think you've met little Arne.
There we are. There we are.
Sigrid, listen to me.
Sigrid. So, you've met a friend, eh?
Yes. Oh, this is Mr. Sandersen and his wife and their little boy.
Sigrid, I've got to talk to you at once.
Why don't you come and join us over here?
- Alone.
- I can't.
- We've brought some sandwiches.
- Would you excuse us, please?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sandersen.
What on earth's the matter?
Sigrid, I want you to start a children's game at the back of the boat.
- Game?
- Now, as far back as you can.
What sort of game?
Well, let's call it life jackets.
Everybody puts one on when I say go.
The winner gets a bar of chocolate.
Now what...
Hello, there.
Excuse me.
Doctor, if you're in some kind of trouble...
Sigrid, do as I tell you.
There's not much time.
Let's organize the children now.
Come on, children.
Where is Rolf?
It's only a couple of minutes.
If he doesn't come in time, we'll have to go out and do what we can without him.
I don't want to play.
Oh, sure you do, you want to play, sure you do.
Don't forget, the winner gets a bar of chocolate.
Now, you ready?
Oh, your doll's cold.
Ready. Set. Go.
Sigrid's onboard the ship. And Rolf.
Rolf's there, as well.
But I don't want to play.
Look, you're gonna play if it's the last thing you ever do.
Get it.
I've won! I've won!
Mummy! Mummy!
Mummy!
- You got orders?
- Yeah.
Check in. Stay off the streets.
There's no liberty.
Right.
- Where's Mitch?
- He died a couple of months ago.
- What happened?
- Just didn't wake up one morning.
I was a shipmate of his. Name's Baxter.
Ex-chief signalman. I took over.
- Everything?
- Yeah, everything.
Gimme a UB of whiskey.
- He was all right, though.
- They start liberty again?
Nah. Transferrin' to a new ship.
The San Pablo.
You can have my part of that.
Them gunboats are nothin'.
- Well, they got engines, ain't they?
- Sure.
Well, then they ain't nothin'.
- You likee me?
- Oh, much like all the sailor man!
Uniform gets 'em every time.
We can't threaten them into being our friends.
- Exactly.
- Then what's the point?
Now, you can hate the gunboats and what they represent, Jameson, but you missionaries are only tolerated because we have them.
- I question that.
- The Chinese'd run you out, otherwise.
They hate you and despise you.
Dare you know that?
I dare love them in return, and I dare trust God rather than guns.
Yes, but when there are anti-foreign riots, how often have you fled to the gunboat for protection?
To my shame, twice. But never again.
My name is Hamilton.
- Holman.
- How do you do? This is Miss Eckert.
And Mr Jameson. As you may have gathered,
Mr Jameson is a missionary. Miss Eckert, too.
- And this is Mr Outscout.
- How do you do?
British.
- Where are you headed?
- Uh, San Pablo. Gunboat.
Well, if I were you,
I'd jump overboard while I still had time.
- Do you know anything about her?
- Uh-uh.
American gunboats in central China are a painful local joke, Mr Holman.
- And the most painful is the San Pablo.
- Oh, yeah?
I think she's something you chaps inherited from Spain after the Spanish-American War.
Well, I missed that one.
They don't let her on the Yangtze proper.
They keep her up in some small river.
You must know her.
She operates near Changsha.
- Yes. We know her.
- Mr Jameson dislikes gunboats.
Whatever flag they fly.
English, French, American...
Symbols of what the great powers did to this nation.
Nation? Don't be ridiculous.
It's a patchwork quilt of bandits, warlords, mobs, rape, loot and chaos.
China will be unable to put her own house in order until she is free of your enslaving, unequal treaties.
Foreigners collecting her taxes, placed in charge of her Customs, postal system...
Foreigners enjoying immunity from her laws.
Would we tolerate a Frenchman who had committed a crime in America not to be tried in our courts?
You know Chinese justice.
Confessions by torture, corruption...
Have you seen the executioner of the warlords walk through the streets? "Oh, you."
"Ah. You!"
Well, do you think that's funny?
Well, you do it kinda funny.
Yes, those things happen.
But they're trying.
Responsible Chinese leaders are trying to put their house in order.
- From the south, the Nationalist Party...
- Mobs, that's all I see. Mobs that threaten us.
Confusing, isn't it? And painful.
I bequeath China and her agonies to you youngsters, with pity, and with the hope that perhaps
you can understand what's going on, can comprehend what so many people are going to have to die for.
The good, the bad... the innocent.
- Excuse me, sir, but you're talking rot.
- Conceivably.
A firm hand, that's what's needed.
That's what you're doing here.
Hey. Listen, I run the engine.
All this other is just "looksee-pidgin".
- I beg your pardon?
- To make a show. Something for the officers.
I don't fool with it.
Oh, don't stop.
I can't do no more.
Just butterflies and rabbits.
Is this your first trip upriver?
Yeah.
Did you understand what they were talking about last night?
- Politics.
- I'd like to know more.
I'm not a missionary, I'm a teacher. And if I'm going to teach, I ought to know more.
You gonna try to teach the slopeheads?
Yeah.
I taught back home in high school.
Vermont.
- Where's your home?
- Well, I was born in Grover, Utah.
But my home's whatever ship I'm on.
You're an engineer, huh?
I'd have thought the engine on a large ship is more interesting than the one on a gunboat.
Too many guys tryin' to tell you how to run it.
Ah.
See, on a small ship you haven't got any of that military crap.
They, uh... They leave you alone.
I had a brother in the navy during the war.
He was a lieutenant in the reserve.
Uh-huh?
- How long have you been in the navy?
- Nine years.
- And out here?
- Seven.
See, most China sailors, they don't go back.
They pull their 20, 30 years and shack up with a Chinese girl, open up a bar.
I see.
I mean, I keep asking myself the same question about what I'm doing here.
I'm kinda frightened.
It may be romantic, but I wanted to be swept up by something.
One night, Mr Jameson showed coloured slides in the basement of the church.
Slides of his mission, China Light.
- How long you sign up for?
- Seven years.
Well, those slopeheads could use some teaching.
I hope you're good at it. Long as you're good at something, they can't bust you down.
Like me, you know, with the engine.
The Reverend'll probably tell you that nice
American girls don't talk to China sailors.
It's not your brother's navy.
I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you.
No.
Goodbye.
I can't help feeling a sort of sadness about his life.
Yes, it would be sad - if he wanted something else.
They don't. They reduce life to a very simple point, or no point at all.
As long as they obey orders, the navy takes care of them.
The way of life appeals to a certain kind of man.
Go.
- Hello. I takee.
- I got it.
- I takee all gear sailor man.
- OK! Takee.
- OK.
- Takee!
- That guy sure likes to carry things.
- Ah, it's his rice bowl.
You must be Holman, huh?
We was wondering when you'd get here.
Well, Shanghai slowed me up a little bit.
Had a hell of a time tryin' to find you.
Oh, we only come down to civilisation every couple of years for overhaul.
Welcome aboard the Sand Pebble.
That's what we call her. We're Sand Pebbles.
- Frenchy Burgoyne.
- Yeah. Hey, you got an engineerin' officer?
No, just the skipper and the exec.
You'll be the senior engineering rate.
- Yeah?
- Wong will show you your bunk.
I wanna look at the engine first.
All thing proper. You makee looksee, master.
Any side proper. All OK.
Hello, engine.
I'm Jake Holman.
Coffee, sailor man?
Ah. Good boy, Wong.
Through with the butter?
Welcome aboard. My name's Bronson.
- Hiya.
- Hey, what's your name, buddy?
- Holman.
- Stawski. Machinist's mate.
- That's Farren. Bosun's mate, second class.
- Howdy.
- The redhead is Shanahan, ship's writer.
- Yeah, that's me. Red Dog.
- Red Dog "bite 'em in the butt" Shanahan.
- Red Dog, cut it out!
- Jennings, pharmacist's mate.
- Hey, Holman.
When you meet those pigs at the Red Candle at Changsha, the doc's a man's best friend.
Right, Crosley?
Say, Holman, what was your last ship?
Flagship. Asiatic fleet.
- Harris, electrician. Navy's foulest mouth.
- So don't get me started.
- What do you want for breakfast? Tell Wong.
- Eggs.
- Sure. How many?
- Half a dozen?
- You got 'em. Over easy, or what?
- Yeah, over easy.
- Ham?
- Yeah.
- OK, Wong?
- OK.
The old Sand Pebble ain't much to look at, but she's sure as hell a home and a feeder.
- Yeah, she sure is, Frenchy.
- Tell him all about it.
Hey, Holman.
Clip-Clip here does all the shaving.
I like to do my own shavin'.
It's his rice bowl.
Don't wanna break nobody's rice bowl.
OK.
- Attaboy, Clip-Clip.
- Great breakfast this morning, huh?
Let's go! Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Move it, move it. Come on!
Fall in at attention. Let's go. Hup!
Come on, come on, come on, come on! On the double!
Let's go! Fall in at attention.
Dress right!
Front! Answer to muster!
- Holman! Burgoyne!
- Banks!
- Perna! Shanahan!
- Ho!
- Colgate! Troys!
- Here!
- Crosley!
- MacDonald!
- Haythorn!
- Here!
- Report!
- Deck and gunnery divisions all present, sir.
Engineering and navigation all present or accounted for, sir.
- Ship's company all accounted for, sir.
- Very well.
- Posts!
- The clock reads eight, Captain.
Make it so.
Ten hut!
- Dismiss the ship's company.
- Aye aye, sir.
All right, Chief, dismiss the men.
- Fall out and turn to.
- Fall out.
Holman. Welcome aboard. I'm Wellbeck, your mustering Chief Petty Officer.
Did you look at the new man's records,
Mr Bordelles? What did you think?
Well, he seems to be a first-rate engineer, sir.
- You take a good look at his service record?
- Yes, sir. Nothing but 4.0 marks.
In everything except leadership.
And he's had seven transfers in nine years.
It's almost time for battle drill, sir.
What shall we run this morning?
- Repel boarders starboard.
- Yes, sir.
All hands, repel boarders starboard!
- Repel boarders!
- On the double, Holman.
You help man the hose in the waist party.
I'm Chief Franks.
OK, grab this.
Waist party manned and ready, sir.
Stand back, you slope-headed slobs!
Stand back, you slobs! Stand back!
Go! Go!
Stand by on that hose!
All right. Cut her in down there.
- Secure from drill!
- Secure from drill!
Secure from drill!
- You do this a lot?
- Every day except Sunday.
Well, what do you do Sundays?
Turn a machine gun on 'em?
Come on.
Master!
All of you. Go back to work. Go back to work.
Continue. Continue.
- You, uh...
- Po-han, master.
I wanna looksee the bilge side.
Take up the floor plate. Savvy?
- Me savvy.
- Bilge pidgin no can do.
Today must washee port side.
- Who the hell are you?
- Chien. Boss coolie. No can do bilge pidgin.
Yeah? I do bilge pidgin. Looksee pipes.
Learn pidgin all pipes. Savvy?
This ain't the Chinese Navy. Take it up.
Master! Master!
Hey, shut it off! Shut it off!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! What the hell is wrong?
- That boss coolie's gonna get his head bent.
- What?
- He blew the glass on me in the bilges.
- Oh, take it easy.
We always blow the glass when the watch changes.
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.
He probably didn't even know you was there.
He knew.
We don't never go in the bilges. And if you want Chien's respect, stay out of 'em.
- I don't care if that slopehead respects me.
- Well, you better!
- We couldn't get along without him.
- Well, by God, I can get along without him.
- Who works for who around here?
- Oh, it's a system they got.
If you want a bilge coolie, go through Chien.
For a deck coolie, go through Pappy Tung.
The boss of all the coolies is Lop-eye Shing.
He's kind of captain.
- Like Collins is with the crew.
- Yeah?
- How the hell did they get this thing started?
- Oh, a long time ago, before I shipped on.
The sampans'd gang around the slop chutes, and the Chinese'd fight for the garbage.
Well, that was no way, so finally the cook gave one sampan the contract. Hey, come on.
Relax, huh?
Soon, they wasn't only collectin' it, they was scrapin' and washin' dishes.
In a week, every mess cook had a Chinese helper to do all the work.
Next thing, they were sleeping in the galley passageways.
Then they was with the ship for good, in all the departments.
- Course, it ain't official.
- Hey, how do they get paid?
Oh, squeeze. Little here, little there.
Uncle Sam don't miss it. You got a minute?
- Yeah.
- Come on. I'll show you.
They live in the old crew's quarters.
We never come in here.
The Captain don't even inspect it.
Oh, come on.
He's lost enough face for one day.
If you wanna hit one of them, kick him.
Never touch him with your hand.
Don't get buddies with a coolie.
That's trouble.
- And they do all the work?
- Sure.
That leaves us free for standing topside watches and our primary duty.
Black gangs ain't supposed to stand topside watches.
- On this ship, everybody.
- What is our primary duty?
- Fightin'.
- Who do we fight?
Nobody. Probably never will. But, like the skipper said, we're always ready.
Look, Jake, we got it good here, huh?
I didn't come all the way from the fleet to have it good. I'm an engineer.
Look, I told you. Let Chien handle the engine.
He'll keep it in shape. He knows it inside out.
Relax, huh?
Today we begin cruising to show the flag on
Tungting Lake and the Hunan Rivers.
I want all honours rendered smartly.
At home in America, when today reaches them, it'll be Flag Day.
For us who wear the uniform, every day is Flag Day.
It is said there will be no more wars.
We must pretend to believe that.
But when war comes, it is we who will take the first shock, and buy time with our lives.
It is we who keep the faith.
We serve the flag.
The trade we all follow is the give-and-take of death.
It is for that purpose that the people of America maintain us.
Any one of us who believes he has ajob like any other, for which he draws a money wage, is a thief of the food he eats, and a trespasser in the bunk in which he lies down to sleep.
Mr Bordelles, make preparations for getting underway.
- When was the last time it was overhauled?
- About a month ago.
Captain?
- Yes, Holman?
- Got a burnt bearing, sir.
It could tear up the crankshaft.
I'd like to shut down and repair it.
Holman, as long as we move and smoke boils out of our stack, we'll make the impression
I want to make on the Chinese.
Yes, sir. It's still gonna give us trouble, sir.
It never has.
Yes, sir.
Here's a message, sir.
- Full speed ahead.
- Full speed ahead.
Full speed ahead.
Tell the Captain she won't take no more turns.
Oil the cups! Oil the cups! Oil the cups!
Oil the cup. Oil. More oil.
- Holman, why aren't we up to full speed?
- She won't take no more turns, sir.
We're under orders to reach Changsha on the double.
She ain't gonna make it.
We've never had to stop before.
Well, I'm just telling you.
That's right.
Tell the Captain we must stop and secure.
As soon as we get the LP at the top, we'll lock in the jacking gear. That'll hold it.
- A lot of slack in that damn thing, Jake.
- There sure as hell is.
OK. Lock it in.
Two men. You and you.
Jacking gear in.
Into the pit. I order you.
- I won't go.
- You are boss. You do it.
- You want to be fired?
- Do it yourself.
Gimme the wrench.
My takee wrench. My takee wrench.
OK, Chien.
Hammer.
- Watch it!
- The damn jacking gear gave way!
- Get Jennings down here!
- Aye aye, sir!
Floor plate down. If you try and pull him out through there you'll tear him to pieces.
Frenchy...
- The drain valves open?
- Yeah.
And Frenchy?
Don't let no steam build up, huh?
All right. Come on. Out, out.
Come on.
Easy, easy.
Hey, Jennings, grab his hands.
Easy. Easy now.
OK.
- Slow engine.
- Slow engine.
Stand by all lines.
Get cleaned up.
The Captain's waiting for you.
A man has been killed on this ship for the first time. I want to know why.
- A key in the jacking gearjarred out, sir.
- Why?
- Vibration.
- And why the vibration?
Because of the bearing knock, sir. I guess one key has been missin' for a long time.
And the other one's just being held in by rust.
Can you fix any personal responsibility for this?
- For the jacking gear, sir?
- For the accident, Holman.
Without the knock in the LP, there'd be no vibration.
Chien handled the overhaul.
He should have fixed it, sir.
Are you saying that Chien killed himself?
I'll remind you he worked under supervision.
Can't supervise an overhaul and stand deck watches at the same time, sir.
Black gang should stand their watches in the engine room, sir.
Lop-eye Shing says that you killed Chien.
You threw the engine in some mysterious way.
Now, that may be superstition,
Holman, but it's very real to them.
Your resentment of Chien was well known.
The system you got on this ship is what killed him, sir.
You will immediately train a new coolie to take Chien's place. Give it your full time.
- They ain't got the brains.
- They operate efficiently enough.
It's monkey see, monkey do. They don't know what happens with the engine.
- It's not necessary they should.
- Let me run the engine room like I should.
- I can give you 12 knots, no breakdowns...
- Holman.
I'm the one here who decides what jobs'll be done by whom.
The crew of this ship is designed just like the machinery that powers the ship.
Captains before me designed the San Pablo for a special job in the backwaters of China.
But men will not hold together like brass and steel.
We have to refit ourselves into the design every day.
That's the purpose of all we do in San Pablo.
As part of that design, you cannot do what you prefer to do, however well you do it.
You will train a new coolie and then return to your military duties.
That's all, Holman.
- Hey, come on. Over here.
- Hey, Red Dog! Bring our whiskey back!
- You no wantee whiskey?
- Oh, no, honey.
Not on an empty stomach, I'll tell you.
Hey, Jake.
Jake!
- How'd you make out with the Captain?
- One piece whiskey.
- We ain't waltzin' no more.
- What happened?
Collins says that us Sand Pebbles is like machinery, only different.
Huh?
We gotta keep changing, cos we ain't made out of brass. Think that one over.
Didn't he say nothing about Chien?
Yeah. I gotta train a new coolie.
- What?
- Yeah, one of them slopeheads.
I can't do it, Frenchy.
They think that engine's got ghosts in it.
- Sailor man?
- I'm broke.
Hey! Mama Chunk.
- Where's the new stuff?
- You all the time same Sand Pebble sailor.
What's the matter? No likee all the same girl?
What's the matter with her?
Hey! Frenchy!
- Hi, Mama.
- What's the matter, no takee girl topside?
- Ah, give me time.
- Oh, I think you too old a man.
Too old, huh? Too old, huh?
Wait. You new sailor! What you name?
- Holman.
- Homang. Homang.
- Yeah. Homang.
- Oh. Have got one piece new girl topside.
Brand new. She just now makee pretty.
I suppose bye-bye she come see you?
- Well, I...
- Send her over, Mama.
- Oh, oh, nice Frenchy.
- Hey, Ski!
Your eyes are bigger than your...
Hey. Oh, OK.
Right over here, lovey duck. Best table in the house. Right here. Sit over here.
Clear out, you slobs. Back to your pigs.
My name is Ski.
Ski. Savvy?
What name you?
My name is Maily.
Say that again.
- My name is Maily.
- Did you hear that? A Vassar girl.
- Well, hello, Maily.
- Ski, I am your buddy.
- Shove off, Restorff.
- Hey, Ski. Pal? Come on.
I'm sure you have your own joy junks to go to.
Come on, why don't you vamoose?
Come on, you guys, beat it.
Maily, what'll you have to drink?
I should warn you,
I get a commission on what I drink.
All I drink is cold tea, but you'll have to pay for whiskey.
Oh. I see. Yeah, sure.
Boy! Catch two piece whiskey.
Relax. Relax, Maily.
- I keep books for Mr Shu.
- Oh.
And act as hostess.
I'm very pleased to meet all of you.
Yeah.
Where'd you learn to talk English like that?
My secret.
Uh-huh.
- Where do you come from?
- New Jersey.
- Oh, yes. Trenton.
- Yeah, Trenton's in New Jersey.
- Where Washington crossed the Delaware.
- Yeah. That was a little before my time.
As hostess, I'm supposed to divide my time among all the tables.
It's been pleasant meeting all of you, but I must go now.
Oh, no, no. Not till we take a little trip across the Delaware.
I don't go upstairs. I'm only a hostess.
- Ski, she don't love you.
- Hey, Ski, go and get some air.
Mr Ski, please. Please don't!
- Ski, let her alone!
- You go to hell.
Please.
Hold it, Frenchy. In case you didn't know, this girl's got duties, just like sailors.
- Oh, please.
- Oh, let her go.
Now, Frenchy, stand fast! That's an order.
You know better than to mess around with another man's girl till he's through with her.
What's the matter? Wait. What's the matter?
You want to go topside her? Pay money.
- Money!
- Money, money. OK.
- Come on. Topside.
- Wait.
This girl first time.
Must pay 200 dollar.
- I'll give you ten dollars Mexican. Come on.
- 200 dollar!
- You think I'm an admiral?
- That be first-time price.
- Who say so?
- Victor Shu.
- Nobody's ever gonna have that much.
- I'll be damned.
- I'm still drinkin' with her.
- No. She go other table now.
You can't change the house rules just like that.
- As long as I pay for her drinks, I keep her.
- What's the matter? You crazy?
Come on, on the side.
Come on. Come on. All right, break it up.
All right, break it up. Go back to your pigs.
Wait. Wait. You like talk to pretty girl?
Yeah, sure, Mama.
- Why don't you grab a table?
- Yeah.
Come on. Let's sit down.
- What's your name?
- Frenchy.
- And yours?
- Jake Holman.
- Mine is Maily.
- How do you do?
Ooh!
- Thank you very much for helping me.
- Oh, it was nothing.
- Where are you from, Mr Holman?
- Utah.
- Oh, Salt Lake City.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm from Philadelphia.
- Yes, Liberty Bell.
- Uh-huh.
- Is Utah nice?
Oh, for some people.
Well, I guess I'd better get back to ship.
- Huh?
- Yeah. Thanks, buddy.
- So long.
- There's a guy who knows when to leave.
Where'd you learn to speak English this good, Maily?
My secret.
Oh.
Why $200?
Is there something special about $200?
Yeah, I know. Your secret, huh?
Well, what happens when Shu gets his $200?
I go to Hankow, to Shanghai.
I am free!
I wish I had $200.
Oh, I mean... I mean, just to give you.
You would do that?
Yeah, sure.
Look... I'll get it.
Time's up. Next table.
You gotta work fast here, boy.
My name's Farren. I don't come from nowhere and I don't wanna talk geography.
- Anybody wanna shoot a little crap?
- You won't get 200 bucks from me, lover boy.
Next week, Frenchy. Next week.
Hey. Come here.
You, uh... you likee be boss?
All same, like Chien?
Like same who?
Chien. Number one engine coolie.
Him all die.
Yeah, him all die. And that's too bad.
But I wantee new boss, savvy?
Teachee all pidgin.
Oh. Engine side not proper?
No, no, the engine's OK.
I'll teach you how to run it right. Come here.
Now, the valve.
Huh?
Belong same.
- Valve.
- Wowel.
Valve.
Wowel.
- Wowel.
- Yeah?
OK. Wowel.
Now, main steam stop valve.
May stim stop wowel.
Where?
You find.
No, no.
No, not proper wowel.
May stim stop wowel.
- May stim stop wowel?
- Yeah.
- May stim stop wowel?
- Main steam stop valve.
But I don't know.
You, me, can do.
Jake.
OK.
OK. If you go that way, then we're going reverse. OK?
Huh?
The generator. Makes juice for the lights.
See?
OK.
This is the boiler.
Inside belongs live steam. Savvy?
Strong steam.
- Stim.
- Steam.
Stim.
Live stim goes through this pipe.
Live stim goes into the feed pump.
Live stim! Make pump go vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom...
Live stim, huh?
Live stim... Live stim... Live stim.
Exhaust stim.
Condenser. Makee steam all dead.
You know, sleepy stim.
Live stim, dead stim.
Before, live stim.
Now water. Water belong dead stim.
All same dead stim.
Stim dead. Stim dead!
That's right. That's it.
Now you got it! That's right!
That's the way it works!
And that's the throttle.
I'll teach you about that throttle one day.
Go ahead. Grab ahold of it.
Boo!
Nah. There ain't no ghosts in that engine.
Hey!
- Who's your new throttle man, Homang?
- Out.
Ask the new throttle man if you can have some coffee. Maybe he'll let you use his cup.
Yeah. Why, you slant-eyed bastard...
Holman, you'd better watch out.
Lettin' that slopehead drink coffee down here, touch the throttle...
You watch out, Holman.
Slopehead!
Pick up your coffee cup.
Looks like you ain't runnin' this ship after all, Lop-eye.
Sir, is it wise overruling Lop-eye about the coolie?
That's not what I've done.
The crew wants Po-han off the ship.
They believe Stawski about what happened in the engine room.
- You believe Holman, sir?
- Not necessarily, but he makes more sense.
But Lop-eye fired Po-han. He'll lose face if Holman makes the crew change their mind.
Unlikely as that is, it might serve a purpose.
Lop-eye has a tendency to forget his place from time to time.
That's right. That's what happened, Holman.
The slopehead hit me and you jumped me before I had a chance to kill him.
- Right, Perna?
- Just like that.
You're lucky I busted it up when I did.
If he'd have hit ya, he woulda killed ya.
The slopehead woulda killed me?
You never... You ever see a slopehead fight?
- You guys saw a slopehead fight.
- Yeah.
Holman, you're crazy.
He woulda killed the Chink.
- He woulda put out your lights.
- Who says so?
- I got 50 bucks that says so.
- I'll take it.
- You got any more?
- I'll take some of that.
Now, wait a minute. Hold it, hold it.
Hold it! Hold it! Just one minute! Hold it!
Who's gonna do the fightin' here? Now,
I don't go for it unless you bet me $100.
- You holdin' $100?
- Yeah, I'm holdin' $100.
And I need $200 to buy myself a very special present.
$100 says he'll take you.
Oh, Maily! Maily, here I come!
Hey, hold it.
Beside the money, if Po-han wins, he stays aboard. That's my deal.
- Sure.
- Well, he's not gonna win anyway.
- Bets right here.
- You said $50, huh?
Hey. You got any more, Homang?
- Yeah, I got an extra $50.
- Holman?
- I'll bet you $10 the slopehead don't fight.
- He'll fight.
Put me down for $10.
Hey, Chief. When are we gonna start?
- Frenchy, you mustn't worry.
- How the hell can you say...
- Excuse me.
- If Ski gets me, then he's supposed to.
- That big ape.
- It will only mean that I'm being punished.
- For what?
- My secret.
Now look. You quit that "my secret" stuff.
- Who'd wanna punish you?
- God.
- Who?
- God!
What'd you do to him?
I...
I stole some money from American missionaries.
They found me as a baby and brought me up.
Why did you steal it?
To get away.
They wanted me to be a missionary too.
I meant to go to Shanghai and earn enough money to send it back to them.
But I couldn't get there. So I came to
Changsha instead and Mr Shu advanced it.
And now he must be paid. And so must God.
You're bughouse, Maily.
What kind of religion do they teach you?
- Don't you worry about it.
- The Chinaman can't fight.
Get me some beer.
Yeah, he's big. But he's blubber.
How can you fight and drink beer?
Ah!
Po-han. Get him in the throat, in the kidneys, in the gut. Hurt him.
Too much cold this side. Suppose cold this side, any man no can fight.
Oh, you plenty time fight Chinese man.
How you no fashion fight Stawski?
- Ski no same.
- Come on, boy!
Listen to me. He's gonna try to hurt you.
Forget what colour he is.
You want you come back ship, you fight.
Fight!
- Give me a bell.
- Let's get out here.
- Come on out here.
- Let's go.
- How you doin'?
- Come on! Come on, get out here.
- Ski, you look great.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Now look. No kickee, no scratchee.
None of that stuff, you savvy?
- Me savvy.
- Me no savvy.
You!
Go on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Give me a bell.
OK. Let's go.
Get him, get him. Come on!
Boo!
Come on. Hit me. Come on, come on. Hit me.
What's the matter?
Your man all same not fight? Huh?
Give you even money Ski don't knock him out in the first round.
Drop anchor, will you?
- Hit him!
- Fight!
What do I do now, Ma?
Come on. Fight. Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Hit him.
All right. Break, break.
- Hi, Haythorn, how are ya?
- Hit him! Hit him.
- Get up, Ski. Get up!
- Get up there.
Get up, Ski!
Hit him!
- One...
- He's bleeding. The guy is bleeding, Ski.
Finish him off.
- One. Two.
- You got him, Ski.
- Three.
- He wants his mother, Ski.
- Four. Five.
- He wants his mommy.
- Nice going!
- You've got him goin', boy.
Thanks for the fifty, Homang!
Now listen. He's getting tired.
You thinkee he tired hit me?
I'm tellin' you, he's runnin' out of steam.
Now, hit him, Po-han. Hit him in the guts.
Hit him. Hit him!
Pack your bags for that trip across the Delaware, baby!
Hit him.
Hammer! Hammer!
Get him, Ski!
Hit him! Hit him!
Come on, Ski, belt him!
Open his face!
Tear his head off!
Come on, Ski, get him!
Hammer!
Hammer!
This is what happens when you train on beer.
Finish him this time. You'll need your strength for the main event.
Oh, yeah! Whee!
Hammer! He's ready to go down.
Hammer! Hammer!
Yeah, hammer, hammer.
Hit him in the gut. In the gut!
Kiss your money goodbye, Holman.
- Jake, if we lose fight, you lose money?
- Three. Four.
- Five. Six. Seven.
- Yeah. I lose money. But you lose ship.
Eight.
Come on. Fight.
One. Two.
Three. Four.
One. Two.
Three. Four.
Put him down. Put him down!
- Get him, Ski. Get him!
- Hammer!
Hit the bum!
Hammer! Hammer!
- Ski!
- One. Two.
- Three.
- Four!
- Get up, you slob.
- Get up, Ski.
One. Two. Three.
Four. Five.
Emergency recall!
Everybody back to the ship on the double.
Finish the count! Six!
- Let him alone.
- Eight!
- Nine! Ten!
- Yahoo!
Maily! I told you he'd do it!
I told you! What'd I tell you?
Me go back to ship?
You're damned right you do!
- Come on! Let's go!
- What the hell's goin' on up there, Waldron?
- Who's blowin' that whistle?
- On the double!
On the double! On the double, there!
- Keep moving.
- Let's go!
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on, Chief, get 'em aboard. Look alive!
- Come on! Come on!
Get steam up. Stand by to cast off lines and drift if we don't get steam up fast enough.
We'll anchor in the channel.
Sober the men up.
- We may have to repel boarders.
- Aye aye. Chief, prepare to get underway.
Now hear this.
Make all preparations for getting underway.
Holman!
Get steam up to the engine on the double.
- Come on, Red Dog.
- Just a moment.
Up on the bridge. Come on.
- Steam coming up on number two.
- I'll get the steam pump.
Where are you goin'? You're boss now.
- Look sharp on those lines!
- All hands are on board, Captain.
Very well.
- Cast off all lines!
- Cast off all lines!
Get 'em in. Come on.
Take in gangway, on the double.
Last night, at Wanxian up the gorges of the Yangtze, two British warships fought with the local warlord.
200 Chinese were killed, and 150 British.
The Bolsheviks are now saying that
2,000 innocent Chinese were slaughtered.
- We're up against a new strategy of lies.
- I see, sir.
The students of China support a new leader,
Chiang Kai-shek of the Nationalist Party.
He's leading an army north to wipe out the warlords.
- What are we to do, sir?
- We have new orders, Mr Bordelles.
- Not to fire back.
- Sir?
- Not to fire back.
- I don't understand, sir.
Apparently, we're being blamed for everything. "The foreign devils".
Oh, it's an old trick, to unify people by getting them to hate something or someone.
Well, we're it.
They all want to get rid of us.
Chiang Kai-shek peacefully, the Communists in the movement by force.
And we're supposed to grin and bear it.
Because if we fire back, we give them new propaganda to use against us, and play into the hands of Communists, who want us to start a real war so that Russia can come to China's rescue and in that way take her over.
It is an accident of history that we in the
San Pablo are the first American armed unit to come face to face with this new thing.
How we face it can be our great honour, or our dishonour.
I intend that it shall be our honour.
Our government has decided for now not to treat fighting between
Chiang Kai-shek and the other warlords as just another warlord squabble.
We will treat it as an authentic civil war, in which we must remain very carefully neutral.
The United States Government has ordered the evacuation of central China.
We shall be making one last trip to Baoshan to rescue the missionaries at China Light.
Make all preparations for getting underway.
- Stop engine.
- Stop engine.
Those are the China Light people, but I don't see Jameson. Where is Jameson?
He wouldn't come.
- Go to China Light and get him.
- Aye aye, sir.
Shove off at once. Damned nonsense.
Left, left, left, right.
Left, left and right turn.
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, right and left turn.
Left, left, left, right, left, left, left, right, left, left and halt.
Left face.
Mr Jameson is in my custody.
- Yes?
- Mr Jameson, please.
Come in. He's down the hall.
Hi.
She's a schoolteacher. I met her on a steamer comin' up from Shanghai.
- Yeah?
- She's a lady.
They'd do great on the San Pablo, huh?
Collins'd have 'em standin' like that all day.
- Hello.
- Hi. Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm Shirley Eckert.
- Oh. Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?
Those kids stand like that much longer, they're gonna melt.
What's all the machinery you got over there?
A lot of things we don't understand.
I thought about you the minute I saw it.
- How do you like your gunboat?
- It's OK.
- Do you like your teaching here?
- Oh, yes. Very much.
That's to make beet sugar, and this is for electric light.
Hey, you oughta be runnin' 'em.
- Cho-jen!
- How come you ain't runnin' 'em?
We don't know how. Some wealthy man from Philadelphia sent them out.
Cho-jen.
Cho-jen's the leader of the students in this district.
I want you to meet him. He's very bright.
Cho-jen, this is Mr Holman. He's an engineer.
- Hiya.
- Hello.
Where's your direction manuals?
Machinery like this usually has 'em.
Oh, well, I think Mr Jameson has them.
Attention! Attention! Face front!
That Cho-jen, he a Bolshevik?
Oh, no. Chiang Kai-shek is his god.
For all of them he's the hope.
How come he tied a can to the Reverend?
Mr Jameson stood trial in a Chinese court here. He's under sentence of death.
Opium was growing on a remote piece of mission property.
He didn't know, but technically he's responsible.
Why go to a Chinese court?
He coulda ducked that.
He didn't want to.
He's in Cho-jen's custody now.
We're going to Changsha to appeal the sentence. We're sure it'll be changed.
Then we can return to our work here.
Changsha? That's where we're goin'.
We heard you were taking the missionaries all the way down to Hankow.
Changsha.
Shirley!
The San Pablo is going to Changsha.
It'll be quicker than going overland.
Cho-jen has agreed.
We'll leave when you are ready.
I'll go pack.
Now, don't take too much.
I'm sure we'll be returning.
Forward march!
Mr Bordelles, steam is up. We'll get underway when the motor pan's secured.
Aye aye, sir.
- Repel boarders port side, on the double.
- Aye aye, sir. Repel boarders port side!
Repel boarders port side!
Repel boarders port side!
Don't shoot unless attacked. Wait the word.
Wait the word!
It's the bilge coolie, Captain.
- Hold fire!
- Hold fire!
- What was he doing ashore?
- I send.
- Cho-jen?
- They are not ours.
Let him go! He is our countryman!
- What's he saying?
- "Watch what we do to the running dog."
- Who is it, sir?
- It's Po-han.
Offer ransom.
Speak I pay money, $100.
- No, sir.
- Speak!
Release him. The American sailors will pay $100 if you let him go.
We dare you to shoot.
- What?
- They dare ship to shoot.
Yes. They'd like another incident.
They'd like a war. Tell them $200.
He will pay you $200.
He will pay $200.
Four hundred!
- You dirty bastards!
- Crosley, stand clear of that gun!
- They're killing that coolie!
- Stand clear! Bronson, take over.
Hold station, Holman.
Five hundred!
$500, the Captain will pay you.
Let him go! Let him go!
Steady. Steady. Hold station, Holman.
Offer $1,000!
- Get back to your station.
- Do something!
- Get below, or I'll have you shot for mutiny.
- Well, shoot somethin'!
Someone save me! Please shoot me!
Po-han say, somebody shoot him.
Holman! Holman!
Holman!
- Jake.
- Get out.
That man this afternoon, who was he?
He was a bilge coolie I trained.
So you became a teacher too, hm?
Yeah.
That's good.
If you had killed a Chinese, there'd have been a massacre.
We'd have had to open fire, and it might have been the war the Bolsheviks want. You see?
As it is, in killing the coolie...
Although I can understand your feelings,
I can't condone what you did.
However, I choose to ignore it officially, on condition you request a transfer.
You're opposed to the whole spirit aboard the
San Pablo, Holman. You've disrupted morale.
You've been involved in the only two deaths this ship has ever had, and the men consider you a Jonah.
If you won't request a transfer to keep your record clean, then I'll request it.
I'll request it, sir.
You want me to keep running the engine?
Yes. It'll be some time before a replacement can get here.
That'll be all.
- Engine ahead one third.
- Engine ahead one third.
- Prepare to drop anchor out here.
- Aye aye, sir. Stand by the anchor.
- Stop engine.
- Stop engine.
Let go the anchor.
Did you ever find out what happened to them engine manuals?
Mr Jameson says he has them.
- Hit them with the hose if they get too close.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Get a fire hose up here.
- Right.
The Boatmen's Union has declared a strike on your ship.
When the missionaries go ashore, send an armed escort.
- With what orders, sir?
- The same orders the ship has.
Fire only to save American lives, and then only when everything else fails.
We demand that you permit us to take off the citizens of Republic of China who you are holding against their will.
You can go to hell. Hit 'em with the hose.
Aye aye, sir. Give us the water.
Come ahead! Come ahead!
Keep it smart!
Come ahead! Come ahead!
Left, right, left. Left.
Left. Left, right, left.
Detail, halt.
Mr Jameson.
Miss Eckert, how nice to see you again.
Left face!
Mr Bordelles, this is Major Chin of the Nationalist Chinese Army.
- What is your mission here, Mr Bordelles?
- I ask you that, Major Chin.
- This compound is American property.
- It is Chinese soil.
I have authority under Chinese law to commandeer it for battalion headquarters.
You have no right to be here under arms.
I will have you escorted back to your ship.
Let me warn you, Major Chin.
If your superior officers are not prepared to go to war against the United States, they will undoubtedly disavow your actions and make amends.
Do you understand my meaning?
It has happened before.
All too often before.
But we've had enough of that now.
I will quote your own history to you,
Mr Bordelles.
"If you mean to have a war, let it begin here."
Gentlemen, please. Mr Bordelles, we're perfectly safe here with Major Chin.
You may have your men sling arms, or you may have them lay down their arms.
You may go under escort or under full arrest.
That is all the choice I will give you.
And you must make it now.
Present arms.
Sling... arms.
Turn right!
Right face.
Right and left about... turn.
Detail, forward march!
- Don't wash it. Burn it! Burn it.
- Throw that out.
Nobody could wash it clean enough for me to wear.
- What the hell happened?
- Shut up!
Wash this, will you?
- Will there still be liberty, sir?
- I have no instructions to the contrary.
- They'll tear the town apart.
- Restrict it to that place they usually go.
Aye, sir.
- Where you been?
- Nobody'd rent me a room for Maily.
- You get one?
- Finally. It cost me an arm and a leg though.
- What's going on?
- She's been with them since I got here.
- They've got her drinking.
- Did you tell her?
I ain't had a chance.
Give me the dough, Frenchy.
I'll talk to Shu, have him get her away from them, huh?
Yeah.
Shu?
I got the $200 for Maily.
Now, let's do it quiet.
Just pry her loose from those guys in a few minutes and bring her outside.
I got the $200.
- Outside.
- I say $210.
Well, how about it, sailor?
You said the price was $200, Shu.
- And I said $210.
- Butt out of this, mister.
All right, break it up, you guys.
You've got no authority over me, sailor.
He's right.
Match it.
- I'll pay $210.
- Auction! Auction! How about it, Mr Shu?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
We haven't had an auction here yet.
So let's do it.
Why not?
- Wait a minute. Keep clear.
- Put her up on the block.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Now, just look at this merchandise.
Now, what am I bid for this clean, delicious piece of girl-flesh here?
- Come on, what am I bid?
And 40.
Boys, boys. That won't even buy one leg.
Brand-fresh new goods, untouched by human hands.
- Let's bid it up here, come on.
- More! More!
Boys! Who'll say $300 and we see it all?
All right, let's take a look at her.
- $300 I got...
- $300. Now let her go, damn you!
- She ain't yours yet, buddy.
- $350, I...
Strip her. Strip her!
Strip her! Strip her! Strip her! Strip her!
$350! I said $350! Now that's it!
- Bid $400 and we strip her.
- OK. $400.
Jake, come on!
Watch the steps. They're slippery.
It's down this way.
- Anybody after us?
- Nah.
- Oh, let me go back.
- After all that?
- Please!
- No. No.
Here. Here.
- Boy. If ever I get my hands on those guys...
- You've got enough troubles.
What happens now?
Well, I guess I'll go back tomorrow and pay Shu the $200.
That's all she owes him.
- OK.
- I'll see you.
No, hey, hey.
Hang on a minute. I'll go with you.
You all right?
I'm sorry as hell about...
You'll be OK here.
I'm gonna go tomorrow and pay Shu just what you owe him.
Then I'll get you on a train to Shanghai.
Look, if I can't get you on a train right away, you could stay here, huh?
Maybe I'll... I'll drop in.
I sure as hell apologise. I don't know what to say about those guys. They...
You all right?
Let me go away. Just let me go away.
No. I want you to go to Shanghai like you want, but not just away like that.
I'll do what you want. You've bought me.
No. I didn't buy you.
Oh, sure, I'm gonna pay some money, but I'm not buying you.
I don't want it to be...
Well, I don't want it to be like that between us.
I want it to be something else.
It's got to be something else.
You'll be all right.
Please. Please don't leave me.
- Jake?
- Yeah?
- I wanna marry her.
- Hey! Now, wait a minute...
I don't know what I've been doing.
Years with them dumb pigs...
They got a law.
You can't marry no Chinese girl.
- One of them missionaries might marry us.
- Well, they ain't gonna do it.
Why don't you just move in with her?
No. I don't want that.
Maybe we could get it done in Chinese?
I just know I wanna marry her.
Six dollars.
OK.
Thank you.
Sounds kinda nuts, but guys catch these birds so you'll buy one and set it free.
You know, just for the hell...
For the fun of it.
- Go ahead.
- It's a lovely idea.
Well, it's supposed to make you feel like when you help an old lady across the street.
Go, fella.
It does. It's ridiculous, but it makes you feel marvellous.
- What happens if you make it?
- You get a wish.
Oh.
Jake, you made it!
You got it! You get a wish.
What do you want?
- I don't know.
- Well, there must be something.
Yeah, well. I used to want... want an engine.
Isn't the engine still important?
Well, not like it used to be.
- Why don't you take my wish?
- OK.
Oh, hey. Mr Jameson said
I could lend these to you.
These are the booklets for the machinery.
- OK. I'll look 'em over.
- All right.
- Well, go ahead. Take your wish.
- OK.
- Jake?
- Huh?
- Don't you wanna know?
- Know what?
Don't you wanna know what I wish for?
OK.
Well, I wished that someday you'd feel like telling me more about yourself.
Sometime.
When you feel like it.
OK.
So? Then what happened?
- You just keep pullin', don't you?
- You can't just stop in the middle.
Well, why not?
Because it's about you. I'd like to know.
OK. I graduated at the head of my class.
Jake!
Um... I got kicked outta school.
- Aw...
- Aw?
No, I mean it. What happened?
Well, me and this guy got in it on a class picnic.
He brought a couple of bottles of booze and he was chargin' double for drinks.
And I never liked him anyhow, so I hung one on him.
Thing was, though, I was gonna get my diploma in a couple of months.
So I went to see the principal.
He was one of them soft, smiley kind of guys.
He said "If you'll sign this paper saying you brought the booze, that'll be that."
So, like a bonehead, I signed it. Then he looks at the paper and he kinda smiles.
He says "Well, I'll have to think about it."
So I guess I started swingin'.
I forgot he was wearing glasses, and I put out his eye.
So anyhow, the judge says "You got three choices: Army, navy, reform school."
Well, why did you pick the navy?
Well, ain't much water in Utah.
Jake. Wasn't there anybody to stick up for you with the judge?
My mother. She didn't count for very much around there, though.
But a good dame.
We're mixing our lives together, Maily.
We'll never be able to unmix 'em again.
And we'll never want to.
I take you for what you are, and all that you are, and mix you with all of me.
And I don't hold back nothing.
When you're cold and hungry and afraid, so am I.
I'm gonna stay with you all I can, and take the best care of you I can.
And love you... till I die.
Now you say it.
I will always love you, and honour and serve you, and stay as near to you as I can, and do everything for you, and live for you.
I won't have any life except our life together.
I will just love you, Frenchy, all of me, loving you for ever.
Now we're married.
Want to put a hand on ours for luck?
I hope you have luck, and I hope it goes smooth and easy for you.
Thanks for comin'.
They seem very much in love.
- Frenchy is.
- Not Maily?
Yeah, but she knows.
She's not foolin' herself.
- About what?
- Well, for one thing, she's Chinese.
And for another, one day he's gonna get shipped out.
- She could follow him.
- Where?
What they got right now ain't no good.
Somethin' called a "block committee" is trying to kick 'em out of their rooms.
Where are they gonna go?
Just runnin' from hole to hole.
Still, I envy them.
Jake...
It ain't gonna work, Shirley.
Why?
Cos you're goin' back to China Light pretty soon, and I'm goin' back to the fleet.
Jake? Come back to China Light with us now.
You know how hard they look for deserters, Shirley?
And what happens to 'em when they catch 'em?
Well... Well, I just thought...
Knowing how you feel about the military, and that you taught Po-han...
That ain't what we're talkin' about.
Oh, it's good up there, Jake.
It can be a good life.
The court's agreed to let Mr Jameson go back.
You could come as a kind of engineering missionary.
I shouldn't have suggested it.
I'm sorry.
I told you not to talk to sailors, didn't I?
Hey, look. I wonder what's the matter.
They're jumpin' all over.
Hey, it's our coolies. They're jumpin' ship!
Bend off.
- Hey, what the hell happened?
- Shing put opium on board, said it was ours.
- Ski, the bonehead, dumped it in the furnace.
- The Captain told me to get rid of it.
- We can't run this ship without coolies.
- Well, we're gonna.
Shall we try to mask the smoke with rubber, Captain?
It's too late, Mr Bordelles. It's too late.
The San Pablo is now in a state of siege here, and will be all winter.
The water level in the channel is already too low for us to leave before spring.
There will be no liberty.
No contact with the shore except a guard mail trip to the consulate once a week.
Each of you will get a chance to make this trip once.
They have singled out
San Pablo for destruction, using their new weapons of boycott and propaganda.
They expect in the end to haul down the flag in shame and disgrace.
We will not let them do that.
When the time comes, we will defend our flag with our life's blood.
They will watch us every minute.
They will gloat over every rust streak down our sides, every sign of military slackness.
They expect to destroy us.
But it will only make us stronger.
That's all. Carry on.
All right, Chief. Carry on.
Ten hut! Dismissed.
The next incident, they could just as well turn on him and kill him.
Well, at least he's off our necks, sir.
Our primary mission is still to defend American lives.
Even if they are damned fools.
Pray for an early spring.
Or permission to open fire.
Frenchy, you mustn't come here any more.
- You must stay on the ship.
- No.
Sometimes, when I come here,
I think maybe you've gone...
They've chased you away someplace I can't find you.
- Maybe it would be better.
- No, sweetie, don't say that.
I can't help it.
I'm nothing.
I'm not Chinese, I'm not American.
And the child will be nothing.
He'll be ours.
Like you're mine. That's all we need.
Harris, clean up your stinkin' mess!
I'm not gonna do your work.
- I won't stand any more of your watches.
- Harris, lay below!
- Perna, you...
- I said lay below!
Harris!
- Cut it out! Cut it out, you guys!
- Let him go! Let him go!
- Get the deck aides to help you.
- What's the matter with you guys?
- Isn't there enough trouble with slopeheads?
- Get him down below where he belongs!
- I'm an electrician. He belongs below.
- Knock it off!
And the rest of you!
What are you standin' around for?
I want you to start wearing side arms. Franks, too.
When the water in the channel rises and we can get to Shanghai, everything will be all right.
Till then, the men are not responsible.
They have to be protected.
- So stay clear of them.
- Aye aye, sir.
There's never been a mutiny aboard a United States ship of war.
I'm not gonna give them the slightest chance on this one.
I understand, sir.
I told him to go back to the ship to see a doctor.
But he was afraid they would lock him up.
How long has he been dead?
Last night.
You can't stay here.
I'll be all right.
You go back to your ship.
I'm all through with that.
Come up to China Light with me.
I can't.
Listen. Listen.
Frenchy'd want you to.
It's gonna be all different up there.
Nobody's gonna ask you whether you're Chinese or American, where's your father, or anything.
It's just gonna be everybody, all together.
And you got your kid to think about.
Shirley says they grow vegetables, and they got a milk goat.
You can't stay here. Get out.
Him, too. Wake him up, white man's slut!
- The white pig is dead.
- Throw her out.
Stop! What are you doing here?
Come with us. Come!
Don't come back to that part of the city again.
What the hell happened?
Don't say nothin' about this on the ship, will you?
All right.
Captain! Mr Bordelles!
Captain?
- Repel boarders.
- Repel boarders! All hands to stations.
Repel boarders! Repel boarders!
Hey! What the?
- Get Holman up here on the double.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Captain wants to see you.
- Now what's goin' on?
I don't know.
- What's this all about?
- I don't know, sir.
You were ashore yesterday. What happened?
Tell me. That's an order.
- I don't know anything about no murder.
- He is a murderer!
He killed a Chinese woman who was carrying his child!
What is it? What's he talking about?
Frenchy's wife. Maily.
I think they killed her.
What happened?
Frenchy's dead. He got sick and he couldn't make it back.
While I was there they busted in and...
I didn't think they'd do that.
They say you killed her. That's all that's important. How do they know your name?
They must have found my hat.
Within two days this'll be an international incident.
"American Gunboat Sailor
Kills Chinese Woman."
- Is the channel deep enough yet?
- Well, I think we could make it, sir.
We may have to fight our way out of here.
Not for you personally, Holman.
You only matter now as a symbol of your country.
That's all.
- Secure from repel boarders.
- Aye aye, sir.
We wanna talk to you. Word is, they ain't gonna let us out till they get you.
As long as you're aboard, they ain't gonna give up.
They got guns between here and Hankow.
Blow us right out of the water.
You oughta turn yourself in.
Tell the Captain you'll go ashore and stand trial so we can get outta here.
- I didn't kill Maily.
- Then you got no problems.
They'll let you go.
You give yourself up, Holman. You've been a Jonah since the day you come aboard.
Captain!
Looks like nationalist soldiers this time.
Repel boarders.
Get Holman up to the flying bridge.
Underjust and equal law of nations, we demand you give up murderer Holman to people's justice.
Under the just law of nations, you people are pirates. I will not parley with you.
We will!
Come and get him!
- Come and get him!
- Silence on the main deck!
Homang, come down!
Homang! Come down!
- Homang, come down. Homang, come down.
- Homang, come down.
Homang, come down.
Homang, come down.
Homang, come down. Homang, come down.
Homang, come down. Homang, come down.
Holman, if you make any effort to give yourself up...
You in the sampan there, shove off!
Shove off, or I'll fire into you.
Crosley, fire a burst into the water.
Crosley, damn you, fire a burst!
The gun is jammed, sir.
- Bronson, fire a burst!
- The gun's jammed, sir.
Homang, come down!
Homang, come down! Homang, come down!
Homang, come down! Homang, come down!
Homang...
Mr Bordelles, make all preparations for getting underway.
- Take her out of rifle range and anchor her.
- Aye aye, sir.
Captain...
Make preparations for getting underway.
Aye aye, sir.
Here. Wear this.
Come back up as soon as we secure.
Make all preparations for getting underway.
Captain?
Sir, there's an urgent message.
Nationalist troops have Nanking.
They're killing American treaty people.
British and American ships have shelled the city. Marines are landing in Shanghai.
Sir? Treaty people are being directed to flee to the coast for their lives.
Plan Red will be put into effect upon confirmation from Washington.
Mr Bordelles, get Franks.
Come into my cabin, all of you.
What happened this morning has not gone down on paper yet.
It is not history unless it goes down on paper.
What is going down on paper for the end of San Pablo is quite different.
Our radio communications are out of order.
They're out of order.
We are therefore on our own.
Not hampered by orders from above.
At dawn we will get underway.
We will proceed into the lake.
Then, instead of turning downriver to Shanghai, we will cross the lake, and turn up the Chien River to China Light.
Our objective will be to rescue the missionaries at China Light.
After the slaughter at Nanking they will be desperate for rescue.
We will make one last, savage thrust deep into China, and if the San Pablo dies, she dies clean.
It is my responsibility to the ship.
And to the men.
They've been put through intolerable strain.
They rate this... last chance.
Reports indicate the Chien river is blocked by a boom of junks linked with bamboo cable and defended by militia.
We will break that boom and we will move on to rescue the people at China Light.
All right. There's the boom.
About a dozen junks, 50 to 60 feet apart, a cable from bow to bow.
- Half speed.
- Half speed!
It looks like the sampans are bringing more men from shore.
- Drop armour. Call general quarters.
- All hands, general quarters.
Man your battle stations.
Let's go! Let's go!
Look alive! Look alive!
Minimum crew in engine spaces.
All others topside.
Aye aye, sir.
Minimum crew in the engine spaces.
All others topside.
Comin' up. Stawski, take the throttle.
Perna and MacDonald, handle the boilers.
The rest of you, on deck.
Bronson.
Holman! Set up a BAR position forward.
You others, lend a hand.
- Aye aye, sir.
- I'll get it.
From the bulkhead over.
- Battle stations manned and ready.
- Very well. Run up the battle flag.
Aye aye, sir. Battle flag!
- Full speed!
- Full speed.
- Holman, you lower the jack staff.
- Let's go!
Here you go.
- Steer for the centre of the channel.
- Steering for the centre of the channel, sir.
Prepare to concentrate fire on the centre junk.
- Have Wellbeck take the con below.
- Chief, take the wheel.
I got it.
- They're within range, sir.
- They'll have to fire first.
Half speed.
Half speed, sir.
- Main battery, commence firing.
- Main battery, commence firing.
Ready.
Ready!
Ready.
Ready.
Sir.
- Commence firing.
- Commence firing.
- Commence firing! Commence firing!
- Commence firing! Commence firing!
Magazine.
- Here you go.
- Ready!
How about that? The mast!
Ready.
- Captain.
- Ready!
- Slow speed.
- Slow speed, sir.
- Main battery, cease firing.
- Cease fire.
Cease firing!
- Boarding party, take arms!
- Aye aye, sir.
Boarding party, take arms!
Boarding party, take arms!
Boarding party, take arms!
First wave, take boarding position.
- Take her now and lay her alongside.
- Aye aye, sir.
Fix bayonets!
Prepare to grapple!
Grapple!
Boarding party, away!
Why, you dirty...
Let's go.
Aboard, second wave!
Let's go!
Down!
Come on, Holman. Come on!
Captain!
Return to the ship! Come on, Bronson.
Lend a hand with the wounded.
Return to the ship!
They'll try to repair the boom.
We haven't the strength to break it again.
If I'm not back by daylight, consider our mission failed. Sail without me.
- Captain, I can't do that.
- That's all. That's an order.
Whom do I have for a landing party?
Well, all of them are badly cut up, sir, but it's the best we could do.
Farren will handle the boat, and Bronson and Crosley.
Holman will be the senior petty officer.
- Remember your orders.
- Aye aye, sir.
- The men performed brilliantly, Mr Bordelles.
- Yes, sir.
Uh, Captain?
Good luck, sir.
Lieutenant Collins, it would be much better for all of us if you go away at once.
- We have no intention of leaving.
- Your lives are in danger.
- You shouldn't have come here.
- Jameson, you're to come back with me.
You have five minutes to pack what you need.
Our militia of students went to fight you at the boom.
I was hoping to see them come back victorious instead of you.
- You've heard about Nanking?
- Yes.
But those events have no bearing here.
You alone endanger us.
I must ask you to leave now.
My duty is to protect you.
No longer. Shirley, will you please get that paper from my desk?
We've declared ourselves stateless persons.
We've sent our names to Geneva.
That's impossible.
Read this.
- Jake.
- I tried to get back sooner. I couldn't.
- You staying?
- Yes. What happened at the boom?
By that signed declaration we have renounced nationality itself.
Your uniform now gives you no authority over us and no responsibility for us.
- Romantic nonsense.
- We've convinced most people here that there is no connection between ourselves and the gunboats.
- Your presence only endangers us.
- We're at war, Jameson. They'll kill you.
They will not.
Perhaps once this might have protected you, but not now.
Now it is shooting and killing.
It's too late for such fine distinctions.
It will protect us.
This afternoon, my ship fought its way through down there at the boom.
People were killed on both sides. You will not make that a futile and meaningless battle.
We will not serve to give meaning to your heroics. Our lives have their own meaning.
- We have renounced nationality!
- You were sentenced to death!
I am free, under the protection of a student.
They will not care who protects you now.
Not after Nanking.
And it will not be a student militia who comes for you now, but regular troops.
Miss Eckert, they will strip you and rape you.
And this whole valley will be destroyed when our country comes to avenge your death.
Do you want that?
You don't know them.
Have you ever cared for
Chinese women raped and butchered by the warlord troops you favour with your treaties?
- In heaven's name, leave us alone!
- That's enough!
Holman, help them get their things together.
No, sir.
That's an order.
You better get back to the ship, Captain.
Cos they're stayin' here. And so am I.
Do you know what this is?
Desertion in the face of the enemy.
I ain't got no more enemies.
Shove off, Captain.
Jameson! Jameson, sir!
Jameson, sir, sir...
Jameson, sir...
Jameson, sir...
Cho-jen was killed at the boom.
Soldiers are coming to get you. You must go.
Shirley, he says Cho-jen is dead.
Oh, no.
No!
You killed him at the boom.
And now they're coming for me.
Because of you... and your blind pride.
Damn your flag!
Damn all flags!
It's too late in the world for flags!
Lights! Get the lights.
Wait. Wait!
Listen to me.
Wait. Listen...
No!
Is there another way out of here?
A hut by the back wall has a door that leads to the open fields.
Show us.
Cover us. Come on.
Ammo.
- Which way?
- The doorway over there.
Holman, take charge and get everybody back to the motor pan.
You're senior here.
I'll stay and make 'em think we're all still here. Give me the BAR.
When I think you've gotten clear, I'll follow.
You did well at the boom today.
All of you.
Wait till I open fire, then get 'em out of here.
All right, you cover the screen!
You other men take the walls!
What the hell are we waitin' for?
Fire at anything that moves!
Jake...
He's dead. Get her outta here.
- Let's all get goin'.
- Somebody's gotta slow 'em up.
They'd nail us before we got to the river. If they get her, you know what they'll do to her.
- Jake, for God's sake!
- Get goin'.
No! Jake!
Now go ahead. I'll be along.
Hold your fire, Bronson.
Don't shoot till you see something.
How we doin', Crosley?
Watch it, Crosley!
We're gonna get outta here,
Bronson! Watch the walls.
OK, everybody out!
Time to go, Holman. Right!
Right.
I was home.
What happened?
What the hell happened?
If it was only your word, Lucila,
There would be doubt.
Caesar must be undoubted Caesar.
Is it not possible, Lucila that there are
Other ways of becoming the real heir of Marcus Aurelius?
Hail, undoubted Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus! Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
I will never forget what you have done today.
Let this be heard over the four corners of the empire
That I Comadeus,
Now Caesar
To proclaim Galius Matheus Levius
Commander-in-chief of all Roman armies.
Proconsul of the Roman empire,
Second only to Caesar himself.
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Remember, thou are mortal.
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
In these buildings
You store all the law,
All the writings of the great men of Rome.
I am leaving with
My husband.
And soon I'll be far from this city.
Now I ask
That you guard these
The meditation of my father
Marcus Aurelius.
Whatever has happened
In the days to come.
Let not this be destroyed.
For this is Rome.
When...
When my father was dying,
I spoke to the gods,
Saying...
I am not like my father.
And if I'm to be crowned Caesar,
I would change all he did.
I offered them my life,
And told them that if it is not for the good of Rome
That I be Caesar,
Then let me be killed.
But you see...
I'm alive.
And Caesar.
Now!
I wish to see Rome once more... the city of light.
Gaiety, the beauty and strength.
We will have games.
The people of the city will be fed.
You & your Eastern provinces will send us
Twice the grain they've been sending
The taxes on them will be doubled.
My lord, Caesar.
This cannot be done.
We have famine,
Not only in our provinces of
Syria and Egypt,
But also in Armenia, Cappadocia
Arabia
In the whole Eastern half of the Roman empire,
People are dying of hunger
When the words spread that
You have sent for us,
It was joy and hope. Our people said,
Rome cannot let us die.
Our Caesar will send us help.
If we carry out these orders,
We risk having the entire East
Rise up against Rome.
You will tell your provinces,
Egypt, Syria,
The entire Eastern half of the empire
That if there is a least resistance to my orders,
I will destroy them.
You will also let them know they must forget
The weakness of my father.
The tribe of Polybus and his legions
Dead march, ambushed.
Barbarians. Human sacrifice. Romans.
Attack!
Balimar! Balimar!
Lay down your weapons and swords.
We have fought each other long enough!
You will never drag me,
And my people to the streets of Rome as slaves.
Balimar!
You or your people will never be slaves!
This I pledge you on my honor!
Caesar will never accept this.
They are prisoners of war.
They must be sold as slaves.
Let us die killing Romans!
Put them in chain! Put them in chain!
So we can talk to them as men.
We are asking only that you give us your words,
And your chains will be removed.
You don't seem to understand.
Galius Matheus Levius
Wishes to remove your chains.
He wishes to make free men,
Free women of you.
Wishes to make you Romans.
Is it that you doubt the word of Levius?
Tell me, I want to help you.
This is Voltran,
Our god of war.
If your gods are stronger than ours,
They will give you strength.
If they are not, you will reach out and touch Voltran.
You are surrounded by Roman soldiers.
At my first scream they will fall upon you and kill you.
We have lost the battle,
Voltran says we must die.
Let us look upon this logically.
You wish to know
If our god are stronger than your god.
One, what will you know if
I touch your god.
What if it's I am weak?
Two...
We wish to help you,
To free you.
If I scream you will all die.
Although I've been a slave,
I'm not accustomed to pain.
All I am is a philosopher,
I am weak.
I'm not worthy of it.
Barbarians!
Monsters! Animals!
Touch Voltran then will know
If your gods are weak.
I cannot,
I cannot bear this.
It's beyond all human endurance.
I cannot.
Oh, Levius.
What a world to
The future rested in such as this.
I have no intention of turning...
My faith was not strong enough!
You did not even scream.
There's no reason to take our god.
That's no reason to change your ways.
What do you want with us Roman?
You miserable, uneducated, half men.
You are not taught of what we fought for
And yet...
We want you.
We want you.
Sister!
If he hasn't been Caesar,
He'll be the greatest gladiator in Rome.
Yes! You do belong in the arena.
You mean to say you me all this way to sharpen your wits.
Everything you do has a purpose.
I came to tell you what your friends dare not.
You are pushing our Eastern provinces to rebellion.
Now I see.
You've come to scold me.
And may I remind, my sister.
That her younger brother cannot be order about and ridicule.
You seem to forget that I'm Caesar.
I do as I wish.
Do you? Do you?
You had only one idea,
To smash and destroy everything father did.
You always resented me, Lucila.
Why?
What have I ever done to you?
It's what you are doing now!
You're lying.
Don't you suppose I know that it was you
Who poisoned father against me.
I did not have to.
The problem is you and the cruel things you did.
How is it that you never knew about the cruel things you did,
Especially to our own mother.
I was in the room when she died.
When our mother died...
Remember!
I heard her beg you.
Lucila,
Why do you hate me so.
If I'd done anything to hurt you,
Forgive me.
And you let her die without a word.
Wasn't that cruelty?
There was a reason.
Reason?
What was it tell me?
Nothing.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Caesar!
You are unarmed.
Even a woman with a dagger
Could be dangerous.
She has no dagger.
She is my sister.
Leave us.
So, you came to warn me.
No other reason.
Didn't you know Levius
Was on his way back to Rome?
I did not know.
Do you know why he is coming?
Stay here with me, Lucila.
We'll find other ways to show the loyalty
Of Armenia.
Galius Matheus Levius.
I heard a whisper that
Lucila is here in Rome.
I do not heard him saying that anything is possible now
That Comadeus has become Caesar.
I've been hearing these wild rumors
That you've come with your head full of ideas,
For a new Rome.
Rome of my father.
I let you intend to come before the Senate.
With these ideas
These wild schemes of yours.
What will you do if I were to say, Levius
I don't want you to do it.
Just that. Nothing more.
I would still do what I believe must be done.
Abandon this plan, Levius.
And I will see to it that you and Lucila can always be together.
Oh, Levius.
Oh, what will I do?
I'm not as strong as I thought I was.
I have not learned to live without you.
There is no life for either us apart Lucila.
I told you this before but you would not listen.
I thought you betrayed my father.
But now I know.
You found your own way of making the world you want.
And yet if I try to make that world,
Comadeus will keep us apart.
Make that world. Levius
And let's see,
What will keep us apart.
Hail Levius, conqueror of the German.
Hail Levius, Germanigan!
Honorable fathers
And Senators of Rome.
Have you heard what is being proposed?
Galius Matheus Levius,
Have asked that we the Roman Senate
Should give
These barbarians,
These savages
Roman citizenship and settle them on Roman lands.
To treat these wondering murderers
As brothers,
Equal.
And what about other provinces?
What of Goule? So loyal to us.
What of Syria,
And Egypt which send us our grain?
If we make Roman of these barbarians,
Can we withhold
Roman citizenship from them?
No! Then what becomes of the precious price
Roman citizenship once was
It becomes a cheap, common thing.
It will be given away like bread.
I say no!
Warriors!
Let us rid our minds of these poisonous idea.
Crucify their leader.
Send the rest as slave
Teach them once and for all what it is to make war on Rome.
That...
Is the Roman way.
Honorable fathers of Rome!
You have greeted me as a soldier,
Who came in small triumph from the wars.
And I thank you for it.
But you will have a hard decision to make here today!
And it must not be I as a soldier
Swayed your vote.
I ask, therefore, of Caesar
That a man who's neither soldier nor senator,
But a philosopher.
A man of reason
Be permitted to speak for me.
Fellow Romans!
Greek! Greek!
Roman Greek have become a Roman by choice.
Slave! Slave!
I'm not a slave.
I want my freedom.
Fellow Romans.
I am a teacher,
And as a teacher I know that when I
Tried to teach the same lessons for a hundred times
And still the pupil does not understand
Then I force to conclusion that
Perhaps there's something wrong,
Other with the lesson
Or the teacher.
A hundred times we have taught
Those we have called barbarians
What it means to make war with Rome,
We burned their villages,
We crucified their leaders.
We've enslaved their young.
As far as go out to death and buried.
The slaves die, slowly.
But their hatred that we leave behind us
Never dies!
Hatred means wars.
Wars mean tribute
From our provinces,
Taxes,
Hunger,
Disease.
How costly that is!
How wasteful!
And yet the answer is simple.
We must have no war.
No war?
When your friends continually attack us.
This is treason!
These people have proved their aims
Very clearly.
To destroy us
And to destroy the whole Roman way of life.
And yet...
The answer is simple.
Let us transform my friends from men of war
To men of peace.
Let us put them on our abandoned farmland.
Not only will they produce food for themselves,
But this I pledge you.
One day they will send food to Rome.
Yes, I agree!
Put them on those lands.
Let them produce for us
But as slaves.
That is the way it has always been?
Neither here, we have twenty thousands
Of slaves in the family states.
Where are they now?
All sold or freed.
Why?
Because neither oppose to slavery.
No, because it is no longer profitable to keep slaves.
Slaves do not produce as much as free men.
Let us do what is profitable.
And right.
Let us share the greatest gift of all.
Let us give these men the right of Rome and freedom.
And they will spread the word
That Rome has accepted them as equal, then
We will have our human frontiers.
The Roman peace
That Marcus Aurelius promised.
In the name of Caesar...
In the name of Caesar!
Caesar has asked me
When has Rome ever been greater or stronger?
I say in answer to Caesar,
Never has Rome been greater or stronger than mow.
And what is it that has kept our empire together?
Our strength!
Our might!
Equality...
Freedom...
Peace.
Who is it that uses these words but Greeks,
And Jews and slaves.
Behind him and his people are the bandits...
Untold millions of them.
Waiting for a moment of weakness ready to destroy us.
If we take these barbarians and be amongst us,
Our enemies will say is it because
We are weak.
Then they will pour in to us from everywhere.
It will be the end of the Roman empire.
It will be the end of Rome.
End of Rome? The end of Rome?
How should an empire die?
Does it collapse in one terrible moment?
No. No!
But there comes a time when its people no longer believe in it.
Then, then! That an empire begins to die
Fathers of Rome,
I have lived under four great emperors
Trageon,
Henum,
Antonitus
Marcus Aurelius
When during all those years our empire grew.
Changed.
There all life is grow or die.
And you, the senators,
Are the heart of Rome.
It is through you that the people speak.
Speak up! Let the world hear you!
Let the world know
That Rome will not die.
There are millions like them waiting at our gates.
If we do not open these gates they will break them down
And destroy us, but instead,
Let us grow ever bigger,
Ever greater.
Let us take them among us.
Let the heart of the empire grow with us
Honorable fathers.
We have changed the world.
Can we not change ourselves?
Yes!
It is time to change! An end of war.
End to war!
Levius.
Oh Levius.
You have won.
We have won.
We have won the Senate.
We have yet to win Rome.
Rome is with you.
The armies are with you.
I'll be with you.
March against Comadeus.
With you as Caesar all Rome will change
You think you have defeated me,
Haven't you?
Since it was for Rome it cannot be your defeat.
It is also very clear now,
Why you came.
To destroy me.
I could kill you, both!
As for the Senate...
If you will try to oppose the will of the Senate...
I will not oppose the will of the Senate.
We'll allow your barbarians to settle,
But you,
You are no longer second in command to Caesar.
You will return to your northern frontiers,
And you will patrol them forever.
Until it is my pleasure to change my mind.
No, no, no, sister.
I'm not giving you anymore chances to prop against me.
You will go back to your husband in Armenia,
And you will not see Rome or Levius again.
A few days ago,
You were ready to make peace with Rome.
Over these half years we have made many peace treaty.
But many have died.
Of the northern people only you were left.
If you are afraid of the hordes of bandits on your frontier,
Rome will protect you.
Why did you refuse?
Why? Speak out clearly,
Now!
Or be on your way.
All these years in this wilderness.
What have we accomplished?
The first time in the history of the Roman empire
Boast of the northern peace.
And that could be a long, months, years.
For that moment has come.
That one moment that is too much
Would that moment would come
If Lucila were here with you?
A command from Caesar.
Your ought to return to Rome.
Themonitus,
Look! It's Levius!
All is well without you.
We prosper.
They have a home, like the Roman.
As you can see there's more than enough for ourselves.
You were right, Levius.
There's no limit what could be done
With the human spirit, for good or evil.
Have you heard from Lucila?
No.
I haven't heard a word, not for months.
I hear there's a famine I Rome.
People are dying in thousands of hunger
And pestilence.
I must get there before night fall.
I'm glad you prosper.
Terrible day, isn't it Levius?
I'm afraid the gods are angry.
They are torturing Rome with this
Pestilence
Thousands have died. I am alone.
I have no one to...
To turn to,
Except you.
I have not wanted to be away.
The entire East of Babel,
Arabia,
Judea, Cappadocia, Syria,
Egypt... Syria and Egypt!
That is Marcelus' and Versilana's...
They were among the most loyal.
Yes, to my father.
The army is against me,
Against Rome.
Even Sir Hamas has joined them.
He has forced Lucila to flea with him Levius.
Where is the Eastern army, Comadeus?
They have sided with the rebels.
There's only the northern army left to crash them.
And you,
You're the only one they will follow.
Levius.
Take command.
Do not give me this power, Comadeus.
The gods are all with me.
They will always be with me.
Go to the East and crash this rebellion.
Do not give me this power.
I'm not afraid.
You asked for this meeting!
Speak!
You are prepared to do battle with us,
Even before you have spoken to us.
You have rebelled against Rome.
Marcus Aurelius spoke of an empire
Of equal nations.
Rome will not tolerate rebellion!
We're old friend, Levius.
You are traitors!
You have caused two armies to mutiny!
You have threatened the empire!
We are not alone in this, Levius.
Levius.
Levius. Oh Levius.
The gods were kind to us.
They sent you. You. You.
You're a part of this, Lucila?
I am a great part of this.
Why a rebellion?
We are breaking away from Rome.
We will make our own empire with these
An Eastern empire.
An Eastern empire! You will make chaos!
What will hold you together?
What will you do to divide the empire?
But not if you'll join us, Levius.
We will have all Rome greater than ever.
What have you done, Lucila?
I am trying to prevent a disaster
My brother has set upon.
They may be wrong of what Comadeus has done,
But this is not the way to oppose him.
I cannot let you destroy the empire!
Cannot!
Cannot!
If you cannot then take your army back to Rome.
Let us make our own destiny here.
And let the rebellion go on unpunished!
I am part of this rebellion!
I am beginning to wonder if you ever love me.
It is out of love that I dared so much.
Run, Lucila.
Hide somewhere now before it is too late
Because as certain as death,
We'll fall upon the rebellious army and crash them
I do not run, Levius.
Who the hell is he trying to kid??
Hello? Hello, Abbeville?
What? But if you cannot place them, advise Paris!!
I'm at my winds end, but carry on.
Reinforcements, sir?
Why don't you cut out the clowning?
- Me, sir? What have I done?
- Don't ever let me see you... doing a victory roll over my airfield again.
I thought it would buck up the civilians.
For God's sake, Jamie, give your brain a chance.
Corporal, refuel them immediately!
Yes, sir.
So anyway, he hit me and made me nose bleed...
Corporal, I don't mean with your blood.
I gave him a couple of socks...
And re-arm them.
Yes, sir!
Hello, Harvey. Where's Jumbo?
Posted missing last night.
You acting C.O.?
Oh, yeah. Of what?
Five serviceable aircraft.
No spares. No contact.
First we knew the bastards would overrun us... was when we tried to land.
But yes, I hear you very well.
Eh? What?
Are you sure?
They are at Sedan?
For the benefit of the uneducated among us...
I shall translate.
Archam can't believe that Sedan's fallen. I can.
It's no use. They'll be here in half an hour.
We must leave immediately.
Yes, let's get the hell out of it.
Where to, sir?
Why don't you follow me and find out? Come on, idiots.
After you.
Unless they've got there before us.
Get that buzzard out of here!
We'll go with what we've got!
All right.
Forget your kit. Let's move.
Get all the transport you can and get the men out of here.
All N.C.O. S report to me immediately!
You know what to do with the lame ducks?
Yes, sir.
Bombs away.
All the yanks, over here!
Load 'em up!
Over the wing.
Flood the cowling.
Plenty of it.
Right! Stand clear!
Into the trucks!
Come on!
We haven't got all day!
"To the permanent
Secretary of State for air...
"Sir, I have the honor to refer to the very serious calls...
"which have recently been made upon fighter command...
"in an attempt to stem the German invasion...
"of the continent.
"I hope and believe that our armies may yet be victorious...
"in France and Belgium...
"but we have to face the possibility...
"that they may be defeated.
In this case...
I presume that there is no one who would deny...
"that England should fight on...
"even though the remainder of the continent of Europe...
"is dominated by the Germans.
"I must therefore request...
"That not one more fighter be sent across the channel.
"If the home defense is drained away...
"in desperate attempts to remedy the situation in France...
"defeat in France will involve the final, complete...
"and irremediable defeat of this country.
"I have the honor to be, sir...
"your obedient servant,
H.C.T. Dowding."
Air Chief Marshal Dowding, sir.
You do realize, Dowding, the position this puts us in?
I realize that the French have been promised this squadron.
By Churchill personally.
He's given the French prime minister his word.
You do appreciate, Dowding... that Churchill will have to see this?
That's why I wrote it.
This is the BBC home service.
Here is the news.
In the House of Commons this afternoon... the prime minister,
Mr. Churchill, said...
"What General de Gaulle called the Battle of France is over.
The battle of Britain is about to begin."
Eyes right!
I welcome you in the name of the Second Luftwaffe, General.
Thank you, thank you,
Kesselring.
- My dear Fink.
- General.
Everything all right?
We are ready, General.
We can start.
Very well, gentlemen, then forward.
Attention!
Eyes right!
Call out the guard!
Call out the guard!
Attention!
If I have to inspect one more bomber...
I won't recommend you for a Field Marshal, Kesselring.
Please, may I finish the inspection?
Certainly.
Sir.
Pleasant return journey.
The English are not ordained by fate to be our enemies.
You heard it yourself,
Jeschonnek.
This time he's wrong.
They are completely finished... done for.
We'll never have a chance like this again.
Absolute nonsense!
Nonsense, do you call it?
It's a pure catastrophe.
Herr Baron von Richter.
The Fuehrer will speak to you now.
My dear Max!
How lovely to see you back in Switzerland so soon.
I came straight from Berlin an hour ago.
The ambassador will see you now, sir.
Thank you. Excuse me, please.
Sir David,
I'm again instructed... to emphasize that the Fuehrer wishes... to avoid further bloodshed.
England is not our natural enemy... and he offers guarantees for the British empire... if you give Germany a free hand in Europe.
Goering and his Luftwaffe would like to flatten London... as a prelude to invasion.
It's two lumps you take, isn't it?
What's left of your army... abandoned its weapons at Dunkirk.
You're defenseless and just playing for time.
We know of the moves you're making in Washington.
We know the Americans won't be drawn in.
Their embassy in London gives you two weeks.
So what's stopping you?
Look, David. The Fuehrer is being very reasonable.
He offers guarantees.
Experience shows the Fuehrer's guarantees guarantee nothing.
What about Churchill?
After our last appeal, what do we hear?
"We will fight them on the beaches."
With what?
Winston gets carried away sometimes.
With liquid courage.
That's what they tell me.
Clearly, you don't know him.
David, we are not asking for anything.
Europe is ours.
We can walk into Britain whenever we like.
If you think we're going to gamble... on Herr Hitler's guarantees, you're making a grave mistake.
All those years in England seem to have left you none the wiser.
We're not easily frightened.
Also, we know how hard it is for an army to cross the channel.
The last little corporal to try it came a cropper.
So don't threaten or dictate to us... until you're marching up Whitehall!
And even then we won't listen.
Heil Hitler.
It's unforgivable.
I lost my temper.
The maddening thing is that he's right.
We're not ready.
We're on our own.
We've been playing for time.
And it's running out.
Silly bitch!
He's calling you names again, Harold.
I spent half a week settling her and the kids in the country... and now,
"I'm bored," she says!
One of your elite trying to land without wheels.
Boomps-a-daisy.
It's enough to make you weep.
And welcome home, sir.
Undercarriage lever a bit sticky, was it, sir?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it was.
Well, I wouldn't tell the C.O.
That, sir, not if I were you.
You can teach... monkeys to fly better than that!
I'm terribly sorry about that, sir.
- It won't happen again.
- Keep your jacket on, boy.
How many hours have you done in spits, Simon?
On spits, sir? 10 1/2.
We'll make it eleven before
Jerry has you for breakfast.
Spring chicken to shite hawk in one easy lesson.
Attack, attack, attack...
This is Rabbit Leader.
Are you receiving me?
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
Red-3 on 3.
Receiving you loud and clear.
Right. I'll try and get on your tail... and I want you to take evasive action. Understood?
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
Red-3 on 3. Understood.
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack...
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
I thought you might come in from the sun.
Don't think. Don't just glance.
Look! Search for the bastards!
And never fly in a straight line, or you're a dead duck.
- Sir.
- Now, let's try it again.
Or, in other words, beware of the Hun in the sun... who, for reasons best known to himself... has confined his recent attacks to our channel convoys.
However, this won't last forever.
But it has given us a chance to pull ourselves together... and to train people like you.
As fighter controllers, you'll be joining an organization... which, thank the good Lord... was not rushed up hastily yesterday.
It'll be a pain in the neck to the enemy when he comes.
It's the joker up our sleeves.
Now, the R.A.F. Chain shows us where they are.
The information is passed to group... group scrambles the necessary squadrons... and you, at sector level... guide our chaps to the interception.
It's been tried and tested.
It works.
So don't blame the system if you're no good.
Now, clearly, 11 Group here... will bear the brunt of the battle... as those of you who are posted there... will find out to your discomfort.
12 Group is our second line of defense... and covers the industrial midlands and the north.
13 Group, Scotland and the northeast... and 10 Group, the west of England.
More than half the fighter-command squadrons... are stationed here at 11 Group... near the coast where we expect the invasion... and also able to protect London... which is as far as the bombers can get with fighter escort.
But I think we can leave strategy... to those with egg on their hats.
Attention!
Please, gentlemen, the Inspector
General has just arrived.
Here.
Thank you, Captain.
Ah, my dear Foehn.
You are well?
- Yes, thank you, General.
- And Falke?
Yes, thank you, General.
May I introduce my brother Hans, sir?
Another fighter ace perhaps?
When I get the chance to fight, General.
General.
We have borrowed this.
- Dover?
- Dover.
Those masts are their radio direction finders?
Yes. Their secret weapon.
Which we captured at Dunkirk.
Our Stukas can deal with them.
Excuse me, General, but why?
If they know we're coming, so much the better.
We don't have to look for them.
The pilots are in excellent spirits, General.
I have eyes in my head,
Osterkamp.
I merely wanted to say,
General... we shouldn't wait too long.
It may happen sooner than you think.
Please, gentlemen.
Come, Falke.
Thank you, General.
This delay is an incredible piece of luck.
I mean, they roll up France and then stop.
They could've come right on.
You know, our latest intelligence... is that Herr Hitler is sightseeing in France.
'Tis rather pleasant weather.
Oh, no, I mean it.
He's on holiday.
I'm not complaining, Minister.
No, no, no, seriously, Dowding... the morale factor is vital.
I saw Beaverbrook on Monday.
Now, he's going to be able to deliver... as many as a hundred fighters a week.
Well, after seeing you...
I want to be able to go back to the cabinet... and tell them you're as confident as I am.
Damn it, man, we've got 650 planes.
And they have 2,500 aircraft, haven't they?
They won't all come over at once, and we have radar.
Churchill puts great faith in radar.
It's vital, but it won't shoot down aircraft.
I must say, you don't exactly exude a spirit of optimism.
God willing, we will hold out, Minister.
I see. So I tell the cabinet... that you're trusting in radar and praying to God... right?
More accurate the other way around.
I'm trusting in God and praying for radar.
But the essential arithmetic is that our young men... will have to shoot down their young men... at the rate of four to one if we're to keep pace at all.
It's the oil pressure, sir, but the gauge is being checked.
- All right, Charlie. Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.
Never give up, do you, Charlie?
Instrument check, sir.
I hope your new C.O.
Believes you.
He's going to be one of your headaches now.
They know the orders... don't tangle unnecessarily.
So it's "May I do an engine check, sir?
"Or an undercarriage check or a radio?"
Any excuse to get at the Jerries.
At least it shows they're keen.
Yeah, they're a good bunch.
God knows what I'll find in Scotland.
A lot of kids with down on their cheeks.
Yeah, training them to be fighter pilots... is a damn sight more dodgy than fighting Germans.
Well, you've got to earn that new stripe somehow.
At least I got three days in town.
Give my regards to your wife.
Thanks.
May I have a word, sir?
Send us back a haggis.
If you want permission for a test flight... the answer is no.
Large scotch, please.
You with that lot down the road, sir?
No.
One and six, please.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Have you applied for that post in Scotland?
- Darling, I can't.
- You can't.
You know I can't.
- You mean you don't want to.
- Can't. I've got a job.
What have we got?
What the hell is this?
Is it a marriage or a flaming air force committee?
For God's sake, Colin, don't start that all over again.
I knew this would happen.
I never wanted you to join up... never.
Colin, please, try to behave as if I were a human being.
You look more like a parade-ground suffragette to me.
I'm just not cut out to wave a wet hankie on sooty stations.
For God's sake, who's asking you to?
We'll be in Scotland together.
I never could stand marching women.
You couldn't care less, could you?
I cared enough to come here fifty miles.
I didn't measure it.
I did.
I even booked a room.
Three days.
It would be marvelous.
Are you going to apply for that posting or not?
Left, right, left.
Right, left, right, left, right.
Squad, halt!
Right turn!
Order arms!
Now, wait for it.
Squad... dismissed!
Come on, Albert, you're not dead yet.
- It's his turn.
- You'll be lucky.
Twelve pints, please, Fred.
One for the sarge.
Let him get his own.
No, sir, it's not Charlie.
It's some Hurricane out of juice very likely.
Right. Call me directly you hear anything.
Well, somebody must have spotted him.
He can't just disappear.
All right, I'll hang on.
Sir, it's
Air Vice Marshal Park.
That's all we need now.
Jamie, hang onto this.
Good afternoon, sir.
Tell your men to relax.
How are they making out,
Canfield?
Half the squadron are new pilots, sir.
That's why you were sent here, to lick them into shape.
They get less warning here than any other station... so they must learn to get up from standby... in two minutes flat if they're to intercept the enemy.
Hello. Dispersal.
Right.
Stand down, "A" flight.
Yours?
Yes, sir.
The chaps spoil her.
All right, Canfield, what's up?
You have a pilot missing.
Yes, sir.
Over the channel.
Is he much overdue?
Over two hours, sir.
I thought I'd made it clear we're too near the enemy... for pilots to go swanning around on their own.
We can't afford to lose them this way.
What's the excuse this time, undercarriage check?
Instruments, sir.
We've all done it, but that's no excuse.
What's his name?
Pilot officer Lambert, sir.
Gerhardt, my bath!
Yes, certainly, Major.
Do me a favor. Not now, Papa.
These are the day's instructions for the Luftwaffe...
- and they must go off today.
- All right, if I must.
I know, you have just found it.
That doesn't concern you.
Hurry up, old man... because my evening meal will not wait for you.
In exactly five minutes, we drive to Boulogne, OK?
Hans, look after Major Foehn.
Good evening, sir.
May I lead the way?
Certainly, my boy. Lead on.
Don't let him near the wine cellar!
What's the best way to evade a Spitfire, Major, shallow dive?
And curving in at the same time.
But excuse me, Major, my brother says... a Spitfire can outmaneuver a 109.
When we are in England, let him take up a Spitfire... and prove it to me in my 109.
Done! But don't forget your life jacket!
I said look after our guest,
Hans, not drown him.
Major Foehn doesn't think much of the shot-method.
If you would teach your boys to shoot a little sharper... the problem wouldn't arise.
Excuse me, Jafu II.
You are to report to Wissant.
- What, now, Papa?
- Immediately.
And Major Foehn also.
I think I know why we've been asked to go to Wissant.
This is it.
Gentlemen... Eagle Day!
The destruction of the Royal
Air Force on the ground.
Zero hour for takeoff 7:15 A.M.
Our targets today in southern England... are the following airfields.
Manston, Biggin, Kenley...
Dover, Hawkinge.
It is our task to destroy the R.A.F. On the ground.
There'll be nothing left for us.
Don't worry, gentlemen... our omnibus drivers won't be able to destroy everything.
Some Spitfires will remain, anyway.
Even for you, Bruno.
Therefore, gentlemen... fly in at maximum height and make good use of it.
And try not to land in the Channel.
Especially use your eyes and watch your petrol gauges.
Remember, you've only got thirty minutes over there.
Come on, chaps.
Away, I'm here.
Hostile 2-3.
Morning, all.
Bearing 1-8-6, range thirty miles.
Twenty plus.
Height, six thousand.
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.
No I.F.F.
Hostile 2-9, now thirty plus.
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.
Recheck I.F.F., please,
Bentmarle.
Sorry to call you in, sir, but something's building.
2-8 now forty plus.
Convoys?
None due through until tonight, sir.
Hostile 3-1 forty plus, 1-6.
Better bring more squadrons to standby.
Right, sir. Get me Beacon Hill.
Reconfirm Hostile 2-3.
Hostile 2-3, 1-8-0.
Getting interference again, sir.
Not now, corporal, not now.
That's better.
Five miles.
I'm afraid the raid is entering my ground range, Danmoor.
Stukas.
Get them up.
43 Squadron, intercept Hostile 2-1.
That was Danmoor, sir.
Ventnar radar out of action.
Who's covering Dover?
54 Squadron, sir.
6th Squadron's airborne, sir.
Too slow. Some of them took six and seven minutes.
They'll have to do it in two.
Tallyho, Velvet Leader!
Down there on the left.
Stukas!
Roger. Here we go.
Attacking now.
Yellow section, keep your eyes peeled for the escort.
Spitfire!
Easier to hit than a barn door.
It's like shooting rats in a barrel.
You'll be in a barrel... if you don't watch out for the fighters.
What's the matter?
Can you hear me?
Ventnar, and now Dover's out of action.
- Our plots are drying up.
- Then we're blind.
So now we've only got the observer corps.
This is only the beginning.
They won't stop now.
Heinkels.
Make it a hundred plus.
Hello? Hello?
Heinkels, hundred plus.
Yes, Center. Still going north.
Height?
Twelve thousand.
Dispersal.
2 Section, scramble!
Look alive!
Engine trouble!
Lookout.
Right.
Muck and filth everywhere,
Mr. Warrick. It's like a pigsty!
The cooks don't come on till 6:00.
Well, you've got some defaulters. Put them onto it.
Come on you lots, move!
You'd be there fast enough if it was real!
At the double!
Oh, my God.
Section Officer Harvey!
Sir.
I've noticed that some of your girls... are now using the men's trenches during air raid practice.
- It's got to stop.
- Sir.
And another thing... gas mask cases... they're for gas masks.
They're not handbags.
I do realize, of course, that female requirements... differ somewhat from the male.
Nevertheless, that's no excuse to...
God's teeth!
Take cover!
Bastards.
At least we know what Jerry's going for.
All our airfields, unfortunately.
It's a squadron scramble, sir.
Don't be wet.
Get me the duty controller.
We've only just come down.
We're still refueling.
Don't just stand there!
Get one up!
Corporal Johnson!
Engine blocks away!
Rest of you men, in the trenches!
Talk about a hairy takeoff.
- I saw Jimmy buy it.
- Did Archie get off?
Oh, I'm with you old boy, but I've left my stomach behind.
Ah, shut up, will you!
Rabbit Leader to Cowslip Control.
Do you read me? Over.
For Christ's sake, Cowslip, wake up, will you?
Rabbit Squadron airborne.
Close up, Red-2!
Stick to me like glue, Simon.
Rabbit Leader, sorry about that.
This is Cowslip.
About time, too.
Where'd they go?
Bandits now twenty miles east of you heading southeast.
Sector 1-2-0 and make Angels 2-0.
We'll go, Cowslip.
Rabbit's turning port... now.
Come in, Red-2.
Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you, Simon?
You, lads, pull yourselves together!
Get moving!
Get another shovel!
Bates, pull yourself together.
Stay with them, Seymour.
It's all right. I'll see to it.
How about two hands over here, Officer?
Run the hoses out over here!
Put that cigarette out!
The mains have gone!
Can't you smell gas?
Don't you yell at me,
Mr. Warrick!
Here, you men!
Don't stand there looking at it, you idle shover!
You! Get me some stretchers and the orderly.
- Ma'am.
- Fast!
You can stand some of the girls down now, Corporal.
Jones, Whitman, clear up that mess.
Then you can take five minutes.
43, stand down.
1-1-1 released.
5-0-1 are down at Tangbear.
They couldn't get in at Big Wing.
Few more days like this... and we won't be able to get them down anywhere.
I suppose we could always pull them all back... north of the Thames, out of range.
That is precisely what they want us to do.
This is the BBC home service.
Here is the 9:00 news.
Large formations of enemy aircraft... today attacked targets in southern England... but the enemy's aerial armada came in for heavy punishment.
Over forty-seven German planes were destroyed... with a loss of only fifteen of our own aircraft.
Six of these pilots were saved.
Several R.A.F. Aerodromes were also attacked... and some casualties were sustained... but they were light.
Colonel.
Good. Very good.
The weather is constant.
We have a stabilized high pressure zone... and we'll make use of it.
The proof, gentlemen.
We are destroying... as many planes on the ground as in the air.
Thank you, Schmidt.
On the desk, please.
Reichsmarschall Goering will certainly be interested... in my report.
To date, almost 300 planes have been destroyed.
Almost half the entire British fighter force, gentlemen.
The Colonel can report what he pleases.
The fact remains... that our bombers continue to be intercepted.
Because the English are now bringing in their reserves.
As from tomorrow, we'll increase our attacks on these airfields.
And five Luftwaffes will attack the north and north-east.
But that is outside the range of our fighters, Colonel.
Also outside the range of the English fighters.
Not even a Spitfire can be in the north and the south... at the same time.
How far are we from the coast?
Everybody, Action Stations.
Tomato Heinz to all.
Tomato Heinz to all.
Another ten minutes to target.
All ready at Fighter Stations.
Another ten minutes to target. End.
Look! Spitfire!
Help yourself, everybody.
There's no fighter escort.
There! Right behind us!
Soapbox Leader, break it off.
Home and tea.
For once you deserve it.
Well done, everybody.
Heinkel, three-second burst.
Starboard engine.
Ruddy great flamer.
Any identification marks?
Yellow stripes on the wings.
Wing leader. See it go down?
Did I? Nyaow... plunk!
Hmm. Graham and Jack will confirm your story.
That's three of you who got him.
1/3 of a kill, laddie, 1/3.
Sir.
- What did you hit?
- A Heinkel.
- Anyone see mine go in?
- Didn't know you were with us.
Well done, Peter.
Only 1/3 of a one, sir.
Oh, that's better than nothing.
I used to blast away and never hit a sausage.
One thing though...
What's that, sir?
It takes us two years to train people like you.
Suppose your controls had been damaged.
What would've happened to that idiotic victory roll?
You'd have been spread all over the damn field... like strawberry jam.
Never again. Clear?
Yes, sir.
Something to make Stuffy's day.
The old man's just gone down to the OPs room with Sasha.
Final figures of the northern raids... twenty-three without loss.
Jolly good.
I'll show it to him.
Right.
We're getting 6 volunteer pilots from Coastal Command... and from the Fleet Air Arms, sir... five from each of the Fairday battle squadrons... and three from army cooperation.
That's thirty, is it?
Not enough.
We lost that many yesterday.
And the air staff hesitate to weaken the light bombers... in case of invasion, sir.
We need pilots now.
What about the foreign squadrons under training?
Czechs, Poles?
I know your feelings about the language difficulties.
They don't understand a word that's said over the air.
They're a menace to themselves and us.
I'll try and cut more corners off the training program.
Pilots are doing well... enemy losing at the rate of two to one... then he can afford to, can't he?
Never sends more than half his bombers at one time.
We must find more pilots... or lose.
Begin. This is off speed.
Check 5-0-1 back at ready desk...
I think you ought to see this, sir.
Thank you.
Air raid warning.
Sector Three Red.
Rabbit Squadron.
Tallyho, tallyho, Red Section.
We'll take the rear starboard.
Yellow, you take the port.
Yellow-1 Wilco.
Tallyho, Yellow.
Amaliel, keep your eyes open for the Red Squad.
Rabbit Leader, Red-3, you're on those bastards...
Six o'clock high.
Coming down now.
Roger, Red-3. I see them.
Rabbit, brave right and climb.
Behind you, Andy! On your tail!
Get out, Andy!
Jump!
Hurry up! Out!
All out!
Don't any of you Joes talk English?
Corporal!
Sir!
Where are you taking those vultures?
Officers to the mess, ensigns to the guard room, sir.
Like hell you are. They're responsible for all that.
- Get them to clear it up.
- But what about the officers?
Give them a bloody shovel.
Come on, step with it!
Skipper hates Jerries.
He'll hate me if you don't get that gun repaired.
Then wrap up this little lot.
Only eight for the morning?
Got to do better than that.
Five are write-offs.
One has another guard gone, and two are missing, sir.
Mr. Anthony and Sergeant Moore.
And these two are hundred-hour checks.
They've been at it for 48 hours solid, sir.
I know.
Where the hell have you been?!
Learning to swim.
- Do your best, Blaine.
- Roger.
You get one?
All I got was a bellyful of English Channel.
When are you going to learn?
I didn't know they were there.
Never fly straight and level... for more than thirty seconds in the combat area.
How many times have I told you?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'd rather walk, sir.
Cut out the "sir."
You called your wife?
All right, boy. Get in.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
It's ridiculous!
We go up four or five times a day... and every time we come down, more potholes.
There are more potholes until we can't bloody well get in a door.
We'll get this place operational again.
You won't. Not until someone decides... to protect it while we're up.
What flaming genius thought of sending us... to that dump of a flying club?
Don't blame me.
Direct orders from group.
Park himself.
It's not a bad little field.
I've seen it. Damp tents... and a nasty little shack full of dead flies.
At least you won't have the Jerries visiting you.
I don't blame them.
How much longer, Hobbes?
The engine's overheating, and so am I.
We either stand down or blow up.
Which do you want?
Hostile 1-6, reconfirm, please.
Need some more
Yellow sevens, Flight.
This is R-29, now forty plus. 1-5.
Yes. 2-6 and 4-1 detected, sir.
7 Squadron's airborne, sir.
Thank you. Let 12 Group know.
And make sure they know... they're protecting my airfields while they're up.
- They have been told, sir.
- Tell them again.
Pine Tree Leader, this is Turkey Control.
Vector 1-9-2.
I have some trade for you over Maidstone.
Turkey Control,
Pine Tree Leader.
Roger 1-9-0.
Pine Tree, this is Turkey.
Twenty plus bandits and Angels 2-0 heading west.
Roger, Turkey Control.
Indiana left.
Making low level attack.
Roger. I see you.
I'm breaking left to attack.
My God!
Fighters coming down now!
Fire speed. Break.
Break!
On your tail, Jamie.
Enemy aircraft approaching, sir.
Coming straight for us.
Flying course, 21st.
About eight thousand feet.
I'm taking cover.
Tin hats, everybody.
That should damn well never have happened.
- Where the hell is 12 Group?
- They were requested, sir.
They're nowhere in sight.
Find out what the devil they think they're playing at.
They just fell on us.
They got my number two and the C.O.
You saw Canfield go down?
It blew up.
Just blew up.
- Bad as we thought?
- Worse.
Kenley and Biggenor are shambles again... and the rest are not much better.
God knows how many aircraft we'll have in the morning.
All because 12 Group didn't do their stuff.
Leigh-Mallory and his so-called Big Wings.
Might as well stay on the ground for all the use they are.
We were up, sir.
Trying to knock out the enemy en masse.
But it takes time to assemble 40 or 50 aircraft at 15,000 feet.
It takes far too long.
By the time your Big Wing is up... the enemy have hit their targets and are on their way home.
All that matters is to shoot them down in large numbers.
I'd rather destroy fifty after they've hit their targets... than ten before.
Don't forget the targets are my airfields, Leigh-Mallory... and you're not getting fifty.
You're not even getting ten.
Gentlemen, you're missing the essential truth.
We're short of two hundred pilots.
Those we have are tired, strained... and all overdue for relief.
We're fighting for survival.
Losing.
We don't need a big wing or a small wing.
We need pilots.
And a miracle.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.
And now, over to the Savoy Hotel, London... for dance music until midnight... with Carrol Gibbons and his Savoy Hotel Orpheans.
You look a damn sight better out of uniform.
Hardly remember you out of yours.
And who's fault's that?
For God's sake, not again.
Look, damn it, my squadron's come south.
You just apply for that posting!
Colin, no!
All right, agreed!
Taboo subject tonight.
Old wafs.
You really think we're solemnly going... to get into these ridiculous garments?
Not at this stage, surely.
I'm shy.
Oh, Maggie, come on.
It's just...
I am shy.
Honestly.
I'll put out the light.
No, Colin!
No, it's not just bed, it's us!
It's you.
And me.
You and me.
We should have been over target nine minutes ago.
The wind has veered.
So where are we?
Where is London?
Far back in the south-west.
Good. Then get rid of the bombs and let's go home.
Colin.
I will put in for that posting.
Promise.
That's their bombs!
They're bombing London!
It isn't funny! Cut it out!
Too damn close.
Colin, I promise.
I promise.
Attacks on London are strictly forbidden.
This order you know as well as I do, Major Brandt.
These attacks may only be flown... on the specific order of the Fuehrer.
I regret, gentlemen... that this is now completely out of my hands.
By order of Vice Marshal Goering... you two are to report to Berlin to testify.
Thank you.
Major Brandt?
Flying Officer Froedl.
Please follow me.
Would you believe it?
Don't they know there's a blackout?
You know what Goering said:
"If ever a bomb falls on Berlin...
- "you may call me Meier."
- Hmm.
You are to report to Colonel
Schroeder at 9 A.M. Sharp.
This car will take you to your quarters... and you are to remain there.
"As from today, we are called Meier."
Last night, bombs were dropped on Berlin by the British.
So be it.
That is a game at which two can play.
If the R.A.F. Drops three, four... five thousand kilograms of bombs on Germany in one night... then in one night we shall drop three hundred... four hundred, five hundred, five thousand on England!
When they attack our cities, we will flatten theirs.
Then we will obliterate them!
The hour will come when one of us must crack.
It will never be
National Socialist Germany!
Never! Never!
The English are wondering.
They keep asking,
"Why doesn't he come?"
Be patient. Patience.
We are coming.
We are coming!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
Attention!
Reichsmarschall, I welcome you in the name of...
It's all right, Kesselring.
Thank you, thank you.
Ah, Osterkamp, everything all right?
Yes, sir.
Then it can begin.
- Come with me, Kesselring.
- Yes.
Don't stand around like a bunch of pigs!
Fall in!
I'll let the lot of you swim over the Channel!
Attention!
In the ditch! March!
Get off the road!
Attention!
There they come.
If we lose the war now... they'll tear our arses asunder.
Arrow to Rabbit Leader.
Vector 1-6-0.
Bandits one hundred plus.
Angels 1-5.
Bandits one hundred plus. Over.
Rabbit to Arrow.
I can't see them.
But they must be there.
Well, come have a look for yourself then.
Nothing, I repeat, nothing.
Group, please.
Everything we've got, and get them moving.
They've caught us this time.
They're turning northwest.
It looks like London.
It's London, all right... and we've got everything up covering airfields.
Where is the Royal Air Force?
- Messerschmidt.
- Iron Corps.
Messerschmidt!
No, they ain't.
They're Iron Corps.
Five seconds.
Away!
Away!
The pressure's dropping again.
This is as far as I can get, lad.
Down at the end there, by that car.
- Hey, no you don't.
- What do you mean?
There's a thousand-pounder down there... and it's not gone off.
If you're looking for somebody... they're all down at the church hall.
They got the Rose 'n' Crown.
He'll have to drink at the Red Lion now.
If they'll have him.
How bloody stupid can you get?
I spend half a leaf seeing you all safe in the country... and you bring her back to all this.
I'm sorry, it's just we missed everyone.
You're all going back.
Dad, have you finished it?
Have you got it?
Thank you.
There's a family trapped in Shaw Street.
Can we have some more volunteers?
I'll be back, luv.
Stop that bloody bell!
It came more from the back.
Not real Spitfires.
They couldn't land here.
You'll see in a minute.
Only officers fly Spitfires.
You're not a fighter pilot.
What about your top button?
Anybody can do that.
T-5? What's that?
They're a training squadron, sir.
The Poles.
Get them out of it.
Get them down.
Blackhawk Leader, vector 2-3-0... and return to base immediately. Over.
Blackhawk Leader.
Received and understood. Out.
Blackhawk Leader to "A" flight.
Turn to port and steer 2-3-0.
Germans! Germans, on the right!
- I don't see! Where?
- Down there on the right!
I see the Jerries. I see!
Stop that Polish chatter and steer 2-3-0.
Repeat, please.
I say again, 2-3-0.
Repeat, please.
For crying out loud, 2-3-0!
- Repeat, please.
- Repeat, please.
Now, just shut up, the lot of you, and follow me... unless you're blind as well as...
Oh, God's truth.
Shut up!
Silence, in Polish!
Get out quickly!
One, the R.A.F.
Is not a flying circus.
Two, strict R.T. Procedure will be observed at all times.
And it is never... repeat, never... to be used... for private Polish chitchat.
Finally, and God alone knows why...
I've received the following signal.
"Congratulations. As of today, this squadron is operational."
Signed, "Keith Park...
"Air Vice Marshal,
A.O.C. 11 Group."
I was wrong about the Poles.
We also have the second
Polish squadron, sir.
I thought you'd mention that.
All right.
Make them operational.
And the Canadians?
And the Czechs.
We need them all.
Looks like London again, sir.
Yes.
And there's nothing we can do about it.
But if Goering should concentrate... on London by day... it's another matter.
If it means he leaves my airfields alone...
I shan't complain.
Even a few days would give me the chance... to get back to full strength.
He'll have farther to come.
And to go back.
We'll have more time to intercept.
What's more important, Park... his fighters have only fuel enough... for ten minutes over London.
His bombers will lose much of their protection.
For the first time... they'll all come within the range of 12 Group.
Perhaps now, at last, we shall see... what Leigh-Mallory's
Big Wings are made of.
Turning on London could be the Germans' biggest blunder.
Spider Leader, this is Top Hat Control.
Bandits now twenty miles east of you, heading southeast.
Vector 1-2-0.
- Make, Angel 2-0.
- Roger, Top Hat.
Fox Trot Leader, this is Tango Control.
Fox Trot Leader,
Pass your message.
I have some trade for you building up over green "A."
Roger, Tango.
Spider Leader, Top Hat Control.
Your customers appear to be splitting up.
Main course heading for London will be your target.
Vector 0-9-0.
Roger, Top Hat.
Batman Control.
Climb to Angels 1-9.
Roger, Batman.
Thank you again.
This should give them something to think about.
Starlight Control to Dogtail.
Keep an eye out for a friendly wing... joining you on your port side.
Roger, Starlight.
I see them. I see them.
Bloody marvelous.
Fox Trot Leader, Tango Control.
Bandits now probably slightly below you.
Roger, Tango. I've got them.
Peewee Leader turning starboard now.
Watch out for 109s about.
Roger, Fairfield Leader.
Going up now.
Take the left-hand pair,
Blue Leader.
Roger.
Everybody else, keep tight.
Swarms of them, sir!
Fox Trot Leader, cut that out.
Everyone keep quiet.
Leave the flaming fighters.
It's the bloody bombers we want.
Ox, will you pipe down?
On fire, son of a gun!
Ox! Behind you!
Behind!
I am on fire! I'm bailing out!
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon my ass, you Boche bastard.
Put your hands up!
Come on, put them up!
What is it?
I'm a Polish pilot...
Cor blimey.
Your mitts, mate... your mitts.
Put 'em up there.
Go on. Get going.
Where are you taking me?
I'm fighting on your side!
Can we get in?
- And fetch the doctor.
- Good.
I know, young man.
Get out of the way, man.
It's coming. It's coming.
Are you telling me that your losses are critical?
We're bombing day and night,
Reichsmarschall.
Our losses are high, and our pilots are tired... and the planes need servicing.
Be specific!
What are you telling me?!
The English have changed tactics.
Changed tactics? How?
They are attacking in large numbers.
Our losses might be reduced if our formations... were more closely escorted by fighters, sir.
The fighters are always there.
But not close enough, is that it?
You, yourself, were a fighter pilot.
The fighter is a hunter, sir.
I was a fighter pilot.
I was not a coward!
There is no suggestion of cowardice, sir!
I am making the suggestion!
From now on the fighters will stay close with our bombers.
And lose their natural advantages... of surprise and speed?
You will obey orders!
The invasion cannot begin until we have cleared the skies.
Come, my friends,
I have chastised you enough.
But I am here to help him.
Is there anything you want?
Foehn? Falke?
Yes, sir, a squadron of Spitfires.
Stop... vapor trail.
Left and above.
Vulture Leader to everyone.
Keep quiet. Hold positions.
We'll encircle them only when they close up... to firing distance.
We'll take the rear starboard.
Yellow, you take the port.
Roger.
Thanks awfully, old chap.
Sir, you know...
I have promised the Fuehrer... to clear the skies and totally destroy the R.A.F.
I expect to be obeyed!
Here we are.
The miracle of the loaves.
We should have moved in here before we were bombed.
Maggie, I'd like you to meet our new assistant controller.
Squadron Leader Tom Evans,
Section Officer Harvey.
How do you do?
Hello.
He knows your old man.
How is Colin?
Haven't seen him since my little escapade... with the burning Hurricane.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am. There's a call for you.
Will you excuse me just a minute?
- Yes.
- Thanks.
It's around the corner.
Hello?
It's me.
How on earth did you get through here?
Put it down to rank.
I said I was an old battle-ax from the Air Ministry.
Colin. That was very clever.
Any news?
About?
Your posting, you silly idiot.
Well, you've applied.
I've been so busy here.
It's really not as simple as all that.
Look, why the hell not?
To be absolutely honest,
I forgot.
I know, darling. I'm sorry.
Groopy's here now.
I'll go and talk to him right away. All right?
All right?
Colin?
Colin?
Get through all right, sir?
Yes.
Let me give you a piece of advice.
What's that, sir?
Stay single.
Are you still with me,
Dogtail Red-2?
Affirmative, Red Leader.
Directly behind you and on your starboard side.
What happened to Harvey?
He got a 1-0-9, then ran into trouble... but he's all right.
No mistake.
I saw him bail out.
Right, right, attention.
Right. Stand at ease.
Corporal Seymour will detail you to your various watches.
I left out the bit about the wolf whistles.
You're better at that.
The troops have other things on their minds nowadays... thank goodness.
Right! Shun!
It's Colin.
He isn't dead, Maggie.
He's going to be all right.
They can do wonders nowadays, you know.
It's just a question of time, that's all.
We'll get you a posting so you can be near him.
Is he badly burned?
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Peter. I want you to take over Red Section.
Who are my numbers two and three, sir?
A couple of new lads.
They're outside.
Right, then.
How many hours on spits?
- Ten, sir.
- Seven, sir.
Stick to me like glue and keep your eyes open.
Control. Put out 2-2-2 and 6-0-3 Squadrons... against Hostile 2-6.
Winston would pick a day like this to come.
Is everything up?
The lot, sir.
- Reserves?
- None.
That's what I've just told the prime minister.
Red-3, this is Red-1.
Much closer.
I can hardly see you.
Red-2.
You must keep up with me.
Right, Red Section. Here we go.
Stick to me like glue.
Red-3, behind you!
Come in, Blue-2.
Hey, kids. Shut up, will you?
This is the BBC home service.
Here is the 9:00 news... and this is Armand Adell reading it.
Up till 8:00 tonight...
165 German aircraft have been destroyed... in big scale attacks attempted by the enemy today... on London and the southeast.
We lost thirty fighters with ten of the pilots safe.
Buckingham Palace has been bombed again... but no one was hurt.
Yes? Yes, one moment.
It's the air minister, sir, on the scrambler.
Yes?
Dowding. Look, our people in Washington... are having trouble with the American press... and it's about today's figures.
German sources there are saying... that our claims are wildly exaggerated.
Hello?
Are you there, Dowding?
I'm here, Minister.
Well, can you verify the figures?
I'm not very interested in propaganda.
If we're right, they'll give up.
If we're wrong, they'll be in London in a week.
- Morning, Arnold.
- Morning, sir.
Morning, sir.
- Morning, Arnold.
- Morning, Clyde.
Dispersal.
Right.
Tea's up.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
They are late this morning, sir.
The bastards are up to something.
Quick march!
You have let me down!
You have betrayed me!
Padre.
Padre Polenta.
- Who is that?
- It's Fabio, Padre. Fabio della Romagna.
I've come from Montefalcone, and I want to ring the bells.
Fabio, have you been drinking?
There is great news, Padre.
Important news.
A great thing has happened today.
A great thing for us, a great thing for Italy.
Benito Mussolini, the tyrant, he is gone!
Don't you understand?
Mussolini is gone!
It's the greatest day in all the history of Italy!
I'm sorry.
If you can't even see what it means, then excuse me.
I should not have bothered to come home and tell you.
Listen. Listen, you town of jackasses!
How many of you would like to sink your foot in Copa's fascist backside?
That's what it means.
The end of the Fascists.
The end of Copa and Francucci and Bara and Mazzola.
After 20 years, no more cheating on the grape scales, you dumb bastards.
Hey, Babbaluche.
There he is! Cosimo Francucci!
Well, what are you waiting for?
I offer you the big fat ass of Cosimo Francucci.
That's all they know, these heroes.
First, they play up to the Fascists, now they kick them in the behind.
Come on.
Here. Hey, sit down over here, huh?
- See that they pay.
- Yeah, they'll pay!
I said, see that they pay, and I mean it.
The trouble with Rosa is she lacks a sense of history.
All right.
We'll drink to the free city of Santa Vittoria.
- But what will happen now, Fabio?
- I think the Germans will come.
To Santa Vittoria?
Well, why should they come here?
To grab everything they can.
There is nothing in Santa Vittoria for the Germans.
There is nothing in Santa Vittoria for the Italians!
- Did they pay?
- Yeah, they paid.
Let's see the money if they paid.
Rosa, this is a historic day.
You don't ask for money on a day like this.
You don't accept money on a day like this.
I do.
I accept money because this is my house, my wine, my shop.
I invited none of you, so go on, get out of here.
Out. Hey, out!
Out!
You know what I think, Bombolini?
I think you should put your fist in her mouth. Just once.
Luigi's right, Bombolini.
It's a sad house where the cock is silent and the hen does all the crowing.
Hey.
Fabio! Fabio!
Fabio!
Fabio!
Fabio!
- Angela. What is it? What's the matter?
- It's Papa! He's going to be killed!
- Who's going to kill him?
- He's going to kill himself!
MAN: Bombolini, what are you doing up there?
MAN 2: Don't jump!
What do you want? Go on home!
Go on home!
MAN 2: There is no more Mussolini!
MAN 2: Bring the old fool down!
What do you want? Go on home.
Go on home. Your lunch is ready.
Fabio's gone to get him down.
He has a rope.
If he wants to kill himself, let him.
He will do me a big favor.
Fabio, what are you doing here?
Angela asked me.
She was afraid you might need a little help.
I do.
I want to paint out Mussolini, but I'm so tired
I can't even lift the brush.
Oh, I must have been crazy to come up here.
Who was the idiot who painted it in the first place?
You won't believe it.
I was.
I'm sorry.
Fabio, do me a favor, huh?
You paint him out.
Go on, you paint him out.
It's all right. It's all right. I'm all right.
Okay. Okay.
Oh, Fabio, he was so beautiful at first.
He was promises for us.
He was going to help us build a school, build roads.
We were going to plant the hillside in grass and trees.
This tower to give us free water.
Oh, the miracles of Benito Mussolini.
Then Copa's Fascisti come in.
Francucci cut the flour in the bread in half.
Mazzola took over this tower and charged us for the water!
With Mussolini gone, they are finished.
The people remember that I was the biggest fool of all.
They despise me.
Nobody despises you.
Everybody despises the big fool Bombolini.
Rosa, my wife, everybody.
Those people down there, why do you think they're down there?
They want to see me fall, that's why!
- Oh, that's not true.
- That's true, Fabio.
It's true.
All right, the big fool Bombolini is going to make a big splash for you.
Italian Fascism is finished.
Italian Fascism is finished.
And so are we.
Mayor Copa, I could offer a suggestion.
Before they come and take what they want, give them what they want.
- Surrender?
- Before they become violent
- and they come after you.
- It's an idea.
- We surrender on our own terms.
- On your own terms.
- On our own terms.
- On your own terms.
- It's all right.
- All right. It's time to go.
Fabio. Fabio, you'll never do it.
I used up all my strength, just getting up here.
Of course we'll do it.
I'll tie you to the pipe, so you can't fall, whatever happens.
- Yes.
- Then you put your feet on the spikes, and I move the rope one spike at a time.
All right?
All right. All right.
- Fabio, it won't work.
- Of course it'll work.
Just be careful.
Now, come on.
- All right. Fabio, I'm going down.
- Yes.
- I'm going down, Fabio.
- Yes.
I'm going down.
ANGELA: Fabio will save him, Mama.
You'll see.
ROSA: Impossible.
The old fool will kill himself, that's all.
ANGELA: Mama.
ROSA: (SIGHING) Maybe, for once, he's finished!
I have no more tears left for that man.
I cried my guts out the day he put up all that nonsense.
Up with Mussolini! Down with Mussolini!
Yes, no, yes, no!
He's been doing it for 16 years!
He wanted to be so much, he would go so far, he would rise so high in the world.
Well, take a look.
He's arrived. That clown!
He's 100 feet above the rest of us, drunk, drunk as always, hanging by one foot from paradise.
He's finished.
And I, your mother, Rosa Casamassima, to-my-shame, Bombolini,
I tell you that I don't care. I don't care!
I just don't care!
- Fabio, what are you doing with the rope?
- I have to take it off to get over the bar.
- You're not going to leave me here, Fabio.
- You're safe. You're safe.
- I don't feel safe!
- You're very...
Bombolini!
Fabio! Fabio!
Fabio. Fabio. Fabio, I almost got killed.
- Fabio, please help.
- I've got you. I've got you.
Fabio, I almost got killed.
- Bombolini.
- What?
- Get going!
- Oh, no, I... I can't move.
- Come on.
- Fabio, I can't move!
- Come on!
- I'm paralyzed. I'm paralyzed!
Viva Bombolini!
Viva Bombolini!
Viva Bombolini!
Viva Bombolini!
Viva Bombolini!
Bombolini!
Bombolini!
We are coming down!
CROWD: Bombolini!
Bombolini!
- Bombolini!
- Bombolini!
Italo Bombolini, the wine seller.
- I don't believe it.
- Impossible.
If that crazy mob has chosen Bombolini, then you'll have to deal with Bombolini.
He is an idiot!
CROWD: Bombolini!
He is an idiot.
CROWD: Bombolini!
Bombolini!
Free wine for the people of Santa Vittoria!
To the piazza!
Signorltalo Bombolini and good citizens!
By the powers vested in me by the government of the city of Santa Vittoria,
I have the honor to surrender to you the symbol of all authority!
I accept.
But first...
But first it is necessary to ask for your solemn vow that the persons and the property of those who have gone before you will be given full respect!
All right, I agree.
In exchange for that solemn vow, it is my honor to place the medallion of the office of mayor around your honored and distinguished neck.
Up.
Good citizens of Santa Vittoria,
I present to you your new leader,
His Honor, the most excellent Mayor,
Italo Bombolini!
- Citizens of Santa Vittoria...
- Bombolini!
- What? What?
- What do we do with the Fascists?
- Arrest them! Arrest them!
- Arrest them! Arrest them!
And now on to the wine!
Hey, Rosa Casamassima Bombolini.
Rosa.
Rosa Bombolini.
- What do you want?
- Rosa, open the gates.
You drunken clown, go away from here.
And take these bums with you!
Woman, I tell you to open the gates.
I open no gates to a mob of idiots.
This is no mob.
These are the citizens of Santa Vittoria!
And I order you to open those gates.
- Order? You order?
- Yes.
You order me?
As the Mayor of the free city of Santa Vittoria!
Up the fat you-know-what of the Mayor of the free city of Santa Vittoria.
All right, take it down.
- Rosa, what's the matter with you?
- Why did you stop singing, huh?
- Rosa!
- How's that?
- And that!
- I'm the Mayor of Santa...
- You should be proud of me.
- Proud of what?
I'm the Mayor. Rosa.
A drunk elected by a mob.
Of this I should be proud, huh?
- I was elected by public acclaim!
- I'll be proud of you! I'll be proud of you!
Not on the head.
Rosa, please, not on the head.
Rosa. Hey, Rosa, come on.
Did you see me on the tower, huh?
- Tower?
- Yeah.
They had to tie you up like a salami to get you down.
Oh, I like you when you're like this.
Oh, you couldn't fall and break your neck, no.
Rosa. Rosa...
- I'm too unlucky for that!
- It reminds me of our honeymoon!
- Rosa, please.
- But that? I'm too unlucky for that.
- Take that!
- Please, I told you, not in the head. Rosa!
Destroy my shop! You're a bum drunk...
- Rosa, I'll fix it! Not there, Rosa!
- Take that!
Not there, Rosa!
Rosa...
- If you hit me once more...
- Me, too.
- ... I'm gonna get mad.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Rosa.
Mayor. Some Mayor! Get out.
Get out of the house, huh?
Get out of my life forever.
You destroyed my shop, you drank my wine!
Just stay out of my sight, because every time, every time I see you,
I will make you remember this historic day!
Out!
Out!
- Rosa, I'm going to...
- What?
Out!
You know what Rosa said?
She said that tomorrow, when the town has sobered up, they will want me to resign.
That's what she said.
Rosa is a loudmouthed bitch.
No offense, Italo.
The trouble is, to all the important men in Santa Vittoria,
I'm just a clown.
BOMBOLINl: A big, stupid clown.
- Don't deny it.
- Who could deny it?
I'm not going to accept that.
That would be an insult to me.
What are you going to do?
I will issue an official statement, something simple and dignified.
"You can take this job and shove it up your ass. "
That would be the finest moment in Italian history.
Still, you know, for once...
Maybe I...
Maybe I could do something.
For once, I could make Angela proud of me. Even Rosa.
Hey.
Hey, I...
Maybe I could appoint a grand council. A...
Who?
They all hate each other.
Pietrosanto hates Benedetti,
Pulci hates Bracolini, everybody hates everybody in this town.
I will give all the big shots a big title.
Minister of this, Minister of that!
They will support me, or lose their title!
Bombolini, you may be the Machiavelli of Santa Vittoria.
Who?
Machiavelli.
Yes, Machiavelli.
The Prince. It's a book about power, how to get it and keep it.
Machiavelli.
(CLICKS TONGUE) Niccolò Machiavelli!
The Prince. The Ruler. The Mayor.
Yeah, that's me.
BOMBOLINl:
Minister of Finance, Antonio Benedetti.
For Master of Scales, Vincenzo Pulci.
Head of Affairs for the Aged,
Matteo Bracolini.
Minister of Public Works, Luigi Lungo.
Minister of Culture, Fabio della Romagna.
Head of the Cooperative Wine Seller,
Amadeo Gorsetti.
Head of Department of Music and...
And... And Allied Arts,
Giuseppe Capoferro.
Vatican Correspondent, Padre Polenta.
Minister of Sanitation,
Giovanni Pietrosanto.
Director of Protocol, Fabrizzio Vittorini.
And last but not least,
Minister without portfolio,
Hugo Babbaluche.
Members of the Grand Council, a great Italian, Niccolò Machiavelli, once said,
"The first impression one gets of a new ruler and his brains
"is from seeing the men he has chosen to have around him. "
Gentlemen, if you look at it like that,
I submit...
I submit, anybody may say, Bombolini is a genius.
I mean...
Viva Bombolini!
He may look like a clown, but he acts like a real leader of men.
Inside that bastard a clown lives, and sooner or later, the clown will come out, because a clown is a clown and will always be a clown!
It's the Malatesta woman. She's back.
- Caterina Malatesta.
- The snotty one.
Things must be pretty bad in Rome for the Fascists.
- She'd cut the eggs off a man.
- It would almost be worth it.
I'm sorry you're going, but of course I understand you have to go.
- If I didn't, I could lose my place.
- No, we mustn't have that.
It's important for Santa Vittoria to have one young man at the university.
- Hey, Angela, Fabio's leaving.
- I know.
Thank you.
- I've done your other shirt.
- Thank you.
You know what Pulci said to me last night?
He said Fabio must keep his seat on the council even when he's away at school.
After all, you're the only minister we have who's gone past the fourth grade.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Bye.
- You're sorry to see him go, too, huh?
- I always cry when Fabio goes.
Of course, he's like a brother to you.
I don't love him like a brother.
I love him like a woman.
Angela, my child, you're too young to think such things.
That's what Fabio thinks, that I am a child.
- He's right.
- But I am 16 years old!
- You're only 16...
- And I have the breasts of a woman.
- Angela, please.
- And at night, when I'm in my bed,
- my breasts ache for Fabio!
- Don't do that!
And I only want to be with him!
You mustn't say such things!
I can't help it, Papa!
The time has come for you to instruct your daughter in the ways of the world!
Angela, please ask your father what the hell he's talking about.
Angela, I want your mother to teach you two things, the beauty of women, and the danger of men.
I mean, it's your job, not mine!
All right, what is it?
Are you sick?
You look sick.
Hey, why are you sweating all over?
What's wrong? Talk to your mother.
- It's Fabio, Mama.
- Fabio.
When I see Fabio, I love him so much,
I can't help sweating.
Well, I understand, believe me, my little girl.
I understand you.
You see Fabio even in your soup.
Yes, Mama, yes.
And when I talk to him, I can't help it, the juices flow inside...
- What?
- The juices, Mama.
You can hit me all you like, but that doesn't change anything.
You are a woman, Mama, and so am I.
It's time you taught me everything you know.
Know?
What do I know after a life with your father?
I fell in love with him at once without even thinking.
Only because he was handsome, strong, happy, with his big, beautiful hands.
And he smiled.
He smiled like a row of angels!
I told my parents
I want that man in my bed, only him.
My father should have hit me over the head with a bottle.
But I don't want to marry Papa.
I want to marry Fabio.
I had him in bed.
I had him and that was all. Drunk.
Drunk every day from 12 noon to 4:00 in the morning.
And the rest of the time, snoring like a jackass!
Please, Mama, for the love of God, all I want is a little information.
Information?
Hey.
Hey!
Here! You see!
Mama, I know what that means.
You know?
Hey, Roberto, what is it?
What's happening?
- They're occupying all the towns.
- What about Santa Vittoria?
Santa Vittoria on the 17th.
Dr. Bara's away and this is a matter of life and death, Contessa.
Everything in Italy is a matter of life and death.
This man left the army to come home to die.
- This way.
- Then let him die.
Don't bother him, and why bother me?
Well, you worked in a hospital in Rome, no?
- Oh, I changed bedpans.
- Well, every little bit helps.
But I have no bandages, no disinfectants, nothing.
Please.
Tufa.
Tufa, the Contessa's come to help you.
Grenade?
Bombolini tells me you're a good man.
How can you be a Fascist and a good man at the same time?
It's not easy, huh, Tufa?
This place is very dirty.
- He could die in here.
- He's not going to die.
I'm sure you can walk. Get up.
Come on, get up.
- Where am I going?
- Where?
He can come with me.
Oh, that's nice.
You can go with the Contessa, Tufa.
My people are dead.
One place is as good as another.
All right, one, two, three.
- Seven.
- Five.
Six.
- All right.
- All right.
One, two, three.
Zero.
- One.
- Two.
- Bombolini! Bombolini! Mayor Bombolini!
- Fabio!
All right.
Bombolini. Bombolini.
Fabio, what are you doing here?
Why aren't you at school?
The Germans.
The Germans are coming, Bombolini!
Are you sure?
I keep coming back with important news, and either it doesn't mean anything, or nobody believes it!
5:00, Tuesday afternoon!
Units of the German Army!
So, let them come. What else can we do?
They are coming to take the wine!
Vines!
Vines!
Hey, old man!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Vines!
Where the hell are you?
(WHISPERING) This is a nervous wine.
If you talk loud, or curse, it can go sour.
Listen...
(WHISPERING) Listen, how many bottles of wine are there?
One million three hundred and seventeen thousand, more or less.
- One million...
- One million...
- ... three hundred...
- ... three hundred...
- ... and seventeen thousand.
- ... and seventeen thousand.
More or less.
- Julietta!
- Coming.
Coming, Contessa.
It's time for your bath.
You're very shy for a captain of infantry.
I wash only in the most modest places.
Julietta, see who it is.
- Normal.
- I'm feeling better.
- I can go.
- As you like.
Julietta put a bed downstairs.
You can stay here until you find a place.
Thank you.
I beg your pardon. Am I disturbing your...
- Your privacy, Contessa?
- Not mine, no.
- Come in, Bombolini.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Have you...
Have you heard about our terrible crisis?
Give your wine to the Germans.
By the time they drink it up, the war will be over.
Contessa, without our wine we are nothing.
Tufa, you understand that.
You worked on the vines since you were this high, like the rest of us.
Excuse me. I thought maybe...
Maybe you might have an idea.
There's only one place in Santa Vittoria where it's mathematically possible to hide one million bottles.
Mathematically.
If only I had a mind like his!
Mathematically.
Take the wine out of the cooperative and put it down in the old Roman cave.
That's a wonderful idea, except we already thought of it, so maybe it's not such a wonderful idea, because if we thought of the Roman cave, and you thought of the Roman cave, so will the Germans think of the Roman cave.
You can hide the wine in the Roman cave in such a way that all the Germans will see is an empty cave.
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
- But I haven't told you yet.
- It doesn't matter!
Prayers are never wasted.
Now, we all know the cave is useless, so we won't use the cave.
The cave is useless.
So we won't use the cave.
- Then what the hell are we doing here?
- We will use the tunnels instead.
You are crazy, Italo.
Look at the room in there.
There's enough room for all the wine in Italy. And there are four of them.
Four of them!
So, my friends, I follow the advice of my master, Niccolò Machiavelli.
"Things are never what they seem. "
We will brick up the tunnels as if they never existed.
So when the Germans come marching in they will see exactly what there is, an empty Roman cave.
Huh? Huh? Huh?
The clown is right.
Our wine is saved.
Do you hear that, you miserable Germans?
Our wine, the blood of our labor, is saved! Saved! Saved!
- Pull that wagon!
- Pull that wagon!
- Get the wagons out of there!
- Get those wagons out...
Stop the fighting, you bastards!
- Those mules!
- Those mules!
- Move those mules!
- Move those mules!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
Hey, you! Tell the Mayor of the free city of Santa Vittoria that it's no good. It won't work.
It's impossible!
- What do you know?
- You'd better think of something else.
Bombolini. Bombolini.
Stop them! No more bottles!
Get all the animals out of here, and tell the people to go home.
Tell them to go home?
All of them, the people, the animals, the wagons. Tell them to go home.
- What do you mean, everything...
- Bombolini, this won't work.
This won't work.
All right, Bombolini, you can start them going.
- Start them going!
- Start them going!
Now!
Yeah.
It's working.
It's working! Tufa, you made it work.
Bombolini, you won't be able to keep four lines going.
Make three, then two, and the children and old women, let them pick up the glass from the bottles that have dropped.
- They haven't dropped any!
- They will.
Every hour, one blast, five minutes rest, then two blasts.
They could use a rest now.
- I'll be back later.
- Yeah.
Hey!
Hey.
Well, blow!
- Straighten out that line!
- Straighten out that line!
- Watch that torch!
- Watch that torch!
You!
You better be careful.
You lost a lot of blood.
Do you care that much?
I don't think I care too much about anything.
It's the wine. The people of the town.
Maybe.
A peasant is always a peasant, huh?
And a Malatesta is always a Malatesta, huh?
We don't forget, people like us.
On the day that you were born, your father gave many presents into the village.
To my father, he gave some coins and a cup of wine.
- But how could you remember?
- Because he was insulted.
And when my mother heard he refused the money, she sent me to your house through the back door to say that there was something wrong with my father's head.
- How long since your husband was killed?
- Two months.
You don't seem like a woman in mourning.
I'm not. It wasn't much of marriage.
I liked him. He liked me.
And then he became a fascist official.
He went one way, I went another.
You feel nothing?
Nothing.
It's best that way.
Here, take a rest. Rosa, how are you?
Who wants to know?
You look thin.
Even when they work, the rich don't sweat like the poor.
Or smell like them, either.
What's that?
- Poison.
- It smells like paradise.
Rosa, it's nice to have a hot meal before you die.
You aren't going to die.
I'm the Mayor, no?
The Germans come, I greet them.
They threaten me. I spit in their face.
They'll put a pistol to my head and blow out my brains.
Why would they put a pistol to your head?
The whole world knows
Bombolini's brains are in his ass.
Make it solid, like a double wall.
Okay, okay.
Some kraut is going to rap on the side of this cave with the butt of his gun.
Is it finished?
In the morning. I'm sorry I awakened you.
You didn't.
You've made a peasant out of me after all.
You're laughing at me again.
No. Waiting like this for you.
I'm laughing at myself this time.
Caterina Malatesta.
From the first moment when you touched me,
I wanted you.
You didn't act like you did.
I was pretending.
"One place is as good as another," you said.
No, I wanted you.
I wanted you like a schoolboy who has just seen the most desirable woman he can remember.
So now, after all, you can be gentle, and not so shy, and not afraid.
I love you for that. Caterina...
You and I, we need each other.
Perhaps only for a little while.
Yes.
Without being afraid.
Yes.
Without promises.
Right.
Hey, wait, wait.
To you! To you!
The last... The last bottle!
It's almost time.
Hey, Tufa, should I change clothes?
Wear what you have on. Be yourself.
- What do you say to a German?
- Nothing. Answer what they ask you.
How do I act? I don't know how to act.
- Like yourself.
- Well, I don't know how I act.
Hey, Tufa, I want you to take command.
I mean, you know what to say.
You know how to act.
Hey! Hey, I'll make you mayor.
The people chose you, Bombolini.
Tufa, I'm no mayor.
You're a much better mayor than you think.
Go home, Tufa.
And you'd better stay out of sight.
You don't look like a man who tends grapes anymore.
Welcome to the free city of Santa Vittoria, sir.
We, in this city, know that in times of war, certain... Certain things...
- Who are you?
- Italo Bombolini, sir.
Mayor.
I see.
Well, Mayor, I must tell you that this town and the surrounding region for a radius of 30 kilometers are, from this moment, and officially, under German occupation.
Captain, sir, I understand perfectly, sir.
In fact, it is my hope we can find some way of cooperating with the great German Army in a way that will be satisfactory for all of us.
And now, if I may offer you the hospitality of our ancient and historic city hall.
Thank you, no. I think
I prefer a house instead.
- A house?
- That one will do very well.
- Traub!
- Captain.
Notify the occupants of that house with the balcony that we regret the inconvenience to them.
They shall be remunerated accordingly.
But they have 15 minutes to vacate.
Yes, sir.
Um.
Bomble?
Bombolini, sir. Yes.
- Bombolini.
- Bombolini.
Bombolini, who are those people over there?
- Oh, those?
- Yes.
That? That is the Grand Council of Santa Vittoria, sir.
You may dismiss the Grand Council.
Yes.
Curfew will be from 9:00 p. m. till sunrise.
And I shall have the pleasure to meet with you again tomorrow morning at 10:00. Zopf!
Fix me a decent supper, will you?
And some wine. The local wine will do.
Anything else?
- Shut up, everybody!
- Shut up, everybody!
All right, all right.
Quiet for a word from the butter-nose husband of Rosa Bombolini.
That was uncalled for, Giovanni.
And I will thank you to leave my wife's name out of this.
He's right, Bombolini.
When the Germans came, all I could hear was, "Sir, sir, sir! "
Everything but "HeilHitler! "
Shut up! We've had enough democracy for a while. I am the mayor here.
I am the voice of the people!
What the hell do you know about the people?
I smell the people, and the people smell me!
At least no one can argue about that.
An officer and 10 men, and there are 1,200 of us!
They could send an army here in an hour.
You all shout like heroes.
You're a bunch of grape growers!
Sometimes a man has to fight!
Oh, you want to be a martyr.
You go be a martyr somewhere else.
We can't afford martyrs in Santa Vittoria.
As long as the Germans are here and to save our wine, our policy is butter on the nose.
When they push, we give.
They go on pushing, we go on giving.
Every Santa Vittorian has known for the last 1,000 years brave men and good wine, they don't last long.
It's criminal! You keep us locked up.
We don't get enough food.
You tell us nothing.
There's not even a toilet!
Next time, vote communist.
Gentlemen. Nice morning, huh?
Officer, may I?
- Bombolini.
- Yes, sir?
I am considering the question of whether it would be useful to me if you were to remain in office as mayor.
I certainly hope it will be, sir.
I'm pleased with the attitude of your people thus far.
Thank you, sir.
Do you think we are able to work together?
Yes, sir, I am sure we can. I know we can.
And we will.
A very, very realistic way of looking at things. Very mature.
Now, I want a complete inventory of everything in this community.
- Yes, sir.
- How many people, ages, occupations and...
Yeah, go ahead. And savings.
People, occupations, savings, ages.
- Savings.
- Now, number of houses, total acreage, uh,
- complete records of annual yield.
- Yield.
Mmm-hmm.
How many mules, oxen, list of all machinery and tools, and... Oh, yes, precisely how much wine you have in store here.
- Have I said something to disturb you?
- Oh, no, no, no, sir.
It's just that it will take several weeks, maybe months, to get all this information.
There are so many things about you Italians that, for me, are genuinely delightful.
And I'm sure you could be months about this task, but unfortunately I need this information in 48 hours.
Will you do that for me?
(CLICKS TONGUE) Sir, you do something for me, I will do something for you.
I mean, you scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.
We have a saying. "You lend me your mule, I will lend you my ox! "
Well,
I have no mule.
And as for scratching your back,
I'm not so sure.
However, Bombolini, we'll talk from time to time.
Perhaps we can learn from each other about things.
Yes, sir. Well, sir, it's...
I want to say it's... I mean...
It's...
It's been a great pleasure.
Excuse me, my hat.
Sir, the fact is we don't see this war as our war.
All we want to do is act in a way that will cause us the least harm in the end.
- I see.
- Excuse.
Well, good day, sir. Good day.
So I said to Vingolini, "Look, Vingolini, I... "
Did you see what I saw?
If there are two people in the world who should never meet, it's the German and your wife Rosa.
Babbaluche, do you think she'll make trouble?
With Rosa, there's trouble.
Italo Bombolini is your husband?
- I can't deny it.
- How does it happen that you are here, and he's there?
In Santa Vittoria, anything can happen.
If you have a pig with six ears and two bottoms, you say, "Santa Vittoria.
What do you expect?"
If Germans come here, we say the same thing.
Your manners leave something to be desired.
We didn't invite you here.
Sometimes, it would be a good idea for you to keep your mouth shut.
- Bombolini is well rid of you.
- Listen, German, the whole town is one big Bombolini.
"Good evening, German Army.
How are you, German Army?"
The whole town, 1,200 people,
1,200 butter noses! But not me. Not me!
Signora, even for a woman with your powerful face, you're becoming a little too brave for your own good.
How can you talk to the German like that?
It's not so hard.
Try to understand my position.
Rosa, Rosa, you could help me.
Rosa, I can't eat. I can't drink.
I have nightmares.
Just this afternoon, I fell asleep, and I dreamt he asked me how many bottles of wine we had.
- Tell him the truth.
- Yes.
And go back to sleep.
And don't try to cheat him.
You are not smart enough.
I am not trying to cheat him.
I'm only trying to make him think I'm cheating.
If he doesn't think I'm cheating, he's going to start wondering why I'm not cheating, or even trying to cheat.
And, Rosa...
Rosa, then he's going to start thinking maybe this isn't all the wine we have, you see?
Bombolini, why do you always have to go all the way around the mountain when you want to take a leak next door?
I don't know.
I guess cheating comes more natural.
Out. Out!
Look!
You be reasonable and keep your fat mouth shut, or I'm going to feed you my fist, I swear!
I'm frightened to death of you and the cat!
Oh, Captain, sir, I want to apologize.
I'm not responsible
- now for what my wife says.
- It's all right, Bombolini.
- I decided to forget it.
- Thank you.
But she certainly is a bitch.
Good afternoon.
- Bombolini.
- Yes, sir.
Tell me, what did you do before you entered the field of civic administration?
I was a wine seller, sir.
- Were you?
- Yes.
And to whom did you sell your wine?
Well, to anybody who had money to pay for it.
- You mean table wine.
- Yes.
But the wine that this village produces, it goes to the Cinzano Company for the making of vermouth, does it not?
Some.
The products of the Cinzano Company are appreciated even in Germany.
No! Even in Germany.
You know, sir, the people of Santa Vittoria often speak of the valiant efforts of the great German Army.
- Do they?
- Yes.
Mr. Mayor, how many bottles?
I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand.
You've had ample time to make the inventory I requested.
Now, tell me, how many bottles of wine are there in Santa Vittoria?
Oh.
Well, I can answer that quite easily, sir.
Please do.
BOMBOLINl: Exactly
310,000 bottles.
Three hundred and ten thousand, huh?
Three hundred and ten thousand bottles.
Bombolini, you are lying.
Well...
Sergeant Traub's count is three hundred seventeen thousand six hundred and one.
That many?
- That many bottles.
- That many.
Well, that proves I'm not lying because, if I was going to lie,
I wouldn't lie for 7,000 bottles, would I?
(LAUGHING) That would be stupid, no?
Yeah, that would be stupid.
Bombolini, it is your fate to be a civil authority.
It is my fate to be a soldier.
What I'm about to say to you now has nothing whatever to do with my personal feelings, but since I am a soldier,
I can only follow my orders.
What is it that you're about to say to me, sir?
They want your wine.
Bombolini!
Are you afflicted with some incurable disease?
But our wine. To take our wine...
No, I don't believe it.
Please...
Please, tell me it isn't true.
Please, I beg you, tell me it's a joke!
It's a cruel joke!
Only a portion of it, Bombolini, only a portion.
But to take our wine when that is all we have?
It's the blood of the people...
How large a portion?
That matter is, up to a certain point, negotiable.
Up to what point?
- Twenty percent.
- That's terrible.
(SOBBING) That's horrible.
You take 20% of our wine!
I think you misunderstand.
We take 80% and you keep 20.
Sir,
I gave you my word that we would cooperate to avoid the shedding of a single drop of blood.
I now withdraw that guarantee unless you're willing to compromise.
- What's your idea of a compromise?
- Sixty-forty.
Bombolini, Germany has no need of vermouth.
We are simply trying to defray the cost of occupying, and if necessary, protecting this community.
But it's like paying a stranger to sleep in your bed with your wife!
I suppose it is.
All right, then, 25%, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.
I couldn't ask my people to rape themselves for 25%.
For what figure, then, would you be prepared to ask your people to rape themselves?
They won't do it
- for less than 50%.
I doubt. I doubt that my superiors could possibly agree.
But still...
Still, I suppose...
I suppose it does no harm to see what I can do for you.
Oh.
- You drive a very hard bargain, Bombolini.
- Who, me?
Tell me, tell me, who was that attractive woman we passed on the steps?
Oh!
And frankly, to find someone like yourself in a mountain town like this, it's startling.
One grows lonely here, no?
The grapes, oxen, peasants, soldiers.
(SCOFFS) Not much to talk to, is there?
I think I know you.
Want me to guess where you used to spend your summers?
Let me see.
Montreux.
And where would you go to ski?
Innsbruck.
St. Moritz.
(LAUGHS) You see, same thing, same place.
I want you to come have dinner with me.
Monday.
If you say so.
I say so.
They should be crying.
We are taking their wine.
I just don't understand these people, sir.
You didn't listen.
I told you. They're children.
They've probably hidden an extra 1,000 bottles somewhere and feel flushed with victory.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Mayor Bombolini.
- Yes, sir.
- If you please.
At your service, sir, night and day.
- Perhaps you can explain something.
- What?
Why, in the circumstances, are the people so gay?
Well, we Italians always try to look at the bright side.
Unless we are depressed.
I see.
And which would you say is the bright side of this situation?
Now that you mention it, there isn't one.
I guess we Italians are just naturally...
- Optimistic.
- Optimistic. Yes.
Fabio!
Fabio!
Stop it! Stand back!
Stand back!
Sergeant.
Put the herd swine on bread and water for three days.
Maybe that will weaken your sexual appetite.
Bombolini, I'm sorry for this.
Fabio. Fabio.
Angela, what are you doing here?
I came to say thank you for what you did.
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Mmm-hmm.
Thank you, Fabio.
That's all right.
I would do it again for you.
You shouldn't be here.
Does it bother you for me to be here?
No! I don't think so.
Just a little?
More than a little.
A lot!
(PANTING) Angela, I think...
I think I want you!
- Oh, Fabio!
- Angela!
- Angela!
- Fabio!
Angela!
Holy mother of God!
Mayor Bombolini! Wake up!
What's all that noise?
What, are you drunk?
Rosa, is that you?
Pax vobiscum, woman.
Shut up, you!
A crime is being committed,
Honorable Mayor.
A crime?
You stay in there fast asleep, and a man is seducing a virgin.
- Where?
- Right under your nose.
At this time of night? Who is it?
He's your young friend Fabio.
- That young goat!
- Good for him!
Who is the lucky girl?
The lucky girl, Mayor Stupid of the stupid city of Saint Stupid, is your daughter, Angela.
Angela. My baby Angela.
It's impossible.
She can't do this to me!
You're telling the whole town.
Rosa. Rosa, maybe... Maybe it's love.
She doesn't even know what love is, and she's making it right now!
I brought her to you.
You were supposed to teach her.
It's the mother's fault!
I told you, shut up!
Listen, Mayor Bombolini,
I demand that you put on your pants immediately and come down and kill him, or kill yourself. I really don't care which.
Don't worry, Rosa.
I'm going to punish that boy so he'll remember it the rest of his life.
Thank you, Padre. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, Babbaluche! Vittorini! Thank you.
Good morning.
Good morning.
They look quite well together, don't they?
Yes.
- Tonight, at 8:00, if you remember.
- I remember.
- There's going to be trouble.
- I had no choice.
He didn't order you. It wasn't a command.
There are ways, Carlo, of commanding without shouting.
And what will you talk about, huh?
All the people you know in common from the beaches and resorts and all the right places?
Perhaps.
- Things I wouldn't understand.
- I suppose not!
Carlo.
Carlo, what are we doing to each other?
What's the sense in this?
I don't want you to go.
What's wrong, Carlo?
Are you afraid I'll jump into the German's bed because he gives me dinner?
I thought we knew each other better than this.
Let's go over it again.
No promises.
I owe you nothing, and you owe me nothing.
I have a body, and you have a body.
We are both grown people, and we can do with them as we please.
To the gentle life we knew when there was peace.
A lovely toast.
My father kept talking about the war.
I couldn't believe him.
I was young and in love and I knew they wouldn't make war and spoil it for me.
And they did, didn't they?
Why are you here? You don't belong here.
And you?
In my case, I came to steal some wine.
In mine, to hide.
All right, you've stolen your wine.
What keeps you here?
They haven't told me to go.
It might be weeks, who knows?
They might even forget about me completely.
What a wonderful thought.
Winter comes and the cold sets in, when the armies move up, or move back, either way, there's no food and the wine turns to acid.
We're going to need each other, you and I.
May I be quite frank?
Please.
I find myself really attracted to you, and not just physically.
But that, too.
Well, that is quite frank.
Does that offend you?
No. Not at all.
Excuse me.
Contessa, I'm afraid we might have to cut our evening short.
- Sir, an SS officer just arrived.
- Yes, I know.
Tell the gentleman that I'll be at his disposal after I've finished my dinner.
I'm sorry but...
Well, perhaps it's just as well for my reputation since the coffee here is truly dreadful.
Next time you come,
I promise you we won't be disturbed.
Caterina, I'm sorry for what I said earlier.
CATERINA: It's all right.
Did you have a pleasant evening?
It was not unpleasant. He's courteous.
It kept grinding here in my head all evening while you were gone.
Why I acted as I did.
It's because I love you, Caterina.
I offer you, Caterina Malatesta, a pair of hands like shovels, a piece of grape terrace 30 meters by 10.
No home, no money, no future.
How does such a generous offer appeal to you?
- Carlo. Carlo, I...
- I know.
I know. But you'll think about it.
Carlo, leave things the way they are.
You said yourself it's best that way.
But you'll think about it.
Yes, I'll think about it.
As we said.
Scipione is the chief bookkeeper of the Montefalcone bottling plant.
Oh, it's a pleasure, sir.
This wine is only one-fifth of what his records show is in Santa Vittoria.
In other words, four-fifths is missing.
Four-fifths?
What happened to the rest of the wine, Captain?
Where is it?
What have they done with it?
Say, he's made a great mistake.
Four-fifths.
Where's the wine?
I swear by everything that's sacred.
My father's grave, my mother's grave...
Now, my dear Mayor, if you want to lose your eyesight...
CAPTAIN: All right!
Bombolini, I ask you to tell us, as a reasonable man, to save both of us further effort and further pain.
Captain, this is unworthy of you.
How can I tell you about the wine when there is no wine?
We could do with a little less grace and a little more personality.
It works better with these people.
I know these people very well, Lieutenant.
I can handle this matter my own way.
How much more time would you suggest for your way, Captain?
Thirty-six hours. If I don't find the wine,
I'll turn the matter over to your men.
Thirty-six hours.
CAPTAIN: Bombolini.
Get the hell out of here.
Go away. I don't want you to see me like this.
I've seen you worse, my hero.
You couldn't bring yourself to say something nice at a time like this?
With a face like that, do you want me to kiss you?
You never cared for me, did you?
There was a time, I guess, when I loved you.
That first year we were married.
I was blind until the day you came in out of the rain, soaking wet, and fell into bed, drunk.
It was one day too many.
You were nothing but a big, stupid clown, and I lost my respect for you.
Keep still.
Rosa, it's going to be bad in this town for everybody.
For me.
That doesn't make me tell less than the truth.
No, not you. I could be dead, you would walk up to my grave, spit in my face and tell me the truth.
We lie. We lie to each other all the time, all of us.
I'm sick of it.
I'll wash the shirt and iron it, and Angela will bring it to you tomorrow.
Rosa.
Rosa, tell me something.
These past few weeks,
I did surprise you, didn't I?
Yes, you surprised me.
That's the best thing you ever said to me.
- Rosa. Rosa, you're crying.
- (CLICKS TONGUE) No.
Rosa, I know you.
You're crying.
You see, that's the way it is.
You will always make me cry.
Rosa.
Rosa, don't you want me to come back home, huh?
No. You are the Mayor, Bombolini.
You'd better stay over there.
I have divided this place into four sections as indicated on this map.
Technically, mathematically, logically, there are very limited possibilities for the hiding of one million bottles of wine.
We'll start here at the cellar of the city hall.
Nothing.
- There is no wine here.
- No, of course not.
Zopf, do you believe there's wine here?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
The priest said there is no wine, sir.
Priests don't lie.
In Germany, priests don't lie.
In Italy, they lie.
Now he is tearing up all the houses, one by one.
Babbaluche, to want something you can't have is ridiculous.
Now, he is becoming ridiculous.
Italo, I have something to tell you.
- What?
- The Fascists, Copa and Bara...
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
I forgot all about them!
The Germans will find them!
- No, they won't.
- Put them off. They will...
They are not there.
We moved them last night.
- Where to?
- Here in the cellar.
Here? What, are you crazy?
They already looked here.
They won't come back. I swear to God.
- You swear?
- I swear.
Hey, God, you hear?
- Prum.
- Contessa.
It has become necessary to search each house individually, so for the sake of appearances, we have to search here, too.
May I? Thank you.
- Who are you?
- I work on the terraces.
You look like a soldier. A deserter, eh?
There's no wine in this town, Captain.
You're in pursuit of an illusion.
It wouldn't be the first time
I've been in pursuit of an illusion, Contessa.
Come on!
I think it is time, Captain.
Just one moment.
Bombolini.
Bombolini!
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir?
The time is up now.
Time?
- How stupid can you be?
- What, sir?
- Bombolini.
- What?
You won't believe what's going to happen now.
I know, sir.
And when it does, the responsibility is yours.
- But, sir...
- Yours!
So I ask you the last time, where's the wine?
Sir, I have told you.
I promise you, there is no wine.
- How many do you need?
- We prefer two.
All right, two then.
What are you going to do?
I have good news for you.
The Germans are here.
They want to see two of you in order of importance.
You first, Copa, then Bara.
Come on.
Captain. Captain, you can't ask me to choose anyone for this.
Captain, I just couldn't do it.
Captain, you can kill me right now.
Right here, but I won't do it!
Captain, I have an idea.
Why not pick the first two men who happen to come to the piazza?
That way, I won't have the responsibility.
Not even you would have the responsibility.
We could leave it up to God.
I would have said the Devil.
On the double.
We set up our equipment in the Roman cave.
It's quiet down there.
- Well?
- There's no wine.
I see.
I take it that you'll deliver your report to headquarters?
Definitely.
You were right all along.
The SS will vouch for it.
Marvelous.
For 20 years, you had no mercy on us.
I had to do this to you to save our wine.
Do you understand? To save our wine!
So, everything you did in all those years, that's settled.
That's...
That's paid for.
And you've paid in full.
Copa, do you understand?
You've paid in full.
ROSA: Bombolini! For God's sake, let them be.
I'm just trying to explain.
The slate is clean.
For Captain Von Prum.
- It's from division command, sir.
- Read it.
Orders to leave, sir.
Tomorrow morning at 7:00.
You don't understand, do you, Traub?
They've made a fool of me.
There's wine here.
Everybody knows it. Everybody.
They shut their doors, and they close their windows, and they laugh at me.
Sir, even the SS...
To hell with the SS!
I tell you there is wine here!
But what would we do with the wine, sir?
It's too late.
There's no transport available.
- What would you do with...
- What would I do?
What would I do? I...
I'd make Bombolini drink it.
Every damn drop of it.
Shall I make the necessary preparations to leave, sir?
That man who's living with her, get him.
SOLDIER ON PA: Attention.
Carlo Tufa, the deserter, will be shot at 6:00 a. m. unless one million bottles ofmissing wine are surrendered to the German Commander by that hour.
Attention, attention.
Carlo Tufa, the deserter, will be shot at 6:00 a. m. unless one million...
- Always the women in black.
- They pray for me.
They won't let you die, you know.
There's always someone who wants to save you.
It's very hard to become a martyr these days.
Is there wine here?
No.
- There is no wine.
- Then how can anyone save you?
That will be difficult to do.
I take it back. You begin to look like a martyr to me.
Sergeant, please, may I?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Tufa, you think it's worth it
- to save the wine?
- What else have we got?
Just wanted to hear you say it.
- Do you have...
- No.
Boy, I'd love to tell the German everything.
Just to see the expression on his face.
Let him go.
Why do you want me to lie to you?
I slept with the German.
He forced you. You had no choice.
I slept with him.
Carlo, what do you want from me?
Must I say I love you, Carlo?
I want you to say it.
- The "I love you's" in my life.
- Say it.
Two people with nothing, so different from each other.
We have each other.
For a month, a year, maybe longer, if we can stop saying, "I love you. "
Say it. Don't be afraid, Caterina.
Please, say it!
(SOBBING) I love you, Carlo.
I've been an anarchist all my life, but I've never been sure what it means.
Except that nothing means anything.
- Hey.
- Eh?
How do I look, huh?
Like always. Like a clown.
Italo.
I have a confession to make.
No, I don't believe it.
If there is anything that means anything, it's this stinking town.
HeilHitler.
HeilHitler.
Captain, the people of Santa...
- Bombolini?
- Yes, sir?
I want to hear from you just once more, "There is no wine. "
There is no wine.
Bombolini, all you have to do before I leave is to tell me where the wine is.
I don't want it.
I won't touch it.
Not one bottle, not one drop of it.
I give you my word of honor.
Just tell me where it is.
There is no wine.
You know I know there's wine here.
- Oh, you know.
- I know.
Now, you tell me, or I'll blow out what's left of your brains.
Now. Ten seconds.
What are you trying to do to me?
Look, don't you remember, you lend me your mule if I scratch your back?
I remember.
I...
I'm going to kill that man unless somebody tells me where the wine is.
See? They don't give a damn for you.
Not your wife, not the priest, none of your friends, nobody.
They'd let me blow your head off for fermented juice.
Look.
For God's sake, what kind of people are you?
Sir, it is time.
What kind of people are you?
Excuse me, we have a gift.
To the Captain from the people of Santa Vittoria.
It's not a great wine, but it's not bad.
You sure you can spare it?
There's one million more where this came from.
What kind of people are you?

Mr. Duncan Sandys sir.
Good afternoon sir.
Come in, Duncan.
Sit down.
There's a vital job to be done.
The outcome of the war may depend on how you handle it.
You read these reports, the Germans are developing long-range rockets...
- in order to bombard Britain.
- Yes, but they're extremely vague.
And in some respects, contradictory.
But they can't be ignored.
If London and the channeled ports should come under heavy bombardment... we would've to abandon our plan to land in France next year.
I want you to find out quickly whether this rocket threat is real.
And, if so, to recommend how we should tackle it.
Do you want me to do this as well as my job at the Ministry of Supply?
You think you could manage both?
Well, I'll just have to do with rather less sleep.
Your first task will be to collect all the evidence you can... and tell the War Cabinet what you think about it.
All right sir.
By the way... how are your legs since the accident?
Bloody awful.
Well, there we are.
Have they got a long-range rocket?
We've all seen the reports from Intelligence.
Perhaps you'd let me have your reactions.
- Professor Lindemann.
- Not very intelligent.
- Would you elaborate on that?
- I can.
- Some of our agents could be wrong...
- There you are.
- And some would be right.
- Well, these are wrong.
What makes you think that?
If you were a scientist, you'd know you cannot get reliable results... without solid propellants, such as cordite.
With a cordite-propelled rocket carrying a worthwhile warhead... you'd need no less than 50 tons of it.
Fifty tons.
Our biggest rocket has only 50 pounds.
Now, I ask you a question, gentlemen.
If we here admitted, which we do not... the possibility of a rocket project in Germany, what would you do?
Well, there are three avenues of approach as I see it.
Firstly, I'd go over all the aerial photographs we've got... and I'd try and get some new ones.
Next, I'd interrogate all the available prisoners... and then, of course, I'd send in more agents.
And then?
If, after that, I still believed they got rockets...
I'd recommend bombing their installations before they got off the ground.
That's precisely what the Germans want you to do.
To divert our bombing effort from more important targets. Look, I'm a scientist.
In peacetime there are no secrets in science.
And in four years of war, they couldn't have advanced that far.
Even a less spectacular advance... it would've reduced their war effort immensely.
Look, Boyd, send back your agents, tell them to take a closer look.
What about this report that the Germans are recruiting technicians...
- from the occupied countries?
- I can vouch for that.
But you can't vouch for the rocket report.
Agents are like scientists, professor.
Some are good... and some are not so good.
In my opinion, the whole thing is a wild goose chase.
Well, that remains to be seen.
As a scientist,
I was taught to be sure of my facts.
In war, decisions almost always have to be taken on incomplete knowledge.
If you wait until you're certain, you're sure to be too late.
What's the matter with that man?
He may be a brilliant scientist, but he can't always be right.
As far as I'm concerned, he hasn't explained away our Intelligence report.
Just because he can't build a rocket doesn't mean to say the Germans can't.
For the sake of argument, let's assume they have got one in the experimental stage.
Now, where would they test it?
Not in one of the occupied countries, because they couldn't trust anybody.
They'd take it as far away from us as possible to make it difficult to bomb.
Somewhere near the sea... so the duds wouldn't do any damage and wouldn't leave a trace.
So it's got to be the Baltic, hasn't it?
Sir.
Sir, would you come and look at this, please?
- What am I supposed to be looking at?
- There sir. On the left.
I don't know, Babs.
We know they're extending their airfield.
Could it be anything to do with that?
Dredging operations. Drains.
What do they want in London?
Oh, they want us to probe every sortie for rocket installations.
- Sims, would you take this?
- Rocket installations?
What are they supposed to look like?
Nobody knows.
Something unusual. They're new weapons... so we can't expect to see anything we've seen before.
- So unusual we wouldn't even notice them?
- Maybe.
Something we wouldn't even notice?
Sir, there is something.
I spotted it the other day.
Look.
There, see?
Take a look at these.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
The place is called Peenemünde.
- Where is it?
- It's on the Baltic coast.
You see, there's a new power station they've just built here at Köplin.
It's much too big for ordinary use.
There's power lines radiating about all over the place.
Up there among the trees, there are some new workshops.
Down here, there's some reclamation work.
I don't see what this has got to do with rockets.
All these installations seem to be perfectly consistent... with the place being a rocket-firing establishment.
What about these circular earthworks in the woods here?
Mightn't they be test stands for launching rockets?
They're not going to put a firing point in the middle of the island.
It would be too risky.
If they have any, they'll put them right on the coast.
Whatever they are, the Germans aren't making all this effort for our benefit.
I'm not going to believe your fairy tales until you show me a photograph of a rocket.
Well, we'll just have to go on photographing until we find one.
- Flight Officer Babington Smith.
- How do you do?
- You got something new on Peenemünde?
- Yes sir.
Yes. The N8.60 cover, that's all ready for you.
- How many times have we photographed it?
- Ten times now sir.
Am I supposed to look at anything in particular?
Just here on the coast.
I think this will interest you.
- In the middle of that elliptical earthwork.
- Next to that sort of observation tower.
A torpedo-like object on a transporter.
Oh, yes. Yes, I can see it.
We can estimate the size.
It's about 38 feet long sir.
- Could it be?
- We've never seen anything like it before.
The shape is right, the observation tower, the whole setup.
I'd take a heavy bet on it.
Yes, I think you're right.
It's a bloody great rocket.
It's a balloon.
- You can't be serious.
- It's a barrage balloon.
- I'm interested to hear you say that...
- It's a barrage balloon.
- Partially deflated.
- With a damn great transporter.
Why not? The shape is convenient.
About 7 feet across and 50 feet in length.
Yes, but these vehicles are designed to carry up to 25 tons.
Putting a barrage balloon on them would be like...
Like putting a lightweight jockey on an elephant?
It's a balloon.
Well, the photographic interpreters tell us it's a rocket, and I'm quite satisfied it is.
Laughable. It's a hoax.
It's a damned expensive one.
Tractors, cranes, launching equipment, living quarters.
It could be a naval base.
They might be testing some kind of torpedo.
Oh, so now your balloon is a torpedo?
One must explore all possibilities.
Every possibility except the possibility that it might be a rocket.
If it were a rocket, it could never get off the ground.
And if it were a torpedo... what ship is going to be able to launch it?
Whatever it is, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
You mean a torpedo out of a balloon.
I take it, then, that you still don't think
Peenemünde should be bombed.
Certainly not.
Air marshal, what have you got to say?
Well, to attack Peenemünde would mean diverting the RAF from their main task...
- which is to destroy German industry.
- Quite.
And apart from that, to reach Peenemünde... we'd have to fly through their air-defense system.
No fighter cover, I suppose?
I'm afraid not at that distance.
And once we've attacked it, the whole place will bristle with guns.
So we'd have to make sure that we make a job of it first time.
- How would you do that?
- We'd have to send the whole bomber force.
- How many planes?
- Oh, about 600.
And if the German fighters intercepted in strength... we could lose the lot in one night, and with it, the war.
Are you prepared to take such a risk, Sandys?
We'll never win the war unless we are prepared to take risks.
Sometimes great risks.
So, what are you going to do?
I shall recommend to the War Cabinet... that Peenemünde be bombed as quickly as possible.
The first Intelligence reports have come in sir.
It seems we did the job.
All installations have been blown sky-high.
- Peenemünde is been smashed to bits.
- What about our losses? Any idea?
So far, 40 aircraft out of 571.
Right.
We've gained time.
That's the important thing.
Yes. Precious time.
We can't afford to waste a minute of it.
We discovered that large numbers of engineers... were passing through Hamburg,
Bremen and Cologne.
The trail led us to this area around here.
- It's a new factory deep underground.
- What makes you think it's a rocket factory?
Because all the men going there are top-grade specialists.
They're taking them from aircraft and radio factories... chemical plants, research laboratories.
- The skills you'd need for making rockets.
- Right.
We never expected the Germans to give up after Peenemünde.
They must know we're planning to invade Europe this summer.
Supposing they've begun mass-producing these things.
If they could get them off the ground... if they could launch a saturation attack against this country... we could lose the war at the very last minute.
Can you find out any more about this place?
Tricky.
The only way would be to get some of our own agents right inside the factory.
Still, the Germans are crying out for engineers.
- It's possible.
- Men with technical knowledge... foreign languages... who'd also make good agents.
They'd be pretty rare birds.
Yes. Especially in the shooting season.
Looks like a recruiting drive right away, doesn't it?
Among the armed forces and the government departments.
If we interview a thousand men, we'll be lucky to find 12 suitable.
Well, the sooner you find them, the better.
- Two pound on the clock, guv.
- Right. Wait for me.
- Here, work on that.
- Thanks very much. Ta.
Be right back. And remember... concentrate on what I told you.
Next, please.
Oh, that's me.
- An article there on Holland.
- Thank you.
Take a chair, please sir.
- You been waiting long?
- A few minutes.
Do you have any idea what this is all about?
Engineers who speak languages.
I only took it so I could get a day in London.
But I don't want to spend it here.
But look, I was brought up in Germany.
Your German is very good. So good you'd be a loss to the Ministry of Information.
I studied Applied Mechanics in Dresden,
I do assure you.
I may be a bit rusty, but I can easily brush it up.
I'm afraid your technical knowledge isn't up to standard.
I really am very sorry.
Well...
Next, please.
- Excuse me.
- What did they ask you?
Damn fool questions. Usual chaos.
They don't know what they want.
I hope they don't want me.
I want to get back to my ship.
Well, I hope you do.
Next, please.
- Bradley.
- Oh, yes sir.
Take a chair sir, please sir.
- Thank you, sergeant.
- Sir.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
Funny fellow.
I did three years special study of ballistics at the Royal Institute in Den Helder.
And then supervisory work at an ordnance factory in Hembrug.
You're familiar with the dynamics of projectiles?
Oh, yes sir. Yes.
What about your family?
- Are they still in Holland?
- Yes.
My mother and two sisters.
What about you?
I'm making a rather vain attempt to further my unmilitary career.
Thought there might be something in this.
I'm with a tiresome lot... under canvas in the wilds of Essex.
Not enjoying it.
- I don't blame you.
- Next, please.
Do you mind? I shan't keep you a moment.
I'm in a tearing hurry.
Next gentleman, please.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- It's me, Curtis.
- Curtis?
You remember me, don't you?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
- Nice to see you.
I must say, I can't fault your German.
It's perfect.
- Cambridge?
- Fluid mechanics sir.
I gave up pure mathematics after the first year... and then more recently I've been messing about with anti-aircraft rockets.
These rather secret people I'm with...
The first rocket I built rose three feet into the ground.
The second took off horizontally, straight through a hen-house and killed 40 roosters.
How very discouraging for you.
What did you do after that?
Buried the roosters sir.
Mastered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in physics... and graduated magna cum laude.
Have you worked in any of your father's factories?
What for?
Have you had any practical experience?
Flying a P-38?
Thank you, lieutenant.
- We'll let you know.
- Thank you.
I say, Curtis, it was Birmingham, wasn't it?
No, further south.
South?
Further south.
Good morning, Captain Bradley.
Finished?
Next, please.
- How did you get on?
- Sent back to the base.
They said they'd let me know.
What, they didn't say.
Probably planning some new secret weapon.
That reminds me.
Can I give you a ride in my cab?
Thank you very much.
If it's not out of your way. Boodles.
Boodles? What's that?
Club, old boy.
Sure.
Come on, jump. Cut the conversation and jump.
Come on, you idle lots. Jump.
He's getting excited again.
I think he wants you to jump, old boy.
- You think that's it?
- Afraid so.
- Jump.
- Yeah. I guess you're right.
Gate's open.
- Red brake off.
- Brake off.
- There you are, sergeant.
- There you bloody well are not sir.
If that was a parachute descent, you'd have broken your legs.
You're behaving like an irresponsible nit.
Now get back up that tower again and do a parachute landing as I've told you.
Get back up the tower.
Sir.
Gate is open.
- Red brake off.
- Red brake off.
Sir, where's your hat?
Your jumping hat sir. The hat I drew from stores for you for parachute training.
Why aren't you wearing it on your head?
- You mean this one?
- I mean that one sir.
Take if off there, put it back on your head and get back up the tower.
- Up the tower sir?
- Yes sir, up the tower.
- Red brake off.
- Red brake off.
- Red brake off.
- Red brake off.
Gate is open.
- Red brake off.
- Red brake off.
Bloody good.
We want you to pass as engineers from a German-occupied country.
The Dutch will help you join one of the parties... the Germans are taking to their underground factories.
Your job will be to get information back to us.
Now, you two go to Holland.
You'll have a much easier time in Brussels.
All you've to do is to sift the information, decide what's worth sending, what isn't.
- Will we be parachuted in sir?
- Yes.
Now, here are your identities.
Erik Van Ostamgen.
Jean Marcel.
Jacob Bijus.
On this mission, your face is your fortune.
You look very much like him.
- Yes.
- How do I get to look like him?
A bit Po-faced, isn't he?
- I'd hate to meet him in a dark alley.
- You won't. These three men are dead.
Two were Dutch engineering specialists... working at the Skoda factory in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia.
The third came from Paris, a professor of applied mathematics.
Now, he can wait.
But you two are urgent.
You've got to think in Dutch, think in German, think in French.
- Any idea how these men died?
- We're not certain.
- The papers only came in last week.
- You're not certain?
No German is going to ask you how you died.
Bob and I have to take the identities of these dead, pro-Nazi Dutchmen.
- We don't know they were pro-Nazi.
- You don't?
- No.
- What do you call this mission?
Operation Ruestion Mark?
Curtis, we want you for this job, but you don't have to take it.
Well, would you like my answer right now?
- Who's that?
- Me again, Eric Van Ostamgen.
- Leyden University.
- And?
And I studied for five years in the Faculty of Science.
My brother, Willem Bijus.
My father, Karl Van Ostamgen.
I really gave him a bad time.
Seen much of him lately?
Not much. He's dead, actually.
He died April 30th, 1937.
- Now, when am I going to see my wife?
- Your ex-wife. She divorced you, remember?
- Yes. Silly girl.
- Right.
Thanks. That helps a lot.
She could be my mother.
- What year were you married?
- Where?
- Rome.
- Where you meet?
- Capri.
- Children's names?
- Piet, he's six. Erica, she's four.
Birth dates?
Piet, March 22nd, 1937.
Erica, June 13th, 1939.
I've got a court order to give me access to see them.
- Not bad. Not bad at all.
- Thanks. I just wish I looked like him.
If the Germans kept a photographic record of all their workers... they'd need a filing cabinet as big as Hitler's ego.
Who's that?
Me, Jacob Bijus.
- Family?
- One brother.
- Your father?
- He left home when I was 3.
What year was that?
We're over Holland.
It's almost time for our orders.
What do you bet we get down on the ground... we'll find General Boyd to show us slides of our prenatal experiences?
Your Agent will identify himself to you... by offering you a cigarette from a cigarette case that has no cigarettes.
- Navigator.
- Yes.
- We're approaching drop zone.
- Right.
Check equipment.
Action stations.
Stand in the door.
If your chute doesn't open, change it for a harp.
Jump.
I'm not musical.
Jump.
There's a message to return sir.
Who says so?
Base sir. Message reads,
Operation canceled. Return to base.
Cancel it? Now?
Come in, Bradley. Glad you're here. Sit down.
- Thank you sir,
- We're in a bit of a mess.
I've just got a signal from Holland.
Jacob Bijus is wanted by the police.
- I thought he was dead sir.
- He is. But the Germans don't know it.
So if Henshaw is picked up, he could be in a spot of trouble, couldn't he?
Can't your people warn him sir?
Communication is unreliable. It isn't exactly like sending a birthday telegram, you know.
I'm sorry, Bradley,
I haven't got anybody else.
I was almost looking forward to going to Brussels sir.
Thought I might find a decent bottle of claret.
The best my wine merchant can rustle up is a rather timorous Chateau Lafon '32.
It'll taste better when you get it.
Henshaw's new identity papers are sewn into the spine of this book.
I have a most awful habit of losing books.
For God's sake, don't lose that one.
Now, here are your new papers.
Your name is Engel,
Dr. Engel, traveling from Pilsen.
Your background is a bit sketchy.
We haven't had a great deal of time.
- But supposing I'm questioned sir?
- You'll have to use your imagination.
Have to lose the handlebars. Don't worry, you'll only be in Germany a couple of days.
- I'm greatly relieved to hear it sir.
- Let's have a look over the ground.
Your dropping zone is here.
Now, our chaps will be there to take care of you. Code word Lorelei.
Lorelei sir.
You will take Henshaw and Curtis's route up the Rhine.
Up the Rhine sir.
This is your baggage.
Over two hours shall we come by the frontier.
From then, I cannot help you no more.
But I thought you were supposed to tell us where we are going.
This is your way to the hotel.
You will show your papers and get rooms like other engineers.
The Gestapo will not suspect nothing.
I don't like the double negative.
Sorry. I do not understand the English too well.
Glad to hear it.
Cigarette?
Cigarette?
Van Ostamgen.
Bijus?
Jacob Bijus.
- Have you a fire?
- Yeah.
Cigarette?
Something is gone wrong.
The police have taken your papers.
You'd better go to Room 119.
If one of you gets into trouble, the other must be safe.
- What does the Gestapo want with Bob?
- It's not the Gestapo. It's the police.
- What's the reason?
- I wish I knew.
You'd better pack as fast as you can and go to Room 119. I'll get it ready for you.
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Right.
Make sure that that door is locked after he goes.
Maybe they'll move the engineers out before anything can happen to him.
I'll try and find out something.
- Oh, stay in your room.
- Don't worry.
Don't worry. At least it's not the Gestapo.
Who's worried?
We can always meet during the air raids.
The man downstairs told me room 111.
I heard you speaking English just now.
It's none of my business.
I guess I am the one who should explain.
No, no, that's perfectly all right.
I work for the Propaganda Ministry, broadcasting on the radio.
They must've given me the wrong room number. I'm very sorry.
Not at all.
This is my husband's room.
Of course. I should've noticed. I'm sorry.
- Are you a friend of Erik?
- Yes, I'm waiting for him.
- Where is he?
- I don't know. He went out.
Oh, thank God I found him at last.
If only you knew what it means to me.
- Well, this is quite a surprise for him too.
- He has to sign an important paper for me.
We arranged to meet in Hamburg weeks ago.
I get to Hamburg and they tell me he has been transferred to Prague. I go to Prague.
Oh, it's nothing. He wasn't there.
God, the traveling I've done.
Hotels, offices, hospitals.
- I even had him reported missing.
- You did?
Yes. Then the police told me he was here perhaps.
- Will he be long?
- I've no idea.
If I knew where he was
I could go and find him.
Yes.
- Maybe I'll call up the police here.
- I'm sorry, that's out of order.
Won't you sit down?
Oh, sure.
I'm going back to Italy to my parents.
But I can't take the children without his consent.
It's the law in Holland, you know.
Is that why you have to have him sign the paper?
How long have you known Erik?
I met him a couple of months ago in a railroad station.
Here he is.
This is Frau Van Ostamgen.
This is our housekeeper.
Oh, she speaks excellent English.
She's waiting for her husband.
I told her I didn't know when Erik would be back.
Do you have any idea?
Well, I am sorry, but I've come up for the very purpose... of packing Herr Van Ostamgen's luggage and putting it in storage.
But why?
A message from the Labor Office.
They had to send your husband away all of a sudden.
Oh, no. But where have they sent him?
They didn't say.
- Would you give me a hand?
- I'd be glad to. I'm sorry.
But, but who could I ask? Who can tell me?
Oh, I don't think it's any use inquiring.
From here on, his destination is a military secret.
If you take my advice, you'll go home and wait for him to send you his code address.
It's the best thing, really.
I've been traveling for two days. I'm tired.
Could I stay here? I must get some sleep.
- Impossible. This room has been taken.
- I could wait in the lounge, then.
The lounge has been closed ever since the air raids started.
The porter will help you with the luggage.
I'm so sorry.
Please?
Aren't you going to open the door?
It's the police.
Erik Van Ostamgen.
It's all right, let her go.
Who are you? Who are you?
Didn't you hear? He's Erik Van Ostamgen.
He's not. Where is my husband?
Where is Erik?
I'll find out for myself.
Get out of my way...
Shut up.
- If you don't shut up, I'll gag you.
- We'll have to tell her.
Your husband is dead.
- It can't be true.
- I'm afraid it is.
But how did he die? When?
As far as we know, four months ago in an air raid.
I see.
You told the police you were
Erik Van Ostamgen. You're using his papers.
You have my photograph.
Now I believe Erik is dead.
And you've taken his place.
Don't let her leave the room or talk to anyone.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Where is she going?
What is she going to do?
Open the door.
I won't betray you, I swear it.
I won't say a word to anyone. Open the door.
I can't.
But I must get back to my children.
I can't let you go.
I will never see them again, will I?
I brought you something to eat.
You must be famished.
You might as well eat something.
Well, then have something to drink.
Now, tell me.
What was your husband like?
Erik is dead.
I know Erik is dead.
I need to know what he was like.
You want to know about Erik?
Well, I want to know about you, about the kind of man... who would keep a woman locked in a room away from her children... when there are people downstairs who...
You don't know what they're doing downstairs.
I do.
She, she has made up her mind to kill me.
All right. Let's say she has.
You walked into this. It's not my fault.
You asked me before if you would ever see your children again.
I'll tell you the truth. You won't.
Unless you can convince me that I can trust you.
And you'd stand by and let it happen.
You are thinking of nothing but your own life.
- Mine and others.
- What about mine and my children's?
We don't matter as long as you and that woman are safe.
Look, I want to trust you.
But I'm leaving. I've got to convince her.
It's as simple as that.
- Your husband worked for the Germans?
- Yes.
Willingly?
Did he work willingly or was he forced?
Erik believed he could get through life without ever being hurt.
When the Germans came, the way not to get hurt was to work for them.
And you agreed?
- Did you agree or didn't you?
- No.
Is that why you got a divorce?
Or other reasons?
I don't think the Gestapo would question you... about things which concern my feelings, my thoughts.
It's just talk, isn't it? To keep me quiet.
Didn't they tell you in England that Erik was a collaborator?
No.
That the Germans treated him like one of themselves?
Perhaps I think the same way as he did.
How can you really know?
Perhaps, after all, I have German friends.
And you talk about that woman trusting me.
Listen, I'm trying to help you.
That's wonderful. That's really wonderful.
You are always trying to help.
Well, maybe I could if you'd let me.
I think there's a way out of this.
Through the door.
You've the key, the key in your pocket.
Do you have children?
No.
Are you married?
No.
Then it's easy to play the hero.
How's Piet?
Oh, of course you know my children's names.
Yeah. I know as much as that.
Oh, what's so funny?
You. You are funny.
This awful room, the little waiter, that dreadful woman downstairs.
And you asking me about my children.
You'd better come to your senses.
Oh, I'm being perfectly sensible.
I want you to let me out of this room.
How can I convince you?
How can I persuade you?
Can you be bribed?
With money?
I haven't got any.
But you've had enough to drink.
Come on. Come on.
I'll try to find a way.
I promise you I'll try.
Erik was always making me promises.
I remember he promised... to take me to Paris once.
But he never did.
He did take you to Capri on your honeymoon, didn't he?
Yes.
- Where do you live in Italy?
- Civitavecchia.
Via Mazzina 19, Civitavecchia.
Near Rome.
By the sea.
You really don't have any choice.
You may as well trust me.
I trust you.
Dr. Engel? Dr. Engel?
You're Dr. Engel?
Yes, yes. In spite of every appearance to the contrary.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm rather scruffy.
I'm afraid I didn't have a very good journey.
I landed in a hawthorn tree and spent the night in a field of turnips.
It was a bit uncomfortable.
However, I've got the documents.
They've arrested Bijus.
There's a chance they'll let him go.
They need engineers too badly.
Hope you're right.
Might as well have stayed at home.
Nothing we can do.
I'll show you to your room.
- Will there be a police check?
- No.
They've checked the passes.
They never come twice.
And if they do, you're Engel.
I'm not very well acquainted with Dr. Engel.
In fact, we're scarcely on nodding terms.
- If they ask any questions...
- Invent.
London. Room 426, wasn't it?
They turned me down.
Evidently, you were accepted.
My congratulations.
You're not Bijus.
You're a petty officer in the so-called Free Dutch Navy.
We've known for a long time... that Allied agents were being planted in our underground factories.
I was sent into England to try and join one of these groups.
And English.
Now, tell me, who are your contacts here?
Who helped you get into Germany?
How did you plan to send information to England?
Look, we can easily find out who you really are.
You're obviously a qualified engineer.
Holland is a very small country.
With a photograph, we can identify you in a matter of days.
Perhaps you have a family in Holland.
You wouldn't like to have them sent to a concentration camp.
I'm not asking you to betray your country.
You're a Dutchman. Good.
There are millions in Holland and occupied Europe working for the Reich.
Do you think they're all wrong?
You take my case, for example.
I'm half English, half German.
When the war came, I had to make up my mind what I really believed, where I stood.
Has it ever occurred to you that you might be wrong... and the Germans just might be right?
Look what we've achieved in the past 10 years.
Before Hitler came to power, we were nothing.
Now we're the greatest nation in the world, the most feared and the most respected.
You understand, don't you?
I've only got to give the order... and things would become extremely unpleasant for you.
On the other hand, if you cooperate,
I promise that you'll end this war alive... and on the winning side.
Because we are going to win the war,
I assure you.
So, what's the trouble?
What's holding you back?
I'd like to understand.
You're a very silly young man.
Here, you have this.
Sordid, isn't it?
Not one of history's immortal moments.
And unnecessary. You proved your point.
You're a very brave man.
I have the greatest admiration for you.
But it's all wasted.
The war will go on.
The outcome will be just the same... only you'll be dead... and no one will even know how you died.
For God's sake, man, don't throw your life away for nothing.
- Could I have a word with you, please?
- Of course.
I just got a message. The trucks will be here any moment. Here are your papers.
We have to be careful. It may be some time before anybody gets in touch with you.
Here they are. Now, don't worry about the girl. I'll take care of her.
You don't have to.
We can trust her, we can let her go.
Trust her? How can you be sure?
I know what I'm doing.
Give me that document about your children.
This document gives Frau Van Ostamgen permission to take her children to Italy.
- That's why you came here, isn't it?
- That's all I care about.
To get safely home with my children.
I can forge his signature perfectly.
I'll date it today.
Once she's on her way home, she can't tell the police... her husband died four months ago and betray us, can she?
Would you like to witness it?
With pleasure.
You must tell everyone that you've seen Erik and he's well.
- Erik Van Ostamgen?
- Nora Van Ostamgen.
Van Ostamgen.
I won't be long.
Sims.
Remember this?
Yes, I remember. Drains.
- I wonder if it could be something else.
- What makes you say that?
Well, this is new cover. The same construction, but there's something on it.
- Where?
- To the left.
It looks like a midget aircraft.
Yes, it could be a very small plane.
Let us see what Kendall thinks.
It's the PM.
They're just putting him through.
I thought I should tell you at once that we've found out what the ski sites are.
They're not for rockets.
We think they're for a kind of flying bomb.
Altogether, we've destroyed a hundred of these ski sites up to now.
We're bombing them continuously.
The Americans by day, and we by night.
As soon as we knock them down, they put up new ones.
They're prefabricated. They can stick them together in no time at all.
What are you worried about?
Nothing happened when the invasion buildup was going on.
And I can think of no more tempting target.
Now we've landed in France... and we still haven't had any sign of your mythical secret weapon.
I believe that the reason we haven't seen them up to now... is because our efforts succeeded in delaying them.
But they could still do tremendous damage if they get them off the ground in numbers.
Is Hitler waiting to produce them at the peace conference?
Despite your opposition... which I'm sure is quite sincere,
I'm certain we've done the right thing.
Yes, hold on. It's Fighter Command.
Sandys.
I see.
Channel observation posts report that flying objects... with a tail of fire... are passing over Dover and heading towards London.
Speed over 400 miles an hour.
Over here.
- Get them first aid over there.
- Watch the pressure.
Come along. It's all right, it's all right.
- Breaking now. You have a go.
- Roger.
Missed the bastard.
Why not move the guns down here... stick them in a line from Beachy Head to Dover?
Then your fighters would be free to operate behind them over Kent and Sussex...
- up to the balloons in the suburbs.
- It's a good idea, I agree.
But it means moving a thousand guns,
20,000 personnel... and miles and miles of electric cable.
I must point out that it will leave London defenseless for several days.
In any case, what about the chiefs of staff?
They'll never agree.
Well, we'll ask them afterward, shall we?
There aren't quite as many over tonight.
Just as well, with a thousand guns on their way to the seaside...
Mind you, it's tomorrow I'm worried about.
If German Intelligence is up to the mark, they'll send everything they've got.
Yes, well, with luck, they'll only think about it tomorrow.
And the day after tomorrow, we'll be ready for them.
I hope so.
That's more like it.
Somebody is contacted me at last.
Good. V-2, gyroscope controls. Speed, 3000.
And they're testing a new one, long-range.
How long?
They call it the New York rocket.
All right, give me the kid, love.
I'll take him.
Come on. It's all right, son.
You'll be all right, come on.
- Steady that.
- All right.
Bring him this way. This way.
Come on, now. Got him now.
Get him to the stretcher over here.
- Bring him this way.
- Coming.
This morning, we have proof that the V-2 rockets have no launching sites.
They've learn by their mistakes.
For the flying bombs, they had to have elaborate ramps.
They built them fast, and we destroyed them almost as fast.
For the firing of the V-2, they've invented a huge trailer.
They can transport their rocket and launch it from the same vehicle.
The only hope of stopping them is if a plane happens to pass overhead... when the rocket is erected, just before firing.
That's a million to one chance.
Yea, and even then, it would hardly provide a target for attack... if the sites are mobile.
Ruite. So we've got to destroy them where they're made.
Very difficult.
The factory is been moved underground.
Perfectly camouflaged.
There's more to it than that.
I've got some men inside.
Apparently, the Germans are about to start testing a new rocket... with a much longer range.
So that even after we've liberated the occupied countries... they could still fire at us from the heart of Germany.
We'll have to lay on a full-scale raid.
Let your men know when it's going to be so they can try sabotage at the same time.
We've got to try everything.
Bombing and sabotage.
There's an air raid tomorrow night, 11:30.
They're after the long-range rocket.
Don't they know it's 80 feet down in solid rock?
No.
And they want us to pinpoint it for them.
- Can you open the launching-pit doors?
- No.
No, we always phone the Power House.
They pull the switch.
Have we got anybody in there?
No.
We'll have to get in and pull the switch ourselves.
You know the switch?
No. Can you find out?
I think so.
We still have to get in there.
My pass will get us past most guards.
As soon as he opens the door, we'll jump him and grab his gun.
Just like that?
Bit thin, isn't it?
Yeah.
Can you think of anything else?
No.
What time shall we meet?
Eleven twenty-five.
Assembly plant. Passage C.
Good morning.
Van Ostamgen.
Van Ordern, Van Osten, Van Ostamgen.
- Right. I've got the switch number.
- Good. Let's go.
Right. Door.
Curtis.
How long to target?
Two minutes, skipper.
Van Ostamgen...
or whatever your real name is, listen to me.
We've got your friend here.
I'm going to give you one minute to come out...
or he'll be shot. Do you understand? Killed.
Now, I'm giving you exactly one minute from... now.
Can you see anything?
They're supposed to show us a light.
Can't see a bloody thing.
Thirty seconds.
Fifteen.
Ten seconds.
Switch R9.
R9.
Halt.
Still can't see anything.
How about you?
No. Nothing, skipper.
What's that?
- Where?
- A bit to starboard.
That's it. That's the target.
Stand by.
Right. Right.
Steady.
I've been reading your final report on Operation Crossbow.
- It was a vital task and a job well done.
- Thank you.
But we owe so much to the bravery of our agents, many of whose names...
- will never be known.
- Yes, and to the RAF.
If Hitler's rocket plans hadn't been totally upset by our raid on Peenemünde...
London would've been devastated.
But it's time we began to think about reconstruction... and I want you to be minister of works.
With thousands of buildings destroyed by bombs and rockets, it's an enormous task.
Let us start at once.
Let us clear the rubble and lay the bricks...
and let us do so in the firm conviction that we are building for the future...
that never again shall we have to embark upon such a conflict...
as we recently endured.
I solemnly believe that the price of such a folly...
would be far more than mankind could afford to pay.
THE LITTLE SOLDIER
For me, the time for action is past.
I'm older now.
The time for reflection begins.
Lake Leman divides the city of Geneva in two.
Three days ago... secret agents from several countries openly engaged in mortal combat here on neutral territory.
Eight hundred dollars.
I suddenly thought of myself:
Bruno Forestier... reporter for the French News Agency... looking for anything important around here.
MORE TERRORIST ATTACKS
IN GENEVA
GENEVA PROFESSOR DIES
FOLLOWING ATTACK
They're at it again. Shit!
They're completely crazy!
Geneva, May 13, 1958.
What was it Aragon wrote?
'May without sorrow,
June stabbed in the heart.”
LOVE ONE ANOTHER
1 Peter 1:22
- Things okay, Mary-Lou?
- Someone called for you.
You said I was here?
Damn it! I said not to!
The dark-blue sky reminded me of that Klee painting.
“Where did you come from?
“Where are you? Where are you going?”
“Da dove? Dove? Verso dove?”
- What's going on, man?
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- A nice Paul Klee.
My date's nicer.
- What date?
- I asked you 10 take pictures of her!
What if I don't want 10?
Come on.
I'm going to the Brazilian consulate.
- Go tomorrow.
- I don't want to!
Girls like lots of chit-chat.
The Danish girl with Michel yesterday?
- You know her?
No, he told me about her.
I bet you'll want to lay her.
She has a mouth like Leslie Caron.
No, I only sleep with girls
I'm in love with.
Then I bet you'll fall in love in five minutes.
- How much?
- I don't know.
- If you want.
$50 says I don't fall for her.
The first time I met her... she looked right out of a play by Jean Giraudoux.
Veronica!
Kill a guy from behind with a gun or a knife - okay.
But not a bomb.
Killing a guy from a distance is a disgrace.
You know nothing about it.
What are you two talking about?
What are you talking about?
Lachenal, the art professor killed yesterday.
They planted a bomb in his car.
- Who did?
The French.
What do you know?
You don't know what you're talking about.
It gets on my nerves.
Students are all the same.
I know his daughter.
She comes to the skating rink.
You're right. It's awful.
Aw, shit!
What's wrong?
This is a real bore.
They thought I'd said “war.”
I said it was the same thing.
She stared at me once more.
I'll see you.
We can do the pictures tomorrow at 5:00.
Where are you going?
- It's a mystery.
- You really are mysterious.
Yes. I'm a secret agent.
Do like this with your hair.
Here's your $50.
Where are you going?
Is it important?
You never know what's important.
I was still very young and foolish.
Would it be nice weather?
Or rain? No telling.
Up to now my story has been simple: a guy with no ideals.
What about tomorrow?
I asked if he had a light.
I asked him again for a light.
Ever hear the one about intelligence?
No.
For 15 years... a tall tribe and a short tribe play soccer in the jungle every Thursday.
Without fail, the short guys win.
One day, the tall tribe's council of elders decides to send one of their men to look into it.
“Go and investigate.”
So their man goes to the short tribe and tells them to summon their elders.
“We've played you for 15 years, and you always win.
You have some kind of secret?”
The short chief replies,
“Yes, we have intelligence.”
“Intelligence? What's that?”
“It's simple.”
He calls for an anvil and a sledgehammer.
He puts his hand on the anvil and tells the guy...
“Hit it with the sledgehammer!”
“No, I couldn't?”
The chief insists.
“There's nothing to fear.”
So the guy swings, and the chief pulls his hand away.
He says, “That's intelligence.”
“Wonderful! Good-bye!”
“No, you're our guest.
Please stay.”
“But I must get back before I forget.”
“No, you're our guest.”
So he stays.
After 10 days of fruit and women, he escapes.
He hightails it home and shouts,
“Summon the council!”
So they do.
The tall chief arrives.
“Did you learn their secret?”
“Yes, they have intelligence!”
He's really exhausted.
“What is intelligence?”
“Bring me an anvil.”
“We don't have an anvil.”
“No anvil?
Do we have a sledgehammer?”
“Yes.”
So they bring the sledgehammer.
So he tells the chief,
“Take the sledgehammer... and hit right here.”
“The Acorn and the Pumpkin,” a poem by Jean de la Fontaine.
Sometimes I feel like I've wasted my time.
Veronica...
were her eyes Velazquez-gray or Renoir-gray?
Alfred Latouche or his brother Etienne usually met me.
But they'd been caught.
Where's that leave me?
Then there were clashes with the CRS, who used tear-gas grenades.
Paratroopers joined in around 8:00 p.m.
That's the latest information from Algiers...
- Hello, Jacques.
- Hello, Bruno.
Go on, get in.
The antiterrorist commando
I belonged to was financed by an ex-Poujadist legislator who'd enjoyed some glory under Vichy.
How are you?
- You know Jacques?
- How are you?
I didn't know the other guy.
- Is that him?
- No, the one in back.
- Who's that?
- If anyone asks, you don't know.
Good luck!
Go-betweens, bankers, car salesmen, paratroopers, rich daddy's boys - the secret war jumbled men and ideas together at an ever bloodier pace.
- Are we early?
- We're fine. It's ten to 5:00.
If his car's there, stop by the fountain
where I showed you yesterday.
It's a '57 Nash convertible.
Well, Bruno?
- What?
What are you thinking about?
I don't know.
You have to know.
What were you going to say?
- Nothing.
Go on. Say it.
I changed my mind.
What's that book?
- Thomas the Imposter.
- Jean Cocteau?
Listen to the end.
It's wonderful.
“William flew, leapt, and ran like a hare.
Not hearing the shots, he stopped... and turned around, out of breath.
Then he felt a sharp jab in the chest. He fell.
He became deaf and blind.
'A bullet,” he thought.
Vm lost... unless I pretend to be dead.
But with him, fiction and reality were one.
William Thomas was dead.”
Great stuff.
Yeah, I'd like to die like that.
Don't worry.
You may get the chance soon.
What's with you?
Why?
Because you're a pain in the ass, big boy.
We've been looking for you since Saturday.
What were you doing in Annecy?
I was hoping to take
Veronica to Brazil.
I'm opening an art gallery.
I went there to buy three small Modiglianis.
You're lucky I don't ask with what money.
I'll pay it back. I'll sell them for seven million in Geneva.
We're here.
“Oh month of flowers and metamorphosis
I'll never forget the lilacs or the roses”
Why was I obsessed with that poem?
Turn the radio down.
You know that speaker?
- Arthur Palivoda of Radio Geneva?
- That's right.
There he is.
I quickly guessed they suspected me of being a double agent.
Let's go.
...a war of Arabs against Europeans, not Muslims against Christians.
You are at this moment dying of that illusion...
To think his show is called
“A Neutral Voice Speaks”!
That kills me.
You ever seen Palivoda, Bruno?
- Before today?
- Yes.
No.
- Get a look as we drive by.
- Why?
You have to kill him.
Why me again?
I got the order from Paris.
Just passing it on.
Jacques said it was real easy.
Just drive up alongside him like now... and fire when you're across from him.
Roll up the window!
- They're sure he works for the rebels?
- Of course.
I'm surprised. He's Swiss.
I'm not surprised.
It's less dangerous... to talk on the radio than to fight.
The Swiss have never been very courageous.
Just look how they drive.
They even signal to pass a cyclist.
It's infuriating!
To the hotel?
- No.
Later. The office.
- Is Latouche really dead?
Yes. They found him in his bathtub Tuesday at the Bristol Hotel with his tongue cut out and his eyelids ripped out.
There was blood everywhere.
Scared, are you?
You think I enjoy shooting people?
You can borrow the Peugeot.
It hasn't got Geneva plates.
You'll be less conspicuous.
Too dangerous.
Why me? Why not Paul?
- Because you...
I don't want to kill him.
- Why?
- I don't know.
A moment ago, sure.
But not now.
I don't know why.
I suddenly feel like it would be a defeat.
That's not important.
It is.
Victory's better than defeat.
The Spanish Republicans' salute.
It's beautiful, because it's not wicked, like this.
It's proud.
Did you know Benjamin Constant and Madame de Stag) lived there?
We chose you precisely to see if you were afraid.
I'm not afraid in the least.
You're crazy.
I just don't feel like it.
I won't do it.
We'll make you.
No, you won't.
Even a soldier can't be forced to kill.
What's gotten into you?
It's easy.
The Swiss know you're a deserter.
The slightest slip and they'll send you back to France.
[ Mustn't look down.
Then it's a court martial.
No one will save you this time.
Kill him or it'll be your turn.
Ask Jacques.
Then kill me.
Twenty-six is awfully young to die, little prince.
If they force me, I'll kill Palivoda, but not before.
That's what I told them.
I'll get out here. So long.
So I can count on you?
No, because I'm a pain in the ass.
That's not funny.
Jacques!
What do we do?
I felt the important thing in life was not to be defeated.
After that,
I phoned the Brazilian consulate about visas for a Frenchman and a Russian girl.
They were already closed.
I'll call again tomorrow.
I drove around. The city silhouetted against the starry night sky ls always very moving, both hard-edged and mysterious, in the image of mankind and what lies beyond mankind.
She pretended not to see me,
and I didn't stop. I was scared.
Besides, I'll see her tomorrow.
Later I noticed a car following me.
It took some doing to lose them.
Now... “All is still.
The enemy in the shadows rests.”
Summer wasn't far off. yet to me it felt like winter.
Paul, what are you doing here?
Her place wasn't bad.
It's practically empty.
I just moved in.
No, it's not bad.
Yesterday I wasn't with you, but I was thinking of you.
Today I'm with you and I'm thinking of something else.
Is this all you brought?
Yes.
- I thought you'd need lights and -
- No.
This is very fast film.
It's Agfa Record.
When you photograph a face - look at me - you photograph the soul behind it.
She had rings under her eyes.
Her eyes were Velazquez-gray.
- Where should I stand?
- Anywhere.
It doesn't matter.
Do what you like, and I'll shoot.
I'll ask you questions and you answer.
Easier that way.
You look scared. Why?
- Yes, I am.
You needn't be.
It's like I'm being questioned by the police.
She was less pretty than the day before.
Yes, a little.
Photography is truth... and cinema is truth
24 times a second.
Your name's Veronica what?
She didn't answer right away.
Veronica Dreyer.
You're Finnish - no, Danish.
No, I'm Russian... but born in Copenhagen.
Are you here in Geneva with your parents?
No, I'm all alone.
A foreign woman speaking French is always lovely.
Where are your parents?
They were shot during the war.
Really? By whom?
None of your business.
The Germans?
The Russians, then?
It's none of your business.
Why won't you tell me?
Just because.
Lift your hair up.
Veronica's charm was all her own: the curve of her shoulders... the worry in her eyes... the secret in her smile.
It's funny.
My father was shot too... during Liberation.
He was a friend of Drieu La Rochelle.
Move around.
Don't just stand there.
What should I do?
Whatever you want.
Light a cigarette.
Take a shower.
- Yeah, right.
- Why not?
She turned around abruptly.
You never shower?
I said whatever came into my head.
I'd like to get pictures of you showering.
You really don't want to?
- No.
- Why?
Because I think it's stupid.
Afraid of me seeing your body?
What were you going to say?
What are you thinking right now?
Move around a bit.
Do you ever think about death?
She gave me an anguished look,
and I suddenly had the extraordinary feeling
that I was photographing Death.
Then everything was normal again.
Have lots of guys been chasing you here in Geneva?
Yes. Why?
Just asking.
I'm sure you've posed in a bathing suit before.
No, never.
Now what are you thinking?
Are you thinking about me?
Yes.
What do you think of me?
Why don't you answer?
You seem scared.
Pull your hair back.
Hold that album sleeve in front of your face.
Do you believe in freedom?
No.
Would you be afraid to kill someone?
You're getting on my nerves!
- Any brothers and sisters?
- One brother.
- What's he do?
- He's in Moscow.
He's a student at the Stanislavsky Theater.
- Russians are always studying.
- What?
Russians are always studying.
Funny, you wanting to be an actress.
She lit a cigarette and asked why.
Why?
I think actors are stupid.
I despise them.
Tell them to laugh, and they laugh.
Tell them to cry, they cry.
Tell them to crawl, they do it.
I find that grotesque.
I don't see why.
I don't know.
They're not free.
- Look.
- What?
An Actor.
Yes, it's a Klee.
You like Paul Klee?
Yes.
What's important isn't how others see you... but how you see yourself.
- Did Klee say that?
- No, I did.
Got any records?
Yes. What would you like?
Bach?
No, it's too late.
Bach's for 8:00 in the morning.
A Brandenburg Concerto at 8:00 a.m. is wonderful.
Mozart? Beethoven?
Too early.
Mozart's for 8:00 at night.
Beethoven's music is very deep.
Beethoven's for midnight.
No, what we need is some Haydn.
Good old Joseph Haydn.
What are you thinking about?
Same thing as you.
You know what a doodle test is?
No.
A bit of drawing that reveals a person's personality.
I'll draw one for you.
I used this often with women.
They love it when you call them 'little girl” and suggest children's games.
Do anything you want to it.
Just finish the drawing.
Did Hughes tell you about our bet the other day?
- When you gave him $507?
- Yes.
You don't know why I gave him $507?
You do one too.
I'd like to know your thoughts.
Okay.
I'll show you.
I LOVE YOU
Jacques and Paul were parked in front of the Century.
I pretended not to see them.
Veronica and I talked about art.
She said van Gogh was a lesser painter than Gauguin, which is wrong, of course.
Who's the girl?
A cover girl.
Are you staying with me or not?
I don't know.
I don't know, Bruno.
Coming out of Club 58... you remember?
You took my arm.
Shouldn't I have?
- No.
- Why not?
Because it made me want to sleep with you.
Now you seem to be saying that's impossible.
You shouldn't offer your arm to men you don't want to be with.
Good-bye.
- Goon.
- You think it'll work?
Yeah, Bruno's a coward.
Paul took my car.
He and Jacques made good on their threats
and staged a scene to set the Swiss police after me.
Go on!
Go on!
My Pontiac!
You bastard!
Stop him! Police!
It's a German song.
Shall I translate it for you?
“O radiant dawn... you announce my early death.
Soon the trumpets will sound... and then...
I'll have to leave this beautiful life behind.”
7:00 a.m.
Snapshots taken around the world pass before me like in a bad dream:
Panama...
Home...
Alexandria...
Budapest...
Paris.
The bad dream continues.
“We went off to war like schoolboys to school.”
So began one of Bernanos's novels.
[I remember the title:
Humiliated Children.
FEAR DESTROYED THIS COUPLE
I relit my cigarette.
This morning I feel like one of those schoolboys. Why?
Perhaps asking questions ls more important than coming up with answers.
Give me a puff.
I'm hungry.
I had a nightmare.
I dreamed I went to the theater... and ran into the devil at intermission.
He was very well-dressed.
It really was the devil... with hairy legs and horns.
He was wounded in the thigh, a great red gash.
It was awful.
Who is it?
Where are you going?
Go back to sleep.
God, she was beautiful.
I wondered if she was only pretending to sleep.
Police.
Bruno Forestier?
- Yes. What's going on?
- Get your coat and come with me.
- I haven't done anything.
Don't play games with us.
You're wanted in France.
I deserted, but my papers here are in order.
Just put on your coat.
We'll see about that.
All right.
“Hit-and-run is a serious offense,” the inspector said.
“If charges are filed, you'll be expelled from Geneva, and, as a deserter, turned over to French authorities.”
As I knew nothing yet,
I denied everything.
Look there.
Sir...
Please.
You shouldn't have fled just because you're French.
I wasn't there.
He's French? Those bastards think they can do anything!
Were you there or not?
Never look down with the cops.
- You don't know?
- What an ass I was! Too late.
- This gentleman has witnesses.
- In that car.
I caught on too late.
The crap had begun for my not killing Palivoda.
Should I go back to my beat?
I'd lost my first major battle.
You want to press charges?
A great feeling of loneliness flooded over me.
But maybe remorse is the beginning of freedom.
- Where'd you go?
- To get cigarettes.
Did you take a bath?
- I didn't feel like it.
A woman's shoulders are very pretty and noble.
- You're acting strange.
- Yes, I've become a coward.
What?
I've become a coward.
It's strange.
When I look at my own face...
its like it doesn't match who I feel I am from inside.
In your opinion... what's more important, the inside or the outside?
It was a beautiful object... black, mysterious, incorruptible.
It's what my friend Raoul Coulara, the most brilliant of French cameraman, called...
'the law of the greatest fuckup.”
Every time I was ready to fire, some unexpected event stopped me.
And every time the coast was clear, with no witnesses,
I hesitated a few seconds... and once again it was too late.
If you're not a professional, it's hard to keep trying.
It's like trying again after a failed suicide attempt.
After a while I'd had enough.
I don't think it was the business of killing someone.
I'd done that before, though not often.
And I've always felt conscientious objectors were Just posers.
So what was it, big boy?
Just that you do some things at certain moments in your life and not at others.
Paul's a busy beaver, always on the go.
Being lazy,
I admire him and Jacques.
They never lack for ideas.
Real secret agents.
Nothing fazed them, not even a stupid idea... like having me kill Palivoda in front of crowds of people.
Accused by friends of being a traitor, eliminating an enemy was my only way out.
As [ drew my revolver,
I felt Paul aiming his at me.
How's your Danish girl?
Shit! They're getting away.
You won't shoot him.
It proves you work for them.
Me? Absolutely not.
Then what are you daydreaming about?
I've had enough. Go to hell.
Pursued by the French and unmasked by the Arabs,
I was doubly screwed.
Yes.
No, I'm going to take a bath.
Later, at Club 58, if you want.
Why?
I can't stay in Geneva.
I'm off to Zurich tomorrow.
I'm catching a plane to Brazil.
Veronica... why don't you say something?
I don't know what to say.
Lie to me.
Say you're not sad I'm leaving.
I'm not sad you're leaving.
I'm not in love with you.
I won't join you in Brazil.
I don't send you a big kiss.
I packed quickly and left for Zurich.
It was no longer the lights of Geneva but those of Rio.
I wondered if I was happy to feel free or free to feel happy.
Jacques?
No, this is Paul.
It's Bruno.
Better be careful, big boy.
That's right.
Tragedy today is politics.
No, Napoleon said that, not me.
Listen, Bruno - Let me talk!
I'm just calling to say your car's outside the Century.
My head hit the ground so hard
I blacked out.
I forgot to count the stairs to know what floor we were on.
Mr. Palivoda called for you.
He'll be at the airport at 10:00 a.m.
The consulate called...
Who were you calling at the garage?
- Are you going to torture me?
- You're scared.
- Of course I am.
- His passport.
Who issued this?
The French consulate here?
I'm remembering an Arab joke.
A guy picks up the phone and says, 'All67”
The other guy says, “No, it's Ali.”
- Strip him?
- Yeah.
If I shouted, they'd knock me out again.
Better to just take It.
- Who's this?
- I don't know.
- And this guy?
- Never seen him before.
Jacques Aurélien Mercier.
Former volunteer in Indochina.
We lost track of him during the piastre smuggling affair.
We picked up his trail in Rotterdam in '57 when the freighter Aramis was blown up... and again in '59 in Frankfurt, when Professor Dietrich was assassinated, and now here in Geneva.
It's him you were calling.
What number did you dial?
What number?
“I'm not opposed to telling you, but I don't feel like it.”
That's what I told them.
They asked me to work for them but wouldn't give me an advance,
so I told them to go to hell.
This guy, Alfred Latouche, refused to talk too.
And here's his brother Etienne.
Want us to do the same to you?
Poor Etienne must have lowered his head to protect his throat,
So the razor caught him right across the chin.
I hope you're brave.
This is gonna be tough.
I don't know if I'm brave... but I'll soon find out.
Take him in the bathroom.
Stand up!
“You slip ever further from among the living.
They'll soon strike you from their lists.
It's the only way to share the privilege of the dead.
What privilege?
To never die again.”
Torture is monotonous and sad.
It's hard to talk about It, so I'll say very little.
What number were you calling?
You're scared.
Why are you doing this?
Sometimes you must have the strength to clear a path... with a dagger.
“One spark can set the entire plain ablaze.”
I'd seen people tortured before in Budapest.
I had wondered then if I'd be able to bear it.
Now my moment had come.
The faucets.
I know that others endured worse, but I've never encountered martyred comrades in the hallways or heard screaming through the walls, so [ can't discuss it
I only know
I forced myself not to cry out
and that I soon stopped struggling.
Quick, think of anything to avoid the pain.
The sea, the beach, the sun.
Think so fast you're no longer thinking of anything.
Quick, write to Veronica!
Don't think about the pain.
Quick! Write faster.
Beat the pain with speed.
A letter even more beautiful than the one from Robert Desnos to his wife.
Veronica...
What happened?
You passed out.
Did I cry?
Why do you ask?
What's going on?
It's funny.
He's asking if he cried.
I wonder why he wants to know.
Because it's important.
Between torture sessions, we talked serious politics.
They said it was stupid to hold out when I had no ideals.
And like all self-respecting revolutionaries, they tried to indoctrinate me.
The French use torture too.
“Prisoners waited in darkness either for prison or for an attempt to escape - that is to say, a hail of bullets in the back.”
Djamilla's fiance... died that way.
There's no doubt that force is superior to intelligence.
You have to be strong, it's true - but to fight force.
Again I thought of other things - vacation, a bicycle ride
'In the shadow of young girls in flower.”
Why not tell them the phone number?
I can't even say.
Out of dignity?
I don't know what that means anymore.
The phone number.
When I was worn down,
I cried out for help,
but I didn't realize I was so weak
that I couldn't be heard two yards away.
I thought I was shouting when I was only whispering.
I wondered why he put those shirts on the edge of the tub.
Palivoda?
It's Cavalier F4.
Air can't penetrate cloth that's fully saturated with water,
so it's impossible to breathe.
“The revolutionary thrust is like a ship... already visible on the far-off horizon.
It's like the disc of the sun whose burning rays... already pierce the darkness.
It's like a child... who'll soon see the light of day.”
Did he tell you the phone number?
No, nothing yet.
But we'll get something out of him with this.
No.
Mustn't leave any marks.
Why kill myself?
I should have just given them the information.
That's how the French got such a bad reputation.
I took the blade in my teeth
because I couldn't manage with my hands.
For better or worse, they came in before I succeeded.
Then... then came the electricity.
I recognized the guy who brought the equipment.
Now I remember:
He gave Veronica a little dog the first time she and I met.
Is it working this time?
Shock treatment is very simple.
They attach electrodes [to your body and turn on the current.
You don't die from it, but it breaks you down.
Remember what Lenin said:
“In the revolution, there are no easy tasks, no easy ways of fighting.
This political line must be followed without exception.
The victory of the revolution is certain.
It will triumph.”
They said to get dressed.
I couldn't take any more.
I suddenly thought of jumping out the window.
If it was the second floor, great.
If not...
What are you thinking about?
Pierre Brossolette.
I heard how he died.
It was in 43 at Gestapo headquarters.
He'd been tortured for two months.
They'd put his eyes out.
One day they led him to a room to question him again.
He'd suffered so much he knew he'd crack.
He sensed there was a window in the room.
So as they questioned him... he edged toward it... bit by bit... feeling his way.
The moment he touched the glass... he hurled himself through it.
I was lucky.
It was the second floor.
I holed up at Veronica's.
She told me she worked for the Arabs,
but that she would flee to Brazil with me.
Excuse me.
You still haven't seen our friend Forestier, miss?
No.
All right. Thanks.
I'm sure he's up there.
- Why? She'd tell us.
I don't trust her.
Why did you prefer to die rather than talk?
They'd have killed me anyway.
Oh, I don't know.
Lucky for me it was just the second floor.
You look better without makeup.
I watched her sit down.
I love the way she lights a cigarette.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
Why's this place empty?
Because I was leaving.
I was going away.
We didn't dare look in each other's eyes.
There are no marks.
No, just some burns here.
They were very careful.
With the U.N. considering the Algerian question,
Cairo probably gave them orders.
No one's come around asking where I was?
Yes, just as I came in.
I ran into your friends again.
What friends?
They came around yesterday too... from the French consulate.
The thin one looks like an elevator boy, and the other one looks like a gigolo.
Who are they?
It was Paul and Jacques.
I'm sure of it.
We're the ones who killed Lachenal.
Why did she turn her back?
I think that was stupid.
Palivoda, yes... but Lachenal had done nothing.
He felt the Algerian war was unjust.
But that's all.
Yeah. I don't know.
You always say that.
Of course I'm listening.
Mohamed Messousa...
16 Chemin Chapelit.
Where can I call you?
Why not?
Okay, big boy. You call us.
I gave them the Arabs' address for two diplomatic passports.
Tell the photographer to go have a look.
You have anything in your files on a girl named...
Veronica Dreyer.
You'll call me back?
Veronica Dreyer.
And what about me?
Why do you work with the FLN?
Out of political conviction?
It's hard to say.
Bit by bit...
But it doesn't worry me.
Anyway, I could see that the French were wrong.
The other side has an ideal... but the French don't.
It's very important to have an ideal.
Fighting the Germans... the French had an ideal.
But with the Algerians they don't.
They'll lose the war.
You think so? I don't.
Yes, they will.
Funny how everyone hates the French today.
I'm very proud to be French.
But I'm also against nationalism.
One defends ideas, not territories.
I love France because I love Joachim du Bellay... and Louis Aragon.
I love Germany because I love Beethoven.
I don't love Barcelona because of Spain.
I love Spain because a city like Barcelona exists, and America because I love American cars.
I don't like Arabs because I don't like the desert or Colonel Lawrence, and I like the Mediterranean and Albert Camus even less.
No, I like Brittany...
and I hate the south.
The light in Brittany is very soft, not like in the south.
Besides, Arabs are lazy.
But I have nothing against them.
Or the Chinese.
No, I'd like to ignore them.
But it's terrible today.
If you just calmly do nothing... you get hell precisely for doing nothing.
So we do things without conviction.
And it's a pity to wage war without conviction.
Why is the Vatican anticommunist?
Funny guy, the pope.
They believe the same thing.
All men are brothers.
I'm not the brother of a streetcar driver in Peking or San Francisco.
I couldn't care less about him.
Maybe one day...
I'll want to know how he's doing.
But he's not automatically my brother or my friend... just because he has eyes and ears like me.
And vice versa.
Look at certain objects.
Some you like, some you don't.
Or colors.
For example, I hate dark red.
It's the same with people.
You can't be forced to love them all.
Or else, as Guitry said, “You don't know where to commit your heart.”
She looked at me.
In my opinion, women should never pass 25.
Men grow more attractive as they age, but not women.
I think it's extraordinarily unfair for a woman to age.
And I've noticed something strange.
When women commit suicide, they always leap somewhere - under a train or out a window.
They're so afraid they'll get cold feet that they hurl themselves forward.
That way there's no turning back.
Men never do that.
Men rarely throw themselves under the subway.
Women rarely slit their wrists.
I find it brave of them, but cowardly too.
I don't know.
Life sides with women... but death sides with men.
Death is what's important.
Van Gogh said we'll ride upon death to reach another star.
There's something more important than having an ideal... but what?
Something more important than not being defeated.
I'd like to know exactly what it is.
In school I used to admire the word “pathos.”
Now I despise Wt.
“Taciturn.”
There's a beautiful word, like “Guillaume.”
I'm lost unless I pretend to be lost.
Because I figure everyone has an ideal... so there's something more important that everyone's missing.
'M sure God doesn't have an ideal.
There's a very beautiful quote.
Who said it?
I think it was Lenin.
“Ethics are the aesthetics of the future.”
I think that's very beautiful and very moving.
It reconciles the right and the left.
What do people on the right and left think?
What's the point of revolution today?
The right wins and then applies leftist policies, and the other way around.
I win or lose, but I fight alone.
Around 1930, young people had a revolution.
For example, Malraux,
Drieu La Rochelle, Aragon.
Now we have nothing.
They had the Spanish Civil War.
We don't even have our own war.
Apart from ourselves... our own faces and voices, we have nothing.
But maybe that's the important thing: to come to recognize the sound of your own voice and the shape of your own face.
From inside it's like this...
but when I look at it, it's like this.
So people look at me but don't know what I'm thinking... and they'll never know.
Right this moment: a forest in Germany.
A bicycle ride.
That's gone now.
Now... the terrace of a café in Barcelona.
Now... that's gone.
I try to trap my own thoughts.
And speech - where does speech come from?
Maybe people talk on and on like gold prospectors... to find the truth.
But instead of dredging in a river, they dredge among their own thoughts.
They eliminate all the words of no value... and end up finding just one.
But a single word by itself... is already silence.
Why do you love me?
I don't know.
Because I'm crazy.
Who are you calling?
French News Agency.
Please hold.
It's Bruno Forestier.
Put him through.
Hello? Who's this?
Who is it?
It's Bruno.
Who is it?
What's going on?
I don't know.
Bruno Forestier!
Wrong address?
What do you mean?
Maybe they got suspicious and moved out.
Paul and I just went there.
There's no Mohamed Messousa at that address.
So no passports for me and Veronica
unless I agree to kill Palivoda.
Okay. Come over now.
You're brilliant.
Thanks. Good work.
Okay. See you next week.
You were right, Paul.
A girl all alone in life is either a whore or an informer.
She must know the Arabs' new address.
Let's go.
Lock yourself in.
You never know with them.
Do they know you were tortured?
Yes.
I'm happy.
The police found my Chevrolet on a Swiss highway.
- When will you be back?
- I have 10 find Palivoda.
Maybe tonight or tomorrow.
That's a cute dress.
It was a present.
From the guy who gave you the little dog when we met?
Did you sleep with him?
He's been chasing me for ages.
It's not important.
Yes, it is.
Hasta luego.
See you soon.
Who is it?
It's Bruno.
Who's there? ls that you, Bruno?
Then everything happened quickly, and what seemed very complex played out very simply.
While I went to meet them, the French shut Veronica away in a lakeside villa and tortured her badly
to get the Arabs' new address.
But I didn't know that yet.
Jacques only said he was holding her hostage, and I'd get her and the passports once I'd killed Palivoda.
Sometimes you must have the strength to clear a path... with a dagger.
It was after killing Palivoda that I learned Veronica was dead.
I had no choice but to learn not to be bitter.
I was just glad I still had so much time ahead of me.
{5347}{5404}Come on.|We're due in court in 20 minutes.
{5406}{5479}- Our biggest case in two months.|- Almost our only case.
{5528}{5550}Come on.
{5759}{5789}Come on.
{5794}{5866}- What's the matter?|- We're being followed, don't look around.
{5869}{5930}- Great!|- In here... Hurry.
{6133}{6165}Who was it?
{6193}{6267}- Some amateur.|- Maybe a process server.
{6269}{6322}Or a relative trying to make a touch.
{6338}{6407}I promised Emma|I'm not playing Santa Claus anymore.
{6411}{6446}Col. Marcus?
{6448}{6483}Merry Christmas.
{6485}{6575}My name is Safir,|and my business is private.
{6586}{6638}Bert Harrison, my law partner.
{6642}{6722}Mr. Safir, who conducts|his private business in Macy's window.
{6731}{6780}Maj. Safir of the Haganah...
{6793}{6870}...the underground army|of the provisional government in Palestine.
{6877}{6931}I thought it best not to be seen|at your office.
{6938}{7019}- Are you sure you want to talk to me?|- Absolutely.
{7054}{7145}Please listen. I represent|the world's youngest, worst-trained...
{7146}{7200}...least-equipped|and most outnumbered army.
{7202}{7265}On May 15, the British will withdraw.
{7278}{7326}We will announce our independence and...
{7328}{7405}Six nations have promised|to drive you into the sea.
{7406}{7449}Yes, I read the newspapers.
{7458}{7508}Have you read their exact words?
{7510}{7545}King Ibn Saud:
{7555}{7592}"There are 50 million Arabs.
{7594}{7667}"What does it matter|if we lose 10 million to kill all the Jews?
{7669}{7711}"The price is worth it. "
{7714}{7753}The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem:
{7754}{7821}"I declare a holy war.|Murder them. Murder them all. "
{7862}{7906}We are going to fight.
{7908}{7959}There's no other place for us to go.
{7969}{8067}We won't fight to the last man.|We're prepared to fight to the last child.
{8090}{8172}Our children don't believe in Santa Claus,|not anymore.
{8198}{8301}We need, immediately,|an experienced military adviser.
{8325}{8403}We've come to you because,|frankly, no one else wants the job.
{8525}{8602}At least you're an honest man|but I've just done a war and a half.
{8604}{8652}I promised the next war to my wife.
{8669}{8762}I think if I leave home once more,|I'll find my pajamas on the front porch.
{8810}{8893}Would you give up everything you love|to fight an insane war...
{8895}{8972}...for a country that'll get|its brains blown out in a few weeks?
{8980}{9012}If it were my country.
{9038}{9114}Maybe it's yours, but it isn't mine.
{9126}{9157}But you're a Jew.
{9202}{9284}I'm an American, Major.|That's my religion.
{9285}{9349}The last time I was in temple,|I was 13 years old.
{9354}{9430}I made a speech and got 42 fountain pens.|I don't have to go again.
{9432}{9509}I've got enough fountain pens.|Come on. We're a little late.
{9525}{9560}Here you are.
{9566}{9628}Colonel, I'm asking you, as an American.
{9630}{9693}What do you say in your schools|when you salute your flag?
{9695}{9764}"Liberty and justice for all"?|Is it only for all of you?
{9765}{9822}Don't give me history lessons!
{9871}{9937}Six million of our people|have recently been murdered.
{9956}{10007}Would you like us to try for seven?
{10297}{10325}Hi!
{10354}{10405}My name's Emma. What's yours?
{10424}{10457}Santa Claus.
{10486}{10552}- Why are you still up?|- I worry better when I'm awake.
{10642}{10673}Thank you.
{10743}{10789}What's my other surprise?
{10844}{10913}I know I'm breaking a promise to you,|but...
{10932}{10992}...I'm leaving for Palestine next month.
{11016}{11048}Palestine?
{11070}{11095}Yeah.
{11101}{11169}Military adviser to the underground forces.
{11192}{11228}But why there and why you?
{11277}{11352}I happen to know a great deal|about the business of killing...
{11354}{11465}...and they've been killed by experts.|Somebody's got to help them fight back.
{11502}{11548}I guess I'm proud of you...
{11576}{11641}...but I'm so damn tired|of being proud of you.
{11698}{11751}Believe me, Emma, I|tried to get out of it...
{11753}{11811}...but I couldn't turn this one down.
{11821}{11865}Not these people. Not now, when they...
{11867}{11907}Be honest, darling.
{11916}{11957}At least be honest.
{11972}{12028}You've been out of uniform six months.
{12038}{12129}If they hadn't come looking for you,|you'd have started your own war.
{12234}{12264}You have to admit...
{12276}{12369}...I found a war in a country|that's pretty hard for you to knock.
{12378}{12476}Wait till I get my hands on|whoever's running the world.
{12483}{12530}I thought it was your mother.
{12586}{12653}Don't you think I know|what's going to happen in Palestine?
{12687}{12736}The end of the world, Mickey.
{12745}{12792}They don't stand a chance.
{12809}{12865}They'll be dying by the thousands, and...
{12885}{12930}And you right with them.
{12950}{12996}What makes it so terrible...
{13029}{13073}...is that's what you want.
{13092}{13118}Not me.
{13155}{13182}That.
{13269}{13296}Emma.
{13365}{13398}Are you crying?
{13449}{13484}You never cry.
{13618}{13660}I'm all right now.
{13694}{13796}I just had the awful feeling|this had all happened before somewhere.
{13834}{13901}That nightclub in Washington|during the war...
{13934}{13993}I knew then you were never coming back...
{14003}{14046}...just as I know it now.
{14073}{14138}And maybe it's the same|"not coming back. "
{14162}{14204}Maybe it's all one.
{14232}{14273}Maybe this is the time.
{14314}{14381}{Y:i}It was a nolsy war, that one.
{14386}{14433}{Y:i}Everyone danced a lot...
{14439}{14479}{Y:i}...and drank a lot...
{14492}{14545}{Y:i}...and loved a lot.
{14554}{14661}{Y:i}Some fellows even loved thelr own wlves.|They were the worst klnd.
{14679}{14764}If anything goes wrong,|I want you to know it was my own idea.
{14771}{14814}Nobody said I had to go.
{14816}{14869}That was their first mistake.
{15186}{15237}What did it this time, Mickey?
{15242}{15277}What really did it this time?
{15279}{15352}Did somebody say something|about your hiding behind a desk?
{15383}{15418}Something like that.
{15451}{15477}No.
{15490}{15587}I don't think that's all it is.|It happens too often.
{15599}{15634}Maybe it's...
{15648}{15681}Maybe it's...
{15705}{15757}What's that corny old verse?
{15776}{15828}"I have a rendezvous with Death
{15864}{15941}"At some disputed barricade
{15970}{16023}"When Spring...
{16025}{16058}"When Spring comes
{16060}{16114}"When Spring comes back
{16116}{16158}"With rustling shade
{16166}{16226}"And apple-blossoms fill the air"
{16264}{16352}At school we always said the fellow|who wrote that just had hay fever.
{16409}{16458}What's your sickness, Mickey?
{16558}{16597}When do you leave?
{16629}{16660}Tomorrow.
{16702}{16773}It wasn't Gen. Sherman|who said, "War is hell. "
{16775}{16817}It was Mrs. Sherman.
{16840}{16873}To Mrs. Sherman.
{16934}{16989}{Y:i}A few days later,|there was a note from you:
{16990}{17055}{Y:i}"Arrlved In England safely. Don't worry. "
{17073}{17111}{Y:i}Of course I dldn't worry.
{17113}{17187}{Y:i}I knew they wouldn't dare|start D-day wlthout you.
{17231}{17304}Gen. Randolph, Col. Marcus, sir.
{17321}{17414}The Pentagon has directed me to request|transportation across the channel, sir.
{17416}{17477}What does Washington|think I'm running out here, Marcus?
{17479}{17526}A taxicab service to France?
{17530}{17635}I agree with you, but I have orders|to reach the continent as soon as possible.
{17639}{17722}We're about to start an invasion.|Who ever issued such idiotic orders?
{17726}{17814}The handwriting's not so good,|but I think you'll recognize the signature.
{17845}{17875}I'II...
{17986}{18033}All right, Col. Marcus.
{18069}{18147}Some day next week|when the beachhead is secured...
{18160}{18234}...I shall inform Maj. Foley|at staff headquarters...
{18236}{18290}...that you are to be given VIP treatment...
{18299}{18357}- What I had in mind...|... boat trip to France...
{18359}{18429}...tour of the boys|on the fighting front and all of that.
{18435}{18470}Thank you, sir.
{18552}{18585}And, Marcus...
{18594}{18667}I remember you|from the Tennessee maneuvers.
{18682}{18799}Don't try to capture the opposing general.|This one's name is Rommel.
{18804}{18874}I don't think he'll make|the same mistake I did...
{18876}{18928}...and he isn't using blanks.
{19646}{19712}All right, men. Here we go.
{19791}{19821}Stand up.
{19876}{19905}Hook up.
{19985}{20025}Stand in the door.
{20062}{20097}Okay, let's go.
{20448}{20499}What's wrong, soldier?|Haven't you ever jumped?
{20501}{20523}No!
{21382}{21437}We're the first Allied|soldiers they've seen.
{21450}{21473}Pass the word:
{21475}{21571}Keep smiling and waving,|or they'll think the Nazis are back.
{21678}{21732}Welcome to our country.|What took you so long?
{21734}{21773}Stop the jeep. Stop it.
{21790}{21818}Back up.
{21820}{21872}Back it up. Back up.
{21982}{22020}Welcome, General.
{22033}{22121}Thank you, Col. Marcus, for the bouquet.
{22122}{22177}- What are you doing here?|- You saw my orders.
{22184}{22238}I certainly did, and I checked on them.
{22240}{22296}You were due back|at your desk a week ago.
{22297}{22379}I have four top-priority messages|from the Pentagon...
{22386}{22452}...to ship you home|on the first available transportation.
{22458}{22557}- How did you get into France?|- I jumped, sir, badly.
{22575}{22605}I'll bet.
{22629}{22700}Who gave you authority|to fly a combat mission?
{22707}{22824}I merely repeated your instructions, sir,|that I was to be given the VIP treatment.
{22869}{22943}Col. Marcus,|would you mind explaining to me...
{22945}{23022}...how you arrived in|this particular area...
{23024}{23072}...before the whole U. S. Army?
{23080}{23121}Yes, sir. We missed our drop zone.
{23123}{23183}We were up in the hills|when the Nazis pulled out.
{23205}{23252}We saw lots of guys die in the last week.
{23254}{23317}I thought there might be|something to drink in this town.
{23319}{23365}- Got your bellyful?|- No, sir.
{23369}{23452}We've been knocking off guys|who were making soap out of my relatives.
{23454}{23505}I don't ever want to get behind that desk...
{23531}{23591}Get down! He's on the clock. Get him.
{23805}{23841}Dirty Kraut.
{23905}{23944}Cut that man down.
{23946}{23994}- Capt. Billings!|- Yes, sir.
{23996}{24048}Clean out every building on this square.
{24057}{24084}Yes, sir.
{24095}{24132}That was close.
{24156}{24219}Did you find anything to drink around here?
{24264}{24305}I don't mean water.
{24313}{24354}I don't mean water.
{24516}{24547}You're right.
{24552}{24581}Thanks.
{24597}{24706}Arrest this officer, take him to the rear,|and put him on the first air transport out.
{24708}{24744}You must be joking.
{24746}{24829}If I were running the Pentagon,|I'd have you stood up against a wall.
{24849}{24901}Instead, they'll probably|pin a medal on you.
{24912}{24973}Have you ever heard|of the word "discipline"?
{24980}{25075}A staff officer acting like a kid|playing cowboys and Indians...
{25077}{25148}...is an example that might cost us|a few thousand lives.
{25162}{25225}What are you trying to prove, Marcus?
{25291}{25333}I wish to hell I knew, sir.
{25341}{25392}{Y:i}I wlsh to hell I knew, slr.
{25435}{25481}{Y:i}I wlsh to hell I knew.
{25525}{25569}{Y:i}I wlsh to hell I knew.
{25837}{25865}Mickey.
{26161}{26190}Mickey.
{26205}{26252}Why don't we get a divorce?
{26274}{26300}What?
{26317}{26405}I don't want a divorce,|but a girl has to have some pride.
{26422}{26463}What are you talking about?
{26490}{26536}We haven't really had a marriage.
{26553}{26615}It's been more like|the world's longest affair.
{26624}{26689}So why not be sensible?|Just cut the whole thing.
{26692}{26773}We can just go to bed together|every time you pass through New York.
{26782}{26853}That's a great proposition|from your own wife!
{26879}{26914}Emma.
{26927}{26960}I told you...
{26987}{27042}...we're starting the marriage right now.
{27045}{27084}I'm staying here.
{27133}{27157}No.
{27165}{27200}You're going.
{27219}{27292}I have to send you off|to your flea-bitten war.
{27294}{27361}It gets you more excited than I do,|doesn't it?
{27363}{27464}- That's a hell of a thing to say right now.|- It's true.
{27537}{27614}If I tried to keep you here,|our marriage wouldn't have a prayer...
{27616}{27651}...if it still has one.
{27689}{27789}I'm not going to lock you in a cage|and let the relatives throw you peanuts.
{27833}{27866}The family hero...
{27889}{27988}And have you hate me for keeping you|from trying to get yourself killed.
{28013}{28055}I love you too much.
{28189}{28301}Someday, you're going to find|whatever it is you're looking for.
{28305}{28365}Then you're really going to come home.
{28482}{28557}Did you ever notice|we don't have any children?
{28601}{28630}Only me.
{28697}{28754}I'd like so much to have your child.
{28787}{28877}I was the only girl in Brooklyn|who didn't get pregnant during the war.
{28885}{28944}My mother kept the statistics.
{29041}{29101}What kind of a father would I make now?
{29142}{29230}- Maybe when everything's right...|- Everything's never going to be right...
{29244}{29277}...for anybody.
{29295}{29338}But they still have children...
{29374}{29412}...and I want yours.
{29425}{29451}Ours.
{29519}{29544}Now.
{29623}{29722}There's a chance, isn't there,|I might never have you again?
{30261}{30320}You always come barging|into the Pentagon...
{30321}{30375}...asking a question|on a life-or-death matter...
{30377}{30436}...to be answered in exactly two minutes.
{30442}{30501}I'd just be an adviser.|It's headquarters stuff.
{30502}{30594}You couldn't advise a taffy pull|without slugging somebody.
{30601}{30642}I know it's touchy.
{30677}{30748}What's our official policy|in the Middle East?
{30774}{30833}This afternoon or this morning?
{30840}{30934}There's good military reason for remaining|friendly with the Arab governments...
{30936}{30986}...and none for loaning a reserve officer...
{30988}{31062}...as military adviser|to a pipsqueak nation...
{31064}{31121}...that'll be blown off the map on May 15.
{31135}{31184}You can't put out all the fires.
{31200}{31241}Suppose I go as a private citizen?
{31243}{31324}Then don't involve the Army in any way.|Don't use your rank...
{31325}{31362}...or even your right name.
{31364}{31422}Is it all right with you|if I keep the same sex?
{31465}{31539}Colonel, I am not requesting you|not to go...
{31541}{31583}...I am ordering you not to go.
{31593}{31654}That's the best|damn reason I've heard yet for going.
{31766}{31873}You're going to get yourself killed someday|sticking your neck out.
{31887}{31927}I can hardly wait.
{31961}{31999}Thank you, General.
{32710}{32757}You sure this passport's okay?
{32759}{32812}It must be. You're the fourth one to use it.
{33030}{33097}- Mr. Michael Stone?|- Yes, sir.
{33101}{33157}For what purpose|are you entering Palestine?
{33159}{33189}Pleasure.
{33196}{33279}This is hardly a pleasant country just now.|You've chosen an odd time.
{33287}{33329}Some of us have odd pleasures.
{33351}{33399}Where will you be staying?
{33405}{33435}Tel Aviv...
{33446}{33473}...with relatives.
{33475}{33520}Somebody's supposed to be|meeting me here.
{33521}{33569}- Indeed?|- Michael!
{33570}{33641}Mike, it's so good to see you after so long.
{33722}{33777}I'm sorry. I'm very late. How are you?
{33779}{33813}How do I look?
{33815}{33886}Tired, like you've been making love|to all the girls in America.
{33889}{33936}It's good to be back.
{33992}{34045}Welcome to the promised land,|Col. Marcus.
{34086}{34118}Thank you.
{34351}{34399}If he knew, why didn't he stop me?
{34401}{34463}Some of the British are angels,|the rest are bastards.
{34465}{34520}You were lucky. Probably he's with us.
{34568}{34613}Is that a bus or a tank?
{34616}{34659}A little bit of each.
{34830}{34893}{Y:i}- Shalom, Yaakov.|- Shalom, Magda.
{34895}{34939}By the way, what's your name?
{34941}{34993}- Magda Simon.|- Magda.
{35001}{35087}You'll live at our apartment.|It's better if the British ask questions.
{35089}{35134}From now on, I'm your sister.
{35166}{35250}That's nice. What's the attitude on incest|in this country?
{35270}{35306}Very biblical.
{35379}{35489}Especially since I'm also married.|My husband is an officer in the Palmach...
{35510}{35559}...but you can try if you wish.
{35561}{35608}It makes life interesting.
{36137}{36185}{Y:i}- Shalom, Magda.|- Shalom, Rona.
{36754}{36780}Here.
{36806}{36846}This, there.
{36889}{36916}What'd she say?
{36918}{36979}Never mind. You wouldn't do it anyway.
{38811}{38854}Rona! Rona!
{38856}{38887}She's hit.
{38902}{38941}Give me a bandage.
{39060}{39150}I wrote the book on this gun, and I don't|like girls fighting my wars for me.
{39152}{39204}She's not fighting for you.|It isn't your war.
{39205}{39252}Why do you turn everything|into a meeting?
{39253}{39282}Look, I'm sorry.
{39284}{39345}You don't understand a word|I'm saying, but I'm sorry.
{39353}{39384}Go to hell!
{39752}{39824}- David, why do you people take this?|- What do you mean?
{39825}{39876}Send out some men|and wipe out that town!
{39878}{39964}- Battles aren't won from inside a bus.|- The British are still in control.
{39966}{40051}We're not even supposed to have|these guns. It's punishable by death.
{40053}{40107}Then at least die standing up.
{40130}{40168}Sometimes we do.
{40219}{40277}In the Negev,|Egyptian tanks, armor and artillery...
{40279}{40370}...are ready to roll across the border|against us. Number unknown.
{40392}{40468}In Jerusalem,|4,000 of the Grand Mufti's men...
{40475}{40518}...already brought the city under fire.
{40520}{40593}They're trying to close the road|that connects it with Tel Aviv.
{40607}{40666}Our convoys are being ambushed,|with terrible losses.
{40679}{40720}Somewhere in Jordan...
{40739}{40841}...the Arab Legion:|British-armed, British-officered.
{40845}{40898}The best-equipped|force in the Middle East...
{40900}{40941}...apart from my wife's family.
{40953}{41032}Since the United Nations|voted for partition...
{41034}{41089}...the British are leaving, slowly...
{41091}{41180}...turning over their fortified positions|to all the Arabs in this country...
{41189}{41222}...who've never loved us.
{41224}{41270}We're outnumbered 60-to-1...
{41282}{41356}Pardon me, 60-to-2, now that you're here.
{41367}{41438}What would the Pentagon|suggest we do, Mr. Stone?
{41448}{41508}Teach them to love you, fast.
{41585}{41621}Wait a minute.
{41651}{41732}Asher, you've told me everything,|except what I want to know:
{41733}{41798}The disposition of your own army,|the Haganah.
{41820}{41880}They have a mean disposition, Mr. Stone.
{41881}{41929}Certainly you must have heard that.
{41945}{41992}Don't you want to tell me?
{42011}{42076}I'm not quite sure|what you need that information for.
{42077}{42143}As I understand it,|you're a lawyer in the American army...
{42145}{42216}...judge advocate's office,|behind a desk, unless I'm mistaken.
{42311}{42395}Asher... Is that really your first name?|Asher?
{42397}{42437}Yes, that really is my first name.
{42453}{42509}Asher, take that chip off your shoulder.
{42511}{42548}If you know so much about me...
{42549}{42653}...you may know that I toured this entire|area with Gen. Marshall after the last war.
{42661}{42732}I know the Arab leaders hate each other|more than they hate you.
{42734}{42813}Their soldiers have nothing to die for|and don't trust each other.
{42827}{42899}If you people can pull together,|you have a fighting chance.
{42926}{43023}But it's going to take organization|and an operational plan of battle.
{43042}{43137}I happen to serve on the general staff|of the largest army in the Western world.
{43141}{43213}Whatever I learned behind that desk...
{43226}{43262}...might be useful to you.
{43290}{43349}Now, do you want me to go or stay?
{43405}{43448}I haven't unpacked my bags.
{43450}{43507}You must be hungry. It's nearly 3:00 a. m.
{43509}{43566}I'm sorry, vegetables and sour cream.
{43581}{43611}You see...
{43623}{43670}...most of our people are vegetarians.
{43672}{43728}They've seen too many slaughterhouses|of every kind.
{43729}{43805}- You haven't answered my question.|- Yes, I have.
{43852}{43907}We need all the help we can get.
{44000}{44039}All right, Asher.
{44091}{44123}Let's level.
{44125}{44208}You and your Haganah|can't win this fight sitting in a cellar.
{44229}{44321}I understand your commandos,|the Palmach, are already on the attack.
{44322}{44347}Before they're ready.
{44349}{44433}Their leaders are too impulsive|and their training is a walk after lunch.
{44469}{44543}Okay, let's take inventory.|You've got no guns.
{44545}{44609}You've got no uniforms.|You've got no rank...
{44612}{44666}...and had less maneuvers|than our Campfire Girls.
{44668}{44733}Your Palmach and your Haganah|hate each other's guts.
{44734}{44794}And in three months' time,|the roof caves in.
{44796}{44849}What've you been|doing here the last 50 years?
{44850}{44886}If you have an army, where is it?
{44888}{44933}Asher! Asher!
{44949}{44993}{Y:i}- They've spotted the Ashkelon.|- Already?
{44995}{45065}British troops are going to the beach|to stop the landing.
{45089}{45161}{Y:i}- What's the Ashkelon?|- It's Andre's ship, my husband.
{45164}{45212}She's full of immigrants|looking for a home.
{45215}{45288}They slipped by the British at night.|We thought they were safe.
{45290}{45339}Palmahim Beach will be the landing area.
{45341}{45384}Tell all the girls, get on the phones.
{45385}{45479}Mr. Stone, if you'll come with me,|we'll show you the invisible.
{47565}{47592}Magda!
{47621}{47648}Andre!
{47811}{47899}- Mr. Stone, my husband Andre.|- How do you do?
{47905}{47957}This is the fourth ship|he's brought through.
{47964}{48019}It wasn't just me.|There's an engine in the boat.
{48021}{48116}{Y:i}- Andre...|-No one Is to leave thls beach.
{48161}{48217}{Y:i}We are not the Gestapo,|ladles and gentlemen...
{48219}{48328}{Y:i}...there are laws of entry to thls country|whlch we are under orders to enforce.
{48525}{48593}{Y:i}Please do not make It necessary|for us to use our arms.
{48612}{48705}{Y:i}But those enterlng Illegally|must be sent back to awalt thelr permlts.
{48777}{48816}Look over there, sir.
{48818}{48884}Looks like Wembley Stadium getting out.
{48888}{48950}If they mix with the others,|we'll never sort them out.
{48953}{48979}{Y:i}Haltl
{48997}{49027}{Y:i}You therel
{49029}{49127}{Y:i}Clvlllans movlng down to the beach area,|stop and go back.

{49458}{49516}{Y:i}All those landlng from the sea...
{49525}{49591}{Y:i}...are warned to remaln|separate from the others.
{49686}{49729}Let's change clothes!
{49735}{49802}- Change clothes!|- Change clothes!
{49804}{49844}Now let them sort us out.
{50284}{50380}{Y:i}All passengers from the Ashkelon|wlll step forward Immedlately...
{50396}{50480}{Y:i}...or I shall be forced|to order these men to open flre.

{52370}{52393}{Y:i}...nlne...
{52425}{52448}{Y:i}...ten.
{52563}{52635}Now's the time to find out|if we're bloody Nazis or not.
{52706}{52752}Such a stubborn people.
{52822}{52875}All right, men, stand at ease.
{53244}{53309}Now I suppose they'll start dancing.
{53535}{53600}You see? This is my army.
{54173}{54240}- The camp of the Palmach...|- Your commandos.
{54241}{54303}...is in these mountains.|Mount Canaan, someplace.
{54305}{54400}- It has been secret even from me.|- That is a secret.
{54657}{54736}Remember, if we are stopped|by a British patrol...
{54738}{54793}...we are off for a weekend in the country.
{54797}{54837}And you're my sister.
{54906}{54963}Do you have good sex with your wife?
{54981}{55053}What goes on in that pretty head of yours?
{55073}{55124}Andre's not very good in bed.
{55129}{55205}Just close your eyes|and tell the doctor everything.
{55266}{55353}We will rendezvous at Madj El-Kurum,|10 kilometers from here.
{55363}{55405}Andre has gone ahead...
{55413}{55476}...so we'll be warned|if there is any trouble.
{55495}{55544}You're a very important man.
{55563}{55619}- And you resent it.|- Of course.
{55621}{55702}Andre is my husband.|He risked his life for a stranger.
{55729}{55806}I hope you are enjoying|your little adventure.
{55830}{55856}I am.
{55893}{55937}Andre has done enough.
{55941}{56030}You know, in this country,|it's unfortunately not unusual...
{56035}{56106}...but he has a number tattooed|on his right arm.
{56115}{56165}He escaped, one of the few.
{56178}{56245}I met him when I was running from Vienna.
{56263}{56299}He had no hope.
{56307}{56349}A dog has more hope.
{56358}{56453}So I gave him what hope was in me.|It was the least I could do.
{56483}{56517}I understand.
{56541}{56577}You couldn't.
{56585}{56655}You Americans,|how can you understand horror?
{56673}{56743}To you, horror is having a bathroom|outside the house.
{56745}{56796}You're from a country so rich...
{56817}{56869}...even your wars are rich wars...
{56873}{56932}Big guns, big airplanes.
{56945}{56992}Clean, clean wars.
{57065}{57113}{Y:i}Clean, clean wars.
{57161}{57235}Why this ride?|Why do you want 500 trucks?
{57267}{57325}Because I know you won't give me|500 ambulances.
{57343}{57425}I don't know how you talked yourself|out of the Pentagon again...
{57429}{57521}...and into Germany,|but while you're here, just do your job.
{57559}{57606}Sir, no one can do my job.
{57621}{57660}Why the hell not?
{57667}{57708}You told me to take a battalion in...
{57709}{57773}...and help liberate the first camps|that we came across.
{57775}{57871}That's right. Just give them all the food|they need and let them out.
{57873}{57938}You can't give people food|if they've forgotten how to eat.
{57941}{58000}You can't let them out anywhere|when they can't walk.
{58001}{58098}I've heard all the stories, but I haven't|seen anything to convince me...
{58100}{58165}General, will you get out|of this car for five minutes?
{58170}{58218}Is that an order, Colonel?
{58250}{58304}No, sir. It's a prayer.
{58581}{58612}Attention!
{59128}{59197}Those that are alive|weigh an average of 85 pounds.
{59271}{59353}Over there's a building|filled with ovens, still warm.
{59373}{59432}No one ever baked any bread in them.
{59841}{59932}Here, there are 3,200 corpses,|near as we can tell...
{59933}{59998}...that they didn't have time to bury.
{60096}{60145}- McCreedy!|- Yes, sir?
{60160}{60277}Give this insubordinate son of a bitch|every truck and blanket in the Third Army.
{60321}{60376}I don't care|who you have to steal them from.
{60378}{60406}Yes, sir.
{60467}{60520}{Y:i}Clean, clean wars.
{60539}{60625}{Y:i}So how could you know?|How could you belleve?
{60633}{60691}You couldn't ever understand.
{60705}{60748}Could you, Mr. Stone?
{60808}{60843}You're right.
{60897}{60941}I couldn't understand.
{60969}{61011}I never really could.
{61044}{61079}There's Andre.
{61253}{61280}Andre!
{61289}{61324}How are you? I've been worried.
{61326}{61363}{Y:i}Magda! Shalom!
{61365}{61437}- Everything all right?|- No problem yet.
{61439}{61472}{Y:i}- Hello.|- Shalom.
{61489}{61521}Who are your friends?
{61541}{61604}Ram Oren, commanding Yiftach Brigade|of the Palmach.
{61606}{61676}- Hello, Ram.|- No, that's Yussuf, his driver.
{61695}{61733}This one is Ram.
{61742}{61783}This must be the world's only army...
{61785}{61856}...where you can't tell the officers|without a program.
{61973}{62044}It must have lost something|in the translation.
{62390}{62465}They dance pretty well, for soldiers.|When do they train?
{62467}{62549}We leave the training for the Haganah.|We do the fighting.
{62590}{62654}The Palmach has never|lost an engagement, Mr. Stone.
{62658}{62729}Congratulations.|The party hasn't started yet.
{63105}{63144}Look, Arabs!
{63304}{63381}Those are our boys, dressed like|Arabs to infiltrate their lines.
{63397}{63436}It's a crazy army.
{63500}{63540}Let's join the army.
{63821}{63845}Ram!
{64187}{64235}Mr. Stone, can I talk to you?
{64265}{64316}That's not a bad way to train.
{64346}{64417}Our men tell me there's an old|Bedouin chief in the valley...
{64419}{64478}...who heard the Americans|sent us a great soldier...
{64481}{64573}...to help us fight in these hills.|General Eisenhower.
{64574}{64639}I don't quite have the|haircut for it, but...
{64641}{64719}We have explained,|it's another American officer of high rank.
{64730}{64781}- He wants to see you.|- Me?
{64783}{64852}He's says he's considering|fighting on our side.
{64853}{64900}We've got to see him.
{64994}{65056}I have no right|to ask you to come with me.
{65065}{65157}He's Arab.|If it is a trick, it could be dangerous.
{65159}{65213}All the more reason for me to go.
{65215}{65270}Convincing Arabs|is the least of my problems.
{67487}{67580}{Y:i}"I'm the shelk of Araby
{67584}{67674}{Y:i}"Your love belongs to me
{67676}{67764}{Y:i}"At nlght when you're asleep
{67766}{67854}{Y:i}"Into your tent I'll creep"
{67861}{67897}{Y:i}Hls Master's Volce.
{67912}{67996}Why do you lie to me? I am not a fool.
{68013}{68076}You tell me you're an officer|of the American army...
{68078}{68126}...but what proof do you have?
{68145}{68232}And you are the commander|of the Yiftach Brigade of the Palmach?
{68249}{68288}An infant like you?
{68345}{68405}- I'm second in command.|- You lie!
{68483}{68536}You are Ram Oren, the commander.
{68559}{68625}He thought he was too young|to impress you.
{68637}{68674}That shows that he is foolish.
{68676}{68750}The only thing that impresses|a man in my age is youth.
{68774}{68828}Don't you know|who Saman Abou Kader is?
{68841}{68910}When you were 3,|I was stealing cattle from your father.
{68921}{68975}There was a man. A lion!
{69001}{69034}He shot me twice...
{69037}{69106}...and we came to an agreement|of gentlemen.
{69109}{69180}I was a guest in your house.|I held you on my knee.
{69181}{69220}Twice you wet your pants and mine.
{69243}{69275}You have no honor.
{69277}{69324}It was an old Bedouin friend of my father's.
{69327}{69409}- I thought he died long ago.|- Hush, I am far from dead.
{69412}{69479}You can ask that bag of fat|who just danced for us.
{69481}{69573}I have risked my life to ask you here|because your father was a man to trust.
{69581}{69626}I had hopes his son was the same.
{69647}{69671}And you...
{69687}{69745}Why have you come to this country?
{69746}{69789}- To fight.|- With what?
{69805}{69885}- Have you brought guns from America?|- They will come.
{69887}{69934}Come back when they get here.
{69954}{69979}Wait a minute!
{69981}{70061}You didn't risk your life to invite us here|to dismiss us so quickly.
{70066}{70107}What's on your mind?
{70161}{70190}Coffee.
{70353}{70410}Why do you want to take our home away?
{70415}{70484}Our desert. We have lived here|for 1,000 years and more.
{70492}{70552}By what right? A Bible...
{70562}{70635}{Y:i}...that is more fairy tale|than the Arablan Nlghts?
{70649}{70715}From Damascus,|from Amman, from Cairo...
{70731}{70811}...they send messengers to tell me|the Jews will destroy our land...
{70813}{70866}...and ravish our women.|- How can you believe...
{70868}{70958}So I should send all my men at once|to the Grand Mufti's army.
{71030}{71089}- What answer do you have?|- Your own eyes.
{71090}{71128}They aren't destroying your land.
{71129}{71219}Even a blind man can see,|for the first time the desert is blooming.
{71222}{71301}They're not ravishing your women.|They don't even like your women.
{71302}{71397}That is not much of an answer.|They don't even like their women.
{71406}{71435}Listen...
{71453}{71533}...for 50 years|you have lived beside us without hate.
{71534}{71600}- Why now, a holy war?|- I'll tell you why:
{71601}{71661}The Grand Mufti, King Abdullah,|and the Husseinis...
{71663}{71714}...see the chance to win|money, power and land.
{71716}{71762}They're fighting to see who gets the most.
{71764}{71812}- That's true.|- So I'll get some, too.
{71813}{71866}They won't leave|one camel for your people.
{71868}{71906}You know them better than I.
{71908}{71978}You'll fight the war for them,|but when it's over...
{71980}{72029}...you'll be worse off than before.
{72032}{72072}Or you'll be dead.
{72077}{72138}I have no love for the Husseini family.
{72196}{72248}I'll support you with all of my men...
{72251}{72336}...if you can first prove to me|that you are strong like your father.
{72341}{72385}For then you will win.
{72392}{72473}How can I believe you? I need proof, too.
{72514}{72550}Wait a minute.
{72694}{72763}Across the border,|near the mosque of Mishmar Hayarden...
{72765}{72841}...the Syrians are gathering supplies|for an attack next week.
{72881}{72916}Eight hundred rifles.
{72972}{73019}Mortars, two-inch, 21.
{73072}{73140}Petrol, four tanks of 2,000 liters.
{73205}{73248}Three cannons of 75 millimeter.
{73301}{73350}We finish. Now your proof.
{73426}{73512}- The supplies will be destroyed.|- You're committing my men.
{73514}{73554}I don't care, it must be done.
{73556}{73613}You want to violate a border|without authority?
{73614}{73658}What do you want to do? Wait for a visa?
{73660}{73740}If it's used against you,|they can take half the Galilee in a week.
{73758}{73784}So, Commander?
{73991}{74058}It will all be destroyed within 24 hours.
{74067}{74128}Watch the sky toward Mishmar Hayarden.
{74249}{74279}Good night.
{74355}{74385}Pretty smart cookie.
{74387}{74478}Ram Oren, don't wet your pants again.
{74521}{74546}Come on.
{75053}{75114}Keep down. You should not have come.
{75116}{75197}- I have strict orders.|- My orders are to advise and observe.
{75207}{75276}I'm advising you,|it's stupid to attack with a single squad.
{75277}{75338}You know they have artillery.|You don't have armor.
{75340}{75408}This dynamite is our artillery,|and the night is our armor.
{75409}{75444}And the Lord is my Shepherd...
{75446}{75510}...but maybe he's their shepherd, too.|- You stay.
{75513}{75585}If so, there'll be a hell of a lot|of confused sheep.
{76949}{76976}Andre!
{80145}{80180}Ammunition has been blown up.
{80182}{80224}Good! They did it!
{80286}{80327}We have three dead.
{80331}{80378}Three dead? Who are they?
{80446}{80524}Eli, Tov, Andre.
{80546}{80602}Andre? Your husband?
{80688}{80735}Magda, are you all right?
{80757}{80782}Yes.
{80790}{80832}Yes, I'm all right.
{80942}{81015}I didn't come to Tel Aviv|to say things are peaches and cream.
{81017}{81084}You want the truth. Things are pretty bad.
{81088}{81135}How bad, in your opinion?
{81144}{81235}If the Arabs had a decent campaign plan,|and could attack in force tomorrow...
{81237}{81301}...they have the potential|to take Tel Aviv in 10 days.
{81305}{81388}- You had to bring me another expert.|- He doesn't only complain...
{81389}{81441}Everybody tells me the patient is dying.
{81443}{81525}The patient has already lived 2,000 years|after the doctors gave him up.
{81527}{81616}He won't live to be 2001|unless he follows directions on the label.
{81617}{81686}I can write the manuals|for you from memory.
{81689}{81748}Somebody has to convince|your officers to read them.
{81750}{81781}Go back into training.
{81783}{81830}You write, I'll convince.
{81838}{81898}You know the biggest weapon you have?
{81918}{82011}The guts, the tremendous guts|of those kids in torn sweaters...
{82013}{82056}...and open-toed sneakers.
{82077}{82112}Why throw away their lives...
{82113}{82188}...by supplying them with|bargain-basement guns or none at all?
{82189}{82254}Because your government|and the United Nations...
{82257}{82305}...have embargoed|all arms shipments to us...
{82307}{82366}...while the British can arm|our enemies openly.
{82368}{82407}We're lucky we have a few bargain...
{82409}{82460}No one ever won a war on excuses.
{82475}{82537}They told you|that I have a terrible temper?
{82553}{82624}I served in Germany|under General "blood-and-guts" Patton.
{82635}{82674}You're a pussycat.
{82734}{82797}You can't expect a boy to die|in somebody else's pants.
{82800}{82847}The Palmach fight barefoot in the hills...
{82849}{82903}...while the stores|in Allenby Road have sales.
{82905}{82986}I'm the unofficial minister of defense|of an unrecognized government.
{82988}{83047}I have no authority to requisition supplies.
{83049}{83108}If you can't get supplies,|break through the window...
{83109}{83159}...and take what you want.|Just remember...
{83161}{83206}...the world doesn't pity the slaughtered.
{83208}{83295}- It only respects those who fight.|- We haven't been fighting?
{83297}{83346}Not to win. Look, you're like this:
{83348}{83452}The Palmach, Haganah,|Irgun, Sterngang, government...
{83475}{83524}You're all pulling in every direction.
{83526}{83592}But if you can unify them|under one command...
{83594}{83665}...then you'll have one army|that can move fast and hit hard.
{83668}{83732}- You can help us do this?|- I don't know.
{83739}{83798}I don't know if anyone can.|There isn't much time.
{83800}{83888}But if you want to use me,|and gamble I know what I'm doing...
{83889}{83931}...then you must give me a free hand.
{83933}{84020}Absolute authority to consolidate|all your forces immediately.
{84029}{84116}- That's all you want?|- Yes, that's all I want.
{84193}{84268}You must understand|we're very new at this business.
{84271}{84373}Our Haganah and our Palmach|are wonderful, brave, boys and girls.
{84375}{84456}But, like children of the same family,|they're jealous of each other.
{84457}{84489}What about the other groups?
{84490}{84516}- The Irgun?|- Yes.
{84517}{84552}Also very brave.
{84553}{84625}Listens to no one,|conducts its own war against the British.
{84626}{84724}The Sternists? Brave.|And occasionally shoot at us, bravely.
{84750}{84833}We could have a very nice little war|here without the Arabs.
{84835}{84917}You want me to give you|absolute authority over all of them?
{84922}{84947}Yes.
{84980}{85052}If you can find out how to get it,|please let me know...
{85055}{85130}...because if, God forbid,|anything went wrong...
{85133}{85191}...it'd be nice to have an American|to blame it on.
{85283}{85368}- I guess the meeting's over.|- Look, try to understand.
{85369}{85437}We're in the importing business.|We import people.
{85439}{85516}That's the reason we're here.|We only fight because we have to.
{85518}{85597}We have no quarrel with the Arabs,|only with their leaders.
{85598}{85650}We still hope for an agreement.
{85652}{85716}{Y:i}The traditional greeting|in this country is "Shalom. "
{85717}{85745}Peace.
{85762}{85791}{Y:i}Shalom.
{85841}{85890}The olive branch hasn't worked|around here...
{85893}{85955}...since Noah ran the ark into a mountain.
{85961}{86052}Col. Marcus, don't think we're ungrateful.
{86067}{86112}You write those manuals.
{86117}{86174}Go, inspect. Go to the Negev.
{86176}{86232}Go especially with the convoys|to Jerusalem...
{86233}{86284}...for there is our greatest danger.
{86286}{86357}Make your reports,|your recommendations, please.
{86457}{86513}All right. I'll try it your way.
{86514}{86554}I'll advise. I'll observe.
{86556}{86621}You need a lot more than advice,|or the night of May 15...
{86623}{86674}...you'll be wading in the Mediterranean.
{86677}{86717}Maybe. Maybe not.
{86738}{86828}We might be even tougher pussycats|than anyone has any idea.
{86839}{86870}We'll see.
{86983}{87061}He's been in the Negev desert|on an inspection tour.
{87063}{87135}Next week, he's going|in a convoy to Jerusalem.
{87144}{87181}And he's dictating from memory...
{87183}{87249}...every army training manual|he can remember.
{87251}{87312}He says they need it more than the Bible.
{87315}{87416}Did he happen to mention who|he's dictating the Song of Solomon to?
{87435}{87483}What do you mean by that?
{87488}{87583}- Why should I repeat gossip?|- Why should you stop now?
{87605}{87640}Since you ask...
{87669}{87786}A very dear friend of mine got a letter|from a dear friend of hers in Palestine.
{87806}{87924}There's this woman, lost her husband.|He's been seen everyplace with her.
{87925}{87964}Magda Simon. I know.
{87965}{88065}Mickey wrote me about her.|She's been assigned to him by the army.
{88067}{88139}Instead of paying him? A nice army!
{88141}{88193}Mother, don't be a mother.
{88206}{88256}Besides, Mickey and I have...
{88287}{88355}- What's the matter?|- I don't know.
{88378}{88426}I don't know. A terrible pain.
{88429}{88456}I'll get the bicarbonate.
{88457}{88504}No, mother. Call the doctor.
{88508}{88568}- What kind of a pain?|- I... don't argue.
{88570}{88634}I think I'm losing the baby.
{88717}{88769}{Y:i}- Shalom, Magda.|- Shalom.
{88823}{88902}My family live in Jerusalem.|To them, chickens are better than gold.
{88904}{88968}Why do you let women|go on these convoys?
{88970}{89041}- Magda volunteered.|- She's been through enough.
{89043}{89083}She lost her husband, she's...
{89085}{89120}We need everyone.
{89121}{89180}Especially since the British|search us for weapons.
{89181}{89225}The British are usually too polite...
{89226}{89265}...to search a woman thoroughly.
{89267}{89326}You're lucky you're not occupied|by the French.
{91047}{91077}Get out!
{91796}{91855}- Can you see Magda?|- No.
{91891}{91956}- Let's stop!|- There's no stopping here.
{93473}{93512}The worst is over.
{93517}{93596}- Can you see Magda's truck?|- I think she stopped.
{93597}{93657}Now, hold it. Hold it.
{93989}{94016}Magda!
{94037}{94065}Come on!
{94081}{94117}Come on, Magda!
{94226}{94274}Magda! Come on!
{94306}{94345}Come on, Magda!
{94445}{94527}Come on, Magda!
{95127}{95157}Cover me.
{95432}{95500}Move over. Here, take this.
{95561}{95588}Magda?
{95651}{95703}Help me, Mickey! Help me!
{96873}{96900}Doctor!
{96932}{97014}Can you help her?|I don't understand Hebrew.
{97016}{97065}Asher, can you help me out?
{97068}{97121}He doesn't seem to understand|what I've said...
{97124}{97181}- Is she wounded?|- She's in shock.
{97182}{97269}Until the wounded are cared for,|we have no time for hysteria.
{97271}{97317}She needs a sedative, booze, anything.
{97318}{97394}- You saw what she went through.|- I'm sorry.
{97406}{97459}Listen, Asher, I don't mean to pull rank...
{97461}{97526}...but I'm here under orders|of the Minister of Defense.
{97528}{97585}Mr. Stone, we have no rank for you to pull.
{97587}{97655}The Minister of Defense is in Tel Aviv,|we're in Jerusalem...
{97657}{97701}...and this convoy's my responsibility.
{97702}{97774}Perhaps they handle things differently|at West Point, so...
{97785}{97851}...write me a training manual.|I hear you're good at it.
{98093}{98189}- But you're leaving us.|- I just got a letter from my wife.
{98198}{98301}She never likes to worry me,|but she admitted she's in the hospital.
{98303}{98366}I think it's more serious than she says.
{98368}{98421}I'm sorry your wife isn't well.
{98424}{98479}She certainly needs me|a lot more than you do.
{98481}{98551}- No, I think our need is greater.|- The hell it is.
{98559}{98606}I got to Jerusalem, and your commander...
{98608}{98679}...started looking for a vacant cross|to nail me to.
{98681}{98767}I turned in my draft of the training manuals|for your infantry a week ago.
{98769}{98855}It's still in your secretary's office|under a package of cheese.
{98872}{98924}Here are recommendations|for consolidating...
{98925}{99010}...the Palmach and Haganah|into one unified striking force.
{99019}{99061}Don't laugh too loud.
{99069}{99127}We have a few small problems, too.
{99145}{99220}The UN is having second thoughts|about granting us independence.
{99253}{99325}A lot of pressure's being brought to bear|to have us postponed.
{99327}{99374}A month, a year, forever.
{99384}{99438}- You're not going to?|- No.
{99459}{99577}Not if we can be sure the baby will be born|with at least one friend in the world.
{99605}{99636}Mickey...
{99650}{99724}- Lf the United States...|- Politics isn't my racket.
{99730}{99765}Not anymore.
{99777}{99840}And I finished my work as a paper soldier...
{99841}{99909}...and since that's the only work|you'll allow me to do...
{99913}{99983}...I think we'll all be a lot happier|if I go home.
{100012}{100064}I'm sorry to see you go, but...
{100097}{100126}{Y:i}...shalom.
{100133}{100160}Peace.
{100172}{100209}We should both live so long.
{100385}{100433}So you're really leaving?
{100497}{100542}You should be out cold.
{100544}{100599}Mrs. Martinson said|she gave you quite a shot.
{100609}{100668}I have so many, they don't work. Please.
{100681}{100747}- You'll go out like a light.|- A blessing.
{100820}{100925}While I was packing,|this fell out of a pocket.
{100955}{101005}It's my good-conduct ribbon.
{101142}{101187}But still you leave us.
{101245}{101322}I got this letter from my wife.|Nobody needs me here.
{101324}{101362}Don't give me ribbons.
{101364}{101424}I couldn't start the truck|because I didn't want to!
{101426}{101504}Because I wanted to run away!|And now you run away, just like me!
{101505}{101559}- You coward!|- Magda!
{101561}{101608}Come on, Magda!
{101614}{101674}Come on, Magda.
{101720}{101770}I'm sorry!
{101773}{101853}You have every right to go.|It's not your country.
{101856}{101940}Poor Andre, it was all the country he had...
{101943}{101992}...and for him, I couldn't cry.
{102015}{102073}Don't go. Stay.
{102076}{102152}Are you blind,|you stupid, married American idiot?
{102179}{102236}I am so tired of blood.
{102270}{102329}I am so tired of shooting.
{102367}{102432}I am so tired of wanting and not having.
{102471}{102524}Since you first came here, I...
{102560}{102607}No, not now.
{102609}{102646}It's not fair.
{102685}{102715}I want...
{102801}{102866}Damn you, Mrs. Martinson.
{103048}{103076}{Y:i}Shalom.
{103341}{103380}Keep the change.
{103550}{103615}- What's going on?|- Come on inside and find out.
{103689}{103730}If it isn't Errol Flynn!
{103737}{103812}It's a welcome-home party, Mickey.|All the relatives.
{103814}{103856}Give him a beer, will ya?
{103959}{103988}Mickey!
{104033}{104059}Emma.
{104085}{104154}Emma, I thought you were in the hospital.
{104156}{104213}Mickey, I'm so glad you're back.
{104305}{104356}- Come on, I want to talk to you.|- Okay.
{104364}{104399}Mickey!
{104417}{104507}A letter came for you yesterday|from the British Embassy in Washington.
{104509}{104537}It's marked "Personal. "
{104539}{104610}- What's it say?|- They're going to give you a medal for...
{104623}{104664}I'm only guessing.
{104963}{105011}I'm sorry I lost the baby.
{105049}{105084}I'm sorry, too.
{105112}{105169}I waited to write to you|till I was getting better.
{105171}{105253}- I knew you'd worry.|- Of course I'd worry.
{105260}{105312}It was my baby, too. Remember?
{105331}{105364}I remember.
{105393}{105435}If you'd written me when it happened...
{105437}{105501}...I could've come back|when it might've done some good.
{105505}{105566}Are you angry|because I'm not desperately sick?
{105570}{105594}Of course not.
{105596}{105660}But you could've answered my cable|to say you were fine.
{105666}{105751}- I gave up everything to rush here...|- All right, Mickey.
{105777}{105853}Part of my sickness was you,|that should be obvious.
{105885}{105924}I wanted you back.
{106073}{106136}I heard so many stories about you and...
{106174}{106216}Did you believe them?
{106244}{106308}I don't now. Now that you're here.
{106461}{106488}Mickey?
{106677}{106719}Why did you come home?
{106761}{106815}I was lonesome for your mother.
{106847}{106906}Don't hate me for loving you so much.
{107092}{107181}To Col. David Marcus,|for his able work in World War II...
{107183}{107255}...in the fields of combined planning|and military government...
{107257}{107366}...which paved the road for Anglo-American|agreement on many complex problems...
{107369}{107476}...His Majesty is glad to bestow the rank of|Honorary Officer of the Military Division...
{107479}{107556}...of the Most Excellent Order|of the British Empire.
{107613}{107648}Thank you, sir.
{107680}{107720}Congratulations, darling.
{107725}{107802}- I think this calls for a drink.|- Mr. Ambassador, my wife.
{107804}{107870}- How do you do?|- She drinks, too.
{107880}{107984}That's a fine tan you have there, Colonel.|Might I inquire where you got it?
{107985}{108061}- Traveling, Ambassador.|- Indeed?
{108074}{108154}- Any place I'd be interested in?|- You'd be interested in every place.
{108156}{108212}"The sun never sets on the British Empire. "
{108214}{108330}- Not if we can help it, it doesn't.|- Sometimes you can't help it.
{108333}{108365}But this time...
{108377}{108409}...Mr. Stone...
{108432}{108533}...I think your friends would realize|that we're only trying to be helpful.
{108571}{108671}A British military base in the Middle East|is a necessity for the free world.
{108700}{108757}If they insist on our forces|being withdrawn...
{108767}{108868}...your friends will be at the mercy|of terrible, powerful enemies...
{108886}{108953}...with legitimate claims|on their territory...
{108956}{109021}...and enough arms to overrun them|within a few days.
{109047}{109117}And they will find,|possibly to their surprise...
{109128}{109209}...that they're alone and friendless|in the practical political world.
{109210}{109281}No nation is going to risk|being the first to recognize...
{109282}{109352}...so weak and controversial a government.
{109397}{109427}They are...
{109446}{109486}...as the Bible says...
{109506}{109553}..."a stiff-necked people. "
{109605}{109705}Perhaps you could persuade them|that it's better to...
{109707}{109790}...bend a little, if those necks|are going to be saved at all.
{109905}{109937}Excuse me.
{110188}{110233}What was that all about?
{110255}{110332}I got this medal|because they don't trust Western Union.
{110449}{110507}They want me to deliver a message.
{110569}{110645}Listen, Mike, do you think|the United States...
{110648}{110765}...will ever recognize the new state,|when and if it's declared?
{110767}{110852}What the hell for?|What's in it for us but trouble?
{110871}{110944}Your friends may have the Bible|in their favor...
{110949}{110991}...but the Arabs have the oil.
{110993}{111086}Do you think our state department's|going to hesitate choosing up sides?
{111093}{111132}I guess you're right.
{111133}{111234}They're already putting the pressure|on your pals to postpone independence.
{111245}{111316}What's a few years,|a few centuries, to those people?
{111349}{111407}And I'm glad you finally got some sense...
{111418}{111471}...and pulled out before it was too late.
{111506}{111565}Now, listen, Mike, you bigoted, ignorant...
{111601}{111651}I'll try to enlighten|you, but I doubt I can...
{111653}{111734}...because you have no idea|of what the stakes are over there.
{111736}{111804}Here's a country|surrounded by five Arab nations...
{111805}{111864}...ready to shove them|into the Mediterranean.
{111865}{111921}No guns, no tanks, no friends, nothing.
{111923}{111985}People fighting with bare hands|for a piece of desert...
{111989}{112048}...because it's the last place|on this whole earth...
{112049}{112130}...that they can go to and try to live...|- Then why did you come back?
{112204}{112261}Wouldn't they let you play captain?
{112345}{112392}You know me too damn well.
{112428}{112474}You don't know me at all.
{112479}{112569}You don't give any of the rest of us credit|for being human beings.
{112578}{112628}I saw Dachau, too. Remember?
{112646}{112741}And if anybody ever deserved a home|on the basis of sheer gallantry...
{112744}{112802}...it's those poor devils from those camps.
{112809}{112855}And you have friends too, Mickey...
{112857}{112919}...although it'll probably|upset you to find it out.
{112932}{113051}They'll ring every doorbell in Washington|from the White House down, if it'll help.
{113056}{113090}And I'll raise such a stink...
{113092}{113166}...they'll go in and out|of the state department with gas masks.
{113170}{113206}But what about you?
{113211}{113275}Are you too big to go back|and help your own people...
{113277}{113340}...unless they bow down|and kiss your West Point ring?
{113345}{113372}Get off my back.
{113382}{113461}What happened|to that insubordinate SOB...
{113463}{113529}...that jumped out of one of my planes|over Normandy?
{113538}{113582}He won the distinguished service medal?
{113603}{113704}Are you proud of that medal, and|ashamed you might win the star of David?
{113749}{113786}Stand up and be counted, Mickey.
{113801}{113860}And there's a lot of us|who'll stand up with you.
{113873}{113897}{Y:i}L'Chalm.
{113962}{114030}Maybe you ought|to stay off our side, Mike.
{114036}{114085}Nobody will ever believe it.
{114107}{114136}{Y:i}L'Chalm.
{115664}{115692}Stone!
{115709}{115757}Hello, Asher. What's new?
{115826}{115921}- I never thought I'd see you again.|- It's a surprise to both of us.
{115923}{116037}My apologies for the airport.|The Arab Legion took Lydda two days ago.
{116041}{116072}I'll bet.
{116091}{116132}So you're back. Why?
{116149}{116197}Never mind. We're glad to have you.
{116221}{116296}I hope you mean that,|'cause I'm staying, even if you don't.
{116298}{116336}Haven't you heard?
{116347}{116429}The Palmach and Haganah have accepted|your suggestions for unification.
{116436}{116500}And the old man has us|following your training program.
{116504}{116582}You and the Palmach sneered|at every suggestion I ever made.
{116584}{116636}Don't you realize who you're dealing with?
{116638}{116724}We have to pretend we know everything|because we know so little.
{116726}{116776}Everything'll be different from now on?
{116778}{116808}Of course not.
{116810}{116927}We'll criticize every suggestion you make,|but that doesn't mean we won't do it.
{116958}{117017}I'll bet if Moses came down|from Mount Sinai again...
{117019}{117070}...you'd turn down five|of the Commandments...
{117073}{117129}...just so God wouldn't get a swelled head.
{117161}{117208}Mick? Hang on to this.
{117229}{117301}It may be the only bourbon|between here and the next oasis.
{117302}{117356}I got the pilot in New Jersey,|plane in Burbank...
{117358}{117417}...license in Panama,|and the guns in Czechoslovakia.
{117419}{117466}It's a new kind of Foreign Legion.
{117469}{117549}Vince Ramondi, pride of Passaic,|Asher Gonen, pride of Tel Aviv.
{117551}{117647}{Y:i}According to my flight plan,|we're in Mexico City, so buenas noches.
{117657}{117709}Sorry,|I might have dented your plane landing.
{117711}{117767}Glad to have you and the plane|in any condition.
{117769}{117837}It's not much of a bargain.|It's leaking a lot of oil.
{117844}{117916}- And I'd fly for anybody who pays me.|- It doesn't matter.
{117918}{118015}- To us, you're a hero.|- Maybe that's why we're all here.
{118101}{118140}And furthermore...
{118154}{118231}...we've been told|that if we go through with our plan...
{118253}{118325}...the city of Tel Aviv|will be bombed tonight...
{118331}{118376}...by an enemy air force.
{118417}{118478}They may come over in great strength...
{118494}{118527}...and as yet...
{118533}{118601}...we are not equipped|to meet such an attack.
{118658}{118717}We've also received word|that the United Nations...
{118718}{118795}...would like to revise|its decision of November 29...
{118798}{118845}...granting us independence.
{118879}{118941}We have informed all nations concerned...
{118957}{119057}...that we consider the original decision|to be irrevocable!
{119313}{119423}Therefore, we members|of the people's council assembled here...
{119425}{119488}...on the day of the termination|of the British mandate...
{119491}{119559}...by virtue of our natural|and historic right...
{119597}{119699}...and on the strength of the resolution|of the United Nations General Assembly...
{119702}{119779}...do hereby declare|the establishment of the State of Israel!
{121682}{121735}"The United States of America...
{121746}{121836}"... is proud to be the first nation|to recognize the new State of Israel...
{121839}{121886}"... and welcomes you. "
{122424}{122454}Did you just hear that?
{122456}{122516}What's happened to our state department?
{122518}{122604}Somebody must have given|the White House their phone number.
{122621}{122684}And now, God help them...
{122690}{122761}...'cause that's all|the help they'll get from us.
{123471}{123541}Stop! How about some wine?
{123577}{123612}Here you are.
{123618}{123677}Come and get it! Wait a minute.
{123680}{123732}I'm getting off here to see a friend.
{123734}{123804}Don't leave me here! I'm anti-Semitic!
{123889}{123922}Propaganda!
{123953}{123989}Okay, let me out.
{124099}{124135}Magda!
{124184}{124217}Over here!
{124264}{124288}Mickey!
{124291}{124362}I heard you were here,|but you're so important now...
{124364}{124463}...you have only time for cabinet ministers.|Maybe if I get elected...
{124651}{124700}What are you crying about now?
{124701}{124750}You came back.
{124752}{124814}It's only supposed to make|the Arabs unhappy.
{124816}{124870}I thought all us cowards|would stick together.
{124872}{124938}You hate me. I was so stupid.
{124940}{125024}Magda, tonight I love the whole world.
{125076}{125184}Mickey, I waited so long.|I hoped... I didn't know...
{125789}{125875}Now, the Egyptian army's|pouring tanks across the desert.
{125920}{125999}The armies of five other Arab nations|have crossed our borders...
{126001}{126040}...from four different directions.
{126045}{126135}We have no tanks, no artillery|and almost no air force to stop them.
{126165}{126213}We're getting arms soon.
{126222}{126272}Somehow, for one week,|you must hold them.
{126273}{126326}Hold them? What are you talking about?
{126328}{126391}You've all got to stop thinking like losers.|Attack!
{126393}{126440}Surprise and bluff are your major weapons.
{126453}{126503}Attack tanks with what? Noodle soup?
{126519}{126614}I've been working over that new shipment|of jeeps that came in and I've...
{126617}{126673}- Jeeps with no antitank weapons.|- We'll improvise!
{126675}{126731}We'll fix them up with machine guns,|armor plate...
{126733}{126804}...and there are four antiaircraft guns|nobody knows we have.
{126807}{126837}But how would you use them?
{126841}{126918}We're mounting them on half-tracks|so they can fire straight ahead.
{126920}{126955}In Jerusalem?
{126965}{126997}Jerusalem?
{127001}{127062}The city is almost isolated.|You can't hold it.
{127064}{127100}We should evacuate everyone.
{127102}{127172}It'll cost us 10 times as much|to hold the city as it's worth.
{127173}{127224}How much is Jerusalem worth, Asher?
{127249}{127301}What did it close at on Wall street today?
{127303}{127388}What's the market price of a 100-foot|frontage on Solomon's temple?
{127389}{127441}Not much, with the desert full of tanks...
{127444}{127513}...while you waste your arms|defending the impossible.
{127514}{127583}There will be arms for the desert|and arms for Jerusalem!
{127585}{127665}- Lf you believe in miracles.|- You came back, didn't you?
{127705}{127756}You and Stone|take the jeeps into the Negev...
{127758}{127846}...and see what can be done at night|to stop the Egyptian tanks.
{127853}{127945}You and Ram will move your best units|to the road to Jerusalem.
{127946}{128036}Find out what it'll take|to break through to the city.
{128040}{128092}You'll all report|to me on what we have to do...
{128103}{128181}...and Asher will explain to us|why it cannot be done...
{128194}{128232}...and then we will do it.
{128973}{129000}We'll make camp.
{129002}{129087}We'll sleep here during daylight|and move on after dark.
{129096}{129136}David!
{129341}{129373}What's up?
{129385}{129437}They've picked up Egyptian tank radio.
{129439}{129501}They don't know, so they're talking freely.
{129503}{129552}- Well?|- They've moved fast.
{129553}{129629}A column is heading north|to knock out the Har Safid Kibbutz.
{129631}{129677}What do they have at Har Safid?
{129679}{129736}Your old friend Yussuf|with 20 men of the Palmach.
{129737}{129838}- What else?|- Wire, slit trenches, Molotov cocktails...
{129853}{129880}...children.
{129882}{129956}- Radio?|- No communications at all.
{129959}{130048}- They made a hit without warning.|- How long will it take us to reach them?
{130050}{130144}Too long. It'll be broad daylight.|The plan was only for night assault.
{130193}{130240}I'm just an adviser.
{130262}{130286}Then advise.
{130288}{130350}You've got no choice.|Hit those tanks with everything.
{130355}{130432}- Risk the entire force?|- They don't know that. Go for broke.
{130433}{130514}This has gotta be the biggest bluff|since the invention of falsies.
{130516}{130580}If we're wiped out,|they'll be in Tel Aviv by Saturday.
{130582}{130666}If you don't,|they'll be there for Friday supper.
{130672}{130731}This is the only mobile force|in the entire Negev.
{130733}{130800}There's a mountain over there|called "Masada"?
{130802}{130826}Masada.
{130829}{130901}It was the last stronghold|of our revolt against the Romans.
{130903}{130943}I know. And they had an adviser, too.
{130945}{131025}After they held out for three years|he advised them to give up.
{131027}{131132}They didn't have a chance, so 960 of them|committed suicide on top of that mountain.
{131133}{131158}That's right.
{131161}{131212}- And you guys are proud of it?|- Of course!
{131214}{131240}What do you want?
{131243}{131332}An eloquent philosophical speech|and then you all go and cut your throats?
{131336}{131381}David, attack!
{131399}{131452}There have been enough Masadas|in this country.
{131981}{132066}- The whole air force is at Jerusalem.|- All three planes?
{132068}{132133}Yes, all they can spare is one Piper Cub.
{132146}{132191}No pilot, no bomb racks, no bombs.
{132218}{132309}Tell them to drop anything they can find.|Anything that makes a noise.
{132312}{132414}Vince told me of a run he made over|New Guinea with half-empty pop bottles.
{132416}{132441}- What?|- Yeah!
{132443}{132511}They burst on impact.|Make a hell of an explosion.
{132516}{132592}Now, don't tell me|they don't have seltzer in Tel Aviv?
{132841}{132888}- They think we're crazy.|- Good.
{132889}{132947}Right, now we're|going to split into two columns...
{132949}{132995}...and attack from opposite directions.
{132997}{133057}I have orders not to allow you|into combat...
{133074}{133176}...but will you advise one column?
{133196}{133247}I was afraid you weren't going to ask.
{133298}{133328}Mickey.
{133355}{133465}I've never faced tanks before.|Neither have my men.
{133469}{133580}David, that's all right.|The Egyptians have never faced seltzer.
{133605}{133654}You! Change partners!
{133823}{133869}There's a war on! Come on!
{133977}{134016}Come on.
{134081}{134110}What's this for?
{134112}{134179}A trick we learned from the Stukas|in the other war.
{134181}{134242}It's like a whistle.|It screams on the way down.
{134256}{134300}That's great. That'll make two of us.
{134317}{134372}Put that on the seat there, son.
{134475}{134545}Where can I get a bet|down on the other side?
{138965}{139032}Let's run for it.|Get those tanks to chase us.
{139336}{139375}They're coming along.
{142159}{142199}I called you back from the desert...
{142201}{142310}...because things are not going well.
{142344}{142439}The Egyptian tanks have been stopped.|You've got Jaffa, Haifa, Acre.
{142457}{142500}Don't worry. Things aren't so bad.
{142517}{142610}Mickey, there's been a disaster.|Terrible disaster.
{142643}{142719}The Arab Legion has moved|into the fortress of Latrun...
{142721}{142772}...and cut the only supply road|to Jerusalem.
{142775}{142801}The Arab Legion?
{142808}{142896}Our boys tried to break through yesterday|and were slaughtered like cattle.
{142897}{142960}The wheat fields|are irrigated with their blood.
{142964}{143042}That's a real defense minister speech.|Now, what happened?
{143047}{143099}Hardly any artillery, not enough men...
{143101}{143180}...but most important,|no centralized leadership.
{143185}{143264}You're right. We have no high command.|We have a committee.
{143280}{143334}You know about the cease-fire?
{143363}{143435}The United Nations requested|a general truce...
{143437}{143496}...effective the morning of June 11.
{143499}{143529}Did you accept it?
{143569}{143637}We don't want to see any more bloodshed|on either side.
{143666}{143720}I bet the Arabs have accepted.
{143729}{143796}They know you can't break through|to Jerusalem in that time.
{143797}{143857}When the cease-fire comes,|the lines will be frozen.
{143863}{143936}The city will have to surrender|or be starved to death.
{143953}{143978}We have two weeks.
{143989}{144037}- Less.|- But we've been over all this.
{144039}{144104}What the hell's so important|about Jerusalem, militarily?
{144105}{144147}Half the city's already fallen.
{144149}{144244}It doesn't make sense to risk everything|you've got to save the other half.
{144246}{144320}Did it make sense for a fellow|with a job building pyramids...
{144322}{144381}...to march his friends into the Red Sea?
{144401}{144468}Mickey, Jerusalem is starving.
{144483}{144565}Three pieces of bread a week|for the children, almost no water.
{144569}{144622}Jerusalem was destroyed|once by Nebuchadnezzar...
{144624}{144663}...a second time by Titus of Rome.
{144665}{144716}Not again, Mickey. Not again!
{144724}{144784}Without Jerusalem, there is no Israel.
{144879}{144945}The defense minister|has made another speech.
{144995}{145063}I'd be interested in knowing|how you intend to save it.
{145109}{145197}In the Bible is a Hebrew word|I've never seen anywhere else.
{145199}{145239}{Y:i}The word is "Aluf. "
{145249}{145291}It means commander.
{145297}{145348}More than that, it means leader.
{145366}{145465}I'm placing the unified command|of all forces in the Jerusalem front...
{145467}{145521}{Y:i}...in the hands of Aluf Michael Stone.
{145566}{145626}Now, wait a minute!|When I first asked for command...
{145629}{145687}...there was time to organize,|train, and prepare.
{145689}{145752}It's like giving a kid a balloon|when the party's over.
{145753}{145828}- I don't believe in miracles.|- About miracles, I wouldn't know...
{145831}{145925}{Y:i}...but the last Aluf mentioned in the Bible|was Joshua of Jericho.
{145953}{146013}I've written a note|to all brigade commanders...
{146016}{146062}...announcing your appointment.
{146111}{146135}Well?
{146172}{146291}Don't you want to be the first general|of the army of Israel in 2,000 years?
{146429}{146456}{Y:i}Aluf?
{146825}{146871}How long has this convoy|been hung up here?
{146873}{146935}Two days. There is hope?
{146966}{147018}Tell them not to keep their motors running.
{147048}{147076}And I?
{147126}{147169}You never turn yours off.
{147305}{147377}{Y:i}That means, "I love you," Aluf Stone.
{147394}{147456}A general should learn|that much of the language.
{147467}{147528}Nobody's going to love me|when this fighting's over.
{147530}{147572}Nobody who's alive.
{147589}{147627}Then I'll be dead.
{147681}{147790}"Do not die, for I shall hate|All women so, when thou art gone. "
{147797}{147848}What a time to think of that one.
{147853}{147919}The air smells of cow manure and blood.
{148244}{148271}Asher.
{148334}{148384}- Mickey.|- Hello, Ram.
{148405}{148456}I got something from the old man.
{148598}{148655}- It's about time.|- You gave in too easily.
{148657}{148710}You must be in worse|trouble than I thought.
{148712}{148784}We are. We lost 600 men|in the first assault.
{148813}{148882}We are forced to send immigrants|from the detention camps...
{148884}{148936}...directly from the|boats to the front lines.
{148937}{148997}Where do they get their basic training?|On the bus?
{148998}{149027}If they are lucky.
{149038}{149087}Most of the men have given up hope.
{149090}{149176}With the Legion controlling the heights,|I can't blame them.
{149179}{149237}Asher, your mission's to take Latrun.
{149245}{149305}If you can't do it,|I'll get somebody who can.
{149309}{149375}{Y:i}Yes, Aluf Stone.
{149397}{149479}We'll have a staff meeting in half an hour.|I want to clean up.
{149481}{149552}- Where's the Waldorf-Astoria?|- This way.
{149571}{149683}And this is the police fortress of Latrun,|now occupied by the Arab Legion.
{149689}{149740}This is the road to Jerusalem.
{149761}{149801}And here behind these trees,
{149801}{149865}the Legion has installed|its heavy artillery.
{149870}{149966}Is there any way to bypass that road|and get the trucks through to Jerusalem?
{149969}{149992}No.
{150000}{150069}Nothing that is not|in full view of those big guns there.
{150080}{150134}The only way is here,|through the Bab El Wad.
{150144}{150208}That's where we were ambushed|in the convoy last month.
{150209}{150298}The rest is high cliffs,|wild terrain, impossible to pass.
{150305}{150412}Our plan is for an armored attack|against the fort from this direction...
{150413}{150475}...a frontal assault|through the wheat field here...
{150477}{150544}...and a raid to knock out|their gun emplacements here.
{150545}{150605}- Tonight?|- Not a chance.
{150608}{150636}Tomorrow?
{150647}{150723}- Maybe.|- You can lose a war on "maybe. "
{150737}{150808}All right, we could try.|But the plan itself?
{150831}{150867}Very professional.
{150881}{150967}- You'd all get an "A" At West Point.|- Thank you.
{150983}{151023}I've just one suggestion:
{151036}{151110}I'd like an infantry unit|to outflank the entire position...
{151112}{151168}...then smash through this village|behind the fort.
{151171}{151235}They'd find themselves|threatened with being cut off...
{151237}{151276}...and they'd be forced to withdraw.
{151277}{151305}Maybe.
{151322}{151346}What do you mean?
{151348}{151433}You're speaking of coordinating|four different actions simultaneously.
{151436}{151508}You're not just playing in a sandbox.|This is for keeps.
{151510}{151609}The only chance against that firepower|is to complete the action before daylight.
{151611}{151652}- The whole action?|- What do you think?
{151655}{151694}It'll take split-second timing.
{151696}{151764}You might as well all start|getting used to it right now.
{151766}{151808}Synchronize to mine.
{151831}{151928}When I say "hack,"|It'll be exactly 11:05. Ready?
{151940}{152030}Three, two, one, hack.
{152032}{152061}{Y:i}Aluf Stone...
{152073}{152129}...you'll have to excuse us.|We don't have a watch.
{152868}{152952}The buses were held up by mechanical|difficulties, but now we're ready.
{152955}{152984}So is the Legion.
{152986}{153081}In half an hour,|it'll be light enough to read your obituary.
{153093}{153163}- You've got no choice.|- We must attack.
{153252}{153285}{Y:i}Kadlmal
{153312}{153368}Any word from Petach battalion?
{153375}{153416}We're going to try?
{153422}{153518}Our only chance is if that infantry unit|can outflank the fort.
{153681}{153746}They've almost reached Imwas,|behind the enemy positions.
{153748}{153812}- No one has spotted them yet.|- Good.
{153860}{153888}Thanks.
{153905}{153930}What's this?
{153953}{153977}What?
{153980}{154046}Ram got into a big argument|with some of the men...
{154049}{154096}...who wouldn't believe|he was a commander.
{154097}{154156}So we sent for some ribbon|for all the officers.
{154157}{154248}- What about the general?|- We're out of ribbon.
{154257}{154297}The story of my life.
{154464}{154490}Ram.
{154537}{154624}Wait a minute.|Now that you've got that piece of ribbon...
{154625}{154697}...I should order you|to stay behind with us at headquarters.
{154708}{154757}You never obeyed my orders.
{154779}{154801}Okay.
{155296}{155347}{Y:i}Aluf Stone!
{155358}{155402}{Y:i}Aluf Stone, remember me?
{155415}{155486}- I'm not sure I...|- The bus from Lydda airport.
{155499}{155535}I told you to go to hell.
{155589}{155620}Now I remember.
{155630}{155672}I'm glad you didn't.
{156251}{156293}Where do they come from?
{156332}{156412}Belsen, Auschwitz, Buchenwald...
{156433}{156471}...by way of Cyprus.
{156689}{156728}What are they singing?
{156731}{156826}The same song they used to sing|on the way to the gas chambers.
{156893}{156940}And as most of our songs...
{156943}{157013}...it begins, "Next year in Jerusalem. "
{157099}{157145}"Next year in Jerusalem. "
{158368}{158416}Gafna Blue, this is Petach Red.
{158418}{158452}Do you read me? Over.
{158490}{158541}- Where are you?|- Did they contact the Legion?
{158543}{158617}{Y:i}-We're In the wheat fleld.|- Did you make contact with the Legion?
{158620}{158683}{Y:i}The Leglon Is on the roof of the fort.|We can see them.
{162065}{162108}Our flamethrowers are a surprise.
{162124}{162203}{Y:i}-They made them for us, and they work.|- How about the dynamite?
{162234}{162281}Our boys are placing the dynamite.
{162958}{163011}We're inside. Inside the wall!
{163018}{163056}Three of us. No, four!
{163062}{163116}{Y:i}-Four carsl|- They've made it!
{163381}{163448}Excuse the expression,|but where the hell is the Palmach?
{163469}{163531}The infantry were supposed|to be attacking the rear.
{163533}{163569}Do they want us to be fried?
{163581}{163689}{Y:i}Magda, do you read me?|Gafna Blue, thls Is Petach Red.
{163773}{163796}What'd she say?
{163798}{163895}The second hit a minefield|and the artillery has found the range.
{163897}{163965}Where's the infantry battalion?|Everything depends on them.
{163967}{164040}They should've captured the town|and be coming from the rear.
{164164}{164259}- They've decided to withdraw.|- What? Withdraw? How the hell...
{164270}{164349}All right. What went wrong?|How many casualties?
{164354}{164384}Two. Two dead.
{164390}{164444}- Two?|- Try to understand.
{164445}{164488}They're all from the same neighborhood.
{164489}{164540}18 families lost sons in the last attack.
{164542}{164608}And now two more.|Two from a family that already lost two.
{164610}{164640}They're withdrawing.
{164645}{164675}That does it.
{164821}{164861}Our car has been set on fire.
{164863}{164919}We need mortars! Mortars!
{164943}{165008}We need more than mortars.|We need God.
{165015}{165053}Do you read me, God?
{165101}{165128}This is Rona.
{165185}{165209}Rona.
{165226}{165268}Do you hear me, Rona?
{165278}{165307}Rona!
{165417}{165468}They don't need generals now.
{166059}{166084}Ram!
{166097}{166128}Ram!
{166242}{166273}I'm sorry.
{166381}{166444}The 7th Brigade lost 200 men.
{166491}{166557}The 3rd, over 300.
{166785}{166838}The immigrants were hit the hardest.
{166845}{166954}We gave orders in seven languages,|and still many couldn't understand.
{166956}{166996}But they advanced.
{166998}{167106}We found their bodies in the wheat,|safety catches still on their guns.
{167142}{167191}They didn't even know|how to release them.
{167193}{167288}- But they still advanced.|- But they were all facing toward Latrun.
{167292}{167324}"Next year in Jerusalem. "
{167328}{167370}What do you want me to do, cry?
{167372}{167437}It means your training is poor|and you need interpreters.
{167440}{167537}It means you're wasting manpower.|These kids want to fight.
{167540}{167612}You know how important that is?|We've got to attack again.
{167615}{167687}They wanted to fight.|It's a little different now.
{167689}{167724}The Arab Legion won't move out.
{167724}{167776}They're just playing|for time till the truce.
{167778}{167854}Now you've got to regroup,|reorganize and attack.
{167909}{167953}I must think of my men.
{167963}{168033}You saw yourself, our boys are worn out.
{168034}{168088}We're all worn out, but we'll do it.
{168124}{168189}We made it across the Red Sea, didn't we?
{168283}{168351}It's the first time|I ever heard you say "we. "
{168493}{168519}Yeah.
{168595}{168628}You people...
{168648}{168690}Pipsqueak nation...
{168723}{168806}Tin-can army|that fights with seltzer bottles.
{168823}{168851}"We. "
{168890}{168981}All my life,|I've been looking for where I belong.
{168991}{169031}Turns out it's here.
{169109}{169168}The Catskill Mountains with Arabs.
{169245}{169298}I've been so angry at the world...
{169311}{169371}...ever since I was circumcised|without my permission.
{169385}{169474}All of a sudden,|I find out I'm not so special after all.
{169492}{169592}Everybody here is in the same boat|and nobody's bellyaching.
{169612}{169638}Okay.
{169655}{169703}"Stand up and be counted," the man said.
{169729}{169779}"Grow up," is more like it.
{169817}{169911}I'm not fighting anymore|because I'm ashamed of being a Jew.
{169926}{170016}I'm fighting because I'm stiff-necked|and proud of it.
{170028}{170113}Next week, Asher.|Next week in Jerusalem.
{170122}{170154}{Y:i}Aluf Stone.
{170168}{170227}{Y:i}Aluf Stone, an old friend wants to see you.
{170296}{170330}{Y:i}Salaam alelkum.
{170338}{170400}{Y:i}-Shalom.|- I bring a gift.
{170442}{170476}What's this?
{170481}{170505}Camels.
{170517}{170593}We have been told of your road|on which your trucks cannot move.
{170604}{170639}Thank you for your generous gift.
{170642}{170748}We appreciate what you're doing for us|but let me try to show you the problem.
{170749}{170842}You see, the heavy artillery on that hill|commands this entire valley.
{170844}{170904}There is no way around|for trucks or camels.
{170906}{170999}Don't worry, I did not steal|the finest camels in the entire desert...
{171001}{171055}...to have them butchered by Abdullah...
{171057}{171128}Yes, but perhaps you're not familiar|with the land here and...
{171129}{171165}I am not familiar?
{171167}{171268}I was having women in these hills|when your father was sucking milk...
{171270}{171321}...and your mother was...|- Take a look at this.
{171324}{171343}What is this?
{171343}{171402}- This is what we call|a relief map of Latrun.
{171408}{171470}- Latrun?|- That's the fort. This is a road...
{171473}{171510}Latrun...
{171513}{171540}...Hulda.|- That's right.
{171542}{171572}Beit Jiz.
{171581}{171622}- Bab El Wad.|- Abu Ghosh.
{171624}{171664}- Jerusalem.|- Exactly.
{171682}{171748}- What child did this?|- What do you mean?
{171749}{171804}- This hill doesn't exist.|- No, let him.
{171806}{171856}This hill is over here.
{171885}{171957}{Y:i}And there is an old wadl through here...
{171973}{172014}...that cannot be seen from Latrun.
{172021}{172052}Asher, listen to this:
{172053}{172108}Since you have taken|the village of Beit Jiz...
{172117}{172173}...my camels can move through here.
{172175}{172236}There's another way|through these hills to Jerusalem.
{172239}{172305}{Y:i}The Palmach boys|have already found this wadl.
{172326}{172384}It's barely wide enough for a jeep...
{172398}{172457}...and it ends against|the bottom of a cliff.
{172497}{172545}And they'll come out here.
{172554}{172599}The other side of Bab El Wad.
{172601}{172667}Fifty camels couldn't move|enough supplies in a week...
{172669}{172711}...to feed Jerusalem for half a day.
{172716}{172744}Who is this idiot?
{172746}{172814}{Y:i}Are you sure the wadl's big enough|to build a road?
{172817}{172874}- To take those heavy trucks to Jerusalem?|- Yes.
{172876}{172919}Build the road in a week?
{172921}{173003}The cliffs in that area|are over 250 feet high.
{173007}{173091}{Y:i}Allah Azlml|If one of my men spoke to me in this way...
{173093}{173143}...I would draw my knife|and make him a eunuch.
{173145}{173181}{Y:i}Let's see this wadl of yours.
{173185}{173251}But perhaps in his case,|it has already been done.
{173253}{173302}We can at least take a look.
{173470}{173502}Stop!
{173525}{173553}You see?
{173557}{173676}The Jerusalem road is only 1,000 meters|the other side of this little bump.
{173829}{173862}All right, let's get closer.
{174071}{174104}Let's push.
{174223}{174261}Okay, all together.
{174277}{174328}Don't be daft. You're wasting your time.
{174333}{174429}Even if you could blast a road for trucks,|you'd never make it up this.
{174431}{174527}You'd have to build a mile of switchback|and take over that next hill there.
{174529}{174576}- It would take a year.|- Who the hell are you?
{174578}{174602}Capt. MacAfee.
{174604}{174692}He came to us by way of the Scots Guards,|but he's our best engineer.
{174694}{174738}Hopefully, one of your worst prophets.
{174743}{174789}Mr. MacAfee, during the 14th century...
{174791}{174870}...Spanish troops carved|200 steps up a cliff in a single night.
{174883}{174946}Aye, but we don't have any trucks|that can climb steps.
{174948}{175004}- Boys, move right back there.|- Lf one of my men...
{175006}{175107}Don't tempt me. Mr. MacAfee,|will you come this way, please?
{175257}{175334}There's going to be a road|up this little bump, see?
{175337}{175381}Now, I'll start the job.
{175409}{175453}You figure out a way to finish it...
{175456}{175541}...or one of these rocks will have|your name on it and tomorrow's date.
{175544}{175642}To use the colorful local vernacular,|what kind of a schnook do you think I am?
{175644}{175727}Who's going to build a road|up these cliffs in a week?
{175755}{175812}The schnooks, Capt. MacAfee.
{175850}{175891}The army of the schnooks.
{176657}{176715}If the Arab Legion finds out|what's going on here...
{176717}{176795}...they'll turn those guns around|and blast the hell out of them.
{176817}{176850}Do they know that?
{176856}{176886}They know.
{176933}{176971}Why do they come?
{177025}{177077}I'm still trying to figure out why you came.
{177576}{177660}Okay, keep working, boys.|Get your backs into it.
{177662}{177734}That's the stuff. Keep going, lads.
{177758}{177867}Mac, you've got to get going on that road.|You can't feed Jerusalem on piggyback.
{177869}{177916}It's a very big bump.
{178044}{178117}But they're starving to death|on the other side of it.
{178218}{178273}Put out that light, somebody! Kill it!
{178685}{178732}They're moving up hill 49...
{178745}{178786}...half a mile from our road.
{178798}{178860}{Y:i}It's the flrst tlme|they've sent out patrols at nlght.
{179591}{179631}The Legion is pulling back.
{179633}{179706}Let's hope they stay back. Four days.
{179708}{179760}Then the UN freezes the lines.
{179764}{179822}We'll have to risk working days|as well as nights.
{180038}{180075}From your wife?
{180093}{180136}I know the handwriting.
{180143}{180196}My heart freezes when I see it.
{180206}{180294}Emma's seen the newspaper stories|about the fighting.
{180298}{180364}She doesn't know where I am|or what I'm doing, but...
{180368}{180446}...she doesn't want me|to have any more problems, so...
{180547}{180594}...she'll give me a divorce.
{180873}{180948}If you've forgotten,|that means "I love you. "
{181029}{181097}{Y:i}Don't hate me for lovlng you so much.
{181117}{181180}{Y:i}Don't hate me for lovlng you so much.
{181989}{182018}Welcome.
{182085}{182132}Sorry I'm late, gentlemen.
{182146}{182207}- How do you like our Burma road?|- What road?
{182209}{182303}- How many trucks did you get up this cliff?|- I don't know the exact number...
{182305}{182336}Under their own power?
{182337}{182377}- What?|- You heard me.
{182401}{182460}You certainly get good information.
{182471}{182558}Yes, we've been hauling them,|but last night we finished the last stretch.
{182565}{182620}I could drive it myself now. It's a cinch.
{182628}{182685}Then would you explain that to us?
{182785}{182833}I don't like to be skeptic, Col. Stone.
{182841}{182913}The United Nations has a delicate|and difficult task here...
{182915}{182976}...if it is to retain international respect.
{182978}{183081}If that road is passable to heavy traffic,|the siege of Jerusalem is broken.
{183083}{183107}That's right.
{183109}{183149}The question is, is it passable?
{183181}{183239}Of course it is. Excuse me. Mr. MacAfee!
{183323}{183374}They still can't climb steps.
{183377}{183471}None of the drivers are happy about|taking another crack at it, not after that.
{183473}{183498}They won't budge.
{183501}{183588}- How long to get that truck on the road?|- An hour, maybe two.
{183613}{183666}Get that bulldozer and|shove it off the cliff.
{183668}{183712}- But look...|- Shove it off!
{183749}{183843}Okay! Get that bulldozer up behind|the lorry and shove it right over!
{183848}{183880}Right over!
{184645}{184711}All right, let's get that jeep back.
{184724}{184773}Come on, let's get the show on the road.
{184775}{184817}Right, back you go.
{184819}{184843}That's fine.
{184849}{184904}Come on, move up in the back there!|Okay, move!
{184914}{184977}Right up here! Come on, go!
{184994}{185031}What's he playing at?
{185033}{185089}There's nothing to it.|It's just a Sunday drive.
{185194}{185226}Jerusalem.
{185248}{185326}All right, you understand.|We have no choice. Come on.
{185419}{185462}Don't hurt my highway.
{186181}{186228}You've got plenty of room.
{187190}{187215}See?
{187226}{187273}As long as we don't run into any traffic.
{188950}{189008}Do you think I learned Hebrew|since yesterday?
{189032}{189091}Is that the language|you use here in a monastery?
{189096}{189152}{Y:i}I'm sorry, Aluf Stone.|I didn't recognize you.
{189165}{189190}I guess it's foolish.
{189193}{189254}After all, only a couple of hours|till the cease-fire.
{189259}{189291}Stay alert.
{189293}{189359}The Arabs might still use it|as a trick to launch an attack.
{189381}{189414}Let 'em try.
{189425}{189479}- What's your name?|- Chaim.
{189512}{189552}Tell your friends it's official now.
{189553}{189608}We're marching into Jerusalem|in the morning.
{189610}{189673}Through the back door, sure,|but we made it.
{189675}{189762}And when anyone asks you how we did it,|tell them you did it.
{189764}{189850}- That's an order from your commander.|- Okay, Mickey.
{189873}{189964}You're an insubordinate SOB.|You'll go far, Chaim.
{190137}{190195}- Chaim.|- Tov.
{190811}{190888}If you knew the trouble I had|to get by the sentries...
{190890}{190973}Such an army we have now!|So West Point!
{191064}{191105}Something is wrong.
{191165}{191193}Magda...
{191273}{191315}...I've fallen in love.
{191344}{191383}Your wife, I know.
{191430}{191479}What has that to do with us?
{191485}{191559}- You're being very European.|- I am very European.
{191569}{191654}I live with what is,|not what I would like it to be.
{191656}{191699}I can't live that way.
{191711}{191744}Not anymore.
{191755}{191819}See, when Emma said I could go...
{191841}{191907}...I knew it was time|to stop running after everything.
{191918}{191948}Excitement, war...
{191949}{191992}I don't want to listen.
{191993}{192068}I know everything before you say it.|I've heard it before.
{192229}{192274}Did you know that...
{192300}{192344}You never said it to me.
{192345}{192368}Now.
{192374}{192475}I'm saying it now, because we're here|at the monastery of Abu Ghosh...
{192486}{192533}...on the road to Jerusalem.
{192545}{192604}You're standing beneath a rosebush|in the moonlight.
{192646}{192711}But how would you look|in Brooklyn plucking a chicken?
{192729}{192755}What?
{192796}{192870}I'm going home, Magda, for good.
{192881}{192916}For damn good.
{192956}{193059}I guess I've been in love with Emma|all my life, and I wouldn't admit it.
{193152}{193226}Now I'm picking a rose for her.
{193277}{193337}I'll take it to her|as if I were the schnook lawyer...
{193339}{193387}...she always wanted me to be.
{193413}{193446}Run, Magda.
{193463}{193556}Run for your life.|The schnooks are taking over the world.
{193569}{193606}{Y:i}Shalom, Mickey.
{193730}{193755}You bastard.
{194567}{194632}Chaim, I don't know|what you think I was doing there...
{194633}{194676}...but I wasn't learning Hebrew.
{194729}{194772}I don't want to fight anymore.
{194773}{194832}I wanna go to bed,|and then I'm going home.
{196669}{196778}{Y:i}Mrs. Davld Marcus, 482 Westmlnster Road|Brooklyn, New York.
{196796}{196849}{Y:i}Your husband fell last nlght at hls post...
{196851}{196955}{Y:i}...In the hllls of Jerusalem,|the last casualty before the truce.
{196977}{197049}{Y:i}Durlng the too-short tlme|of hls belng wlth us...
{197051}{197137}{Y:i}...as a man, and as a commander,|he endeared hlmself...
{197140}{197211}{Y:i}...to all who came Into personal contact|wlth hlm.
{197230}{197313}{Y:i}Hls name wlll Ilve forever|In the annals of our people.
{3592}{3638}The island of Cyprus, madam.
{3641}{3726}World famous for beauty|and long, tragic history.
{3729}{3769}Been conquered many times.
{3771}{3878}Conquered by Phoenicians, Assyrians,|Persians, Macedonians.
{3892}{4003}Also conquered by Greeks, Romans,|Byzantines, Turks.
{4022}{4120}Purchased from Turkey|by your esteemed self, the British Empire.
{4132}{4191}All Cyprus most fond of the British.
{4246}{4281}I'm an American.
{4290}{4374}Fond of Americans also.|We Cypriots are fond of everybody.
{4377}{4434}Shall we go through the castle now?
{4437}{4491}No, I've changed my mind.
{4499}{4573}Then maybe the Tower of Othello|at the harbor of Famagusta.
{4575}{4637}-It's included in the tour.|-All right.
{6399}{6441}What's the matter here?
{6444}{6527}Prison ship has arrived|full of Jews for the camps, madam.
{6530}{6614}-What camps?|-Detention camps out at Karaolos.
{6617}{6713}You see, the Jews, they charter a ship|from Europe to get to Palestine.
{6716}{6793}Then the British catch the ship|and send the whole bunch here.
{6795}{6898}The Arabs don't want them in Palestine.|The British don't want them here, either.
{6901}{6949}-But they got them.|-Stop!
{7258}{7289}Get him!
{7401}{7478}Maybe you can back up|and drive me to this address.
{7515}{7570}House of the British Commander.
{8970}{9013}Now, then.
{9029}{9071}-Get his feet.|-Right.
{9113}{9138}Up.
{9698}{9732}Mrs. Fremont?
{9776}{9843}The General's expecting you in the garden.
{10062}{10119}How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?
{10139}{10190}I'm very glad to see you.
{10193}{10231}Please sit down.
{10266}{10315}Found that here in the garden.
{10318}{10401}From the color,|I'd say it belongs to the Byzantine period.
{10404}{10476}The Byzantines occupied|Cyprus for centuries.
{10483}{10591}Gives one an idea how temporary|our claims to the world's real estate are.
{10605}{10689}I'm ashamed to say I really don't know|anything about archeology.
{10692}{10721}Few people do.
{10723}{10803}Didn't you once publish something|about the Roman ruins in Cheltenham?
{10806}{10873}A very obscure something. How did you know?
{10882}{10973}Tom mentioned it in one of his letters.|He was very proud of your friendship.
{10976}{11017}As I was of his.
{11035}{11114}Will you have tea, or something livelier?
{11129}{11178}Something livelier, please.
{11226}{11283}-Is that ice I see?|-Surprised?
{11312}{11361}Tom got me into the habit.
{11391}{11471}Now I use ice in practically everything.
{11516}{11551}There we are.
{11639}{11693}May we drink to Tom?
{11716}{11748}Of course.
{11828}{11934}I'm extremely sorry circumstances|compelled us to bury him in the field.
{11946}{12018}Even sorrier I was|transferred from Palestine...
{12021}{12067}...before I got the chance to see you.
{12082}{12180}It wasn't your fault.|It took me almost a week to arrange passage.
{12192}{12259}But your letter was waiting there for me,|and Tom's things.
{12265}{12330}I really shouldn't have let him go with us.
{12333}{12373}It was only a border affair.
{12376}{12451}One of the Jewish undergrounds|had blown up half a dozen bridges.
{12454}{12541}It really wasn't important enough|to lose one's life for.
{12550}{12584}Is anything?
{12594}{12643}In my opinion, yes.
{12662}{12757}I've known many soldiers, Mrs. Fremont,|and war correspondents...
{12759}{12821}...and news photographers,|such as your husband.
{12824}{12901}But I think perhaps Tom|was the bravest man I've ever met.
{12927}{12979}We have a saying in Indiana:
{12984}{13051}"The braver the bird, the fatter the cat."
{13063}{13093}Perhaps.
{13128}{13193}Do you recognize this photograph, General?
{13195}{13242}Of course. It was his last.
{13245}{13290}Do you remember how Tom got that shot?
{13292}{13317}We were together.
{13319}{13404}I must confess, my eyes weren't on him|when he snapped the shutter.
{13406}{13478}The aircraft came in low.|We were both in the truck.
{13480}{13593}I jumped down on one side to take cover,|and Tom jumped down on the other side.
{13606}{13699}Tom couldn't have taken cover|and photographed the plane as he did.
{13702}{13784}I dare say you're right.|He had a strong sense of duty.
{13805}{13865}He also had a strong sense of death.
{13880}{13977}I felt I had to confirm what I suspected|about the last photograph.
{13990}{14034}I'm very grateful to you.
{14037}{14133}That's over a year ago.|How have you been occupying yourself?
{14140}{14208}-After I lost the child I was-|-The child?
{14246}{14317}Didn't Tom tell you we|had a child on the way?
{14325}{14444}Men like Tom are often quite reticent about|things that are nearest to their hearts.
{14463}{14497}I understand.
{14518}{14589}It was quite late in my pregnancy|when Tom was killed.
{14592}{14657}Apparently the Palestine trip was too much.
{14659}{14730}I lost the baby in the|hospital at Jerusalem.
{14766}{14840}And then I went back|to my old profession of nursing.
{14842}{14937}I've just completed my tour of duty|with the US Public Health Service in Greece.
{14939}{15010}Very good. What are your|plans for the future?
{15032}{15135}I haven't quite decided yet.|I may travel a while before I go home.
{15161}{15254}I have passage booked on a freighter|that sails next week to Istanbul.
{15256}{15311}From there I may go to India.
{15333}{15389}I've always wanted to|see the Vale of Kashmir.
{15391}{15460}It's probably the most|beautiful spot on earth.
{15462}{15521}Mrs. Fremont, may I introduce Maj. Caldwell?
{15523}{15561}-How do you do?|-How do you do?
{15563}{15610}-Have a drink.|-Thank you. I'd love one.
{15613}{15694}-How did your disembarkation go?|-Smoothly.
{15703}{15754}We're really up to our neck in Jews, sir.
{15757}{15830}Karaolos bursting at the seams|and more to come.
{15836}{15916}I still say we should send them back|where they came from.
{15918}{15982}Two loads were shipped out of Haifa|bound for Hamburg.
{15985}{16032}I don't see why we can't do the same thing.
{16035}{16110}I shouldn't like to have a hand|in sending a Jew back to Germany.
{16113}{16157}Squeeze them in as best as you can.
{16160}{16228}They're squeezed in.|Short of bed space, supplies...
{16230}{16304}...short of nurses, short of temper,|short of everything.
{16306}{16350}Mrs. Fremont's a nurse.
{16357}{16418}Why don't you lend a hand at Karaolos?
{16435}{16497}No, General. I'm afraid I couldn't.
{16519}{16578}I've really been quite tired lately.
{16596}{16642}And I don't know anything about them.
{16645}{16678}About the Jews?
{16680}{16717}I feel strange among them.
{16720}{16754}In what way?
{16781}{16839}Now that you mention it, I can't think.
{16842}{16889}It's just a feeling I get.
{16902}{16986}-Will you have another drink?|-Thank you, no. I really must leave.
{16989}{17060}I'm touring the island|and my guide is very firm with me.
{17062}{17143}-I'll take you to your car.|-Thank you for the drink and the talk.
{17146}{17196}Drive by Karaolos on your tour.
{17198}{17285}Ring me if there's anything I can do|to make your stay more comfortable.
{17288}{17317}I will.
{17600}{17673}I'm very fond of the|old man. One of the best.
{17675}{17768}Makes it all the more difficult|to explain his little quirk.
{17770}{17796}Quirk?
{17798}{17873}About the Jews.|You caught it all right. I was watching.
{17906}{17973}Almost makes one believe the story|one hears now and then.
{17976}{18017}Probably nonsense, but still...
{18019}{18045}What story?
{18056}{18159}That if you gave a good shake to his|family tree, you'd find a Jew up there.
{18351}{18417}Please tell Gen. Sutherland|I've changed my mind.
{18420}{18489}I'll be happy to work at|Karaolos for a few days.
{18491}{18537}-Goodbye, Major.|-Goodbye.
{20325}{20382}-Do you need any help?|-No, thanks.
{20392}{20474}-Good night, then.|-Good night, and thanks for stopping.
{21015}{21065}Ari! Ari Ben Canaan!
{21067}{21121}-Reuben. How are you?|-Fine.
{21162}{21200}The car's up there.
{21208}{21264}Good. We'll go directly to Mandria.
{21266}{21344}We can't, Ari.|He's on the other side of the island.
{21346}{21450}-He won't be back until tomorrow.|-He should be on this side of the island.
{22135}{22198}British checkpoint, Jewish checkpoint.
{22202}{22270}We don't allow our military personnel|in the camp area...
{22273}{22325}...unless something extraordinary occurs.
{22327}{22400}We handle the outside.|The inside's up to them.
{22414}{22501}-Lieutenant, this is Katherine Fremont.|-How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?
{22503}{22577}American. Authority Gen. Sutherland.|Pass her at all times.
{22579}{22631}-Very good, sir.|-Thank you.
{22773}{22851}These Zionist organizations,|or whatever they call them...
{22854}{22946}...send their own people over from Palestine|to administer these camps.
{22949}{23020}Jews seem to respond|better to their own kind.
{23023}{23061}Perhaps we all do.
{23064}{23165}We even give them the privilege|of approving all Gentile personnel.
{23176}{23235}-I hope you don't mind.|-Not at all.
{23391}{23440}-Good morning, Ben Ami.|-Good morning, sir.
{23442}{23513}This is Mrs. Fremont,|an American friend of Gen. Sutherland.
{23515}{23557}-How do you do?|-How do you do?
{23560}{23626}Ben Ami is one of the Palestinians|who run this camp.
{23629}{23745}Mrs. Fremont has a few days to while away|in Cyprus, and being an experienced nurse...
{23747}{23817}...the general thought you may find|her assistance valuable.
{23819}{23893}We find all assistance|of value, Maj. Caldwell.
{23902}{23974}-Would you show him your passport?|-Of course.
{24002}{24082}Any friend of Gen. Sutherland's|is always welcome.
{24085}{24154}Convey my respects to the general,|and thank him for us.
{24156}{24261}Of course. Goodbye. Good luck.
{24263}{24318}-Call us if you need us.|-Thank you.
{24321}{24370}-Would you care to come with me?|-Surely.
{24373}{24444}Yesterday's shipload|will double our hospital capacity.
{24446}{24520}It's very good of you|to help us get organized.
{25805}{25868}-Leave me alone.|-You're burning up with fever.
{25870}{25964}If you don't let us clean out the infection|you'll die, that's all.
{25966}{26067}After coming so far, you'll die|without ever having seen Eretz Israel.
{26070}{26146}I'll see Palestine before|you. Now leave me alone.
{26158}{26204}This woman is trying to help you.
{26206}{26255}-Do as she says.|-Who are you?
{26258}{26314}He's the Palestinian commander, that's who.
{26317}{26376}A Jewish policeman, working for them.
{26379}{26428}I know your kind from Auschwitz.
{26446}{26520}-You can't tell me what to do.|-We'll see.
{26524}{26580}-I'll hold him.|-Just try.
{26607}{26682}Dov! If you don't let|them help you, you'll die.
{26685}{26713}I want to die.
{26716}{26817}You don't know what you're saying.|I'll take them off myself. It won't hurt.
{26851}{26905}Keep away from me, all of you.
{26962}{26994}Excuse me.
{27055}{27123}I think I can talk to|him better if we're alone.
{27126}{27237}We came on the Star of David together,|and I know him. He's just shy.
{27262}{27318}Don't get too close to the glass.
{27532}{27612}Dov Landau, you ought to be|ashamed of yourself. Put that down.
{27614}{27643}I won't.
{27660}{27684}That hurt.
{27686}{27784}Not half as bad as it will hurt.|I'll teach you. I'll beat you all over.
{27790}{27861}Well? Do you let them|take care of you or not?
{27916}{28028}Not them. But if you want|to do it, well, all right.
{28077}{28107}Thank you.
{28166}{28245}And don't you ever spit on me again.|Just remember.
{28357}{28430}-It's all right, I'll do it.|-How did you change his mind?
{28433}{28488}Just patience and kindness.
{28546}{28638}Yetta will show you around.|Don't hesitate to call on me if I can help.
{28641}{28672}Thank you.
{28711}{28767}Now, this is pavilion number two.
{28916}{28948}Excuse me.
{28952}{29007}This boy has a skin|infection called impetigo.
{29010}{29094}-He needs sulfathiazole on those scabs.|-lf the camp has no such drug?
{29097}{29161}Leave him alone.|That will spread it all over his body.
{29163}{29228}-You think so?|-I know it. It's terribly contagious.
{29230}{29303}My dear, it's this way.|If you have no sulfathiazole...
{29306}{29360}...and no ammoniated mercury ointment...
{29362}{29464}...which was the earlier pharmacology,|you soften the scab with soap and water...
{29466}{29546}...and gently remove it like this, you see?
{29554}{29633}Then expose the lesion|for five minutes to the sun.
{29642}{29683}That's also a cure.
{29714}{29771}-You're a doctor.|-By coincidence.
{29788}{29845}It was stupid of me to interfere.
{29847}{29941}I'm a nurse. I'll be working here|for a while. Please forgive me.
{29958}{30016}Dr. Odenheim, it's time for you to rest.
{30018}{30088}You've been up all night.|I know how to do this.
{30090}{30174}-He taught me on the ship.|-Thank you, child of light.
{30200}{30280}I'll find you something to wear|over your dress, a gown or an apron.
{30282}{30315}Thank you.
{30354}{30427}My name is Katherine Fremont. I'm a nurse.
{30466}{30543}-You can call me Kitty.|-My name's Karen Hansen.
{30553}{30581}Hansen?
{30609}{30697}-Then your mother was Jewish?|-Yes, and my father.
{31346}{31375}-Reuben.|-Shalom, Ari.
{31378}{31434}-David, how are you?|-Shalom, Ari.
{31455}{31527}-Mr. Mandria, this is Ari Ben Canaan.|-Welcome.
{31544}{31588}Very pleased to meet you.
{31589}{31633}We've heard good things|about you in Palestine.
{31636}{31697}-Rumors. But I like them.|-So do we.
{31702}{31741}Please sit down.
{31766}{31807}-Cigar?|-No, thanks.
{31825}{31896}Well, David,|how many people have you got by now...
{31898}{31950}...in that barbed wire jungle of yours?
{31953}{31988}Over 30,000.
{31990}{32068}And they're building for 30,000 more|on the other side of the island.
{32070}{32129}How many arrived yesterday|on the Star of David?
{32131}{32166}Six hundred and eleven.
{32168}{32271}We're going to take the same 611 off|the island and land them in Palestine.
{32306}{32374}-Six hundred and eleven?|-He thinks he's Moses.
{32398}{32484}We haven't been able to break more|than 10 or 15 at a time out of Karaolos.
{32486}{32566}This will be a new experience.|One thing more. There's a time limit.
{32569}{32643}Today is Tuesday.|We'll stage the break next Monday.
{32646}{32705}-Next Monday?|-Why not tomorrow?
{32720}{32756}Ari, we cannot do it.
{32758}{32822}The United Nations|will vote on the Palestine issue...
{32825}{32860}...before the end of this session.
{32862}{32927}Between now and then|we have to show the world...
{32930}{32979}...thousands of homeless European Jews...
{32982}{33061}...are not going to accept any solution|that bars them from Palestine.
{33063}{33161}A mass escape of the very same people|who arrived on the Star of David...
{33164}{33213}...is worth more than a million speeches.
{33215}{33282}But this isn't the Red Sea, Ari.|It's the Mediterranean.
{33285}{33370}Right. Smite these waters as you will,|they do not part.
{33373}{33436}That's why you'll have to get us a ship.
{33438}{33476}I want a legitimate freighter...
{33478}{33555}...with legal registry and real cargo|we can unload here in Cyprus.
{33558}{33597}A ship for six...
{33669}{33713}That's a wonderful idea.
{33765}{33797}Brilliant.
{33837}{33901}But the expense will be brilliant also.
{33904}{33929}Not too brilliant.
{33932}{33982}You know, our treasury|is based on donations,
{33983}{34033}and right now we're rather low.
{34074}{34187}-Well, can you deliver or not?|-I'll do my best.
{34190}{34299}We Cypriots are with you.|For the Jews, Mandria will do everything.
{34310}{34388}The Jews have paid you well|for your efforts, Mr. Mandria.
{34392}{34482}-Ari, you've got to understand-|-No, Reuben. I say it.
{34542}{34633}Do you believe that l, Plato Mandria,|would do this for money?
{34669}{34739}Do you think I'd risk|10 years in prison for money?
{34742}{34850}I tell you, it has cost me over £5,000|since I work with the Haganah.
{34861}{34910}You owe him an apology, Ari.
{34960}{35032}I do apologize, Mr. Mandria.|It was a stupid remark.
{35034}{35061}Not necessary.
{35064}{35170}If I apologize each time I get stupid,|I'd spend a lifetime on my knees.
{35180}{35272}-Also, we'll need 14 lorries.|-14, he says. Why not 1,400?
{35282}{35369}The British have requisitioned every car,|truck and lorry on this island.
{35372}{35412}Haganah makes mistakes|just like anybody else.
{35413}{35451}This is one of them.
{35454}{35509}David, I want to hear every objection,
{35510}{35566}every criticism, every|suggestion, but only once.
{35599}{35673}-Now the boat project is under way, right?|-Almost accomplished.
{35676}{35737}I will send a telegram|to a shipbroker in Athens.
{35739}{35802}-Don't the British monitor telegrams?|-Naturally.
{35805}{35857}But some of the monitors are Cypriots.
{35859}{35930}They'd like the Britons in Britain,|the Jews in Palestine...
{35932}{36028}...and the Cypriots in Cyprus.|Not, mind you, that I'm anti-British.
{36030}{36093}If I must have a master,|the British are far the best.
{36096}{36181}But the problem, my dear friend, is,|why have a master at all?
{36317}{36391}Shouldn't have hurt him,|Ari. He's a real friend.
{36421}{36474}Maybe, but don't let the Mandrias fool you.
{36477}{36538}They work for us and say|how terrible it was...
{36541}{36593}...that 6,000,000 Jews went into the oven.
{36595}{36657}But when the showdown comes,|we always stand alone.
{36660}{36709}Mandria will sell us|out like all the others.
{36711}{36790}We have no friends, except ourselves.|Remember that.
{36793}{36859}You're wrong,|but you'll have to learn that for yourself.
{36862}{36912}Now tell me, how is Jordana?
{36927}{36971}I think she's in love.
{36995}{37050}You've had this letter|since last night-
{37053}{37085}I forgot about it.
{37088}{37146}He's in love with her,|so he thinks everyone is.
{37148}{37181}He's right.
{37228}{37273}She mention me in there?
{37389}{37421}Thank you.
{37525}{37573}-No, thank you.|-None for me.
{37600}{37660}How did you know I postponed my departure?
{37662}{37758}Central Intelligence has a great talent|for spying on the innocent.
{37761}{37830}It'll interest them to learn|that I have a plot under way.
{37833}{37890}Good. Can you tell me about it?
{37905}{37974}There's a child at the camp|I'd like to take out for a holiday.
{37977}{38047}Just for luncheon,|and perhaps to buy her some clothes.
{38050}{38129}Then I take it|some of the strangeness has worn off?
{38157}{38206}I know it was foolish to say that.
{38209}{38287}But I can't help it. I do|feel strange among them.
{38298}{38398}Except for this girl.|Somehow she's entirely different.
{38401}{38465}Her point of view, the way she works...
{38470}{38548}...she acts, feels and speaks|almost exactly like an American.
{38550}{38605}I can think of no higher praise.
{38642}{38688}You're laughing at me, and I deserve it.
{38690}{38764}I'm not laughing. I'm simply glad it worked.
{38767}{38817}-What?|-I wanted you to get interested...
{38820}{38901}...in something|beside your own troubles, and you did.
{38914}{38976}It's interesting that you saw it so fast.
{38986}{39077}-Of course, you were absolutely right.|-I'm glad you weren't offended.
{39080}{39126}I shouldn't like you to become a woman...
{39129}{39194}...who drifts through|life, "fair to no purpose...
{39197}{39314}"...artful to no end,|young without lovers, old without a friend."
{39344}{39385}Do you have a solution?
{39402}{39488}If I were 20 years younger|I'd offer myself as a solution.
{39490}{39570}The Vale of Kashmir is no good|unless you share it with someone.
{39573}{39653}Places don't mean anything.|Only people are important.
{39655}{39710}Fill your life with people.
{39711}{39766}Let Tom return to the|grave where he belongs.
{39804}{39829}Fred!
{39856}{39915}-Yes, sir?|-There's a child out at Karaolos...
{39918}{39982}...Mrs. Fremont would|like released for a day.
{39985}{40022}What's her name?
{40037}{40063}Karen Hansen.
{40066}{40133}-See to it for me, will you?|-Very well, sir.
{40164}{40230}-Isn't it a little irregular?|-Extremely.
{40233}{40325}That's why I want your signature on the pass|instead of my own.
{40333}{40362}Yes, sir.
{40393}{40423}Thank you.
{41095}{41137}Isn't she a beauty?
{41156}{41201}You must have towed it across.
{41204}{41281}All right, she's no beauty,|but her heart is solid oak. You'll see.
{41283}{41308}Ari!
{41315}{41381}Hank, how are you?|Hank Schlosberg from Cincinnati.
{41384}{41444}He's run more ships through the blockade|than anyone.
{41447}{41518}This is Mr. Mandria, who|arranged for this tub.
{41520}{41590}-Not a bad ship.|-Not a good one, Mr. Mandria.
{41593}{41666}For the money we pay,|every ship cannot be the Queen Mary.
{41669}{41711}Can this abortion make it to Palestine?
{41714}{41777}On my mother's honor,|she has made 300 trips...
{41780}{41836}...from Cyprus to Turkey|under her last owner.
{41838}{41940}That's just the trouble.|We can hold her together for one more round.
{41946}{41989}I want a loudspeaker system aboard.
{41991}{42063}Get me a power unit|and six Almec-Thorston speakers.
{42066}{42120}There is no such equipment|for sale in Cyprus.
{42122}{42213}If you can't buy it, steal it.|Stock it with provisions for five days.
{42216}{42257}-For a two-day trip?|-Five days.
{42260}{42318}All prepared foods,|either canned or packaged.
{42321}{42361}The most expensive, naturally.
{42364}{42449}-Have you got my jeep yet?|-I told you, it's impossible.
{42451}{42518}A jeep is out of the question, absolutely.
{42526}{42632}-Need someone to overhaul the engine tank?|-No, my gang can take care of that.
{42635}{42674}-Mr. Mandria?|-Yes?
{42714}{42764}What about that jeep there?
{42772}{42844}That belongs to His Beatitude...
{42846}{42909}...the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Cyprus.
{42968}{43050}Steal it. Paint it. Hide|it till I'm ready for it.
{43410}{43502}The water's wonderful.|May I have another swim before my steak?
{43505}{43576}Just once more,|because we're due back at the camp.
{43579}{43642}-Is that the girl?|-Yes.
{43673}{43723}Swims just like an American.
{43762}{43808}-I'll buy you a drink if|you'll forget that joke.
{43809}{43853}I just had one.
{43855}{43888}She is nice.
{43930}{44022}Would it be too difficult to arrange|for me to take her back to America?
{44025}{44093}Not from our end.|We'd be glad to let them all go.
{44096}{44152}So long as they don't end up in Palestine.
{44154}{44205}Let me know when you've decided.
{44206}{44257}I'll get Maj. Caldwell|to arrange it for you.
{44261}{44292}Thank you.
{44362}{44389}Karen.
{44427}{44457}Coming.
{44721}{44795}Would you like to go to America?
{44806}{44884}Of course. Everybody likes to go to America.
{44908}{44946}Then you will go.
{44953}{45029}I'll cancel the rest of my trip,|and I'll take you with me.
{45031}{45105}And you can go to school there,|and later on to the university.
{45107}{45205}And if you like it, and want to,|you can become an American citizen.
{45207}{45254}You mean, go right away?
{45263}{45317}Perhaps. In the next week or two.
{45319}{45381}Meanwhile, I may be able|to get you out of camp.
{45383}{45441}I'll speak to the general tonight.
{45489}{45549}-What's the matter?|-Nothing.
{45573}{45619}You do want to go, don't you?
{45622}{45663}Yes, but I mean...
{45687}{45745}I must think about it a little.
{45755}{45840}-What is there to think about?|-I don't know.
{45842}{45920}But it's so important,|and I need a little time.
{45938}{45979}You know, to think.
{46031}{46080}Take all the time you wish.
{46131}{46199}-Kitty?|-Yes?
{46223}{46324}-Don't be mad at me.|-Of course not.
{46371}{46444}It's getting late. You|better finish your steak.
{46661}{46745}Fine thing, what you want to do for Karen.
{46759}{46794}She told you?
{46817}{46872}She is worried about her father.
{46902}{46962}I didn't know that her father was alive.
{46964}{47053}When Karen was six,|he smuggled her out of Germany to Denmark.
{47066}{47141}After the war she went|back to find her parents.
{47152}{47212}The Jewish Agency had records of the dead.
{47215}{47268}She found her mother on the Dachau list...
{47270}{47325}...together with her two younger brothers.
{47328}{47421}About the father there was nothing,|so naturally she hopes he is still alive.
{47424}{47471}Maybe in Palestine.
{47472}{47519}As a matter of fact, there|is such a possibility.
{47522}{47613}He was a very important scientist.|The Nazis could have spared his life...
{47615}{47698}...in order to use his brain.|But of course, who knows?
{47743}{47819}It's curious|that she didn't mention her father to me.
{47822}{47881}You must understand something|about these children.
{47884}{47956}Their past is scarred.|They're ashamed of it.
{47974}{48077}To have a parent who has been persecuted,|or killed in a concentration camp...
{48079}{48176}...is a reproach to them.|They feel guilty for having survived.
{48178}{48253}So they pretend the bad|things never happened.
{48278}{48353}To take such a child is|a great responsibility...
{48365}{48448}-...even a sacrifice.|-It's no sacrifice.
{48456}{48553}I'm alone. The insurance I got after|my husband's death is more than enough.
{48556}{48661}I didn't mean financial sacrifice,|although it's a good thing to have money.
{48663}{48718}No, what I meant was,
{48719}{48775}you will have to make|a sacrifice of yourself.
{48778}{48839}These children who have lost everything...
{48842}{48904}...spend their lives|searching for new parents.
{48906}{49016}Their need reaches out to your heart|as naturally as a flower turns to the sun.
{49018}{49053}And they trap you.
{49055}{49167}Because they've been so long without love,|they demand all the love you have.
{49177}{49254}Karen will drain you of|love. She'll exhaust you.
{49302}{49350}That's exactly what I need.
{49498}{49553}I'd like to go with you, Kitty.
{49574}{49617}If you still want me.
{50530}{50558}-Morning.|-Morning.
{50561}{50633}-Bowen, 23rd GT Company.|-What can I do for you, sir?
{50636}{50701}Afraid I'll to have to|draw rather heavily on you.
{50704}{50759}-Please have a chair.|-Thank you.
{50806}{50881}This does draw us down a bit.|Excuse me a moment.
{50895}{50940}-Operator.|-CO, please.
{50962}{50989}Won't take a minute.
{50992}{51051}I hope not. As you can see, I'm in a hurry.
{51054}{51121}-CO speaking.|-Hall here, sir.
{51130}{51217}I've an order at transport|pool, sir, for 14 lorries...
{51242}{51311}...4 motorcycles, 18 drivers and 18 guards.
{51317}{51367}Estimated use four hours, sir.
{51374}{51431}-What's this for?|-Transport from Karaolos, sir.
{51434}{51481}-Who is requesting this?|-Capt. Bowen.
{51484}{51568}-What authority?|-Sir Cecil Bradshaw, of the Colonial office.
{51570}{51627}-Yes.|-Countersigned Lt. Gen. Sutherland.
{51630}{51697}-Well, allocate it then.|-Yes, of course, sir.
{51699}{51754}-What's the query?|-I thought you might want...
{51757}{51805}...to draw extra transport|from headquarters.
{51808}{51874}-Don't babble on, man. Give it to him.|-Yes, sir.
{51877}{51915}And get on with it.
{51918}{51950}Very good, sir.
{51968}{52036}Smithers. Take this and|get it filled at once.
{52038}{52105}-Yes, sir.|-We'll have you taken care of in a jiff.
{52108}{52155}Can I order tea for you?
{52170}{52243}Rather prefer a gin and|tonic, if you don't mind.
{52781}{52847}-Bowen, 23rd transport company.|-Lt. Arnold, sir.
{52850}{52900}I want to see the|Palestinian camp commander.
{52902}{52943}Right this way, sir.
{53226}{53299}This is the Palestinian commander,|David Ben Ami.
{53302}{53342}-How do you do?|-How do you do?
{53345}{53432}We are relocating all the internees|from the Star of David.
{53434}{53477}Here are your orders.
{53510}{53566}Where are you taking these people?
{53569}{53652}Their destination is not|included in your orders, Mr...
{53670}{53714}-Ben Ami.|-Yes. Thank you.
{53717}{53785}These people have not recovered|from their last journey.
{53788}{53844}I cannot permit them|to travel again so soon,
{53845}{53901}just because of a piece of paper.
{53931}{53967}Piece of paper?
{54011}{54096}-This seems perfectly clear to me.|-Sir, some of these people are sick.
{54098}{54152}You will turn the internees over at once.
{54154}{54216}I'm sorry. I just cannot|accept that responsibility.
{54218}{54269}I'll take the responsibility.
{54422}{54513}-There, does that satisfy you?|-Of course, I don't approve, but...
{54516}{54577}...I guess it makes the record perfect.
{54580}{54649}Would you order him|to place all his Palestinian...
{54651}{54718}...administrative personnel at my disposal|while loading?
{54721}{54765}-Did you hear?|-Yes, sir.
{54780}{54843}You can call on me|if you run into any trouble, sir.
{54846}{54885}Thanks, old chap.
{54904}{54952}Well, let's get about it.
{55016}{55047}Attention.
{55099}{55184}All passengers from the Star of David,|listen carefully.
{55219}{55305}We have received orders|to evacuate you immediately.
{55315}{55422}I repeat. All those who arrived|on the Star of David...
{55438}{55493}...are to be evacuated at once.
{55500}{55606}{lease prepare to board the British lorries|now passing through the camp.
{55620}{55702}Report at once|to your nearest {Palestinian guard point.
{55966}{56037}What does this mean? HMJFC?
{56057}{56140}His Majesty's Jewish Forces on Cyprus,|what else?
{56938}{56977}-What's going on?|-Military police.
{56979}{57045}They're blocking the intersection|for through traffic.
{57047}{57084}I don't understand.
{57098}{57153}Go and find the commanding|officer, will you?
{57155}{57233}I'd better look into this myself.|Excuse me, Mrs. Fremont.
{57343}{57375}Stay here.
{57579}{57652}-Sergeant, clear the way for my car.|-Yes, sir.
{57780}{57829}I'm afraid this is most unusual.
{57832}{57889}We've had no warning.|I'll check with headquarters.
{57891}{57930}These orders are perfectly clear.
{57933}{58017}Signed by the Colonial Office|and countersigned by Gen. Sutherland.
{58020}{58065}What's this? The whole area's tied up.
{58068}{58097}-Who's in charge?|-O'Hara.
{58100}{58145}Permit me. Bowen, 23rd GT Company.
{58147}{58198}Special detail, orders of Gen. Sutherland.
{58201}{58245}Here are the papers, sir.
{58306}{58399}Well, Bowen, I see you're going to be|getting rid of some Jews for us?
{58402}{58482}-Yes, sir. Shipping them back to Hamburg.|-That's where they belong.
{58485}{58543}It's a German matter.|Let the Germans handle it.
{58546}{58605}Apparently the general's|had second thoughts.
{58607}{58649}Why do you question these orders?
{58651}{58719}I didn't question.|I just wanted to check with headquarters.
{58722}{58794}Countersigning is not the responsibility|of junior officers.
{58797}{58853}The acceptance of responsibility...
{58856}{58927}...is what makes senior|officers out of juniors.
{58978}{59030}-Let them through.|-Yes, sir.
{59044}{59098}Should have started this|policy two years ago.
{59101}{59169}I don't care about the|Jews one way or the other.
{59172}{59242}-But they are troublemakers.|-No question about it, sir.
{59245}{59301}Get two of them together,|you've got a debate...
{59304}{59339}...and three, a revolution.
{59342}{59391}Yes. And half of them are Communists anyway.
{59394}{59453}Yes, and the other half pawnbrokers.
{59463}{59549}They look funny, too. I|can spot one a mile away.
{59602}{59674}Would you mind looking into my eye?|It feels like a cinder.
{59676}{59706}Certainly.
{59769}{59863}You know, a lot of them|try to hide under Gentile names.
{59900}{59969}But one look at that|face, and you just know.
{59974}{60031}With a little experience,|you can smell them out.
{60034}{60125}-I'm sorry, I can't find a thing.|-Must've been my imagination. Thanks.
{60350}{60452}Maj. Caldwell, are they taking everybody|who was on the Star of David?
{60482}{60561}-Yes, ma'am, we are.|-Then Karen's on one of those trucks.
{60565}{60591}Karen?
{60608}{60630}Karen Hansen.
{60633}{60701}I have Gen. Sutherland's permission|to take her to America.
{60704}{60782}-We were on our way to pick up the girl.|-How old is she?
{60785}{60842}Fourteen. She was assigned to the hospital.
{60873}{60909}Yes, it seems to me...
{60912}{60952}Is that the girl that the...
{60954}{61028}...forgot his name, the camp commander,|was talking about?
{61031}{61107}David Ben Ami? Yes.|He knew she was supposed go with me.
{61110}{61187}I remember. He told me|the general had made arrangements for her...
{61190}{61247}...so I left her behind,|on my own responsibility.
{61250}{61313}-Very good, Bowen.|-Thank you very much.
{61351}{61421}I appreciate your help.|Convey my respects to the general.
{61424}{61456}That I will.
{61472}{61542}-Bit of a Jew himself, you know.|-Not really?
{61569}{61606}Good luck, sir.
{62330}{62378}Remember, I've been in Palestine.
{62381}{62442}I know what kind of life|she'll live, if she lives.
{62445}{62475}I grant you that.
{62478}{62567}Besides, she must have been forced,|otherwise she would've left a note.
{62570}{62641}We'll get her back for|you, one way or another.
{62667}{62717}With her consent, of course.
{62786}{62847}Who was in charge of this evacuation?
{62854}{62910}Chap named Bowen, sir. Capt. Bowen.
{62913}{62970}-What did he look like?|-Look like?
{62981}{63031}A well set up sort of chap.
{63035}{63094}Proper bearing, decent decorations.
{63141}{63179}Spoke like any of us.
{63182}{63265}-From what command?|-23rd GT Company, sir.
{63306}{63365}-Is anything irregular?|-Could be.
{63370}{63441}We don't list a 23rd GT Company on Cyprus.
{63460}{63503}You should have known that.
{63536}{63571}Yes, I should.
{63587}{63670}-Perhaps I made an error.|-It's human.
{63684}{63743}Who issued Capt. Bowen's orders?
{63764}{63836}They originated with Bradshaw|of the Colonial Office.
{63839}{63872}And, of course, you signed them.
{63874}{63978}-You examined the signatures?|-Well, naturally, and I countersigned.
{63981}{64016}I signed no such order.
{64018}{64099}Neither have I seen such an order|from the Colonial Office.
{64150}{64217}Well, those signatures must've been forged?
{64250}{64344}We can't exclude the possibility.|With one exception, of course.
{64346}{64456}-Your signature was genuine, wasn't it?|-Someone had to take responsibility, sir.
{64465}{64524}And you took it. Now you've got it.
{64534}{64591}What do you propose to do with it?
{64670}{64701}That boat...
{64733}{64771}That Olympia...
{64789}{64868}She's not going to Hamburg.|She's probably heading for Palestine.
{64870}{64903}Undoubtedly.
{64908}{64980}Telephone control, tell|them to block the harbor.
{64987}{65038}Take a look at the situation yourself.
{65041}{65076}Very well, sir.
{65126}{65167}Mrs. Fremont. Sir.
{65438}{65486}Let me have the microphone.
{65590}{65657}Attention, Olympia. Attention, out there.
{65681}{65734}This is Maj. Caldwell speaking.
{65743}{65782}Attention, Olympia.
{65802}{65855}You have no chance to escape.
{65862}{65957}The destroyer Zebra is moving into position|to block the harbor entrance.
{65996}{66032}Return to dock.
{66050}{66100}Otherwise we will board you.
{66171}{66245}We're bound for Palestine|with an American captain and crew...
{66248}{66309}...and a passenger manifest of 611 persons.
{66312}{66405}We're carrying 200 pounds of dynamite|in the engine room with fuses attached.
{66408}{66497}You let one British soldier step aboard|this ship and we'll blow her up.
{66500}{66548}Have you heard me, Major?
{66560}{66598}Message received.
{66637}{66703}Where would they find|200 pounds of dynamite?
{66716}{66776}-Get me Gen. Sutherland.|-Operator.
{66778}{66852}-Connect me to Gen. Sutherland.|-Yes, sir.
{66877}{66946}In an ammunition dump, you blithering idiot.
{66966}{67026}-Sutherland here.|-Caldwell here, sir.
{67038}{67150}The Olympia threatens to blow herself|out of the water, sir, if we board her.
{67164}{67245}I'm convinced it's a bluff, of course.|Boarding party en route, sir.
{67256}{67304}Call your boarding party back.
{67306}{67389}Signal the Olympia.|I'm asking London for instructions.
{67403}{67479}If she stays where she|is, no one will molest her.
{67610}{67698}They've threatened to dynamite|the Olympia if we board her.
{67708}{67756}Do you think they mean it?
{67767}{67820}Nearly two years ago, a Haganah ship
{67821}{67874}which we were detaining|in the port of Haifa...
{67876}{67967}...did blow herself up. 236 refugees died.
{67990}{68061}General, I simply must|get Karen off the ship.
{68071}{68132}Would you care to go on board the Olympia...
{68135}{68192}...and learn from the child|exactly what happened?
{68194}{68261}-Will they let me?|-I'll try and arrange it.
{68263}{68337}If I succeed, you can|do me a favor in return.
{68340}{68369}I'll do anything.
{68371}{68430}If force, or coercion of any kind,
{68431}{68490}was used to get that|child on board the ship...
{68495}{68569}...you must promise me to|tell the entire story...
{68572}{68637}...at a press conference|which I shall arrange.
{68640}{68693}-Do you agree?|-I'll be glad to.
{68778}{68806}Reuben?
{68820}{68898}Send this every 10 minutes,|and keep on sending it.
{68922}{68969}-Could we interrupt, please?|-Yes.
{68972}{69062}This is Dr. de Vries. We elevated ourselves|into a medical committee.
{69065}{69088}Good.
{69090}{69193}It's our opinion the sanitary arrangements|on this ship are hopelessly inadequate.
{69195}{69283}Unless we make some additional|bathing and toilet facilities...
{69286}{69334}...we'll have a serious health problem.
{69337}{69381}All right, we'll try to take care of it.
{69384}{69473}There he is. This is Mrs. Fremont,|from Gen. Sutherland.
{69482}{69533}-How do you do? Hank?|-Yes.
{69536}{69615}We have enough scrap lumber|to build privies on deck?
{69618}{69638}I guess so.
{69641}{69706}Ten-holers. Knock some|showers together, too.
{69709}{69732}Okay.
{69735}{69809}-Anything else?|-Not for the present, thank you.
{69819}{69861}This one to Haifa.
{69886}{69929}You wanted to see me?
{69931}{69965}Yes, Captain.
{69974}{70043}"Yes, Captain." His|Majesty's Jewish Brigade.
{70055}{70143}North Africa, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.|The decorations are real.
{70146}{70213}Is that what Sutherland|sent you to find out?
{70217}{70314}You lied to me about the girl.|She's not at the camp, she's on this ship.
{70317}{70359}And you forced her to come aboard.
{70362}{70429}-We don't force anybody. Tel Aviv yet?|-No.
{70431}{70455}Go on.
{70466}{70490}You're not listening.
{70493}{70578}I heard every word you said.|I lied to you about the girl. What else?
{70581}{70620}I'm taking her off this death trap.
{70622}{70717}Don't tell me what you'll do on this ship.|You'll do exactly what I tell you.
{70719}{70777}-Tel Aviv beginning to send.|-Fine.
{70784}{70841}How do you know the girl wants to get off?
{70851}{70911}I am trying to save a Jewish child.
{70929}{71011}Can't you understand that?|Don't you have any respect for human life?
{71018}{71082}Don't expect me to get hysterical|over one Jewish child...
{71085}{71203}...and don't you get hysterical, either.|You're late, lady. You're 10 years late.
{71214}{71285}Almost 2,000,000 Jewish children,|butchered like animals...
{71287}{71324}...because nobody wanted them.
{71326}{71393}No country would have them.|Not your country or any other.
{71396}{71458}And nobody wants the ones who survived.
{71481}{71539}Jewish flesh is cheap, lady.|It's cheaper than beef.
{71542}{71586}It is cheaper, even, than herring.
{71589}{71634}You and your respect...
{71650}{71693}Tel Aviv complete now.
{71706}{71765}If you can find the|girl, if she wants to go,
{71766}{71824}take her. Take a dozen if you want to.
{72664}{72692}Kitty!
{72766}{72829}It happened so fast,|I couldn't even leave you a note.
{72832}{72895}I had to go, Kitty, to find my father.
{72898}{72940}When you asked me to go to America,
{72941}{72983}I didn't know, and...
{72992}{73047}Kitty, we're going to Palestine.
{73051}{73124}Karen, you don't know what|it's like in Palestine.
{73126}{73182}And the British won't let you go, anyhow.
{73185}{73245}They'll have to, Kitty.|They'll just have to.
{73248}{73324}Because we're not going back to Karaolos,|not ever.
{73330}{73396}Then let me take you to Palestine.|I can find a way.
{73398}{73422}The man in charge, Mr...
{73423}{73447}Ben Canaan?
{73450}{73474}Yes.
{73477}{73557}If you want to come with me,|you have his permission.
{73571}{73621}I couldn't leave now, Kitty.
{73646}{73725}I don't know how to explain it|to someone like you.
{73729}{73827}But we all came here together,|and now we're trying to do something.
{73830}{73874}And I must stay here, Kitty.
{73877}{73941}Gen. Sutherland calling the Olympia.
{73978}{74041}This is the Exodus. Come in, General.
{74055}{74135}I have received instructions|from the Colonial Office in London.
{74138}{74208}No attempt will be made|to board the Olympia...
{74210}{74273}...but the harbor will remain blocked.
{74275}{74345}You may return to|Karaolos whenever you wish.
{74354}{74408}If you choose to remain in the ship...
{74410}{74501}...provisions and medical supplies|will be sent to you as you need them.
{74507}{74541}Message completed.
{74543}{74579}Not even now?
{74610}{74638}Kitty...
{74641}{74676}...I couldn't.
{74697}{74772}It's like leaving your|family when things are bad.
{74816}{74843}I know.
{74876}{74920}If you want anything, let me know.
{74922}{74984}Yes. Gen. Sutherland's your friend.
{74994}{75053}Tell him to let us go to Palestine.
{75247}{75348}They're just going to turn this ship|into another concentration camp.
{75419}{75471}Go back? Nonsense.
{75481}{75563}Did we escape for just ourselves alone? No.
{75572}{75658}We've done it for hundreds of thousands|of Jews all over Europe...
{75661}{75693}...who couldn't get out.
{75696}{75749}Also it makes news. World news.
{75751}{75810}I want your attention for a minute.
{75825}{75903}Now you all heard Gen. Sutherland|on the loudspeaker.
{75916}{75968}You must now make a decision.
{75971}{76008}You can go back to Karaolos...
{76013}{76096}The only way to go back to Karaolos|is by crawling!
{76106}{76150}...or you can stay aboard this ship.
{76153}{76222}Who are you making the propaganda for?|Them or us?
{76294}{76376}Quiet, please. There's another possibility.
{76403}{76467}You were picked by Haganah for this ship...
{76470}{76556}...so that your escape to {Palestine|would have some meaning to the world.
{76558}{76614}If you still want it to have some meaning...
{76617}{76712}...if you want to finish what we began,|you can go on a hunger strike.
{76714}{76781}Now you're beginning to make a little sense!
{76783}{76874}We shall tell to the British,|"We spit on your food."
{76958}{77054}And the little food we've got here,|we shall throw overboard.
{77138}{77238}We are going to Palestine,|or we're going to die right here.
{77294}{77340}Listen, please.
{77366}{77428}Now just stop and think for a minute.
{77442}{77521}To go on a hunger strike|is a very serious business...
{77535}{77564}...because once you strike...
{77566}{77638}...it can only end when you have won|or when you are dead.
{77641}{77748}What is so unusual about the Jews dying?|Is that anything new?
{77769}{77808}I stay right here.
{77819}{77889}There is no excuse for us to go on living...
{77892}{77954}...unless we start fighting right now.
{77968}{78031}So that every Jew on|the face of the earth...
{78033}{78107}...can begin to start feeling|like a human being again.
{78110}{78151}You heard what I said.
{78153}{78199}Fight, not beg!
{78213}{78241}Fight!
{78333}{78368}Wait a minute.
{78407}{78459}Everybody aboard this ship...
{78462}{78527}...agreed to accept Haganah discipline.
{78539}{78586}I am now giving an order.
{78598}{78634}We will sit down...
{78650}{78714}...and we will maintain|silence for 20 minutes.
{78736}{78803}Each one of us will|listen to his own heart...
{78806}{78853}...and to his brain, too.
{78869}{78913}And then we will vote.
{78939}{78991}We will now maintain silence.
{79367}{79420}I saw the people on that ship.
{79424}{79509}They're not dangerous.|They're just poor, miserable people.
{79512}{79560}Why can't you let them go?
{79570}{79660}You must understand that we British|have shown, throughout our history...
{79662}{79746}...an extraordinary talent|for troublesome commitments.
{79769}{79844}Palestine is a British|mandate imposed upon us...
{79854}{79898}...by the League of Nations...
{79901}{79976}...which makes us responsible|for keeping peace in the area.
{79978}{80089}The Arabs simply won't keep the peace|if we allow further Jewish immigration.
{80094}{80143}I don't know much about the mandate.
{80145}{80234}But I do know the Jews|were promised a homeland in Palestine.
{80248}{80295}During the First World War,
{80296}{80344}Britain needed and|accepted Jewish support...
{80347}{80389}...from all over the world.
{80392}{80425}In return...
{80428}{80515}...the Balfour Declaration of 1917|made such a promise.
{80521}{80604}That promise was reconfirmed|during World War ll.
{80611}{80695}This chap Ben Canaan probably wasn't lying|when he said he fought with us.
{80697}{80751}Thousands of Palestinians did.
{80759}{80832}How can you promise something|and then not deliver it?
{80856}{80932}England was fighting for her life in 1917.
{80942}{81019}Nations are very like people|in such circumstances.
{81022}{81102}They make promises|they're not immediately able to fulfill.
{81105}{81185}During that same crisis,|we made the Arabs certain assurances.
{81187}{81247}Hence, they have their claims, too.
{81255}{81344}The Arabs are fanatics|on the subject of Jewish immigration.
{81356}{81408}Just now, we need their goodwill.
{81412}{81481}-How is it ever going to end?|-I don't know.
{81499}{81567}The whole question now|is before the United Nations.
{81570}{81611}I hope they solve it.
{81614}{81708}The sooner I stop operating detention camps,|the happier I'll be.
{81712}{81794}That goes for every British officer|and soldier I know.
{81862}{81893}Thank you.
{81918}{81942}Yes?
{81980}{82010}The devil.
{82029}{82057}Of course.
{82059}{82149}Send a boat alongside at once.|I'll join you in 10 minutes.
{82192}{82261}They want to send 23|people back to Karaolos.
{82264}{82328}The rest have declared a hunger strike.
{82424}{82490}-Can I drop you at your hotel?|-Of course.
{83474}{83549}...a few news bulletins,|and an announcement.
{83553}{83656}The evacuation of 2,000 British women|and children from {Palestine...
{83665}{83721}...was ordered today by|the High Commissioner.
{83726}{83839}The United Nations Commission on {Palestine|still has not submitted its report.
{83854}{83897}The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem...
{83900}{83968}...who sat out the war as|Hitler's guest in Berlin...
{83970}{84065}...has met in Aley, Lebanon,|with representatives of the Arab nations...
{84068}{84147}...to coordinate action|against {Palestinian Jews...
{84150}{84208}...in the event {partition is granted.
{84226}{84325}The UN Commission on {Palestine|has arrived at Flushing Meadows...
{84328}{84425}...and is now preparing its final|recommendation for the assembly.
{84429}{84481}News of the hunger strike|aboard the Exodus...
{84484}{84565}...received front-page treatment|this morning throughout the world.
{84568}{84657}The British embassy in Washington|is already being picketed.
{84678}{84773}Now Dr. Odenheim has something to say to you|for the medical committee.
{84775}{84874}It is very important|that we save our supply of fresh water.
{84886}{84984}So we must ration it.|Every four hours, one cup.
{85000}{85081}On the other hand,|everyone must wash his body daily.
{85085}{85137}This will be done with seawater.
{85139}{85229}Your platoon leader will call|when your turn comes.
{85254}{85326}It is advised to conserve your energy.
{85341}{85431}So all necessary physical work|should be divided...
{85434}{85493}...among as many people as possible.
{85524}{85631}If at any time you should feel lightheaded|or dizzy, do not be frightened.
{85634}{85687}It is, in no respect, serious.
{85689}{85778}Just sit down|and lower your head between your knees.
{85808}{85874}All of us, of course, feel stomach pangs.
{85878}{85965}-They are uncomfortable, but not dangerous.|-That's right.
{85967}{86000}Final point...
{86003}{86100}...people can live a long time without food,|a very long time.
{86145}{86208}Attention, everybody.
{86234}{86328}Here is the news,|and some of it, I'm sorry to say, not good.
{86352}{86449}Dov Gruner and three other leaders|of the Irgun in {Palestine...
{86452}{86512}...were hanged today in Acre prison.
{86519}{86601}The United Nations Commission|on {Palestine is still delaying...
{86603}{86676}...its recommendations|to the General Assembly.
{86691}{86779}Winston Churchill has called on|the Labor government to end what he calls...
{86782}{86876}"...this squalid war against the Jews, "|with all possible speed.
{86899}{86960}-500 Americans picketed...|-Your water, gentlemen.
{86963}{87065}...UN headquarters in Flushing|Meadows, demanded release-
{87070}{87120}Your platoon's turn to bathe, Mr. Lakavitch.
{87134}{87170}Your turn to bathe.
{87178}{87248}Mr. Smolikov, will you please do me a favor?
{87250}{87354}Refresh yourself with my bath,|and then, little bit later, I'll take yours.
{87357}{87389}-All right.|-Thank you.
{87392}{87450}Sorry, Mr. Lakavitch. You know the rules.
{87453}{87533}-Can't you see the position?|-No exceptions.
{87558}{87622}I think you carry this bathing too far.
{87630}{87711}-No exceptions, Mr. Lakavitch.|-Fanatics!
{87737}{87817}...establishment of a Jewish state|in the Holy Land.
{87842}{87916}Thirteen leaders of our|National Committee in Tel Aviv...
{87918}{88004}...have begun a hunger strike|in sympathy with the Exodus.
{88017}{88104}When more news comes in, I'll report it.|That's all.
{88126}{88166}Have you time for me, Ari?
{88169}{88225}Always, Dr. Odenheim. What can I do?
{88227}{88268}We made a mistake...
{88278}{88364}...a bad mistake in letting the children|be a part of this.
{88367}{88463}A child's body grows every hour.|They need food more than adults.
{88474}{88527}Their blood requires more sugar.
{88532}{88576}What should we do about it?
{88578}{88640}When a mistake is made, you admit it...
{88658}{88720}...you analyze it, and you correct it.
{88754}{88805}Doctor, don't you feel well?
{88810}{88869}Who cares if an old man feels well?
{89371}{89398}Major!
{89412}{89485}-Who the devil are you?|-Jorgenson, of the UP.
{89491}{89545}-Thanks, Major.|-All right.
{89882}{89943}What is this?
{89951}{90024}-Information, sir.|-Information for whom?
{90041}{90132}For the tourists, of course.|One of our many special services.
{90172}{90221}And I suppose these are tourists?
{90224}{90289}No, sir. These people are contributors.
{90296}{90362}We are collecting|donations for the Red Cross.
{90365}{90420}Forgive me.
{90667}{90734}What did you say?|What were you two talking about?
{90737}{90765}I said to him:
{90767}{90845}"These are nice fat ones,|for this the archbishop will bless you."
{90848}{90905}He said to me, "l do my share."
{90913}{90960}Word for word, a literal translation.
{90963}{91055}Don't try to deceive me.|You're collecting all this for the Olympia.
{91058}{91140}-You see through me like a piece of glass.|-Complete waste of time.
{91142}{91197}They won't accept food|from us, nor from you.
{91200}{91290}True, but they will accept|from the Red Cross when they sail.
{91293}{91335}Perhaps you're right.
{91383}{91439}What do you mean, "when they sail"?
{91460}{91553}It was my poor way of expressing|confidence in British justice.
{91586}{91614}Good day.
{91979}{92061}You'd better go up and tell them.|Give me a hand here.
{92099}{92144}Let us through, please.
{92439}{92551}It gives me great pain to inform you|Dr. Odenheim has suffered a heart attack.
{92572}{92604}He is dead.
{92678}{92721}Shall I send it out?
{92818}{92849}Why not?
{92899}{92957}Professor Dr. Samuel Odenheim...
{92982}{93040}...head of the first clinic|for Internal Medicine...
{93042}{93142}...at the University of Vienna,|author of many medical textbooks...
{93155}{93231}...died today in the harbor of Famagusta...
{93267}{93324}...on board a cramped|freighter going nowhere,
{93325}{93381}because there wasn't room|for him on this earth.
{93390}{93441}Ought to make news somewhere.
{93589}{93669}Attention, please.|{prepare all children under the age of 13...
{93672}{93743}...for return to Karaolos. This is an order.
{93852}{93905}-Out to the ship once more?|-Yes.
{93907}{93986}You know, they're in their 92nd hour,|and starting to crack already.
{93989}{94048}-I didn't know that.|-Fading fast.
{94053}{94103}They never would have|started this nonsense...
{94105}{94157}...if Ben Canaan hadn't held a gun to them.
{94160}{94220}-Do you really think so?|-Undoubtedly.
{94228}{94306}Poor, ruddy beggars.|I don't see how you stand them.
{94468}{94529}Then let me ask you this, if I may.
{94562}{94621}Do you have the power|to call off this strike?
{94623}{94651}I have.
{94693}{94757}If a compelling reason turned up. Why?
{94765}{94800}Then call it off.
{94802}{94861}I've been talking to Gen. Sutherland.
{94864}{94939}He's a humane man,|but there's nothing he can do.
{94947}{95024}You've made the issue so flatly|that no one can help you.
{95026}{95110}I know it, I feel it.|Either you compromise, or you lose.
{95140}{95174}We won't lose.
{95189}{95246}If the British give in|and let us go, we've won.
{95249}{95330}And if we starve to death aboard this ship,|we've still won.
{95333}{95367}They'll wait.
{95379}{95470}They'll wait until you're too weak|and then come aboard and take you off.
{95473}{95568}It doesn't take much strength|to set off 200 pounds of dynamite.
{95589}{95650}You'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?
{95653}{95684}Of course.
{95701}{95781}Without any regard|for the lives you'd be destroying?
{95792}{95856}With every regard in the world for them.
{95862}{95903}I don't understand.
{95917}{95987}Each person on board this ship is a soldier.
{95999}{96093}The only weapon we have to fight with|is our willingness to die.
{96135}{96177}But for what purpose?
{96201}{96240}Call it publicity.
{96251}{96291}-Publicity?|-Yes, publicity.
{96294}{96345}A stunt to attract attention.
{96365}{96415}A letter to the newspapers.
{96433}{96526}A help-wanted ad to the official journal|of the United Nations.
{96557}{96636}"Wanted by 600 men,|women and children, a country...
{96654}{96703}"...a native land, a home."
{96720}{96766}That's all they're dying for.
{96769}{96827}Just to call attention to Israel...
{96829}{96897}...without ever having seen it themselves.
{96919}{96972}Does the vulgarity of it shock you?
{97035}{97120}You can't fight the whole British Empire|with 600 people.
{97134}{97160}It isn't possible.
{97163}{97223}How many Minutemen did you have|when they fired...
{97225}{97265}...the "shot heard round the world"?
{97268}{97309}-I don't know.|-77.
{97355}{97405}Look, please understand me.
{97437}{97479}I wish you could win.
{97488}{97577}I wish it were possible for you|to have a country of your own.
{97579}{97613}But it isn't.
{97619}{97666}You're offering the|lives of all these people
{97667}{97714}for something that can never happen.
{97717}{97772}I know. I've been in Palestine.
{97797}{97854}-When were you there?|-A year ago.
{97879}{97981}Mr. Ben Canaan, even if you get a partition|and a free Jewish state...
{98009}{98056}...the Arabs won't let you keep it.
{98058}{98141}500,000 Jews against 50 million Arabs?
{98160}{98190}You can't win.
{98261}{98304}You think I'm a fool.
{98322}{98402}But I came to appeal to you|to call off the hunger strike...
{98405}{98440}...and avoid a tragedy.
{98443}{98507}Why don't you appeal to Gen. Sutherland?
{98509}{98550}What can I tell him?
{98581}{98637}Tell him what God said to Moses:
{98650}{98741}"Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,|'Thus saith the Lord:
{98769}{98840}"'Let my people go,|that they may serve me."'
{98881}{98932}Exodus, Chapter 7, Verse 26.
{99013}{99089}We have been asked to talk to you,|Mr. Ben Canaan.
{99091}{99143}-Do you have time?|-Of course.
{99188}{99219}Excuse me.
{99541}{99609}We have made a decision among the mothers.
{99611}{99689}To send the children back to Karaolos now|will show weakness.
{99691}{99769}The British will see that we are|not serious people aboard this ship.
{99772}{99817}It doesn't matter what the British think.
{99820}{99909}I cannot take the responsibility|for letting children starve to death.
{99911}{99955}We will take the responsibility.
{99957}{100025}We will not send them back,|and we will not go back with them.
{100036}{100113}I'm sorry, Mrs. Frankel.|The children must go back.
{100121}{100195}You go back if you want to with them.|Now, that's a Haganah order.
{100197}{100293}You're an important man,|Mr. Ari Ben Canaan, but you know nothing.
{100296}{100381}Look at these babies of mine.|Born behind barbed wire.
{100412}{100464}For the first time they don't have to
{100465}{100517}look out through a fence|like little animals.
{100520}{100573}They are free now, and nobody...
{100578}{100664}...no Englishman, no Haganah,|will ever lock them up again.
{100667}{100719}Look at Mrs. Hirschberg here.
{100721}{100804}Hers will be the first,|when she has no more milk to give.
{100807}{100901}-Tell him.|-I will not take him back to Karaolos.
{100903}{101017}He will go to Palestine with me,|or here on this ship, we will die together.
{101020}{101063}I will not take him back.
{101336}{101396}When are you going to stop this thing|and let them go?
{101399}{101454}Unfortunately, I can't answer that.
{101455}{101510}The affair's entirely|in the hands of London.
{101513}{101593}But you don't like what's going on.|You know how wrong it is.
{101596}{101636}Why don't you say so?
{101637}{101677}Why don't you make a|public statement about it?
{101679}{101749}I can't do that, Kitty. I'm a soldier.
{101756}{101846}I know you're a soldier,|but you're also a Jew...
{101849}{101913}...and all these people|out there are Jews, too.
{101920}{102022}I don't like to disappoint you,|but I'm not in any degree a Jew.
{102037}{102089}-But I thought...|-I know the rumor.
{102092}{102135}There had to be some explanation...
{102137}{102204}...for my attitude|towards this unpleasant business.
{102272}{102377}-I'm sorry for flying off like that.|-You're getting to be quite a Zionist.
{102422}{102485}As a matter of fact,|I'm glad you did fly off.
{102510}{102596}You asked how l, as a Jew,|could let this happen to other Jews.
{102609}{102692}Now I find myself asking|how can any man let it happen?
{102697}{102769}Jew, Gentile, Buddhist, Mohammedan...
{102780}{102825}...no matter what he is.
{103173}{103266}Signal the air base.|I'm flying to London within the hour.
{103578}{103653}You know, you're an interesting woman,|Mrs. Fremont.
{103681}{103749}Sutherland won't let one member|of the press come aboard...
{103751}{103817}...and you shuttle back and forth|like a carrier pigeon.
{103823}{103867}I know you suspect me,
{103868}{103913}and I know nothing I say|can make you trust me.
{103927}{104005}But I wanted to tell you|that Gen. Sutherland has left for London.
{104008}{104080}He understands your situation,|and he is trying to help.
{104083}{104106}Thanks.
{104152}{104181}Is that all?
{104257}{104312}I heard of Dr. Odenheim's death.
{104322}{104389}I'm a trained nurse,|and I worked with him at Karaolos.
{104403}{104476}If I can be useful, I'd|be glad to stay aboard.
{104479}{104509}Without food?
{104552}{104615}I think I can go without|food as long as you.
{104716}{104768}I'm glad to have you on board, Mrs. Fremont.
{104805}{104873}Glad to be aboard, Mr. Ben Canaan.
{105755}{105850}Whatever move you make,|you were dead 10 minutes ago.
{105853}{105914}I asked for an opinion from Romania?
{106013}{106069}Do you think the British will give in?
{106078}{106121}We'll give in first.
{106134}{106179}These schlemiels.
{106197}{106262}Maybe they think they've been hungry|once in a while.
{106267}{106345}They don't even begin to know|what real starvation is.
{106352}{106407}If you hate these people so much,
{106408}{106463}why do you want to go|to Palestine with them?
{106468}{106540}Because there, Jews fight instead of talk.
{106608}{106689}When I get there, I'm|going to join the Irgun.
{106716}{106753}They know how to do it.
{106776}{106869}I'm going to blow up every|British installation I can find.
{106893}{106938}I'm going to kill Englishmen...
{106947}{107000}...and kill and kill them...
{107013}{107061}...till there won't be any more.
{107064}{107157}-But the British aren't all bad.|-They're rotten, the whole bunch of them.
{107169}{107217}The British, all the|Russians, the Poles-
{107220}{107256}-Not the Danes.|When I was there-
{107257}{107292}Them, too. Don't tell me.
{107294}{107326}That's not true.
{107329}{107396}The Hansens were Christians,|and they adopted me.
{107438}{107505}One little exception. That proves something?
{107508}{107605}There are lots of exceptions.|You just listen to me for a minute.
{107621}{107679}When the Nazis marched into Denmark...
{107681}{107753}...they ordered every Jew|to wear a yellow armband...
{107755}{107809}...with the Star of David|on it. And when they-
{107812}{107874}-That's the worst thing that can happen?|-I said, listen!
{107877}{107928}You don't know what you're talking about.
{107933}{108025}The next morning, when every Jew in Denmark|had to wear his armband...
{108027}{108117}...King Christian came out of|Amalienborg Palace for his morning ride.
{108125}{108169}And do you know something?
{108172}{108210}He wore the Star of David on his arm.
{108211}{108247}-But why|should-
{108249}{108286}And you know something else?
{108289}{108369}By afternoon,|everybody was wearing Stars of David.
{108380}{108491}Jews and Danes, and, well, just everybody.
{108537}{108578}Why'd they do that?
{108665}{108761}If you don't just know|why they did it, Dov...
{108793}{108856}...well, maybe that's what's wrong with you.
{109134}{109196}-Get the Olympia. I want to talk to them.|-Yes, sir.
{109229}{109283}Control Headquarters calling the Olympia.
{109323}{109380}-Do you hear me?|-This is the Exodus.
{109383}{109420}Stand by for Maj. Caldwell.
{109423}{109500}You are no longer interested|in your last rook, Mr. Lakavitch?
{109502}{109546}We pause for politics?
{109554}{109673}Gen. Sutherland, at his own request,|has been relieved of his duties on Cyprus.
{109689}{109782}I have just received a message|from the Colonial Office. I quote:
{109810}{109862}"His Majesty's Government,
{109863}{109915}having no desire to witness|needless suffering...
{109925}{110002}"...grants permission|for the Olympia to sail to {Palestine...
{110009}{110090}"...and to disembark its passengers|at the port of Haifa. "
{110123}{110146}That is all.
{110674}{110721}Ari Ben Canaan!
{113619}{113666}Well, happy landing, Mrs. Fremont.
{113669}{113744}-You'll find your luggage at customs.|-Thank you.
{113747}{113795}Have you seen Mr. Ben Canaan?
{113796}{113844}I want to thank him for|letting me on the ship.
{113847}{113920}He and the other Haganah guys|went over the side two hours ago.
{113922}{113996}Too many British soldiers|on the reception committee.
{114373}{114429}-Karen?|-Have you seen Dov?
{114439}{114479}No, not since he left the ship.
{114481}{114554}-He was assigned to Gan Dafna.|-He'll show up.
{114561}{114645}I'm going to the American consulate|and then to the Jewish Agency.
{114648}{114714}As soon as I find anything,|I'll come to Gan Dafna.
{114717}{114741}Gan Dafna, all aboard.
{114744}{114823}-Bye, Karen.|-lf you see Dov, tell him where I am.
{116578}{116601}Inside.
{116871}{116962}This is no accident, he's got the address|written down. Fetch the car.
{117021}{117096}Here, you dirty little Irgun swine.
{117828}{117858}Hello?
{117958}{117986}Shalom.
{118095}{118156}Yaov, take the dog out.
{118169}{118194}Again?
{118197}{118259}A boy about 17 just went into Asa's house.
{118261}{118336}They took him in a police|car. Get a look at him.
{120269}{120320}-What's your name?|-Karen. What's yours?
{120323}{120390}Edna. Come, we'll go up and eat something.
{121507}{121597}Now, if you will please|resume a little order...
{121609}{121716}...I will introduce a man|who has done more than any other...
{121718}{121792}...to establish our village of Gan Dafna.
{121795}{121844}Only 10 days ago...
{121846}{121920}...he was in London,|negotiating with the British.
{121929}{121984}Today he is home again.
{122001}{122103}I have the honor to present|Mr. Barak Ben Canaan...
{122105}{122165}...member of the Executive Committee...
{122167}{122235}...of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.
{122410}{122491}My dear young friends,|I know you're very tired.
{122493}{122578}You've had a long trip,|so I'm not going to make speeches.
{122617}{122680}It's good to have parties like this.
{122689}{122747}But it's also good to|know what you're here for.
{122750}{122824}You are here to learn. You are here to work.
{122826}{122891}You are here to build|a Jewish homeland in Palestine.
{122909}{123016}It says on the banner|"young heroes." Very fine.
{123041}{123147}But here at Gan Dafna you will find|that even the biggest hero...
{123149}{123249}...must work in the fields,|just like the littlest coward.
{123272}{123365}Boys and girls,|when I came to Palestine 47 years ago...
{123367}{123460}...it was not a musical reception|with little cakes served.
{123469}{123559}I came walking, with my little brother...
{123585}{123638}...all the way from Russia.
{123662}{123756}And over in that valley,|the swamps, and mosquitoes so big...
{123759}{123814}...they were picking|fights with the sparrows.
{123833}{123925}Now we have changed those swamps|into such fields.
{123929}{124011}On a quiet night, you|can hear the corn grow.
{124033}{124095}Oranges so big...
{124113}{124168}...five already make a dozen.
{124207}{124297}Over there you see the|Arab village of Abu Yesha.
{124316}{124382}In those days, my old friend Kammal...
{124402}{124445}...may God rest his soul...
{124453}{124503}...was mukhtar of the village.
{124505}{124582}And then one day,|he donated to us this ground...
{124585}{124637}...on which you stand, for a youth village.
{124651}{124723}So, we began to build this place.
{124740}{124812}And again it wasn't a matter|of little cakes and music.
{124814}{124883}It meant more sweat, more work.
{124907}{124936}Look about you.
{124942}{124988}You will see Arab children here.
{124990}{125069}Three of them, grandsons|of that same Kammal...
{125071}{125117}...the mukhtar who gave us this land.
{125125}{125194}It grieves me that he isn't with us today|to see all this.
{125197}{125269}But he's been gathered|to the bosom of Allah.
{125281}{125341}Speak always that name with respect.
{125350}{125469}With us, instead,|we have the son of Kammal, Taha...
{125471}{125526}...an honor to his father's memory.
{125604}{125698}Raised part of the time in my house,|with my own dear son, Ari...
{125701}{125794}...and with my dear daughter, Jordana,|who sits beside him in this place.
{125797}{125882}I want you to give particular attention|to what he's going to tell to you.
{125885}{125989}Here is Taha, son of|Kammal, since five years...
{125992}{126049}...mukhtar of Abu Yesha.
{126107}{126213}Thank you, Barak Ben Canaan.|Village president, Dr. Ernst Lieberman.
{126258}{126361}In this valley of Jezreel,|we dwell together as friends.
{126386}{126438}It is natural that we should live in peace.
{126444}{126516}Since even our words for it|are almost exactly the same.
{126521}{126568}We say salaam...
{126575}{126624}...and you, shalom.
{126663}{126757}Let us seal our friendship forever|with that most beautiful of Hebrew toasts.
{126768}{126817}L'chaim, to life.
{126837}{126860}L'chaim!
{127189}{127218}Come on.
{127297}{127329}Dov Landau.
{127374}{127446}Immigration says you're legal,|so we've no reason to keep you.
{127449}{127505}The Jewish Agency sent a bus ticket|and lunch money.
{127507}{127544}You're assigned to Gan Dafna.
{127551}{127593}You take my advice and go there.
{127596}{127649}Don't hang around Haifa.|You'll get in trouble.
{127652}{127691}Don't wander into the Arab section.
{127693}{127770}Or you'll run into the Mufti's gangsters|and they'll kill you, son.
{127773}{127813}They'll slit your throat.
{127822}{127869}And keep away from the Irgun.
{129398}{129505}-And then, after the ghetto was destroyed?|-I hid in the sewers for five months.
{129507}{129538}Eating what?
{129557}{129645}When I couldn't sneak out at night|and steal garbage, I killed rats.
{129671}{129711}And then one night they caught me.
{129713}{129768}-And they sent you to Auschwitz?|-Yes.
{129793}{129852}To what work were you assigned in Auschwitz?
{129856}{129919}I told you that twice already.|It was mostly clean up.
{129921}{129999}-Cleaning up what?|-The camp area.
{130004}{130073}That's all there was to do.|That and working in the kitchens.
{130081}{130173}And when Auschwitz was liberated,|you walked to Germany?
{130193}{130232}You asked me that already, too.
{130235}{130295}May I talk with the young man for a moment?
{130321}{130404}So you want to blow up British installations|for the Irgun?
Here dead lie we because we did not choose to live and shame the kind from which we sprung;
Life' after all' is nothing much to lose
Though young men think it is, and we were young.
Ha' ha, ha. What does this remind you of?
Remind you of anything?
You know when this war's over
I think I'll get me a job in the sewer; well it's the same smell, the same company.
The perfect soldier.
Aye, the perfect soldier.
Loved his country.
Killed rats.
- Killed lice.
Went without food.
- Without drink.
Without sleep.
- Without
Went over the top.
Killed the Kaiser, won the war.
Home again.
- Honorable discharge.
Fat pension.
- From his grateful country.
Women waiting for him.
- Children fondle him.
Liquor is free for him.
- He sleeps in the sun.
Remind you of anything?
Ha, ha, ha.
I suppose they think
I've let 'em down, Corp.
No.
I reckon I'M get a fair trial.
Aye.
It'll come out all right.
Aye, course it'll come out all right.
Well I'm sorry this lob had lo be wished on you, Charles.
It's not your fault.
If we weren't moving up so soon
I suppose it could all be a bit more formal.
That would make it all the more futile, wouldn“: it?
What? Well he is on trial for his life.
That doesn't make him original we're all on trial for our lives.
The only thing that makes him original is that he's failed.
Failed as a man and as a soldier.
The whole blasted thing's a waste of time.
If a dog breaks its back, you don't sit around chatting all day, you shoot it.
Er' excuse me, sir.
- Oh yes, come on.
What er what were you like as a child?
The same.
Is he in there?
- Yes sir.
Er, might I have a word with you, sir?
He's no idea what could happen to him sir.
At least, he don't give no sign of knowing.
I suppose he's bound to know' he's bound to know what he did; he's bound to know what could happen to him.
Have you been talking to him?
Yes sir' a bit.
I know it"s laid down we shouldn't.
Shall I come sir?
Is it necessary?
No sir.
My name's Hargreaves.
- Yes sir, I know you, sir.
Do you?
- Trores Wood, sir.
Worlencourt, sir, as well.
How long have you been out here?
Fourteen' sir.
Best pan of three years.
You know of course that you are entitled to the help of a defending officer.
Oh yes sir. Soldier's Friend.
I suppose I can be as much use to you as anybody else, subject of course to your acceptance.
No objection?
Oh no, sir. I'd, er I'd like to thank you, sir.
It's not as if you have to do it, sir.
Do you mind standing to attention when you are speaking to an officer.
I didn't think it mattered in here, sir.
Well it does matter.
Pull yourself together, will you?
Now you're Hamp, Arthur James,
Age'?
- 23, sir.
Occupation?
I I'm a soldier, sir.
I mean in civilian life.
Oh, er
I had a trade, sir, Boot maker.
Hand-made boots.
I come from Islington.
D'you know it, sir?
Yes I know it.
- Yeah?
Were you were you a cobbler all your life?
Since I left school, sir.
- At what age?
Twelve, sir.
Started young, as they say.
Were you a good one?
Oh yeah' yeah.
A good cobbler, yeah.
Me father and grandfather were cobblers before I was, see.
Me grandfather, he started it.
- Are you married?
Er' yes, sir.
- Any children?
Yes. ' sir
- How many?
One, sir. A little boy.
Do you understand why I'm asking you these questions?
You know best, sir.
AH right, stand at ease.
- Yes, sir.
L, er...
I I'd better ask you some questions about your about your home life.
Home life?
Well, we we never really had a proper home life, sir.
Er, we always lived with her mother.
Did you?
Were you on sit down, sit down.
- Oh' thank you, sir.
Were you on good terms with your wife?
Has somebody said something to you?
Would you mind answering my question?
About the wife?
- Yes.
She's took up with somebody else that's what I got told.
Who told you?
- I got a letter.
A kind friend?
- Yeah, Len.
I see.
- Len Wﬂson.
Lives just a couple of doors away.
Well that'll do for mitigating circumstances anyway.
Sir?
A reason.
An understandable reason.
- Oh.
Did you keep the letter?
- No sir, I hadn't thought.
Did you, er did you er did you mention this letter to anyone else?
Yes sir, I did. Yeah.
Er, Willie Bryson
Private Bryson in our platoon.
Did you know him, sir?
Er er no, I don’t think I do.
Oh. Yeah, he got killed, here at Paschendaele.
Er, did this er, did this trouble with your wife have anything to do with the with er with what you're accused of doing?
Er, no. sir.
I never thought of it.
Do you reckon maybe it was a reason even if I never thought of it?
- I don't know.
Thai's for you to tell me.
Oh.
I see.
This kind of story's so often true that, er well you you could be lying.
And I have to believe you before I can defend you, do you understand that?
You can believe me, sir.
It'll come out all right, sir.
Why did you volunteer?
- King and Country.
Sir?
Mm. They dared me.
Who dared you?
- The wife and her mother.
They never thought I'd go.
Yeah, I reckon it was that more than anything else.
I wanted to surprise them.
They got a surprise and all when I told them.
And of course er we..we didn't know what it was going to be like' did we'?
Well, I... I didn't think about it too much but I suppose you.. you reckon to yourself in my kind of life.
Well, it can't be much worse than this, you know.
Not you. sir. My sort and most of the lads.
But we was wrong.
Up there well
H's worse than anything, isn't it?
It's no worse for you than anyone else.
I know that, sir, I know that.
I'm only talking about it
'cause you're asking me.
Go on.
Well, when I volunteered we didn't know any better, did we?
What d'you mean by that?
Well, just a manner of speaking, sir.
You'll have to learn to be careful of your manner of speaking.
Yes, sir.
Funny thing is the fellows I come outwith do you know, there's none of them left except me
Loos. “
Loos that was the first one.
It was long side, that one.
Trones Wood
Gommycore
Worlencourt
Yeah.
And now this one here.
Passchendaole worse than anything.
Have you been wounded?
- Not properly, sir.
I was bleeding a few times and there was one time I got sent down to a G.C.S.
It was nothing much.
They sent me back the next day.
Of course you hear of fellows wishing they could lose an arm or a leg.
Same as everybody else.
I've heard of some of the lads that have tried it on themselves.
Have you tried it'?
Sir?
- Have you tried n?
Oh, no sir, no
Me and Willie er, Bryson, we was thinking of trying it once, but we never did.
It... it wasn't long after that, that Willie's number come up.
When? Here?
Oh oh sorry, sir.
I'm sorry. I've got to go someplace.
Corporal!
Sir.
- Latrines.
Yes sir.
- Go on.
Come on Hamp.
Right wheel.
Sergeant, get the rest of your platoon outside with their gear for de-lousing.
Come on, out.
- Right, sir.
Gear for de-lousing.
All out for de-lousing!
Come on!
Come on outside for de-lousing.
Outside with all your gear for de-lousing.
Come on, out!
Captain Hargreaves, prisoner's friend.
Prisoner's friend. A fair trial.
A fair trial and a quick death.
- Very funny.
Didn't you think it was funny?
Not funny if you're in Hamp's shoes.
Ready for you, sir.
I mm you he was a strange one, sir.
Attend to that, will you?
I wouldn”: be in Hamp's shoes.
If I'd done it, I wouldn't have got caught.
Right, get yer picks and shovels.
I've got a }ob for yer.
They still hanging around here, sir?
Thanks for the smoke, sir.
Did you expect to get away with it'?
Well, I wasn't really thinking about it, sir, one way or the other.
I just couldn't stand it anymore.
It wasn't the first time, sir.
- What?
Well, I I nearly did it once before.
I mean I thought of it.
Time of Worlencourt.
I got sent back on a water party.
I I was thinking about getting away but an M.P. got his eye on me, so I didn't.
And that was all?
- Yes, sir.
Supposing the others had, er cleared of-f and left you on your own at Loos or Trone's Wood?
I don't think it could have been much worse, sir.
All right then, we'll forget about that.
Tell me about the the last time, the time you said you couldn't stand it anymore.
What about that?
Well, the time this really started going in my head,
I got blown into a shell hole.
Two of the lads pulled me out with their riﬂes.
Well' I.. I..
I'd seen it happen to a bloke a couple of days before.
He slipped off the duck boards into the hole, you see, and he's bobbing up and down in the mud you know, like an egg boiling in water, with his pack on and everything.
Well I didn't help him, nobody did. It's laid down.
So of course, when
I gets m the mud
I thought that was my lot, see.
I was going to drown in it, like he did.
Sucked into it, fighting it, drowning in it.
Oh, after that I couldn't stand it anymore.
But the battalion was relieved.
You came back here for a rest.
- Yes, sir.
And you waited ten days until you went?
Yes sir.
- Why?
Like I said sir, I can't say it any different.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
- What, even out of battle?
It didn't matter where I was, sir.
Any place I could hear guns.
There's never anywhere where you can't hear them.
Yes sir.
Mr' Webb, he knew, he knew.
He he gave me extra rum.
Did you say anything to him about it?
Not much, there wasn't nothing I could expect a gentleman in his position to do, sir.
What he did, giving me extra rum, wouldn't have made any difference to what I did,
I knew I wasn't going to go back.
You mean you planned it?
No, sir, no.
I didn't have a plan.
I haven”: got the sense, have I?
Maybe one time I would have had the sense but er
mt er no, it's like being dead, sir.
Why did you wait ten days?
I don't know sir.
I didn't have a plan.
I went to the M.O. that time, yeah.
And what did Dr. O'Sullivan say to you'?
He gave me a number nine sir, for me bowels
I spit it out when he wasn't looking.
Maybe there was some sort of medicine that would have helped me but one thing I didn't have any need of was a number nine.
And did he give you any other advice'?
Well, he said I'd got cold feet, sir.
He said I was a soldier and
I should be a bloody soldier.
Mind you' I... I Ididn't expect any different.
I didn't expect him to say anything except what he did.
Why did you so?
Well, I thought he might give me some sort of tonic, something sir, to stop me diarrhea, stop me shaking, help me sleep.
It wouldn't have make any difference to what I did.
I knew I wasn't going to go back up the line.
Did you know the battalion was going back into the line before you went?
Yes, sir.
Is that what finally decided you?
No, sir.
- Then what did decide you'?
I dunno.
I just started walking walking away from the guns.
Did you know where you were walking to?
No... no.
After I got a few miles away from the guns
I got it into my head that
I was making for home,
Islington you know.
Er...
Er. didn't make any sense but that's what I got in my head.
I must have walked a long way because I remember
I took me boots off and me mg toe was kneading.
Then I was in a cart sitting on some potatoes.
Then I was in a train and some fellows was er was was playing cards.
Then I was wanking again.
Then I was talking to this priest but he was foreign. I didn't know what he was talking about.
It... it was like a dream sir.
I... I didn't know what was really happening and what wasn't'
Weren't you ever challenged?
Only when they picked me-up.
Not till then'?
- Oh' no no.
Didn't you hide in ditches and things to avoid them?
Oh, no, sir. No no.
Did they say anything to you when they arrested you?
Well, er just about me being a deserter and I heard one of them saying to the other about it being a shooting job.
Nothing else?
Well you see, there's nobody left in 'A' company that's been out here as long as me, sir, so they can't shoot me.
It's likely that you will be found guilty of desertion.
And I'd be failing in my duty if
I left the least shadow of doubt in your mind as to the consequences.
Well I don't reckon
I'll get off, sir, but they they can't shoot me.
Unless I can convince the court that you were acting under extra ordinary strain at the time when you committed this crime, you will almost certainly be sentenced to death.
This was the first time sir.
Mr. Webb; sir' he said I hadn't been a bad soldier.
He might say the same to them if he was asked.
Yes, he might
Yes, I thought that was worth mentioning, sir.
Can you think of anything else that was worth mentioning?
Er no, sir, no.
Did did I tell you about Willie?
Bryson yes, you told me about that.
Well, about about when
Willie was was killed?
You told me that he had been killed.
Well, I don't know if you can, er if you can tell them about something like that.
Well, it's important for you to tell me.
Well you see, I was alongside of him when it happened.
Same as many a time before, five' six yards away.
H wasn't the first time I seen a man blown to bits of course, it wasn't even as if Willie was anything special to me.
Well, just a bit, you know, because he came from up our street.
But that's all, I mean nothing special
One thing about Willie, it was quick.
I never saw it, sir, I was five or six yards away
I turns around and old Willie's nowhere, except over me.
Ooh, I tell you, they had to get me a new uniform.
This is a this is a question that I may have to ask you in court, sir.
I'm going to ask you now,
If they, er were lenient enough to send you to prison, could you be relied upon to do your duty when you come out?
Well I'd try my best. sir.
- I don't mean that.
Could you be relied onto go up the line, and stay up the line.
I mean that exactly, nothing, less.
Do you understand me?
- Yes sir.
Well'?
Do I have to tell you the truth sir?
Could you?
Can you tell me sir?
Can you tell me any way of being sure?
Prisoner's ready, sir.
Shouldn't take long, sir.
It's a bad business.
Who's in charge of the er later formalities?
One thing at a time,
Sergeant Manor.
Yes, sir.
Give us a hand with this.
What is it? Horse or mule?
- Pig.
If we was left to ourselves, we'd all be home in bed having it, wouldn't we?
I didn't say anything about
- Wouldn't we?
You can't win a war lying in bed, can you?
No but
- So you do what you're told.
Doesn't make sense.
- That's not our fault, is it?
Keep an eye open: cook.
- Pity to waste it on that lot.
Where's the best bit?
- This bit. Chopper.
Knife.
Dixie.
Right, well now we'll see what we can do for our officers.
The Brass have gathered.
- How's Hamp?
Oh they've got him all spruced up like for his wedding.
Cut himself shaving of course. him; we just push him over and watch him sink.
They won't do it.
Do you think they will, sir?
- No. I think he's had it.
I'm afraid he's had his mt.
Are you going to get the silly bastard off, do you think'?
He thinks so.
- I hope he's right.
I'll shall certainly do my best.
Oh don't misunderstand, my interest is purely personal.
I don't want my men used as a firing squad.
And I certainly don't want to be the
Joe Bloody Soap who has to shout 'fire"
Why you?
- Oh I'm number one on the Colonel's Sweat
List at the moment'
I see.
- When it comes to my turn,
I'll perjure myself for the man if you like.
The truth will do.
Good luck my learned friend.
Prisoner and escort Halt!
By the right turn!
Private Hamp cap off.
Corporal.
Prisoner and escort left turn.
Quick march left.
Left, right
Left wheel
Prisoner and escort halt!
Left turn.
873426 Private Hamp, sir.
Is that your name and number?
- Yes sir.
Mr Prescott, would you pass me that?
The accused, no. 873426
Private Hamp' Arthur James,
Soldier of the Regular Forces, you are charged with when on active service er... attempting to desert
His Majesty's Service.
In that you absented yourself from duty without orders from your superior officer, from approximately 0700 hours on October 10th this year at a mace called Jackdaw Tunnel until October the 11th this year when you were arrested by the military police at Calais.
Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty, sir.
Speak up.
- Not guilty sir.
Very well.
I have to ask you if you object to any members of the court?
Myself or either of these two officers?
I am surprised, sir' that as convening officer, you are also president of the Court Martial.
There are no other field officers available,
Captain Hargreaves,
I must appoint myself.
Are you making a formal objection?
No sir.
You may stand at ease,
Private Hamp.
Well sir, I've spoken to Captain Midgeley and we've agreed that I won't dispute the facts of the case.
So all the witnesses will be called by the defense.
Good. That will save the Courts time'
I submit that the prisoner absented himself at a time when, because of his mental health' he was not fully responsible for his actions.
Mental health,
Captain Hargreaves.
Do you mean that the prisoner is lunatic?
No: sir.
- Or mentally deficient?
No, sir.
There must be hundreds of thousands of men who are in an unhappy mental state but who have not absented themselves from their duty.
I realize that sir' fully.
I assure you.
Are you ready for your first witness?
Yes sir.
Call Corporal Hamilton.
Corporal Hamilton.
- Sir.
Halt
Hold the Book in your right hand.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Corporal Hamilton,
I believe that you apprehended the prisoner?
- Yes sir.
What did he say to you?
- Not much, sir. Only
Well he tried to tell us he was going on leave, of course.
Yes.
A soldier going on leave is required to carry with him a full pack and equipment, is he not?
- Yes sir.
And the prisoner was carrying?
Gas helmet, riﬂe and bandolier, sir.
Wouldn”: have stood much chance of getting on board a leave ship in that gear, would he?
No, sir.
Rather a silly story, wasn't it?
Yes, sir.
Then how do you account for it?
Well sir, he could have, for all I know he could have been just stupid.
Gives us the day off, though' doesn't it'?
I'm not going up to the front and leave that bloody bastard behind me alive.
Bloody, bloody rats!
Corporal Hamilton,
I presume that during the course of your duty you have arrested other deserters, of other men who have absented themselves from service?
Yes, sir. Quite a few, sir.
Did any of them behave in the same way as this prisoner?
Much the same, sir.
In particular, did some of them, to use your own words, did some of them appear to you to be stupid'?
Or behaving as if they were dazed?
Yes sir' I suppose so.
In short, was there anything remarkable or extraordinary about this prisoner compared with others?
Well, if there had have been something extraordinary you would have thought about it, wouldn“: you?
The thing that surprised me sir, was how he got as far as us.
By rights he shouldn't have had a hope.
He must've been through places thick with patrols like Poperinghe and that.
Perhaps he wasn't quite as simple as he seemed.
No, sir. I didn't mean
- After all, he did get very close to an embarkation point, didn't he?
That's all Corporal, no more questions. Thank you, sir.
Look at that!
There must be dozens of them in there, and too full to be nippy.
Shall I jump on it?
- No!
Right. When I say 'Now' thump the belly.
Now!
Captain O'Sullivan, do you remember the prisoner reporting sick to you on or about October 8th of this year?
On the 7th, yes. I looked it up.
Of what did he complain?
I remember quite clearly.
He complained of nerves.
- Nerves.
He didn't tell you he that he was finding it impossible to sleep'?
He may have.
Yes, I believe he did.
But you didn't take this very seriously?
No, ifs not uncommon.
It certainly isn't uncommon for me to be told such things.
You mean you didn't believe him?
Oh I didn't say that.
Every Medical Officer hears this kind of thing five or six times a day.
Did you believe this man?
' Why r-wot?
It seems a permissible question.
- Why not'?
Why didn't you believe him when he said he couldn't sleep?
I didn't say
I didn't believe that.
Very well. Of what other symptoms did he complain?
Well, he said he was off his food.
Said he was feeling a bit shaky.
- Shaky.
Uncontrollable bouts of trembling?
I don't know about
"uncontrollable?
You don'! know about it but did you bother to find out?
Are you challenging my competence?
I don't want to interfere with your defense, Captain Hargreaves but must you attack the witness?
It's not Captain O'Sullivan's competence which is at stake, sir, it's this man's life.
You said you didn't believe him; what didn't you believe?
Oh dammit, Charlie,
I knew what he was after.
Did this man lie to you, and if so what did he say?
I knew what he wanted' to be sent down the line.
Did he say so?
- Did he what?
Did he ask to be relieved from duty?
Not in so many words, of course he didn't.
And er how long did this interview last with him?
Five minutes ten minutes.
And after that you lost interest in the man'?
Well what do you expect me to do?
I haven”: got time for everyone's emotional problems.
But you were sure that an interview for five or ten minutes was sufficient for this case?
Yes.
- Why were you so sure?
Experience. My own judgment, of course experience.
And you usually prescribe the same treatment?
More or Mess. More or less.
Laxative pills.
A good dean out never hurt anybody.
Is that the only relief you can offer a man, laxative pills?
I'll prescribe one for you in a minute.
Captain O'Sullivan, were laxative pills in the slightest degree relevant to what was wrong with this man?
There was nothing wrong with him and I told him so
Did you? What did you say?
I talked to him man to man.
I told him he wasn't the first soldier to feel a bit jumpy.
I told him he'd be alright, back to normal
I told him to try to eat, to try to get some sleep.
Well what else could I say?
I told him to pull himself together.
Has the incidence of medical reports of this sort been growing recently?
I haven't got time for statistics.
Or diagnoses, it seems.
- No. No, no, no.
What are the symptoms of shell-shock?
Shell-shock is a different matter altogether.
Is there an exact moment in the life of a soldier before which he is not suffering from shell-shock and after which he is?
An exact boundary about which no two doctors will ever disagree?
An exact boundary on the one side of which a man is required by Army law to "pull himself together. "
Or on the other if he cannot, is liable lo be shot as a criminal. Is there?
This has nothing whatever to do with what we're all here for.
I must say Captain Hargreaves,
I agree with that'
Do you sir?
Then what are we here for?
A mock trial'?
That remarks entirely improper,
Captain Hargreaves.
I apologize, sir.
Proceed.
Does the term 'shell-shock' have an exact medical meaning?
Yes, of course it has.
And a 'five or ten minute' examination is quite sufficient time in your estimation to judge whether a man is or is not suffering from shell-shock?
It is not my job to maintain a Bedlam.
God knows you of all people should realize I've got no time for such rubbish.
Do you expect me to heave wounded soldiers to die while I cross question cowards?
What I am asking is is there not a borderline?
This is not a borderline case of anything, how many times have
I got to tell you?
This was a case of cold feet, funk, miserable funk, nothing more or less.
Are you sure?
- Yes'
I ask you most earnestly, are you absolutely sure?
How could a man responsible for his actions do such a hopeless.
Desperately stupid thing as this man?
When they found him, he was trying to walk home to England.
He might just as well have tried to clear a German trench single-handed.
Is it not obvious to you that this man had lost possession of himself?
You've made your point,
Captain Hargreaves.
Have you any more questions for Captain O'Sullivan?
No sir.
Captain Midgeley.
- Er, yes, sir, if you please.
Captain O'Sullivan, have any of the Defending Officer's questions altered the conclusion you came to about the prisoner when he reported to you on October the 7th?
No, not in the slightest.
In view of the speculation we have heard' will you now tell the court in your own words what that conclusion was?
- Yes'
I found the prisoner fit for duty, provided he was kept under discipline and discouraged from malingering.
And there's nothing you wish to add to your judgment now by way of qualification?
Nothing whatever. He's proved me right' hasn't he'?
And that's all there is to say about it.
He did tum and run, didn't he?
Thank you, Captain O'Sullivan.
Were you in the area between our billet and the cookhouse at 1600 hours today?
Yes, he admits he was in the area between our billet and the cookhouse at 1500 hours today.
Right Did you or did you not crawl up to Private Sparrow and take a bite out of his earhole?
No he did not crawl up the Private Sparrow and take a bite out of his earhole.
Right. Now one last question, if you had been in our billet today, would you have done a thing like that?
No, he's not that sort of a rat.
Captain Midgley, would you like to cross-examine the accused?
You've been telling a lot of bloody hes' haven'! you'?
No, no, I haven't been telling a lot of bloody lies.
You're just an ordinary rat who only eats dead ﬂesh, mm?
Mm, I'm just a normal rat.
Well then, if you're just a normal rat who only eats dead ﬂesh why, when all the other rats were coming out of the front end, what were you doing coming out of the back end'?
Oh, he's crying.
- Ah and after that his nerve had gone?
Absolutely.
I imagine there were others of your men in a similar condition at that time; were there not?
Well he must have been in a worse way than any of the others, sir.
But we dent know that he was in any worse condition than his comrades; we only know what he decided to do about it.
With respect sir, he did not 'decide' to do it- if you'll let me carry on..
- Continue.
Was the prisoner popular in his platoon?
Oh yes. He always shared anything he had, and he's the nearest thing we've got left to a founder member, of course.
And he...
Yes?
Well I was just going to say..
I don't supose it matters.. but er..
He brewed a damn good cup of tea.
Was he a good soldier before this happened?
First-class.
Near enough. Not a born soldier' but first-class.
And you were surprised when you heard that he'd absconded?
Oh yes I was.
From what you know of him, you believe he'd have to be a little unhinged to do what he did?
Yes.. I do.
Thank you.
No more questions sir.
- Captain Midgley?
First-class soldier.
- Yes.
His record Is singularly blank.
Neither good nor bad.
His principal talent as soldier seems to be in staying alive.
Well, surely we're not trying a man for staying alive, are we?
The War hasn't got to that stage, has it?
Mr. Webb.
Hargreaves here is the sole survivor of an assault on the Somme.
They didn't try him for that.
You'll confine yourself to answering questions, Mr. Webb.
I beg your pardon sir.
Mr. Webb, about this mental unhinging did you see any actual sign of it yourself?
Well, it depends.
- I mean if it had it surely would have been your duty to see that something was done about it wouldn't it?
Did the idea occur to you before he went absent?
No.. but he could have been ill in his mind even if I didn't see it beforehand.
Can you offer any evidence that he was?
He'd had & bedtime.
Er well I don't blame him. We all get the wind up sometimes.
I much prefer a man to boll beforehand rather than crack up under fire and endanger a whole platoon.
Mr. Webb.
Isn't it true to say, however much we may regret it, however much we may sympathize, isn't it true to say that this man simply allowed his fear to become his master?
There's more in it than that.
I ask you again.
Can you recall any evidence to support what you say?
I've said what I believe.
Thank you, Mr. Webb. No more questions, thank you, sir'
Very well.
- Sir.
Got it. Got it!
Broke its bloody back!
It's as though the Devil's got hold of me legs
He's pulling me down.
I'm not even wounded.
Pm not even wounded but I'm going to be drowned in the mud.
Oh, something had it in for me, I knew that.
Did this idea that the
Devil was after you did it stay in your mind after you'd been rescued from the mud?
Not in the same way, sir. no.
So it wasn't the Devil.
Then why did you run away?
I didn't run sir. I walked.
I just started walking.
I dunno why.
It's it's not true to say is it that you deliberately decided to desert that you deliberately decided and hoped to gel away with it'?
I wasn't really thinking about it, sir.
No. I know you weren't thinking about it.
No but I was hoping they wouldn't get me, of course.
But you really weren't you weren't clearly thinking of anything at the time, were you?
I just wanted to getaway from the guns, sir.
Had you any idea where you were going?
No sir not really.
I just wanted to get left alone for a bit, that's all.
Private Hamp you say you wanted to be left alone for a bit.
Does that mean you intended to return to the battalion?
I don't know sir.
That's because you you don't remember anything very dearly, isn't it?
That's right sir. Yeah.
You had no clear man or reason in your mind, did you?
I just started going, sir.
I, ya know I couldn't help myself.
Well like you told me to say, sir,
I was acting under extraordinary strain
I er... I er, can't think of anything else sir.
Is it all right if I ask you a question, sir?
Yes, carry on.
Well, I, I'd sooner you tell them sir.
You know more about it than me.
All right.
Any more questions,
Captain Harreavcs?
No, thank you sir.
Captain Midgley.
Private Hamp, did you know you were doing wrong when you deserted?
If anyone'd tried to stop me I'd have stayed, sir.
Well didn't you wait until you'd made sure that there was nobody thereto stop you'?
No, er, well I think
I was just lucky, sir.
That's very much a matter of opinion.
Look' what I really want to know is this.
You did know, didn't you, that it was your duty to stay with your battalion?
Yes sir.
- And you must have been very well aware of that all the time you were absent from the first moment you decided to decided to have.
I I don't know sir.
But you could walk, talk think like anybody else.
And you managed to get quite a long way, didn't you?
Like I just said, sir,
I was lucky.
Well let me put this to you quite simply, did you know what you were doing?
I I knew what I was doing, sir
And you realized that you were leaving your comrades at their posts who were prepared to do their duty while you deserted them.
Didn't you? Didn't you?
I've never done this before sir.
This was the first time.
No more questions sir.
That'll do, Private Hamp
Captain Hargreaves will you address the court now on the prisoner's behalf?
No sir.
I will address the court on its behalf.
The prisoner, when he did the thing for which he's being tried was no longer responsible for his actions.
This court is responsible for its actions.
It has not lost possession of itself.
This Court knows clearly what it's doing.
This Court has the power to choose.
Private Hamp is not a liar.
He's not glib, he has no ready answers.
He has an embarrassing honesty which made him a bad witness in his own case.
He could have put a bullet through his leg and suffered nothing more serious than a term of imprisonment.
He even told me he thought of doing so.
But he didn't.
He stayed.
A deserter in full consciousness of what he is doing, runs away to save his own skin and leaves his fellows to do the fighting and the dying for him.
This man is not a deserter.
He volunteered.
He volunteered because his wife and her mother dared him to.
Never mind - he volunteered.
He's been out here for three years.
Longer, if I may say so, than some of us have been.
He's seen it all.
A man can only take so much.
So much blood.
So much filth.
So much dying.
In the shell hole he thought he was drowning in the mud
He thought his time had come and it had.
After that he was no longer responsible for his actions.
He hadn't got the power to decide whether to stay or to go.
He had one instinct only left the instinct to walk.
To walk home To walk away from the guns.
They've become a fact of our daily lives.
So much so that we no longer ask each other why they're being fired.
Is this war so old and are we so old in it that we've forgotten?
Are we not fighting to preserve some notion of decency?
Some notion of justice?
To preserve for this Court the right to choose?
I beg to remind the Court, if justice is not done to one man, then other men are dying for nothing.
Matter of opinion.
Prescott.
You as our legal member advise the court on the law as it applies to this case.
The Court will remember that the soldier takes the law of England with him wherever he goes, and he's protected by it.
The accused does not have to prove himself innocent; the prosecution must prove him guilty.
If the members of the Court have any reasonable doubt but it must not be a fanciful doubt, they must give him the benefit of it.
You have before you the opinion of the Battalion Medical Officer which is that at the time the prisoner left the Battalion he was fit for duty and was not shell shocked but only suffering from what the doctor described as 'cold feet. '
You must not be unduly swayed by the eloquence of the Defending Officer, who has quite properly made out the best case he can.
If doubt that the prisoner really meant to desert, and you believe that he merely went absent without leave and intended to return after a few days, you will give a verdict accordingly.
On the other hand, if you are satisfied that the prisoner really deserted, it is your duty to find him guilty.
As to the stress the
Defending Officer laid upon the prisoner being a volunteer, neither must you be unduly swayed by that.
The Army is now composed of regulars, of volunteers and of conscripts, and one law applies to them all.
And it is the Court's duty to administer the law as it stands.
We will proceed immediately to our discussion of the case.
Private Hamp, 'shun.
- Thank you Captain Midgley,
Captain Hargreaves.
Escort fall in on the right of the prisoner.
Prisoner and escort left turn.
Quick march. Left right, left, right left
Thanks for cutting my throat, old boy.
Well you were overdoing it a bit, I couldn't help n.
I thought there was a great deal in what you said if I may say so.
Thank you.
- You did very well, Hargreaves,
I hope you got him off.
- I hope so too.
But you know, a proper
Court is concerned with law.
Ifs a bit amateur to plead for justice.
What do you want now, then?
Have you seen my rifle, Corp?
Well why would you be wanting that?
Well I just thought I might give it a clean.
You know, something to do.
The way they did the Court
Martial it could be anybody
You know, I kept forgetting they was talking about me.
Er er Mr. Hargreaves, he gave them a lovely speech.
"This man is not a deserter. "
Oh...
You've been twice since you got back already.
It's not my fault, is it?
Right. Guard.
Corporal.
- Latrine'
Right wheel
Help yourself, Mr. Morris.
Stand easy, Mr. Prescott.
Hm. Mr' Morris wishes to know whether we can find the prisoner guilty and recommend mercy.
Yes sir, you may.
And you may either confirm the sentence yourself or send it to a higher authority for confirmation.
I see.
Mr Prescott. Never mind.
- Thank you.
Er would you help Captain
Cartwright prepare a finding?
Er guilty of desertion but emphasize good conduct, length of service' that kind of thing but don't put in anything about mental health.
They're not interested in that sort of thing at Headquarters.
When you've finished, have it read to the prisoner and then send it off for confirmation.
Right, gentlemen.
Won't know anything for a bit yet.
It's got to go to the
Generals and that lot.
It'll be a week then.
They're all pinned down in Paris, you know.
What's Hamp thinking, I wonder.
If he's got any sense, he's not thinking
Whatever happens he's not going up the line again.
Do you know what he said when he got back?
"They're taking a lot of trouble over me. "
Feels bloody honored, he does.
Yes, they're taking twenty four hours to kill him.
Jerry wouldn't take that long.
He'll get the glasshouse.
Captain Hargreaves, sir.
- Yes.
I don't know if it's allowed, sir, but he says he'd like to see you.
Who?
- Private Hamp, sir.
Would that be legal,
Mr. Prescott?
Well, I I'm afraid it would be highly irregular, sir.
It would be kind.
All right, I'm coming.
Yes.
- Messages for the Colonel, sir.
I see. Come with me.
Excuse me, sir. Message, sir.
- Ah, thank you Mr. Webb.
Er go and get yourself something to eat, Corporal.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, your attention, please.
The Battalion will be moving into the line tomorrow morning at 06:00 hours.
We will be reinforcing a battalion of the Munster Fusiliers.
Captain Cartwright, would you ask all Company Commanders to come to my billet after dinner at er... 20:00 hours?
Right, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
Well, Hamp?
Sir.
Er.. it's just that I'd like to thank you, sir.
Er, in case er well you know I expect I'll get put in military prison, you know, and er in case
I don't see you for a while.
We, er we don't know where you'll be put, if you're put anywhere.
Well anyway, sir, I I wouldn't like to miss thanking you
You've taught me a lot of things, sir, and I'm very grateful.
Have I?
Rather too late, I fear.
AH right, thank you.
You, er... you haven't heard anything, have you, sir?
No.
I mean, after what you said they couldn't help but well it was the truth.
That's what I'm trying to say.
Nearly everything you said
I could never have said it.
No, I mean it sir.
It was my duty to s ay it.
Oh, I don't know about that, sir.
It was my duty.
If you'd remembered your duty none of this idiotic rigmarole would have been necessary.
Cant you get that into your head.
Don't thank me for doing my duty.
I had to just as you should have done yours'
Yes, sir.
It's not as if I haven't thought about it, sir I have.
I know what they could do to me.
It's just that er
I wouldn't be thinking
I stood a chance if it hadn't been for you.
Prisoner shun.
With your permission, sir.
Yes.
Private Hamp, A.J.,
Number 873426, it is my duty to inform you that the General Officer
Commanding in Chief has confirmed the sentence passed on you by the
Field General Court Martial.
You will suffer death by shooting on Thursday, October 22nd, at 05:30 hours.
When's that sir?
Tomorrow.
More wine, Midgley?
Er no thank you sir.
Would you excuse me now, sir?
Yes of course.
- Thank you, sir.
Some Haig over there.
Pure chlorine.
Oh, beg your pardon sir.
Rather shod on ceremony, aren't we?
Yes, sir.
I had too much of that today.
You know the verdict?
Just now.
You lost.
We all lost.
We're bloody murderers.
Don't be idiotic, Charles.
Pull yourself together.
Pull yourself together pull yourself together.
That's what they said to him today.
Pull yourself together, you're talking like a bloody doctor.
Aren't we rather overstepping, old boy?
All right.
I'm sorry.
But er why?
Hm?
Actually why?
Why?
- Mm.
Was it O'Sullivan's evidence?
You know he's an idiot.
Was was it my defense?
I... I did my best.
Very eloquent, Charles.
But nothing to do with the facts.
Facts, facts, facts.
You 're going to shoot that poor little bastard simply because he went for a walk.
That's all it was, you know.
It was a technical desertion but just a a bloody little walk, really.
And you know it.
Don't you?
These facts
“your battalion moving up tomorrow important to maintain morale.
Sentence of death to be carried out immediately. "
0 my God.
Pour encourager les autres, eh?
Has it ever encouraged anyone?
Discouraged anyone?
Of course it has.
Are you sure'?
No not quite.
Who's in charge tomorrow?
Jack Webb.
His man, his platoon, his mistake. Teach him a lesson.
By the way, I've written the next of kin letter,
I wonder would you mind giving it to Webb as you go out?
“There's a porpoise close behind me
And it's treading on my tail“
Huh?
Facts.
"When I am buried and all my thoughts and acts
Will be reduced to lists and dales and facts,
And long before this wondering ﬂesh is rotten
The dates that made me will be all forgotten. "
Hamp!
Hamp!
Is that you, Corp?
- Aye.
Now listen up.
Wilson and your lot, they've been nicking some rum.
Oh.
- Aye.
We've got some of the good stuff and all, mate.
Thinking about a booze up tonight, you know.
Well I thought you were bringing it.
No.
- Well where's rest of them?
Coming.
- You'll get into trouble
No to heH with that, man.
Shut the door.
What's this for, then?
Somebody's birthday?
Is he very religious?
I don't think so. Official
C. of E but
You'll be staying with him right through the night?
Of course, if he's willing.
Yes, well, I've laid on something which might prove just as useful
How does the idea strike you?
It's not for me to say.
Well I've spoken to the 0.0.
It's left to his discretion and he's left it to me.
So he said he said, that man in bed with my wife was me.
Was me.
There is no disgrace no disgrace at all.
Here today gone tomorrow.
It doesn't mailer who kills you, does n?
Well you know, you you've lived a long life,
Hamp, and you're due.
You'll rot tn the mud, and that's that.
It doesn't matter what anyone bloody well thinks about it, does it?
Hey, we're all moving up soon.
We'll be in the same boat as you are.
We'll all be rat food, before long.
Last drink in bottle.
Who's going to get it?
You'd think I was entitled to it.
Fire!
Come on. Come on.
- Right' Come on.
Come on.
Give it here.
- Come on'
All right, open up.
Where are you, you bastards?
Will you let me try to help you?
Do you want to talk to me?
God decides when it is our turn to be taken to him.
Will you be absolved of your sins?
My sins?
My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.
For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has left power to his church to absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him of His great mercy forgives thee thine of fences and by His authority committed to me;
I absolve thee from all thy sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
We do not presume to come to this thy table, 0 merciful Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in Thy manifold and great mercies.
We are not worthy so much as to gather the crumbs from under Thy table
But Thou art the same Lord whose property is always to have mercy.
Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the ﬂesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ and to drink his blood that our sinful bodies may be made clean by His body and our souls washed through
His most precious Blood and that we may evermore dwell in him end He in us.
Amen.
The body of our
Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee
The blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for thee preserve thy soul unto everlasting life.
Well where's the soul, Padre?
Here.
AH that's left here is a few hours of moody nothing.
Aaaaah!
This ground
Oh will grow
Oh will grow no more buttercups.
Oh
Quick march.

Isn't it finished yet?
No, sir.
I'm sorry.
Hamp, 10 Gifford Street,
Islmgton, London:
Deeply regret to inform you Private A. J. Hamp killed in action October 22nd the Army Council express their sympathy.
Secretary War Office.
Wednesday, April 16th 1746.
This is the advance battalion
of an English Government army of 9,000 men.
Their objective: Culloden Moor,
four and a half miles southeast of the Highland town of Inverness.
Their purpose: the destruction of the
Highland Jacobite army of rebellion,
a tired, ill-administered force of less than 5,000 men
who wait just beyond the top of this ridge.
Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Jacobite military secretary.
Suffering advanced debility and loss of memory.
Former military engagement
56 years ago.
Sir John MacDonald,
Jacobite captain of cavalry.
Aged, frequently intoxicated,
"described as " a man of the most limited capacities.“
John William O'Sullivan,
Jacobite quartermaster general.
"Described as " an Irishman whose vanity is superseded
only by his lack of wisdom."
Prince Charles Edward Stuart,
Jacobite commander in chief.
Former military experience:
10 days at a siege at the age of 13.
You must understand, without putting too fine a point on it, that the army here is in a total shambles.
I've got half my company missing.
I just can't find them.
They've gone off somewhere to sleep.
Your Royal Highness,
why exactly are Mr Sheridan,
Sir John MacDonald and Mr O'Sullivan
handling the administration of your army?
Because I chose them.
I consider those gentlemen to be utterly trustworthy and competent.
The first thing my men will find when they do awake is the enemy on them, cutting their throats.
James MacDonald, taxman.
Senior officer in a ruthless clan system,
who's brought with him on to the moor
men whose land he controls.
Alistair McVurrich, subtenant of a taxman.
Owns one eighth of an acre of soggy ground and two cows.
Alan MacColl, subtenant of a subtenant.
Owns half-share in a small potato patch measuring 30 feet.
Angus MacDonald, servant of a subtenant.
He owns nothing.
Lowest in the clan structure, he is called a “cotter.“
This man is totally dependent on the men above him in the clan system.
They, in their tum, on the taxman.
They, in their tum, on this one man,
the man who has brought them all onto the moor.
Alexander MacDonald, called, in Gaelic, MacDhomhnuill,
chief of the MacDonald's of Keppoch.
The owner of all his tenants' land,
the rem he has charged them is to fight with him as clan warriors
whenever he decrees.
This is the system of the Highland clan: human rent.
I hold my land from MacCruachan, as my father did, by bringing him 20 fighting men from amongst my tenants.
These I have brought.
To this man, who is rent, today's battle is a matter of honour.
I fight today because it is an honour to be with my chief, MacDhomhnuill, and because my father fought beside his father.
To this man, who is rem, the battle is a matter of revenge.
I fight first for MacDhomhnuill, then for Charlie.
Then because the Campbells, who did steal my cows, are with the enemy.
I have also raised over 100 men from Rannoch.
Some were unwilling.
With these, I used force.
Alistair McVurrich, told by his taxman that if he did not fight
he would have his cattle taken and his roof burnt.
This is the system of the clan,
a system that has brought on to the moor over 4,000 men,
men from Argyll and Inverness, from Moidart, Appin and the isles,
Catholics, Episcopalians,
Presbyterians,
the MacDonalds, the MacLeans, the Chisholms, the Camerons,
the Farquharsons, the Frasers, men of 14 major Highland clans.
Men like this.
Donald Cameron of Loch Eil,
chief of the powerful clan Cameron,
fearing for the survival of the ancient and ruthless society
to which he belongs.
Because he is here on the moor, most of the other chiefs are here.
Because he is here, Keppoch is here.
Because I feel that the Act of Union with England is a betrayal.
Because Prince Charles is a Catholic and I am a Catholic.
And the king in London is a Protestant.
Because Charles is part Scot and I am a Scot.
And the king in London is a German.
Prince Charles Edward Stuart,
the centre of all these men's hopes, himself half-Polish.
Age 25 and four months,
son of the exiled
James the Pretender,
he landed in Scotland nine months ago,
raised the clan army on a Highland surge of nationalism,
marched to Derby and came within an ace of toppling the Hanoverian dynasty
and regaining the throne for his father.
Though since forced to retreat back into the Highlands
and despite all evidence to the contrary,
Charles remains supremely confident
both of victory and his welcome by the English people.
King George ll is both a usurper and a tyrant.
He's kept my father's crown by enslaving all the people of this island.
He's deemed unpopular and I know that once victory is mine the people of England will welcome me.
Lord George Murray, age 51.
Lieutenant General in the clan army.
As their commanding officer,
this man forged the undisciplined Highlanders
into an army that not only almost reached London
but that also twice reduced superior English forces
into a panic-stricken rout,
first at Prestonpans, then at Falkirk.
Blunt, imperious, this man has bitterly quarreled with Charles
over the chaos in the army administration
and over the choice of this battlefield,
chosen by John William O'Sullivan.
Flat, treeless, devoid of shelter,
ideal for the employment by the British army
of its cannon and cavalry.
And from behind the shelter of these walls,
which O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,
Lord George Murray also fears both crossfire and outflanking.
Mr O'Sullivan,
in view of what Lord George feels about the battlefield,
have you inspected the ground yourself?
- No, I have not.
- Why not?
Because I don't deem it necessary.
It is a large, plain moor and, as such, it's a fair field for the enemy horse and cannon against which the
Highlanders will be defenceless.
I have informed His Royal Highness that it is a good field which I believe it to be.
I have told the Prince
I do not like it.
Your Highness, why are you fighting today,
when the ground here has been criticized by some of your officers?
Because God is on our side and I am convinced that my duty to my people lies in fighting today.
It's my opinion that the choice of the field for us is suicidal.
9,000 men, 16 battalions of infantry,
12 squadrons of cavalry,
8 companies of militia,
220,000 rounds of musket ammunition,
10 three-pounder battalion cannons,
800 three-pound cannonballs,
500 bags of cannon grapeshot.
This man's name is Fraser.
A deserter from the Government army, he still wears its uniform
but now stands in the ranks of the Prince's army,
amongst the men of his own clan and name.
He knows that, if he is captured as a deserter,
he will be immediately court-martialled to a sentence of death by throttling.
These are the Wild Geese,
150 exiled Irishmen
sewing in the army of His Most Christian Majesty,
Louis XV of France, the most powerful ally of the Stuart cause.
Brigadier General Walter Stapleton,
commander, Irish pickets of the French army.
Yes, we're here because
Prince Charles is a Catholic.
It will be a fine thing for all Catholics when Charlie's on the throne and German George is off it.
If we had a Catholic king on the throne in this country, then we could get back to living in our own.
You must remember that your Protestant king in London is passing penal laws against the Catholics in Ireland.
I'm from County Tipperary.
Now I've got to live in Boulogne.
You won't find a Catholic Irishman with much cause to love George ll.
William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, third son of King George ll.
Age 25 and one day.
Commander in chief of the Government army in Scotland.
Salary £15,000 per year.
Alexander Laing, private.
Salary sixpence a day.
Patrick McColman, three days ago a sergeant,
two days ago 800 lashes for looting, today a private.
John Mallaby, private.
Pressed into service.
William Roach, private.
Two years of his pay would not buy even the wig and hat
of the officer marching in from of him.
Joshua Ward, lieutenant, British army,
a fraternity where the least pretension to learning, to piety or to common morals
would endanger the owner to be cashiered.
I will now pass... in the middle of the second line.
Your Highness.
Give me a battery in the centre of the front line.
Alexander Laing carries a .753 musket,
firing a ball of one ounce and a third weight
an effective distance of 60 paces.
He carries sufficient ball, paper and black powder for 24 cartridges.
He carries at his hip a brass-hiked sword
and a bayonet with 18 inches of ﬂuted steel.
Alistair McVurrich carries in his right hand
an outdated dragoon pistol
for which he has no further ammunition.
What's the gun you're sewing?
It's a three-pounder.
Right now, it's downright useless.
Why's that?
We've only got 4 lb ammunition for it.
I tell you, it's chaos.
Half the ammunition's with the food.
That's still back in Inverness.
I haven't eaten for...
I don't know how long.
Ah, well now... that really is not my responsibility.
But, Mr O'Sullivan, you are the quartermaster general
and, as such, surely you're responsible for the distribution of food.
In normal circumstances, yes but now, as I am much pressed by other affairs,
I have given that responsibility to someone else.
When was the last time you ate?
Two days ago.
The day before yesterday.
This morning he killed a pig but wasn't allowed time to eat it.
I can't remember.
Andrew Henderson, Whig historian, biographer of Cumberland,
eyewitness of the Battle of Culloden.
The time is 12:15.
Now this wall, behind which we're sheltering, is at approximately right angles to the rebel lines.
I've drawn a rough sketch map here.
The rebel lines are here.
We are here.
And the Duke of Cumberland's army is here.
9,000 men in 16 infantry battalions
three of which are themselves Scot,
a total of 1,300 regular soldiers from the Lowlands,
plus, in reserve, the volunteer militias
of Stirling, Edinburgh,
Dumfries and Glasgow,
a further 8,000 men.
Charles Edward Stuart,
regent claimant to the thrones of England and Scotland,
has more Scots-in-arms against him than for him.
And, ranged against him in the Highlands,
he has the Whig clans siding with the Government,
the Munros, the Rosses, the MacKenzies,
the McLeods of Skye, the Sutherlands,
and here on the moor, the Campbells of the Argyll militia.
Here to fight Charles and his rebellion, here to take clan revenge,
Angus Ian Campbell,
wife murdered by the MacDonalds.
Alistair MacDonald, brother killed by Campbells in a cattle raid.
For him, loyalties to Charlie mean little.
For him, today's battle is a clan battle.
The swords those bastards use can cut a man in half.
Well, I reckon we'll have them this time.
- Why do you say that?
- We've got a new bayonet drill, see.
You don't poke at the man in front of you.
You poke at the man coming at your chum on the right.
That means, as he's lifting his sword arm, you get him underneath, like.
What do you think about the rebels?
Well... I ain't taken me clothes off for six weeks.
I reckon till we lay them bastards out I won't, neither.
I'll tell you one thing.
I know a lot of the boys make fun of our Billy Cumberland but I reckon he's all right.
He's a tough bastard but at least he feeds you which is more than some of them do.
I've heard said the rebels want to cut him as small as herbs for the pot.
Well... I don't reckon that.
They're a lot of friggin' savages.
Donald Gram, a farmer,
forced a month ago into the Highland army,
twice has deserted back to farm and family,
twice has been captured and forced to return.
Euan MacDonald, farmer,
forced into the Highland army the day before yesterday.
With him his son,
John Angus MacDonald,
the day before yesterday a ploughboy,
today a rebel in arms.
His age, 13.
I can't just make out what's happening in the rebel lines.
There's much confusion of movement.
Large numbers of men are moving about, changing their position... and there are large gaps in the centre.
It seems to me as though the entire line is completely askew.
Why is this?
We are all MacDonalds and, as such, we are entitled to stand on the right in the line of battle.
This is an ancient
MacDonald privilege and yet Mr O'Sullivan has thought fit to place
Lord George Murray's men in that position.
The main reason is that yesterday the Prince had an idea for a surprise march by night on the camp of Cumberland.
This we attempted. It failed.
But it meant that we were all up marching the entire night.
Consequently, the men are exhausted and are still stumbling into their positions.
What effect has this had on your men?
Look at them.
When did you last sleep?
As far as I am concerned, we are now putting an end to a bad affair.
The Scots are fair fighters until a crisis is reached and it's my opinion we've now reached that crisis.
With all these things amiss in our army, it would have been better had the
Prince made some plan for retreat.
Bu! Charles has made no plans for retreat.
He says that only those who are afraid can doubt his coming victory.
He puts from his mind the discontent of the MacDonalds,
the fatigue and hunger of his men,
the total outnumbering of his army,
the thinning of ranks by desertion,
the ill choice of battlefield,
convinced as he is of the invincibility of his men.
God is on our side.
Our cause is just and we will triumph this day.
The soldiers in the Elector's army know me to be their lawful Prince.
And so I'm convinced they'll break in panic, for they will never dare fight me.
Battalion, fix your bayonets.
Fix.
This man's name is Chisholm,
James Chisholm.
A private in the Government army, he is also a Highland Scot.
This man's name too is Chisholm,
Roderick Og Chisholm.
Fifth son of the clan chief,
he stands before his men in the Prince's army.
The Chisholm 500 yards away is this man's brother.
Charles Edward Stuart's war is a civil war.
They've started.
The rebel cannon have opened fire.
The cannon have opened from the rebels' centre and they're over-elevated.
Fire!
Batteries... from open sights... at will... fire!
Pull!
Fire!
Fire!
That's the Duke of Cumberland's cannons.
Cannonades all around me!
I'm going to have to shout to make myself heard!
The smoke is beginning to thicken.
It's going to be very difficult to see what effect our cannon is having on the rebel lines.
A cast-iron ball of three pounds' weight, fired from open sights.
This is roundshot.
This is what it does.
Pull!
Alistair McInnes, age 20.
Right leg severed below knee joint.
Malcolm Angus Chisholm, age 24.
Disembowelled.
Ian MacDonald, age 13. Shot.
1:12.
Dazed, indecisive, Charles has moved to behind
the right ﬂank of the Jacobite lines
and is now unable to see what is happening to his army.
Ordered by O'Sullivan to stand in the ranks six-deep,
the men on the Highland right
make a clear and tight-packed target for the English gunners.
Pull!
The rebels' artillery have stopped firing altogether and, before they did, we counted...
How many?
We counted 15 to 20 shots fired by our artillery for every one fired by the rebels.
1:17.
The second result of
O'Sullivan's administration.
The Prince's artillery, iii-fed by a sporadic ammunition supply,
ill-served by untrained amateurs,
ceases fire.
Pull!
Have you had orders to attack, sir?
- No, I've had none!
- Well, why not?
The Prince hasn't given any!
If he doesn't give them soon, he'll lose the entire army!
We're being shelled to pieces!
Pull!
Reload!
Pull!
Reload!
- What's the Prince doing?
- I don't know!
Nobody knows what he's doing!
1:22. Prince Charles Stuart, paralyzed with indecision,
still has given no order, either to advance or to retreat.
1:22. Clan Cameron,
200 men, shot to pieces.
Clan Stewart,
180 men, shot to pieces.
This is fantastic!
If this keeps up much longer, our gunners will have finished the whole affair.
The cannonade... The cannonade has given our men infinite spirits.
Clan Chisholm casualties,
47 killed or maimed.
This is incredible! Those men have been standing there for 22 minutes!
They're just lining the ranks!
The rebels are being literally blown apart!
Why are they standing there?
Why in God's name don't they run?
1:30. Still no order to advance.
Clan army casualties,
700 dead or maimed.
Charles Stuart hopes that by not advancing
he will tempt the Government army out of its battle lines to attack him.
1:32 pm. Cumberland orders a move
but not the one his cousin is expecting.
I want Wolfe's battalion to advance inside on the left!
Your Highness!
At 1:32, Cumberland places a battalion
behind one of the walls
O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,
to fire into the side of the clan army
when it charges the Government front.
This is the crossfire
O'Sullivan said would never happen.
Oh, yes, yes... Units of the Argyll... the Campbell-Argyll militia, yes?
And there are squadrons of dragoons with them.
Yes, it's obvious that
His Royal Highness has decided to have units of the Campbell-Argyll militia and some squadrons of dragoons to go down behind the south side of this wall, out of sight of the enemy, to take them in the rear and outflank the rebels.
Thus, also at 1:32 pm,
begins the outﬂanking movement
that O'Sullivan said would never happen.
29 minutes too late,
Charles Stuart orders an advance
along the entire from of the Jacobite army.
And you make the right side advance!
Bu! The message fails to reach the right wing.
Casualties, 850.
Have you still had no orders to attack?
No! I've had no orders!
I had a message from Mr O'Sullivan, which, as ever,
I failed to comprehend!
- The line's broken up!
- What?
They're charging, they're coming straight at us!
Sir, the right has broken forward!
The walls will hold them.
- They're going straight!
- Get down behing the wall there!
After 28 minutes of cannonfire!
What sort of men are these?
- Right! Change from ball to grape.
- Change from ball to grape!
A cylindrical canvas bag eight inches in length,
packed with musketballs and pieces of jagged iron.
This is grapeshot.
This is what it does.
Pull!
Pull!
It must be the grape! The centre has collided with the right.
There's great confusion, bodies flying!
They must be going to receive fire from our centre battalions!
Charge! Charge!
Fire!
Bastards!
God, they're almost upon us!
They're firing from this side and from this side.
They're been cut to pieces!
It must be chaos behind those walls!
Chaos!
Barrell's!
Towards this one regiment,
Barrell's Fourth of Foot,
heads the entire right of the clan army,
800 men in a solid clump,
running with a collision speed of over 12 miles an hour.
Alternate... firing!
Battalion, take care.
Fall in by rank. Take aim!
Rear rank, present!
Rear rank, fire!
Fire!
Front rank, take aim!
Front rank, fire!
Rear rank, present.
Fire!
Centre rank, present.
Front rank, present.
Remember, Barrell's, off to the right!
They've broken through Barrell's!
General Huske, advance Bligh's and Semphill's, support on the left.
Your Highness.
1:57 and the Duke of Cumberland sees the men of his second line,
placed there for just such an emergency, fire with crippling effect
into the Highlanders who broke through the from line.
1:57. Charles Stuart, who has made no battle plan at all,
sees, on the right wing, his men run from this concentrated musketfire
and sees, on his left wing,
the MacDonalds, tired, hungry,
rebellious at not being given their rightful battle position by O'Sullivan,
hold back from charging the royal army right.
Instead, they stand and taunt,
trying to tempt the royal army lines forward in disorder.
Battalion Pulteney's, make ready!
They're stopping to pick up stones!
Shoot!
1:58. The MacDonalds, dismayed at the sight of the advancing cavalry,
themselves draw back.
Keppoch, one of their leaders,
runs forward with other clan officers to encourage them
and is shot through twice by musketball.
About him, his men tum and run.
Time 1:59 pm.
The rout of the Highland army begins.
Christ, they're running.
They're leaving the field except for two small units, the French and the Irish.
Let them through. Stand your ground.
Guard, forward!
Oh, Jesus!
Front rank, present. Fire!
Re-form! Re-form!
Stand and aim! Fire!
Walter Stapleton, commander, Irish pickets,
cut down with 100 of his men
as the Scots about them run.
Where are you going, you?
Charles Stuart tries to rally his men.
"Pray stand with me, your Prince," he cries.
"Pray stand with me but a moment, otherwise you ruin me,
"your country and yourselves and God forgive you.“".
But it is too late.
At one minute past two in the afternoon,
his cause in ruins,
Charles Edward Stuart is led from the battlefield
by the man most responsible for his defeat.
As Charles leaves, a senior clan officer screams after him,
"Run, you cowardly Italian."
- Mr Fossett.
- Your Highness?
- You will order a general ceasefire.
- Your Highness.
Of the 9,000 men of the royal army
who advanced this morning from Naim with Private Laing,
an estimated 50 are dead.
Bu! For every one corpse in the royal army
there are 24 in the clan army.
Piled in layers, dead or dying,
are 1,200 men...
including the brother of Private James Chisholm.
There was scarce a soldier or officer of Barrell's Fourth of Foot
who did not kill one or two men each with their bayonets or spontoons.
Not a bayonet but was bent and stained with blood
to the muzzles of their muskets.
All witnesses agreed that, if grapeshot were the king of battles,
the bayonet was now the queen of weapons.
"It is mine and everybody': opinion," boasts a trooper,
"that no history can brag of so singular a victory."
How do you feel?
Don't feel nothing, really.
I feel all right!
Well, now it's over.
Battalion, take care!
Halt!
2:14pm. The battalions of Cumberland
halt at the lines held by the rebels one hour and eight minutes ago.
Battalion, shoulder your firelocks!
Three cheers for His Royal Highness!
- Hip, hip!
- Hurrah!
Thus has ended the last battle to be fought in Britain
and the last armed attempt to overthrow its king.
The Establishment has been saved, peace restored,
Church, Crown, trade and commerce safeguarded.
Thus the Duke of Cumberland won his only victory
and Charles suffered his only defeat.
His advisers are shortly to urge his instructions for reassembly.
"He is to reply, " Do as you wish.
Only, for God's sake, let us go.“
Charles Edward Stuart, his cause now in ruins,
has given one order too many.
Charles pitted these men against the modem musket and bayonet,
against cavalry and cannon.
Thus, in one hour, eight minutes,
he has reduced the ﬂower of the Highland clans
to twitching, limbless corpses.
2:30 pm and His Royal Highness, the Duke of Cumberland,
orders rum and brandy, cheese and biscuits for his “brave boys.“
For the wounded and dying clansmen on the moor,
there is to be different treatment.
All over the battlefield, whilst the
Duke of Cumberland eats his lunch,
any clansmen seen to be still alive
is either slit in the throat, pistolled through the head
or bayonetted and trampled on until, in the words of an eyewitness,
"the moor was covered with blood"
"and our British soldiers looked less like Christian men"
"than so many butchers."
What about some grub?
This rebel host has been most deeply indebted to the public for all the rapine, murder and cruelty and our men are heartily determined to give them receipt in full.
Cut him!
Cut him, you bastard!
Take him to the shoulder!
I'm letting my regiments of horse loose after the battle in order they may have some sweets with all their fatigue.
Thus nearly 100 people are to be butchered or maimed
on the road to Inverness.
Butchered whether or not they took any part in the battle.
They took my baby.
He's only two weeks old.
And one of them whirled him around by his leg... and threw him on to the ground.
This is Jean Clark, aged 28.
Cut about the face and body by sabres,
she was left lying for dead on the road to Inverness.
The soldiers came in and caught him, and Daddy too but I got away through a hole in the wall.
- How old was your brother?
- Lachlan was nine.
I don't... I don't know where he and Daddy are now.
Come on, you!
4 pm. Inverness.
James Rae: trooper,
Kingston's Light Horse,
the first man of Cumberland': army to enter the Highland capital,
the first man to show its inhabitants
what is to be expected from an Englishman
protecting his liberty and his Protestant religion.
There was these two men, shouting and screaming.
And then he came out and there was blood on his hands.
These troopers from the Duke of Kingston's Light Horse Regiment
are later to be commended by Cumberland
for their "zeal in the pursuit."
Each of them comes from Nottingham.
Each of them by trade is a butcher.
James Rae himself, who, like the other troopers of Kingston's Light Horse,
played his pan in the battle when it was over,
is later to return to Nottingham,
where his regimental colours are to be laid to rest
with great pomp and ceremony.
"To the perpetual fame and immortal memory
"of the Duke of Kingston's
Light Horse,
"where, amongst others, on the 16th day of April 1746,
"they performed many and glorious exploits
"in routing and entirely subduing the perfidious rebels.“".
"Long may the county of Nottingham ﬂourish."
"God save our ever august King."
April 16th. 10:30 pm. Inverness.
For William Augustus,
Duke of Cumberland,
third son of King George ll,
an evening of immense satisfaction and triumph.
At the age of 25, he has saved his father's kingdom
and redeemed the reputation of the British army.
At his table, older officers drink his toast and declare him to be
one of the greatest English captains since Marlborough.
His cousin Charles, until today the heroic leader of an armed rebellion,
is now a fugitive in the heather.
If further proof were needed of this young man's prowess,
it is here,
unheeded by him, four and a half miles away.
This is Lachlan MacDonald of Lochaber,
right leg severed below the knee joint.
He's been lying on the moor untended for 13 hours.
For most of the time, it has been raining.
This is Mrs Anne Hossack of Inverness.
Somewhere on the moor, amidst 1,200 dead and dying,
is her husband.
I don't know... where he is.
For Alexander Laing, private,
Barrell's Fourth Regiment of Foot,
this evening is also one of immense satisfaction.
His regiment has acquitted itself with honour on the field of battle.
He himself has despatched three of the rebels
and, above all, he himself has escaped death and maiming.
Lucky bastard!
Battalion will take care while the casualty lists are read.
It's all right for you, my lord!
This is Mrs Anne Walker,
wife of Private Andrew Walker, who was wounded in the ranks of Barrell's
and taken to the surgeons' lines.
This woman, also, has no idea whether her husband is alive or dead.
It is given out this morning of Thursday 17th April that the following officers and other ranks of Major General William Barrell's
Regiment of Foot were either killed or have since died from wounds resulting from the glorious victory inflicted yesterday over the rebel army.
Killed: Captain Lord Robert Kerr.
Other ranks: Sergeant Pullman,
Privates Baker, Barstow, Dyke,
Finch, Lowell,
Lawson, Meecham, Napper, Osbourne,
Smart, Williamson.
Wounded and since died in the surgeons' lines:
Corporal Lockhart,
Privates Davis, Pollock and Walker.
Battalion, take care.
Battalion will dismiss, save for the duty picket.
Battalion, dismiss.
You treated Private Walker a short while ago, Doctor?
Yes... Yes, I did.
What did he die of?
This one? He died of shock, if I remember correctly.
Why was that?
He was an amputee.
I had to take his arm off.
Do you know what... what is our young Billy's pleasure because we fought with such gallantry?
His Royal Highness thanks all ye officers and men for their gallant behaviour.
Get out of it! Leave off!
His Royal Highness releases all ye military prisoners who were this day in custody of the provost.
- Have you heard about the wounded?
- Well, yeh, some talk about it.
They're gonna pay 12 guineas out of the Duke's own purse for all those wounded in the battle.
For Lachlan MacDonald,
who's been now lying on the moor two days with a severed right leg,
there'll be no 12 guineas.
Orders for Friday 18th April 1746.
"A captain and 40 foot to march directly"
"and visit all the cottages"
"in the neighbourhood of the field of battle."
"The officers and men will take notice"
"that the public order of the rebels on the day of battle"
"was to give us no quarter."
Line up the bodies, men.
Come on, quick as you can.
There's another one over there.
The public orders of the rebels to give no mercy to the royal army
do not exist in any other form than a crude forgery
alleged to have been found on the field of battle.
All right, lad.
We're only taking you to hospital.
Bu! Whether he knows this public order is a forgery or not,
Cumberland makes it his excuse to authorize what now happens.
Battalion, present your firelock... at the man in front of you.
Fire!
The officer in charge of this execution squad
is himself a Scotsman.
Captain Scott, are many of the rebels being killed in this fashion?
As many as we can find.
I don't know how many men have been killed in this fashion.
I fear to think.
But just this morning I heard a Campbell officer saying that, in just one area, he himself saw 72 wounded rebels shot or clubbed on the head.
Yes, I saw what was done.
Did you agree with it?
No, of course I didn't.
I will always thank God that I had nothing to do with the black work.
You must try to remember that this is a most difficult problem.
I have talked much with officers from Lowland Scots regiments and they undoubtedly feel that these Highlanders are threatening their culture, their Protestant religion.
They're threatening to disrupt their peace and their commerce.
There's a great feeling of insecurity in the Lowlands.
These people still remember the Highland host.
They still remember the years of cattle thieves and murder, men coming down at night from the hills and extorting blackmail under pain of being robbed.
You see, the Highlander talks a different language.
He wears different clothes... and he undoubtedly has some uncouth and barbaric practices.
For all these reasons,
I think you'll find most Lowlanders hold the man from this part of the country in contempt and hatred.
Much more so even than the English do.
Why is your army treating the prisoners and the wounded like this?
Of yourself, it's been said you're keeping the prisoners in Inverness
without warmth, food and water.
And that you're even withholding medical dressings from them.
Surely this is against all bounds of humanity.
Look, I think the point somewhat eludes you.
These men are rebels and barbarians and as such are to be rated as cattle and treated as cattle.
Get that thing back out the way, please.
For three days and nights since the battle,
these men, many of them stripped of their clothes,
many of them dying from gaping wounds,
have been lying in cold attics and clamp cellars,
awaiting removal to the prison ships anchored in the firth.
The British army authorities
have withheld from them even medical dressings,
thus hoping to solve the acute lack of prison space
by ensuring the mortality rate remains high.
They get no food, no light,
no medical dressing.
Get their headgear while you're about it.
The belt here, too.
The smell in here is terrible.
This man next to me...
I think he's dead.
The way they are treating us, you'd think we were just animals.
Robert MacLean, salmon fisher.
To be tried without defence at an English trial,
of which he is able to understand not a word spoken.
His sentence, execution at York
by being hanged, drawn and quartered.
Check these shackles while you're about it.
Ranald MacDonald, farmer.
To wait in prison 14 months for a trial.
Then sentenced at Brampton to be pulled through its streets on a sled
and hanged, drawn and quartered.
Charles Edward Stuart, believing the Scots to have betrayed him,
refuses to listen to last-minute pleas
to stay and fight in the mountains.
Curtly and without a word of thanks he dismisses the Highland army.
In his saddlebags the last of the Jacobite funds,
which he has now decided to keep for himself,
his need, he estimates, being greater.
Alistair John Stewart,
to lie 10 days in prison, untended, with a broken leg.
To die on the 11th day of gangrene.
John William O'Sullivan, soon to be safely in Rome.
To tell King James of the good part he has played in the rising
and to promptly receive first a knighthood
and then a baronetcy.
Alexander Sutherland, never brought to trial.
Disposal unknown.
Lord George Murray,
who to the end blamed Prince Charles and his Irish administration
for the defeat at Culloden,
is soon to leave Scotland forever, forced to seek exile in Europe.
Prince Charles refuses to see him again and never forgives him,
blaming his opposition to his administration
for the downfall of the Stuart cause.
Bad day for us all, this.
Lord George Murray, estimated by some
as one of the most brilliant generals of the 18th century,
who, if left to his own counsel,
could perhaps have turned Culloden into a victory.
Keep in step, now!
May 23rd. The British army moves to Fort Augustus in the Great Glen.
From here, the centre link in a chain of forts and garrisons
stretching from Inverness in the east to Tobermory in the west,
from Bernera in the north to Dumbarton in the south,
the Duke of Cumberland mounts what he terms,
"the pacification of the Highlands."
Patrol of Bligh's, you will proceed on police action to Lochaber, with sufficient rations for two days.
All right, lads. Fall out and pick up your firelocks.
Move it!
Lord Sackville, what is the function of these patrols.
Their function is to march deep into the glens occupied by the rebels and their families and there, by vigorous police action, ensure that never again will these people disturb the peace of our land.
May 30th. A military patrol under Lord George Sackville
strikes deep into a corrie in Lochaber,
searching for fugitive rebel families.
This is one of them,
sheltering from the rain 1,500 feet up the side of a hill face.
Andrew McEachan, aged 25,
who stood at Culloden, and who now, because of the patrols,
has to hide in the hills like an animal.
This is his wife, child and a friend called Mrs MacInnis.
They have each been out in the open for the past eight days.
This girl is suffering from severe ﬂux
as a result of damp clothes.
The last meal this baby ate was a small fish caught yesterday
and shared between the children.
This little girl, forced to leave her home suddenly,
has only a thin dress, a damp shawl and no shoes.
At approximately 12 noon, May 30th,
the family is sighted by the patrol.
This is what happens.
Right, then!
NO! No!
I dunno.
All these officers keep telling us these people up here are a load of savages, but...
I dunno, they looked like ordinary women and children up there to me.
I didn't like it, what We did.
I didn't like it at all.
Look, let me tell you something.
I had a mate at Falkirk.
He had his head split open.
Like that.
So don't try and make me go all weeping, like, over what happens to these bastards. Eh?
Just don't try it!
Well satisfied with the result of his military occupation,
Cumberland is to leave
Scotland on July 18th.
He leaves behind him, to finish the destruction of the rebel clans,
not only an immense concentration of English and Lowland troops,
not only the zealous help of all the Whig clans,
but even the help of the chief of a rebel clan, Ludovick Grant,
son of the Gram clan chief,
who has hastily reorganized his loyalties
and just delivered 82 of his own rebel clansmen to Cumberland
for transportation to the Barbados,
as proof of his unswerving allegiance to the Crown.
Cumberland himself is to receive from London a tumultuous welcome.
From the Government, a raise in salary of £25,000.
From George Frederick Handel a choral work,
See The Conquering Hero Comes.
From the public, his name for a ﬂower, Sweet William.
From the Scots, his name for a weed, Stinking Billy.
Month after month, the British army patrols
scour every hill range and glen of northern Scotland
in an attempt, as Cumberland puts it,
"to wear down this generation until there be peace in the land.“".
The patrols leave behind them a trail of brutality and suffering
that is to earn for their commander undying loathing
and the epithet
Cumberland the Butcher.
These three of his officers have already burnt, smashed, raped,
looted and bayonetted their way from Glenurquhart to Moidart,
committing, in the name of pacification,
the worst atrocities in the history of the British army.
Captain Caroline Frederick Scott,
Lowlander.
I agree with the senior staff officer, who has proposed that £5 be paid for the head of every rebel brought to Fort Augustus.
Major lain Lockhart, Lowlander.
Those found in arms are ordered to be immediately put to death and the houses of those who abscond are plundered and burned, their cattle drove, their ploughs and other tackle destroyed.
Lord George Sackville, Englishman, third son of the Duke of Dorset.
We have detachments in all parts of the Highlands.
The people are deservedly in a most deplorable way and must perish, either by famine or by the sword.
A just reward for traitors.
We hang or shoot everyone that is known to conceal the Pretender, burn their houses, take their cattle.
The Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart,
object of the largest single manhunt in British history,
now disguised as an ordinary clansman,
much addicted to the little bottle he carries in his hip pocket,
suffering from dysentery,
is to spend the next five months
scrambling amidst the rocks and hills of the Western Highlands,
sheltered by its people, who remain loyal to him and never betray him,
until, in September, he takes a ship for France and security,
leaving behind him nothing,
nothing but a legend,
"Bonnie Prince Charlie."
My bonnie moorhen
My bonnie moorhen.
Up in the grey hill
Down in the glen.
Charles Edward Stuart, the “bonnie moorhen, “
is to walk out of the lives of the people he has led into so much suffering
with scarcely a backward look in their direction.
The year of the Prince had ended
but for the English Government, this was just the beginning.
Systematically and with clue parliamentary legislation,
they proceeded to eliminate ail the things that made this man unique
and that gave him the strength they so feared.
They penalized the wearing of his Highland dress,
penalized the weaving of his Highland tartan,
penalized the worshipping at his Church,
penalized the carrying of his weapons,
penalized the playing of his music.
They removed the authority of his chief
and, in one blow, smashed forever the system of his clan.
They then encouraged his chief to lose interest in him,
to evict him and to replace him by the more profitable sheep.
Thus they reduced him to a homeless, unwanted oddity
and finally forced him, in his hundreds of thousands,
to leave the land of his birth
for the canning industries of the North,
for the disease-ridden slums of the South,
for the lumber camps of Canada
and the stockyards of Australia.
And wherever he went,
he took with him his music, his poetry,
his language and his children.
"On an April morning.
"I no longer hear birdsongs
"or the lowing of cattle on the moor.
"I hear the noise of sheep and the English language,
"dogs barking and frightening the deer.“".
Thus, within a century from Culloden,
the English and the Scottish Lowlanders
had made secure forever
their religion, their commerce,
their culture, their ruling dynasty
and, in so doing, had destroyed a race of people.
They have created a desert
and have called it "peace."
Papers please, sir.
You want to see my driving license?
My friend won't be needing any.
Papers in order, sir.
What happened to Kaminsky, McDonald,
Akhmed, the two Maltese?
I brought back the young officer, as you told me.
I left the others behind.
And what went wrong this time?
We got within 20 miles, then I was spotted by a couple of snipers.
And what happened to Lieutenant Evans exactly?
He was just unlucky.
Get yourself cleaned up.
I want to talk to you.
Brigadier Blore is waiting, sir.
- You're not going to change, sir?
- Into what?
Another one down the dilly.
So far, Masters, you have cost the British Army £42,000 in what you call miscellaneous costs.
Plus 17 jeeps, 24 trucks, a small fortune in ammunition and supplies and the lives of three British officers.
Forty-three of my men have been killed also, sir.
Your total requisition for the past 12 months has been £124,563.
Yes, sir.
You've sent eight missions behind the German lines, and you've achieved nothing.
Colonel Masters, you are a luxury we cannot afford.
My work over the last 12 months has been a preparatory exploration into the techniques which I intend to employ.
The experience of the great commanders of the past who have fought over this very same territory will ultimately prove invaluable.
Modern warfare has nothing whatever to do with the activities of Alexander the Great or Hannibal.
The principles of desert warfare have not changed.
The principles of getting value for your money haven't changed either.
Masters, your outfit is disbanded forthwith.
Captain Attwood will go back with you, and you will hand over to him.
- You yourself will take a week's leave...
- Yes, sir.
...to find yourself a suitable uniform.
I know that you have to wear mufti, but you might shave occasionally.
Yes, indeed, sir.
You will then take over command of the prisoner of war camp at Sidi Barrani with effect from the 17th.
I have located, through my contacts with the Mujabra tribesmen, the perfect target for my kind of operation.
Where the hell did you get this photograph?
It appears the Mujabra tribesmen have learnt how to use the Brownie cameras I supplied them with.
This camp is about 400 miles behind the enemy lines.
Precisely. You can't get there, but I can.
Two men are going to stop Rommel.
One of them is Adolf Hitler, who cannot give him enough fuel, the other is me, who's going to blow up the little he has.
Masters, I shall give you one more chance.
Thank you, sir.
This time you've got to succeed.
I shall put the expedition under the command of a British officer.
But British officers don't understand my method, sir.
Do as I say, and this time I want him back.
- Yes, sir.
- Alive.
If I must have an officer, sir, could he be someone who knows something about pipelines, petrol installations, that sort of thing?
- We'll see if we have someone to spare.
- Yes, sir.
Don't forget, Masters, this is your last chance.
Thank you, sir.
- I'll send them back to you.
- Yes, sir.
- Ask Watkins to come in, would you?
- Yes, sir.
Alan, I had an idea.
Take a look at that and that.
Interested?
There must be millions of gallons in there by the look of things.
- Rommel's?
- Yes.
There. About 400 miles behind their lines.
I got the location pretty accurately from some of my Mujabra tribesmen.
Actually, they took the photographs for me.
- Like to go and blow it up?
- We'll give you a show, sir.
Rommel is here.
His lines of communication are really extended, so we're going to hit him hard.
Now, if you can destroy the bulk of his fuel supplies at that moment, it might make all the difference.
We'll try, sir.
Rommel's gonna be defeated by two men, Watkins.
Adolf Hitler, who can't give him enough fuel, and me, because I'm gonna blow up what little he has.
By the way, I'm sending a decoy group ahead of you.
- You know Masters' bunch?
- Not those gangsters, sir.
Yes, they set off a day before you.
Same route, same orders.
If there's any trouble, let them catch it.
Not particularly pleasant, sir.
You leave in two days, Watkins.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Well, that's that.
What about the British officer for Colonel Masters, sir?
Oh, completely forgot.
Tell them to find a spare captain from somewhere.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, and I suppose he'd better know something about petrol.
Yes, sir.
Where can I find Captain Douglas, Sarge?
- Who?
- Captain Douglas.
Up there.
- Captain Douglas, sir?
- Yes.
Colonel Homerton would like to see you in his office, sir.
Colonel Homerton said immediately, sir.
Tell Colonel Homerton
I'll be there in an hour.
I have to finish unloading the fuel.
As you say, sir.
- You're late.
- I know. What's up?
I don't know, honestly.
- It's not...
- No. No.
Wish me luck.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes.
Captain Douglas is on loan from British Petroleum.
He's worked for seven years as a field engineer with the Anglo-Iranian branch.
- So, you know the desert?
- Yes.
- A little.
- Excellent.
Captain Attwood here is from HQ, Special Forces.
They want an officer with some experience of fuel supplies to take command of a rather unusual unit.
May I point out, sir, that the arrangement with British Petroleum was that I stay in port areas.
What are you wearing?
British uniform, sir.
British Petroleum uniform?
No, sir.
Good. Captain Attwood will give you the Brigadier's orders.
He's your man.
This is it, sir.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir. Caf?'s over there.
- Colonel Masters?
- No.
- Oh, then I'll have a whiskey, please.
- No whiskey.
- I'll have a beer then.
- No beer.
What do you have?
Tea.
Then I'll have tea.
Looking for Colonel Masters?
Who are you?
I'm Captain Leech.
- British Army?
- No.
Follow me.
Some kind of a soldier to see you, Colonel.
Yes.
- Colonel Masters, sir?
- Yes.
Captain Douglas, sir.
Oh, my dear fellow, there's no need for all that.
My number two, Captain Leech.
How do you do? Which regiment, Captain?
Late of the Fourth Panzer.
Do you know why you're here, Douglas?
I understand I'm to command one of your units on a special mission.
Thank you, Leech.
See you later.
Now, let me explain exactly what you're here for.
Caprus Magna, a Roman port in Cyrenaica, that the Germans appear to be using as a petrol dump.
Are these Rommel's positions, sir?
No, those are the positions of the Carthaginians in the year 215 B.C.
Desert warfare hasn't changed.
Like the ancient Egyptians, I'm going to send an expedition south to Qattara.
Across the Qattara Depression, through the cliffs of the Siwah Pass, over the great sand sea, through the stony desert, and crash into Caprus Magna.
And that's what you're here for.
I am going to lead a unit down there, across there and up there.
Exactly. I'll give you my best man.
He knows the ropes.
- Captain Leech?
- A man of considerable experience.
All right. Get back to work.
- Have you signed your crew on yet?
- Yes.
- How many are you taking?
- Oh, seven, that's enough.
One more would get in the way.
Seven's my lucky number.
Eight is what you've got, and I believe I'm in command.
Is our friend serious?
I'm sure he will work very closely with you, Leech.
Naturally, I would be grateful for any help I could get.
I see. Well, I've got a better idea.
Keep it at seven.
You go, I'll stay.
Then everybody's happy.
I've told Stores to kit you out.
I expect they're waiting for you.
- We'll talk more at dinner.
- Very well, sir.
Captain Leech, I want a full inspection at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
Everything laid out and ready to load.
Anything else you'd like?
No, I think that's all.
I'll see you at dinner, sir.
What's all this about?
Brigadier Blore's not very pleased with our record.
He insists. We'll have to take him.
I'll take him.
If he doesn't come back alive, we're out of business.
You're out of business.
You get well paid for these trips, don't you, Leech?
Not really.
I'll give you a bonus if you get him back.
- How much?
- Dead, nothing.
Alive, £2,000.
You just bought yourself an Englishman.
Where did you find him?
One of my recruiting drives at Rabida prison.
Tunisian named Sadok.
He threw a bomb into a caf?, shot a policeman, and then at his trial, he leaned over and punched the presiding official on the nose.
He got 14 years. He's our demolition man.
Kostos Manov.
Smuggling arms and explosives into Egypt.
They ran him in and I ran him out.
First class armorer.
Boudesh.
Nice chap.
Going a bit strong with an Egyptian girl.
Her brothers came down to invite him to his wedding. He shot them.
Still a bachelor. Communications.
Kafkarides, a Cypriot.
His game was narcotics in a big way.
Shot a couple of customs men.
Transport and supplies.
Hassan and Assine, Sinusi Arab guides.
Are they always so friendly?
All they ask is keef and each other.
That's everybody.
Aren't you going to tell him about me?
I thought you might like to do that yourself, Captain Leech.
The black sheep of an otherwise admirable family from County Dublin.
Most recent deployment, master of a tramp steamer running around the Red Sea.
Sank her for the insurance off Djibouti.
You ought to tell the crew, of course.
They're all drowned, all but one of them.
He told the insurance company.
I got 15 years.
When I met him in Rabida prison, he was king of the damn place.
They hated to see him go, but I needed him more than they did.
War is a criminal enterprise.
I fight it with criminals.
Not to worry, my dear fellow.
Leech knows the routine.
He'll get you out and he'll get you back.
Won't you, Leech?
If he's lucky.
Will I be lucky?
That's up to you, and him, of course.
Very Italian.
Yeah.
Nice morning for a drive, Captain.
I ordered an inspection for 7:00 this morning.
I did it for you. All over.
Let's go.
Anything wrong?
Good luck.
And keep in touch.
Let's go!
This is as far as we can go, sir.
The Germans have a few patrols going south of here.
Thank you, Corporal.
Here we go to the right.
I said we go right.
That road was mined by the Italians a week ago.
They don't put it all on the map.
Take another left.
Splendid, Major Watkins. Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, Lieutenant.
Mount vehicles!
Bara'sa.
- What does that mean?
- They're Bara'sa. Could be dangerous.
Depends who's paying them.
Six men, six camels.
No lead camel.
They're an advance party.
The others could arrive any minute.
Hassan's going to spot them.
- We've got to have water.
- Exactly.
We're Italians, aren't we?
Why don't we trade?
You asking me or telling me?
I'm asking you.
There's an advance party of Bara'sa at the oasis.
We're an Italian patrol who need food and water. Let's go to market.
Everybody else, parli Italiano.
And tune into an Italian radio station.
- I think we chose the right uniform.
- Don't be too sure.
If they offer you tea, drink it.
If they offer you food, eat it.
- What did you do that for?
- I didn't like the tea.
See if there's anything we need in the packs.
Are you out of your mind?
If anybody's going to get killed here,
I give the order.
- Is that clear?
- Somebody gave the show away.
- Who?
- You did.
If you'd stayed at home, they'd still be alive.
Well, I didn't stay at home.
And I'm not leaving.
It's a German radio.
Every patrol in the south would have been on to us five hours after we left them.
Destroy it.
Fifty more Bara'sa coming.
They're miles away.
They won't be here till nightfall.
We can't go that way.
We're not going back.
Then there's only one other way we can go.
Is there a pass?
Not for 120 miles, right down to Siwah.
Let's have a look.
All aboard!
Aren't they going to bury them?
We'll have to go back.
- How long are these cables?
- About 250 feet each.
That'll never work.
Are we carrying any string?
Yeah.
Get it.
Lead on.
We need 327 feet.
Sadok, shackle those cables together.
- Are you strong?
- Yes.
Then get the end of that cable to the top of that cliff.
- Aren't you coming up?
- No.
Kafkarides, sand channels, pulleys and tow chain.
Unload those trucks!
Take that down and shackle it to the other truck.
Yes, Captain.
Hold it!
Kostos Manov.
- He says unload.
- Take it up.
Are they ready?
Yes.
Take it away.
Is that truck loaded?
Foolish!
Cable's going!
Get down!
Radio's gone. No more music.
I ordered you to unload.
Yes.
Salvage what you can.
We spend the night at the top of the cliffs.
Murdering bastards.
Masters' men. Who else?
Now every Arab for 200 miles knows there are British patrols in the Qattara Depression.
Do you think we should change our course, sir?
Impossible.
This is the only track out of the Qattara.
We got to keep going south until we get to Siwah Pass.
Very good, sir.
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.
Get these corpses buried.
They're beginning to stink.
Certainly, sir.
Get these corpses buried!
Germans.
Come.
Our business is blowing fuel dumps.
You play dirty, Captain Leech.
The way to survive here is to watch, listen and say nothing.
I play safe.
Good. Get the men.
Bury them.
Bury them!
I think he means it.
You'd have killed one of us, maybe two, you'd have been the third.
- I know.
- That wasn't very clever.
You want to forget the noble sentiments if you want to live.
I'll manage.
Funny thing, survival.
We've only covered 80 kilometers in the last two-and-a-half days.
Quite good going.
At this rate, the war will be over before we get there.
Don't worry, you'll get your medal.
Why don't you say something?
What?
I said why don't you say something?
Why don't you talk, like a human being?
Because I want to survive here,
I watch, I listen and I say nothing.
In any case, Captain Leech,
I don't trust you, and I really don't want to know you.
- All right.
- Tell me something.
- How did the other English officers die?
- Unexpectedly.
Must find new one.
- What about spares?
- No more spares.
If I'd done the inspection, there'd be more spares.
There may be some tires.
Let's have a look.
We're getting close.
Better start traveling by night.
Let's see if there's a tire.
This looks like a good one that'll fit.
There's a jack here.
Keep perfectly still.
Kostos Manov.
See if it's wired.
It is wired.
Don't move.
Hassan.
Hassan.
Okay.
Are those all the dressings you've got?
We lost them in the wireless truck.
Stop! Stop!
Hold it!
If we go on, Hassan will die!
- Can't we leave them?
- We need them.
There's a German supply road only 20 miles from here.
We'll have a look.
We've got to keep going!
Go on.
You're learning.
Kafkarides, get in the back.
Come on, get in the front.
It's all right.
It's only a nurse.
Hold that.
Don't you know how to handle a woman?
Boudesh.
No.
She can take care of Hassan.
If he dies, you die.
Understand?
Any luck?
The receiver's gone, but I think we can transmit.
What time are we due to transmit?
278 megacycles at 1922 hours.
We'll try before we move off tonight.
What happened here?
Nothing.
What are you telling them?
I'm trying to explain why we're six days late.
Well, keep it short. We don't want to be monitored by the Germans.
That's it.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
We go in now?
Why not? It's perfect cover.
You won't be very popular.
With them or with you?
Don't worry about me. Worry about them.
We're going in under cover of this storm.
Come on.
Sadok, tell him if she causes trouble, to kill her quietly with this.
Mines!
Mines!
Captain.
Keep in my footsteps.
I'm going ahead.
Bastards!
Well, this mission's over.
Now we can go home.
I'm in command here.
We're going to find the real fuel depot and destroy it.
Well, go ahead.
Give them your orders.
Right. We're going to find the real fuel depot.
Come on.
Me, I'm going to find a boat.
Anyone interested?
You don't care about anything, do you?
I care about you.
That's why I've been looking after you.
Masters is paying me to bring you back alive.
How much?
Want a ride, Captain?
Come in.
Sit down.
This aerial photograph shows your oil dump is still intact.
You seem to have failed again.
I'm afraid so, sir.
That's all right, Masters.
In fact, it's exactly what we want.
Montgomery has broken through.
He's moving fast along the coast.
By tomorrow night, we'll be in Cyrenaica, by the weekend, Benghazi.
I knew things were moving, sir, but...
So our conventional methods do seem to have paid off.
Quite.
So, I shall want you to call your chaps off.
I can't do that, sir.
I've lost contact with them.
I've had orders to capture all fuel depots.
We need them.
What can I do, sir?
Don't you know of a reliable double agent?
Get in touch.
You want me to inform against my own men, sir?
Do you know any other way of stopping them?
- Is this an order, sir?
- Yes.
- Then may I have it in writing, please?
- No.
But you'd be well advised to do it.
- I'll see what I can do, sir.
- Do it.
Boats.
- Petrol.
- Forget the petrol.
As soon as it's dark,
I'll be on one of those boats.
I'll feel safer.
I'm sure you will.
I think I have an idea.
What's that?
Create a diversion.
Blow the fuel dump, and while they're fighting fires, grab a boat.
- You're still trying to win a medal.
- No.
I don't think I'll get a medal.
But you'll get your boat.
We can give it a try.
What are you telling them now?
We attack at midnight tonight.
Let's go.
Put down your guns and stand up.
First, come forward.
148525.
Captain R. V. Douglas.
Royal Engineers.
Second, Cyril Leech.
Third, Sadok.
Fourth, Kostos Manov.
Fifth, Kafkarides.
Sixth, Hassan.
Seventh, Assine.
Stand up and come forward.
You are surrounded.
I repeat.
We know you are here.
Come out at once.
You shoot that one.
I'll shoot this one.
Throw the charges that way and go.
Go.
Wait. Throw the charges that way, but follow me.
How did they know our names?
Masters told them.
- Why would he do that?
- Stop us blowing the oil.
They must have changed their minds.
If he betrayed us, he deserves to be shot.
What does it matter who betrayed us?
The Germans can catch you.
You can trip over a mine.
It's the principle of the thing.
You sound like the man who gave me 15 years.
I wouldn't be here now if I wasn't worth £2,000 to you.
Would I?
Probably not.
Lie still.
Assine.
Assine.
Assine.
Assine.
- Well, the news is wonderful, isn't it?
- It is rather good, sir, isn't it?
- Not too late for another drink, is it?
- No, indeed, sir.
By the way, congratulations.
- I gather you reached your chaps.
- Yes. It would appear so, sir.
I had one or two notions about stirring up a little trouble in Tripolitania.
Tell me more. But first, here's to Monty.
And here's to victory.
To victory.
- They're British.
- I know.
- Have you got anything white?
- No.
I should wait.
If you're going to surrender,
I should leave the pistol.
Come on, Cyril.
Don't you want your£2,000?
Sorry, sir. I didn't see the white flag.
Don't do it again.
In every war... In every age...
The forgotten weapon is...
...Food. For to kill, soldiers must live...
...to live, they must eat.
And a herd of cattle is...
...as vital as a herd of cannon.
The United States in 1864.
Hey, we made it, amigos!
Whenever you're ready to talk business,
Kelly, I'll be at my hotel.
- You're Steadman.
- Major Steadman.
Major Steadman.
Sorry.
Major, I've got the most marvellous beef in the world for you.
The best beef in all of Mexico.
No, Sanchez?
They're a little thin by now, but it's been a long walk.
- A few days in the pasture...
- You are late, Mr. Kelly.
Ten days late. Ten miserable days in this stinking, hot town.
Is it Vermont or Massachusetts?
I'm from Boston...
...which, may I tell you, is one long way from this prairie rat hole.
Well, there are certain compensations, major, in a railroad town.
I was hoping that you brought a couple of them along.
I see.
I don't happen to be a procurer, Mr. Kelly.
Forgive me.
Whiskey or sherry?
I'm here on business, Mr. Kelly.
United States Army business.
I'm waiting for an explanation.
What were you in civilian life?
A lawyer. I want an explanation.
Lawyer, huh?
- You've never driven cattle?
- Hardly.
Hardly.
Three months, major. Not ten days.
Three months, staring into the rear ends of those beeves.
Smelling their stink, choking on their dust...
...listening to their damn bellowing night and day.
I'm a reasonable man.
If I weren't...
...I might go over to the other side and see how their manners are.
You'd do business with the Confederates?
No.
Their money's no good.
Kelly.
What's he doing?
If I'm not mistaken, someone's stealing my wine.
I thought you were a soldier, not a sheriff.
You like my wine, Paco?
I like it if you do, huh?
Costs five dollars a bottle.
That's ten dollars out of your pay.
Since you're a generous man, share the rest with your friends here.
I don't understand you.
I don't understand you at all.
A thief should be punished.
We'll have dinner now.
And take a few more bottles of wine out to our friends.
He's a lonely thief, Steadman...
...trying to celebrate after a rough journey.
He'll be happy to go home.
They all will.
And so will I.
I'm afraid you won't be going home quite yet, Mr. Kelly.
There's been a change.
Take the cattle by rail to Virginia.
Deliver them to a plantation near Richmond. The pasture is there.
You'll be paid on arrival.
That's not in the agreement.
I was ordered to bring the cattle here.
The war's going into a new phase.
We're concentrating on Richmond.
And when we take it, we've won.
I don't care who wins.
You want that herd in Virginia?
It'll cost you five dollars per head extra.
I'm authorized to pay you one dollar a head extra. Not a penny more.
That's not Army beef yet, major.
Not until I get paid off on my contract.
The contract specifies, in rather small print, I'll admit:
" Payment shall be made when the beef is delivered to the area...
...deemed most urgent by the commanding general."
Which is 30 miles south of Richmond.
It's in order. I prepared it myself.
Even specifying the size of the print.
Now those steers are going east, Mr. Kelly.
Oh, by Godfrey, that judge.
He thought he had me licked.
Licked, Kelly.
But he underestimated the man he was dealing with.
I hit that judge...
I hit him with a writ of certiorari.
It's like a brilliant bolt out of the black, a tiger springing.
A writ of certiorari!
Play cards, Steadman.
Thousands of them.
The boys in blue are gonna eat beef tonight.
And tomorrow and next month.
Till it's coming out of their craws.
Maybe it's our stomachs making us see what ain't there.
Colonel, how about me going and bringing back proof.
Just to make it official.
My orders are to scout that herd.
Go ahead.
Just make sure the Yanks don't scout me.
Oh, Lord.
This is always embarrassing.
I'm sure you'll handle it with your customary tact.
- Take over, captain.
- Yes, sir.
Major Steadman, ma'am.
I'm Charity Warwick.
This is Alvarez Kelly, who brought the cattle here.
I was ordered to arrange quarters for the two of you.
Your men can camp in the field below the house.
Mr. Kelly, the grazing is best in the north pasture.
You may eat in my dining room tonight, major.
But from tomorrow on, you'll make other arrangements.
Mrs. Warwick...
...will you join us for dinner?
Nice try, but I don't think...
She's a lady, Kelly.
A great lady.
One rarely has the privilege to meet such a...
What does that mean?
Woman.
- Pick up those strays.
- I'll get them.
Go get that meat!
Sir?
Cleet Warwick must be rolling around in his grave.
I'll bet this is the first time his place...
...has been lit up like that since Manassas.
- Eat while it's hot.
- The man who brought the cattle.
- Colonel, I promise you...
- That man really knew his business.
Moved that herd like it was a column of infantry.
That's prime beef, Johnny.
And there's enough down there to feed a lot of people...
...who haven't chewed on meat in a long, long time.
Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.
Now with the $10,000 advance paid to you in Mexico...
...it makes it a total of $50,000 and completes our original contract.
Plus the...
...additional $2500.
Just sign here.
- Buying beef at three dollars a head.
- Two.
- And selling them for 20.
- Not bad.
It's outrageous.
You go to some nice place to count your profits?
I spend it, Steadman.
I spend it and enjoy it.
And when it's all gone, raise it again.
You make it sound simple.
It is, if you don't want it too bad.
Money, whiskey and women.
Your three deities.
Tell me something, Mr. Kelly:
Have they made you a happy man?
No.
But not as miserable a one as you.
Mrs. Warwick.
Dinner is served, gentlemen.
How nice. You changed your mind.
A lady's privilege.
Your privilege is our pleasure, ma'am.
I got hungry.
Driving thousands of half-wild animals across thousands of miles.
For someone brought up in these parts, it seems impossible.
I have such respect for special knowledge.
It's nothing.
You certainly know how to charge for it.
Do you object to making money,
Miss Charity?
In wartime? I think so.
Making money out of war.
It's almost an act of nature.
Do you have any idea what a major's salary is?
I wasn't talking about that.
What about a colone"s salary?
And the prestige afterward?
You'll carry that rank into every courtroom for life.
- I didn't go to war for that.
- No, but you'll use it.
Every man, in his own special way, takes care of number one.
I don't admire men like that, Mr. Kelly.
Mrs. Warwick...
...if there were a kind of profit driven right into your own back yard...
...would there be any reason not to take advantage of it?
What do you mean by that?
I would say it's a matter of the north pasture.
The north... You're talking in riddles.
To you, ma'am?
I don't understand.
I was curious.
When Mrs. Warwick specified the north pasture, I wanted to know why.
The soil, major, is overworked.
Dying for the lack of fertilizer.
- Well, yes, but I still don't...
- Manure, major.
I didn't know you were a farmer.
I was raised on a farm.
My father's estancia in Texas.
Estancia. What a lovely word.
So is caridad.
Charity.
Yes, it was lovely.
It was lovely and big.
Open.
Fifty families lived on it.
My father was like a lord.
Like an Irish lord.
Yet this virtuous Irish lord...
...was not quite able to stop his son from turning pirate, was he?
Make jokes, Steadman, about the war, about God, and about me.
But don't make jokes about my father.
He was killed defending our home.
Mexican War, I think you called it.
We had other names for the theft of a piece of our country.
The officers wore the same uniform you have on.
Only some of them now have changed it to grey.
So I say, "Alvarez Kelly..."
...take what you can from both sides.
Small return for your birthright."
- Beg pardon, ma'am.
- What is it?
A guard found one of our drovers...
- ...beaten and unconscious.
- We're 30 miles behind the lines!
They butchered a steer inside the gates.
Where the hell were the sentries?
Excuse me.
All right, let's go.
The poor major.
He finds duty more fascinating than...
...pleasure.
Do you undress every woman you meet?
There has to be some beauty.
Then it's no special compliment.
Being a beautiful woman is compliment enough.
From what you've said about your father's estancia...
...it must have been something like it was here before the war.
Very much like it.
Might be interesting to buy some land around here.
Not to help rebuild, though. Not to live.
- Just to buy cheap and sell dear.
- It's a nuisance the other way around.
You disappoint me, Mr. Kelly.
After what happened to you, I should think you'd sympathize with us.
I have no sympathies, only instincts.
And they shy away from losers.
I'm overstaying my welcome.
You must be tired.
You underestimate yourself, Mr. Kelly.
Rarely.
Thank you for the evening.
How long since you've been with a woman?
Three months.
A lifetime.
My husband's been dead three years.
There was someone under the bed all the time.
Hatcher.
The money.
I got just as many men outside.
I warn you, I'm a Mexican national.
Doing business with the Yanks.
- My privilege.
- Grazer!
The money.
Obliged, Mr. Kelly.
Just how far would you have gone?
You bastards couldn't have waited a while longer.
Hatcher.
Good night, Charity.
God bless.
Take care, Tom. God bless.
God bless, Charity.
Bless.
Oh, Mrs. Warwick.
Good night and God bless.
Yes?
Major Steadman.
- Yes, major?
- You had visitors.
Old friends of mine.
Old, dear friends.
And why did they take Kelly?
For the money, wouldn't you say?
They didn't have to kidnap him to get his money.
Perhaps they didn't want to shoot him in front of me.
Shoot him? For what?
The way they see it, he committed an act of war against the Confederacy.
Of course, they're prejudiced.
Mrs. Warwick...
...did you know about this?
Of course! I saw it happen.
No, I mean beforehand.
I mean aiding and abetting.
Oh, that difficult lawyer talk, major.
Mr. Kelly was certainly right.
Alvarez Kelly hijacked by rebels.
You appreciate that, major?
Mrs. Warwick.
- Beaurider.
- Yes, sir.
Get back to camp fast as you can.
Straight back. We've had our enjoyment for the evening.
Yes, sir.
Turn them around, boys!
Now that that's over, would you mind telling me what this is all about?
Not yet. Get in.
- Tell him to keep his hands off me.
- Get in.
I may choose not to.
You may choose to die too.
You'd give up those stripes for that privilege, wouldn't you, sergeant?
As long as you knew my hands were tied.
Rossiter, we both know you didn't bring me this far to shoot me.
For some reason, you want me alive and in one piece. Why?
You know, Mr. Kelly, you talk too much. Get in.
I'd like to tell you a little something.
This river winds all the way to Richmond.
Now, if I was to put you to sleep...
...you'd miss some of the prettiest scenery in all of Virginia.
Colonel, in my inside pocket, where my money used to be...
...there's a cigar.
You could get it for me.
Or better yet...
...I could get it for myself.
Bust him, colonel, sir!
Make him shut his big mouth.
Confederate man-of-war?
Kelly, we've got to have that beef.
The army and the whole South is starving.
- That's your problem, not mine.
- Damn it!
If hungry people don't mean anything to you, this should!
That already belongs to me.
We'll double it.
In gold, colonel?
Are you suggesting our currency is no good, sir?
Can I tell you what for?
Colonel, I have to hand it to you.
You're not just half-mad.
How do you figure you're going to get 2500 head of cattle...
...over Grant's lines? By balloon?
Nope. We don't have that many balloons.
All right, we can't get over them.
But we can go around.
We can make this big circle.
Come up behind the plantation.
Then we just shoo those cattle back the way we came.
- Just "shoo" them back?
- That's right.
You know there's a small army guarding those steers.
Don't you expect a fight?
I'll handle the military.
You handle the herd.
- Fair division.
- Then you'll do it?
Mr. Harrison, I intend to die in bed, in the arms of a beautiful woman.
We all share that wish, sir.
I do not intend to die from a Yankee bullet.
So I say the hell with it, colonel.
You're not walking out of here.
This city is swarming with spies, and you know our plan.
Worth nothing.
You couldn't even try it without me.
Oh, look at the soldier boy!
Morning.
Morning.
Enjoying yourself?
Oh, yes.
I like cockroaches with my soup.
Specialty of the house.
You about ready to leave?
Not under your terms.
- But I've got some advice for you.
- Yeah? What's that?
Nobody's even gonna start to move that herd out without drovers.
- My Comanches can handle it.
- Cavalry?
Top riders. Fought under Jeb Stuart.
Any Texans among them? Cowhands?
They're Virginians.
And there's no damn thing anybody can do on a horse they can't match.
No, except maybe drive a cow out of a closet.
Takes a long time to train a drover.
Jailer!
Open up.
Mr. Kelly, your education has been sadly neglected.
Not bad.
But you're not charging the enemy.
You're pushing cattle.
For that, you need trained cowboys.
- Now look...
- These is warhorses, mister.
I reckon they can handle them little old cows.
All right, lieutenant.
Take your warhorses and push those little old cows into that back corral.
With your permission, colonel?
Move, cow.
Come on, cows! Get in there!
You darn fool cows, get in there!
Come on, get in there!
You darn fool cows, get in there!
Colonel, where the hell you get these cows? From an old ladies' home?
Move them out!
Get on! Get out of here! Get out of here!
All right, you darn fool cow!
Come on!
Get out of my way! Go on! Move along there!
Watch out!
- Sound retreat.
- What's that, sir?
- I said sound retreat!
- Yes, sir.
Close the gate.
Get those cattle! Go on, get them.
Now, listen:
There are 2500 head of Mexican range-bred steers on that plantation...
...stupid, temperamental and a lot more vicious than anything you've got here.
All right, so we got plenty to learn.
But you can train us.
Damn you, Kelly, you're gonna train us!
Back to jail.
Are you coming in or am I going out?
General Lee has approved the raid.
That makes you the only missing link.
Missing's the word.
That's a lot of cash to carry around, colonel. It'd be safer in a bank.
Matter of fact, I'll give you permission to open an account in...
They'll be butchering and eating that herd before long.
I figure you've got no more than ten days to get us ready.
Burn it all.
Ten days before we start.
God deliver me from dedicated men.
Ten days.
You used to have ten fingers.
Now you got nine.
Tomorrow, you'll have eight.
You stay stubborn, the day after that, you'll have seven.
The day after that...
...it's up to you.
You decide whether you want to end up with a pair of stumps...
...or lend us your talent.
You decide.
Get a doctor.
Don't split them up like that. Get them.
All right, get those back.
Get them together.
He drives hard, I'm glad to say.
Don't split them up! Slow down there!
Take it easy with them.
I deplore what happened, colonel.
- However, under the circumstances...
- It was necessary.
Still, there's a time for sandpaper and a time for silk.
From now on, I think we'd be wise to cater to his taste.
I want to borrow a hat.
- Tool of the trade.
- Will mine do?
Mr. Kelly, I'd be honoured if you'd accept the hospitality of my home...
...for the remainder of your visit.
I believe you'd find the accommodations more cheerful...
...than your present quarters.
- And the bourbon?
- More plentiful.
You gentlemen have a way of making it hard for me to refuse.
Who am I?
You're a rich land speculator looking for bargains.
Seems to me I heard you mention something like that...
...recently.
Satisfactory?
Yes, yes, that would go down well with anyone who was curious.
Mrs. Townsend is having a soiree next week. Nothing pretentious.
No, certainly not.
Not in starving Richmond.
I can't offer you a clean shirt...
...but we'll take care of the one you got.
That's thoughtful.
Now watch this.
Slow down.
When he moves to your house...
...one of my men goes with him.
Naturally.
Oh, Mr. Kelly, I couldn't.
I'd love to, but I just couldn't.
- I'm spoken for.
- Loudly?
By a seafaring monster who can shrivel a girl right up.
Where's he?
Very impressive.
Since you and I are only going to be friends...
...it's only fair that you turn me over to her.
Liz Pickering?
You're really running in luck tonight.
- Married?
- Engaged.
It's not the same, is it?
I bet you could tell me, if you really wanted to.
Military secret.
- Damn the military and their secrets.
- Come on.
I suppose it's very dangerous.
Not as dangerous as you.
The way you look tonight, you could start pandemonium in the streets.
And that perfume...
But you do prefer horse sweat.
Oh, Tommy, I'm sorry, but I see you so seldom.
You know, that's what
I hate most about the Yanks.
They keep us apart.
I understand married officers have more leave than single ones.
But what if one of those nasty old Yanks...
...threw a speck of dust in my other eye?
How would you look leading a blind man down the street?
As foolish as you sound talking about it.
Thank you.
Who's he?
Rich businessman from Mexico.
Friend of the Harrisons.
But not a friend of yours?
No.
Tom, what's the matter?
I don't know.
I guess the war's the matter.
War's the matter with all of us.
Mr. Kelly, this is
Captain Angus Ferguson of Glasgow.
- Captain.
- Isn't he magnificent?
Aye, it's good when they adore you, especially when they're half your age.
Or could it be the wee gifts
I bring her in my ship?
The French perfumes and silk nighties?
- Let's dance.
- I'm not used to a ballroom.
There are many stout lads to stretch your muscles.
If you don't put your arm around me now, I'll take you up on that.
I will dance the whole night through with you in my rooms.
Angus, you're a devil.
No use telling her it's my farewell night, is there?
Not till morning, that is.
Which one of you will help me make an old sea dog jealous?
Tom.
Rank does have its responsibilities.
Go ahead, darling.
So I weigh anchor tomorrow evening, courtesy of Secretary Harrison.
After four months wait and a good deal more effort...
...than a Scotsman cares to spend.
For mercy sakes, no, Mr. Kelly.
That stuff there will distemper a whale.
Here, you take a taste of this.
Blessed nectar from Scotland.
Will you believe it, there are
1000 bottles of that aboard my ship?
Sounds like paradise.
I was commissioned to run it in here, but then I found...
Confederate money isn't worth the match to burn it with.
Aye, so I'll take it to New York.
Heavens, Mr. Kelly, don't tell me the currency there is still wampum.
Mr. Kelly, you have my flask!
If I may suggest, Miss Pickering, the punch is pale.
This will improve the colour.
You're gallant enough to be a Virginian.
And your beauty goes beyond the bounds of geography.
I'm Alvarez Kelly.
And you've learned my name and a few particulars.
Only one.
You've shortchanged yourself.
You could remedy that.
Are you any kind of gambler, Kelly?
I've lost my last few bets.
Will you come to my house?
I need some advice that can't very well be given here.
What time?
Midnight, number 19, Royall Street.
Make sure there's no carriage outside.
Why, Mr. Kelly, whatever happened to your hand?
One of the bets I lost.
Darling, I think he's rather charming.
Yeah.
- You understand?
- Playing with fire, aren't you, lad?
It's not my house.
Now, follow me.
With all of the beautiful women that were here tonight...
...the result is
I don't feel much like sleeping.
You know what I mean?
I don't know how to put it to your delicate ears, but in Richmond there...
There must be a house of joy.
There's a few.
Now, let me guess what your orders were.
Let him do what he wants...
...but don't let him out of your sight. Right?
Well, let's be off. Two men of the world.
You ever seen him before?
No, but I wish I had.
Kelly, you might not like these women.
I understand that the Mexicans like their women fat and dumpy.
Relax, Hatcher, you can't make me angry tonight.
What part of Mexico, amigo?
Durango, amigo.
You lonely?
Not really.
Friendly?
Not very.
Thirsty?
Not especially.
You're the one I want.
A bottle of your best wine.
- This is where I draw the line.
- I'll wait.
May take all night.
Should I take it off?
The wedding ring.
Some like it on, some like it off.
You men are peculiar.
What do you do in case of fire?
I don't know, we never had one.
Well, suppose you had one right now.
There's a window with a big, old wisteria vine right by it.
Show me.
Now, look, I want you to stay here all night...
...and improve your mind.
Your body's already perfect.
Come in, sir.
Miss Pickering will be down in a minute, sir.
My Japanese room. Uncluttered.
Does she have to stay here?
You can go to bed now, Ellie.
Why, Kelly, whatever are you thinking of?
I was thinking there might be...
...some chimney sweeps up there in grey uniforms.
I've grown to expect anything from Southern belles.
I'm not a Southern belle.
I'm Liz Pickering.
This house was something quite special in its day.
Sorry you couldn't have seen it.
Used to be a lovely miniature over the mantle.
Till last week. It paid for the gown I wore this evening.
I don't know why you asked me here, but it was not to pity you.
Hardly. Pity is the real empty room I despise.
I amuse you, Kelly?
It's too early to tell.
Well, we're getting older by the minute.
Would you like to drink that where it's more comfortable?
Whatever your friend's got, he ought to market it, huh?
Well, good night.
Wherever did you get wine at this time of night?
Ask me no questions.
Haven't tasted anything so good since the war began.
You should've seen that too, Kelly.
It was grand.
That was the year Tom Rossiter and I became engaged.
The year the boys went off singing.
I begged Tommy to marry me.
It wasn't very ladylike, but I begged him.
I loved him so much.
But he was noble, he had principal.
Said he couldn't risk leaving me a widow.
The second and the third years...
...the singing somehow stopped.
I still wanted Tommy to marry me.
He'd lost an eye by then, but that didn't matter.
But he was nobler than ever.
Said it might be an arm next or a leg.
Those were the years of frustration.
Then tonight...
Tonight I realized what he feared the most.
Losing his sight.
Tom Rossiter is right.
I couldn't stand to live with half a man.
God, Kelly. It must be some hideous failing in me.
I'm so sick and tired to death of all the fighting and killing...
...and trying to be brave and patient over a lost cause.
So then we come to the fourth year.
The year of temptation.
Thank God you're not another one of those honourable men.
I've spent my life surrounded by honourable men.
Enjoying myself is one of my weaknesses.
I guess people like us have our own kind of honour.
It's not your advice I want, Kelly.
It's your money.
- House mortgaged?
- I've been asked to vacate.
Any other assets?
Myself.
To buy another dress?
I want you to help me get out of Richmond.
At the moment, impossible.
Nothing's impossible for you...
The minute our good colonel found out I was missing...
...he'd send a regiment after me.
I wouldn't make it to the city limits.
Tom and you?
- You're not what you're supposed to be.
- Who is?
Then why did you come here tonight?
Many reasons.
Mainly because you were his girl.
Only now, I find out you're not.
If I could manage something for you, would you be willing to go anywhere?
Anywhere.
There's a chance.
Just a chance.
Then you will try?
Yes, I'll try.
Kelly, I think we ought to drink to that.
I think we should.
I promised a friend that...
...this might take all night.
I wouldn't make a liar out of you for anything in the world.
Now, the main thing to remember is that...
...cattle are like women.
Sometimes you have to be firm.
Sometimes you have to be gentle.
And sometimes you have to give them a slap on the rump.
Your pistol, captain.
Now that's just a reminder that the sound of gunfire spooks cattle.
A sound that's practically guaranteed on our venture.
All right, now start singing, captain.
That's right. Sing.
Music's the best medicine for scared animals.
Now, look here.
The man said sing!
Yes, sir!
Loud and clear!
I wish I was in the land of cotton.
You, Hatcher, out there and sing.
For the want of one voice, the battle could be lost.
Sing.
- Damn it, sing!
- Colonel.
You know, I keep wondering why you came back to us...
...after slipping away from Hatcher.
I have a commitment.
Don't suppose you'd care to say where you went.
Not yet.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
Developing a new weapon, Tom?
Trying to scare the Yanks to death?
His idea.
I hope those wailing banshees are ready.
They're ready.
We move tonight, on schedule.
I know your opinion, I want his.
What about it? Can the men manage the herd?
If he would keep after them so that the men sing on key...
You're beginning to annoy me, Mr. Kelly.
To the point of refusing my services?
Mr. Kelly, I'd give you the Richmond symphony...
...if they weren't already in the army.
Polish up your contralto, Tom...
...and I'll notify General Lee you're set to go.
Carry on. I'm going back to town.
Nothing like a bath, a bite to eat and a bottle of whiskey before battle.
- Reception.
- Yes, sir?
My name is Kelly.
Captain Ferguson is expecting me.
Tell him I'm in the dining room.
I shall tend to that, Mr. Kelly.
I'd like a double whiskey.
- Make that two. One for the captain.
- Mr. Kelly.
- Hope I didn't disturb you.
- Not at all.
I was just packing my gear.
- Getting ready to shove off.
- Aye, that I am. At nightfall.
Now, what can I do for you?
Book a passenger. A lady.
Anyone I might know?
Beside the point.
And yourself.
No.
Now, the Athena is a broad ship, but she's tiny.
I don't think...
Two thousand.
On the other hand, I am a man with no contempt for money at all.
And the advantage of being able to tell a beautiful lady...
...magnificent lies all the way to New York.
Nineteen Royall Street. She'll be waiting.
Alone, mind. No maidservants.
Alone.
With maidservant.
Bon voyage, captain.
And good luck to you, Mr. Kelly.
It's done.
And you halfway wish it weren't.
You're scared.
And if you weren't a proud person and in a public place, you'd be crying.
Like a baby.
It's quite a gamble.
You don't have to go through with it.
Oh, yes, I do.
Where I'm going, I don't know what will become of me.
But if I stay here, I know damn well what I'll become.
No girl, as pretty or passionate as you, has a right to such an honest mind.
What I wouldn't give to have you along.
If it's any comfort...
...I would have booked passage, only...
Only what?
In the courtyard is a bloodhound.
Rossiter's.
He can't see you, but don't turn.
When I leave here, he'll follow...
...and I'll let him chase me up a tree.
You stay for a while and then leave.
I've used you. Forgive me for that.
There's nothing to forgive.
As for using me, it seems to be the national pastime...
...of the Confederate States of America.
Goodbye, Liz.
What a ridiculous way to say goodbye.
Perhaps that's why we'll remember it longer.
Goodbye, Kelly. I'll be throwing you kisses from the rail tonight.
Yes, as I say,
I recognized the man with him...
...as one of Rossiter's Comanches...
...when the two of them entered the bordello.
I don't avail myself of its services, you understand, general.
But you'd be amazed how much information...
Get along with it.
Yes, sir.
This morning...
...ear to the ground, I learned from one of Harrison's servants...
...that Kelly had been spending his days at the Comanche camp.
And this afternoon, my vigilance paid off.
This afternoon, gentlemen, he made contact with one...
...Captain Ferguson, a well-known blockade runner.
Well, need I spell it out?
If it's not asking too much.
No, sir, not at all.
He is not looking for cheap land, as he pretends.
No, gentlemen. Alvarez Kelly...
...is planning to import herds of Mexican beef...
...into the Southern states by sea.
How long have you been in this business?
Four years.
Too long.
I beg your pardon?
Your theory is idiotic. Dismissed.
- What's that?
- I said, you're dismissed.
Out!
As you wish, sir.
Amusing picture.
Boatload of seasick cows, all standing with their heads over the rail.
Not priceless, Steadman?
Yes, sir.
But you're troubled.
Sir, I think there's something in what Mclntyre was saying.
Shipping cows from Mexico?
No, sir. Cattle closer to home.
Are we being exposed to the legal mind at work, major?
It's Kelly spending all that time with Rossiter.
Are you suggesting Kelly and Rossiter...
...are concocting a scheme to steal your herd?
Yes, sir.
Grant has an army around Richmond.
Rossiter has to get his cavalry out...
...and the cattle in.
Now, plead your case.
Anything else?
Request the general assign me additional troops.
If anybody tries to steal one of your precious cows...
...just telegraph me.
I promise to come a-running.
Get the officers in here.
Colonel Kelly will stay with me.
Colonel, huh?
I just made you lieutenant colonel...
...for the period of the raid.
Aren't you taking a risk, giving me that kind of authority?
When we get those cattle,
I'll be needing you to crack the whip.
You want to share the fun?
I doubt if you'd appreciate it.
- I like to laugh.
- I know you do.
Of course, this harebrained scheme is enough to make any man giddy.
Well, it's not my scheme making you giddy.
It's yours.
- How many guesses do I get?
- You don't need any.
That's bright of you, though, not to try to shake Hatcher off...
...a second time.
I wouldn't do a foolish thing like that.
I bet you wouldn't.
My goodness.
Parting with all that money.
For nothing.
It's a pity.
Considering what money means to you.
I think it went for a good purpose.
I'm sure of that.
I can see Ferguson donating it to a fund...
...for needy Scotchmen.
- You don't know how funny.
- It's too late.
- It is?
- Sure, his ship has sailed.
- I imagine it has.
- Didn't take you with him.
No, but he took Liz.
What?
I said, he took your girl.
Now how many guesses do I get?
You went to Royall Street, didn't you?
That money to Ferguson...
...for her passage.
Not yours.
Damn you, Kelly! Why?
Let's just say I was getting even with someone...
...for shooting a finger off.
I don't know how Liz could have anything to do with you!
Listen, you silly ass!
She's a female not a crinoline saint!
If you'd been as intent on pleasing her as serving the cause, she'd be with you.
Did you please her, Kelly?
I've got some advice for you, Rossiter.
Just close the book on this one.
I think I'll just do that.
- I'll close it...
- Colonel...
Reporting as ordered.
All right, gather around.
The tricky business is to get past Grant's line.
So we'll swing way out around it.
Fewer sentries.
We'll head for his back door, through Blackwater Swamp.
About a 50-mile route.
- If we can...
- Colonel? Pardon me, sir.
You're saying we'll plow through
Blackwater?
- That's one big swamp.
- That's my gamble.
Nobody will expect us, because nobody'd believe we could cross.
If we can get to the plantation by tomorrow night...
...we'll hide till dawn...
...take care of whatever Yanks are there.
- And then...
- I crack the whip.
That's what I'm here for.
Cavalry under General Hampton will cover our flank on the return.
General Lee's ordered a diversionary attack to hold the enemy's attention.
His artillery will be our sig...
That's it. That's Lee's artillery.
Our signal to ride. Let's go.
Bugler, call the men!
Colonel Kelly.
That book's not closed...
...yet.
If anything happens to me...
...kill him.
- Yes, sir.
Beaurider, ride across. Try it.
Old friends are the fairest.
General Rossiter detailed me as your aide.
Aide?
Light.
Next time, remember...
...never put the flame to the cigar.
A half an inch under.
You can learn about things like that in your spare time...
...while you're polishing my boots.
Looks fine, sir.
- All right. Take them across.
- Yes, sir.
Troops, full ahead.
Our luck's holding out.
That bridge is sound as a bell.
- I don't think so.
- They're crossing it.
Well-trained cavalrymen.
Slow their horses down and spread out.
What are you trying to say?
You ought to know cattle don't spread out. They jam together.
And when they do, they'll outweigh your horses 10-to-1.
This will come apart before the first steer hits the other side.
Williams, how long will it take you to shore up this bridge?
The rest of today and most of tomorrow.
You got till midnight.
Yes, sir.
Obliged, Mr. Kelly...
...for being so considerate of our problem.
My problem too.
I want to get Kelly across.
Yeah.
Move it!
Timber!
- Can you finish by midnight?
- No, sir. We can't. But we will.
Bring the column when you're done.
Farrow will meet you with word about the Yanks.
If I run into trouble, you take command.
And the herd. Let's go!
Is this the best way you could pick?
Yep. The best.
Because it's the most improbable.
Can you drive the cattle through here?
Solid spine, about 50 yards wide...
...and the Yanks know nothing about it?
If we keep the herd tight.
That's your job.
Farrow.
Beaurider.
Hatcher.
Just make sure you get there before dawn.
Come on.
Don't you ever get tired of being a chaperone?
I like it.
You know why?
Tell me.
I figure you might try once more.
You do that, Kelly.
Anytime you want to.
Just feel free.
I haven't been in this place for years.
Charity and I were kids, we used to sleep down here. Steal fruit.
When I get there, pick up a cone and throw it. And watch him.
Go on.
Hatcher, wait for me.
I'll take that.
Not even you...
...would shoot this close in.
Hurry up.
- How many men?
- Two hundred at least.
Any idea what regiment they are?
Pennsylvania 12th, and proud.
We fought them in the wilderness.
They're equipped with new repeating rifles.
- Where are they bunked down?
- Down by the old corral.
The old corral.
Farrow.
Charity. Apple core.
Baltimore.
Who's your friend?
Tom.
- Where's Steadman?
- Overseer's cottage.
- Telegraph line?
- At the cottage.
Cut it. As far from the cottage as you can.
Obliged, Charity. You've done your homework real well.
Come on.
- Hatcher?
- Here.
I hate to see loose guns lying around.
I'm glad you got it.
It'll make me feel better when I blow your guts out.
You'd better be faster than these two clowns you got here.
You could make me a Yankee hero.
He was near the fence, major.
We ordered him to halt. He ran.
- Should we notify Kautz?
- And tell him what?
- Reb spy.
- One man.
Unless we can produce the whole of
Hapham's cavalry, he'll just laugh.
- Corporal, get the servants.
- Yes, sir.
Beaurider.
Prisoner?
He's dead.
Question is, did he cut that wire?
Ruth.
You recognize him?
No, sir.
You sure?
I ain't never seen him before in my life.
Men?
- Never laid eyes on him, master.
- No, sir.
Anybody else?
I don't understand.
We're down here fighting for you.
Fighting to free you.
Ruth, how can you be so loyal...
...to someone who wants to keep you a slave?
Maybe that's the worst of them.
All right, bury him.
Wait.
Apples? This time of year?
Storage apples.
From a fruit cellar.
Game's up!
Everybody out!
All right, come on out with your hands up!
Come on out!
Come out or we'll fire!
Hands up! Up!
You put that gun down, please.
Well, Mr. Kelly.
Sergeant...
Lieutenant, sir.
No!
After him! Webster, telegraph line, make sure it's cut!
Farrow, the Yanks.
Now, you just hold it here, Kelly.
This is where I put you to work.
Let's get these Yanks out of here.
Come on, get going!
Rise and shine, gents! Get up! Come on!
Up and at them, blue boy.
Easy.
All right, out.
All right, out!
Get them in the corral!
Come on, boys. Let's move that powder.
Be careful there, Zeb.
All right. Start moving that herd.
- You see where Steadman's headed?
- I said, move.
Listen, you idiot.
Cattle can't make 5 miles an hour.
You'll be in Yankees up to here.
- You'll be lucky to get your men out.
- I told you to move!
No herd, no Kelly.
It was like playing games the other night, wasn't it?
Exciting and honorable.
How does it strike you now?
I'll ride point. Williams, you take the left flank.
Captain Webster, you take the right.
Would you consider riding drag?
No.
I didn't think so.
All right, move them out!
There it is, colonel. Just the way you saw it in that crazy dream.
With the genera"s permission...
...I'd like to remind the general
I warned him about this.
My judgement was correct all along.
Absolutely correct.
I gambled Lee would risk his cavalry and he did. He did.
The herd is big for Rossiter, and he's big for Hampton.
- Hampton?
- He was sighted, just as I planned.
I knew what that beef meant to the Rebs.
Colonel Jacobs is ready to ride.
- What's his strength?
- About 6000.
Excellent. Jacobs is to proceed down the Jerusalem Plank Road...
...and if he's fast he'll have
Hampton by the throat.
Which might never have happened...
...if I'd listened to your request for more troops.
What are you waiting for?
Detect my strategy, major?
Yes, sir.
Now, major. Question:
How do you believe Rossiter expects to get that herd back to Richmond?
Well, I'd say he's gonna drive the cattle into Blackwater Swamp.
I guess that's how they came...
...using the bridge at Cook's Crossing.
Splendid. That's why I'm giving you my reserves: 300 cavalry...
...plus a howitzer battery.
Satisfied?
Well?
Yes, sir. That's splendid, sir.
Yes, sir.
Herd them in tighter.
Colonel!
What is it?
I couldn't catch him.
Not with no quarter-mile lead.
Farrow! Take two men, scout ahead.
Yes, sir. Lanier, Dugot, let's go.
Yankees!
Let's get to the colonel. Let's go!
Come on, you stupid hunk of leather!
Get out of here!
You're miles from the stew pot!
Come on, move them out of here!
After a march, they've a right to a rest and a drink.
We don't have the time!
Get over!
Yankee cavalry.
They're hustling.
Probably at the bridge now.
- How many?
- Looked like a full squadron...
...and a battery of howitzers.
Can we bypass that bridge?
Nothing but swamp.
We'd drown every one of them.
- Williams?
- Yes, sir.
Drown them.
Drive them in the swamp.
At least that'll deny them the Yankee bellies.
Yes, sir.
- And, Williams?
- Yes, sir.
It does seem a pity to disappoint those Yanks at the bridge.
What you got in mind, colonel?
We'll split in two ranks, move at them from both sides.
Holy Mother of God.
3000 miles to drown in a stinking swamp!
You make me sick.
The Virginia Comanches do or die.
You're long on gallantry but short on sense.
We'll talk later.
You know nothing about cattle.
- What are you driving at?
- You want them in Richmond?
You know something, or are you just blowing hard, as usual?
You want this herd in Richmond?
You trying to tell me you know a way?
I might.
What's it worth to you?
What's your price?
You know what the price is.
All right, you got it.
Hatcher...
...any instructions I gave regarding Colonel Kelly:
Cancelled.
Yes, sir.
I'm in command now.
Go ahead.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
How many Yanks did you say?
I'd say abut 300, sir.
And about 100 of us.
2500 head of cattle.
That makes 2600 for our side.
We'll divide them up into groups of 500 each.
I want an inventory of ammunition.
Assemble your men for instructions.
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
This business of command comes easy to me.
Hatcher.
You know, sergeant...
...I'm going to miss your merry smile and winning ways. Get to work.
Let's hurry that up.
Do you still think they'll come this way?
- Get your men quiet.
- Quiet on the line!
The funny thing about cattle. You can hear them like the pounding of surf.
Come on!
Move it along! Get them going!
Move it along! Keep them moving!
Alert your men.
Ready on the firing line!
Get them moving!
All right, split them up!
Here they come.
Keep them moving!
- Shall I fire now?
- No, hold your fire.
All right, fire! Fire!
Shoot! Get the cattle! Get the cattle!
All right, hold, men. Hold!
Move them over to the right!
Hold your fire!
Here's the second group. Move!
Circle them twice!
Take it across the bridge. Fast!
- Williams!
- Yes, sir.
- Keep them on the run.
- Yes, sir!
Hatcher!
Ropes.
Drop it.
Swing it over.
Pull the rope.
Set the next one. Come on, hurry it up!
Hatcher, lay a trail.
Yes, sir!
Get them across the bridge!
As soon as the last man's over, light it.
Yes, sir!
Move them out! Move them over!
Over to the bridge!
Everybody out! Move!
Across the bridge!
Come here.
Get me a report of all companies.
Regroup here. Follow me!
Hatcher!
Hey, Mex! Now's your time!
General Hampton's compliments.
He's got the Union troops contained.
- It's clear sailing to Richmond.
- That's fine. Just fine.
We lost about 40 steers.
That's not bad.
You got one eye.
Looks like now you got one lung.
You keep on fighting like this, you'll wind up with one of everything.
You seem to manage pretty well yourself.
For a nine-fingered man.
Got 20 wounded.
Eight dead, sir.
Including Farrow and Hatcher.
Must've dropped Hatcher when he lit that fuse.
He timed it well.
If he'd lit that fuse any earlier, l...
He timed it fine.
He got chopped down like a hero.
Yeah.
We're all heroes.
Start pushing that herd.
All right, sir.
Well...
...I suppose you'd like to be moving on.
The sooner I get to Richmond, the quicker I get home.
Better feel your ground.
You're a wanted man...
...by the Yanks.
Kelly?
I saw some crazy things at that bridge.
One of them was you, risking your life to save a Confederate officer.
Seems to me that was...
...kind of long on gallantry, short on sense.
- Wouldn't you say?
- I try everything on once.
See if it fits.
Looked kind of stylish on you.
I never thought I'd catch myself saying that.
Don't worry, I won't try it twice.
For once, the soldiers of the Confederacy...
...and the people of Richmond would eat their fill.
What General Grant said when he heard...
...that his prize herd was raided is unquotable.
President Lincoln's comment is a matter of record.
Lincoln called it.
"The slickest piece of cattle stealing
I ever heard of. "
"Unhappy memories!
Yet I welcome you...
You are my long-lost youth..."
ARMY OF SHADOWS
We're taking a little detour.
You're not in any hurry?
Not at all.
My partner's just gotta pick up a few provisions.
You do what you can in these lousy times.
Of course.
You'll be okay there.
It's the best camp in France.
A camp for Germans. l don't understand.
During the Phony War, we expected lots of prisoners.
Naturally, we didn't take a single one.
But now the camp comes in handy.
How lucky can you get.
You said it.
Same old story.
Who are they? How do we treat them?
Some are sent without trial and kept here indefinitely.
Others are released quickly and regain influence in the region, or the prefecture, when it's not in Vichy.

- He asleep?
- He's very ill.
- No infirmary?
- Full up.
Do you play dominoes?
- Sorry, no.
- We can teach you.
Thanks, but I'm not cut out for it.
Then excuse us.
We just have time to finish our game before lights out.
The commander's not stupid.
He sandwiches me between three fools and two lost souls.
Out walking so early? l work at the power plant.
Good job?
Not even an extra crumb of bread.
But I work to keep in practice.
See you, comrade.
You a communist?
But I do have comrades.
There were all nations and races.
Russians.
Poles.
Kabyles.
Jews of every nation.
Gypsies.
Yugoslavs.
Romanians.
Czechs.
Anti-Nazi Germans.
Anti-Fascist Italians.
Anti-Franco Spaniards.
And black marketeers who stood out from the rest.
Everything okay? l once laid a power line in Savoy.
- You an electrical engineer?
- Like yourself.
Oh, no, you must really be somebody.
But we could talk shop once in a while.
Sure.
The Catholic teacher died one night without a sound, as usual.
Some Kabyles removed his body.
I never even heard his voice.
I'm not sad.
Armel is better off this way.
The score will be settled.
Mr. Gerbier. l have an idea.
I'll tell you tonight.
Two things make escape impossible: the barbed wire and the sentries.
The ground under the wire is uneven.
I can blind the sentries long enough by cutting the power.
Why haven't you tried to escape before? l wouldn't go without Armel, and I wouldn't do it alone.
You I can trust.
Why tell me all this?
They need you on the outside.
Turn off the light and get some sleep.
Good night.
The communist and l secretly worked out an escape plan.
We gradually eliminated obstacles.
Let's go, Gerbier.
Take your things.
Hurry up!
Tell Legrain good-bye for me.
But -
Jackasses.
Good-bye, gentlemen.
LlNE OF DEMARCATION
Travel permit, please.
This is our chance.
I'll get up to ask the guard something.
You run through the two doors.
This one here and the door to the street.
Good luck.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you spare a cigarette?
The mighty fortress, Europe, is fighting bolshevism.
MarshaI Stalin wants to defend his city, Stalingrad.
What do you want?
But Stalingrad will be taken and renamed.
A shave.
The Marshal said...
The Marshal did...
The Marshal keeps his promises.
All done.
I'll get your change.
Take this.
It's not very smart, but it's all I have.
A note from the organization
Paul Dounat belonged to - his name was now
Vincent Henry - had instructed him to be in Marseilles mid-afternoon to meet a comrade he knew outside the courthouse.
Dounat had been at the appointed spot for a few minutes.
Police. Your papers.
Fine. But I must ask you to come along for some simple fact checking.
A nasty job.
You may hate bowlers, Felix, but you still have to wear one.
Only when we get out.
Look at him.
He sold you out, along with Zephyr and the radioman.
There's no point in providing any proof or asking you questions.
We should have dropped him long ago.
It's my fault.
We're too few for so many missions.
Le Bison, can't you step on it?
Not unless you want to attract attention.
I'm in a hurry too. l have to fix that old transmitter... and repair our delivery agent's bicycle.
And there's a parachute drop tonight.
- Do you have my new papers?
- They're on me.
Want them now?
Driving up there will attract attention.
We'll walk.
- I'll come too.
- It's not necessary.
Really it's not. l agree.
I'll be back after dark, just in case...
One false move and you're a dead man.
Christ! That place was empty
When We rented.
Keep moving anyway.
In the back room. ls he the traitor we have to...?
Yes, that's him.
And you're the chief?
Claude Le Masque.
He's been begging for a tough job. l came early to prepare things and discovered the neighbors.
They must've moved in last night or this morning. l phoned Felix at once, but you were already on the way.
We'll manage somehow.
We can question him in the attic.
I've set up a table and some chairs.
We're not here for a trial.
We're here for this.
But you can't!
They'll hear everything next door.
Listen.
The walls are paper-thin.
The Brits could've sent the silencers we asked for.
Let's try to find a better spot.
How could you do it?
Nothing doing.
The cellar connects with the one next door.
The attic carries sound even more.
We need a good knife.
Le Bison always carries one.
A knife?
You can't be serious! l won't let you.
Felix... check the dining room or the kitchen.
You can't do this.
I'm begging you. This is murder.
In any case, we're here to kill, correct?
Yes, but not like this.
We have to - l know.
Do it the right way.
I'm not afraid. l swear I'm not.
But it's my first time, you see?
It's our first time too.
Isn't that obvious?
Nothing.
We could leave him here till Le Bison gets back.
Out of the question.
We're all busy. l want to tell the boss the job's done.
Damn it to hell!
We can't bash his head in with a gun, can we?
Gag him.
Strangle him.
With our hands?
There's a towel in the kitchen.
Stop that!
Dounat has to die.
That's why you're here.
You wanted a tough job.
You got it. Don't complain.
Sit him up in the chair.
Felix, stand behind him.
I'll hold his arms.
Le Masque will hold his legs. l swear it won't hurt.
Let's go.
Coming. l didn't think we could do it.
Neither did l.
Always carry cyanide capsules on you. lf you're caught, use them. l will.
Glass of rum.
Jean-Francois!
You haven't changed.
Still young and handsome.
Neither have you.
What brings you to Marseilles? l sold my garage outside Paris and opened a bike shop here.
What are you up to?
Nothing at all. l have an appointment.
Walk with me a bit?
Sure. I'll be right out.
Wait for me five minutes?
Five minutes, but not a lifetime.
Still on a lucky streak?
You got some nerve, wearing that pilot's jacket.
Well, screw them!
Then what?
What? ls that all you'd do to them?
As for the war, if there's no sport in it -
What if I gave you some sport?
Real sport?
You'd have to get up early, spend nights traveling, and never ask questions.
Keep talking.
Come by my shop.
Here's the address.
Nothing in writing.
Memorize it.
And not a word to anyone.
- You're crazy.
You say that, but with a woman -
- I don't have one.
- And that girl?
I said five minutes, but she'll wait a lifetime.
We always confide in our parents.
Mine are dead.
My only brother's in Paris. l worship him... but there's no risk of me telling him anything.
LYON TALENT AGENCY ls the director expecting you?
No, Mr. Roussel.
Please come this way. l came at once.
We have an emergency.
How many men do you have for Gibraltar?
Two Canadian commandos from Dieppe, three RAF pilots who were shot down, and two Belgians sentenced to death by the Germans.
With me, that makes eight.
Where will they wait for the sub?
They're watching the clinic.
Can't we scatter them around?
No. They'd do something stupid.
The Canadian colonel goes to the cafe.
He thinks you can't detect his accent.
We'll only know when the sub arrives the day before.
Take them all to the Viellat farm.
All of them?
So much for total security.
We're not an insurance company.
In these conditions, on the contrary. lt all depends on the man in charge of them.
I have just the man.
You don't know him.
He did a few assignments for me.
He was just fine.
He's in Paris delivering a transmitter to Mathilde.
When's he due back?
Should be tomorrow morning.
Brief him right away, so everything is ready by tomorrow night.
I'll join them at the last minute.
And you get some rest.
- After you're gone.
- No, before.
You won't have time later.
We inform travelers that all luggage will be inspected at the exit.
Open the suitcase.
No black market goods?
What's that?
As you can see, a radio.
All right, move along.
No problems?
No problems.
Twice in a row.
Tell Felix the transmitters need new crystals.
The wavelengths changed.
All right.
Can I help you?
Certainly not.
- The other radio's there.
- Okay. A bite to eat?
No, there's someone l need to see.
Greetings, Saint Luc!
Little Jean.
All the books are in place.
As well as the harpsichord... and the oboe.
Nothing's changed.
Oh, the temperature has.
No more coal.
So to keep from freezing, l bought this.
For working at night and for meals.
But say, how'd you get here? l hope you have an Ausweiss.
Saint Luc has come down to earth!
Saint Luc knows what an Ausweiss is.
Yes, I have one.
And not only that -
Not only that, I'm starving.
We'll have lunch right away. Marie!
Yes, Mr. Luc.
What's on the menu today?
Rutabagas, like yesterday, Mr. Luc.
- What else?
- Unrationed cheese.
And there's some butter left, but no more bread.
I've got loads of bread tickets. l can let you have them.
You're doing badly.
You used to be a gourmand.
I still am, but what's one to do?
What about the black market?
And resourcefulness?
Marie's scared of the police -
And so are you, Saint Luc. l store up heat. l felt the heat myself today.
Twice.
It's those trains and crowded subways.
You can suffocate. l wondered if Mathilde, whom
I'd only just met, wasn't cIoser to me than you, dear brother, whom I'd always Ioved, whom I still love, but with whom I share nothing but memories.
I left for Marseilles that evening.
Much later, I recalled having felt a sort of... foreboding.
So, Madame Viellat, quite a hotel you run.
Good evening, sir.
Well?
The fisherman will be ready at midnight.
He can take everyone in a single trip.
Madeleine will show you the way to avoid any patrols.
Fine.
- Do I go back?
- No.
There'll be an extra passenger.
It's the big chief.
There are too many in our boat.
You'll take him in another boat.
Le Bison will bring him.
Wait for my signal once I'm aboard.
Three short lights and one long.
Got it.
We're in a hurry tonight, so how much do I owe you?
I'll do the bill another time.
You always say that.
You keep coming back, so you must like it here.
Walk in single file.
Not too close, but stay in sight of each other.
Not a sound, not a word.
No nonsense. I'm armed.
What're you doing here so late?
And you?
I'm Augustine Viellat's brother-in-law.
The farmer's wife?
I'm checking if the coast is clear.
- And?
- No problem.
The gendarmes passed by up above.
The Germans don't know the area and trust customs.
And customs?
That's a good one.
Customs is me!
I'm the officer for the whole area.
That is a good one.
Time to board.
Good luck, chief.
Strange to think how the big chief looks the same as anyone else.
In that boat, the apex and base of the pyramid meet.
Odd geometry! I must ask
Saint Luc about it after the war.
So glad to travel with you.
Same here.
I can't send all the arms you request.
As you know, the English have little confidence in the French Resistance.
They want all available planes for missions in Germany.
But I can increase your transmissions.
I'll send you some available radio operators and provide backup to your agents to improve the landing fields for our Lysanders.
An hour before the ceremony,
Jardie asked me to attend.
The war will be over for the French when they can see this great movie.
I heard about Felix that same day. l still had a lot to do in London, but with his arrest, l couldn't stay a minute longer. l decided to return that night.
You've never jumped before?
No, never.
Be careful when your feet hit the ground.
Don't try to avoid falling.
Bend your knees and roll.
Understand?
More or less.
In my absence and after Felix's arrest,
Mathilde had moved down to Lyon.
She proved herself a first-rate organizer.
I made her my assistant.
The chief had told me she was a remarkable woman, but she still astonished me.
She knows both how to command and how to carry out orders.
She is strong-willed, methodical and patient.
She spent days studying the layout of the Lyon military medical school, now Gestapo HQ.
She learned Felix was in the celI reserved for those to be tortured.
She wanted to breach the walls with expIosives.
She had to give up that plan for another one requiring various disguises.
She found a new hideout for my command post.
She couldn't have found a safer spot.
My new host was Baron de Ferte Talloir.
Ex-cavalry officer, needless to say.
Before the war, l was a sworn enemy of the Republic. l organized my sharecroppers, kennelmen and huntsmen into a squadron armed with hunting rifles and pistols.
I was ready to lead a cavalry charge against the Iocal prefecture in the event of a Royalist uprising.
His squadron, perfectly trained and organized, still exists and guarantees my security.
The baron invited me to use his grounds as a drop point and landing strip.
His wishes came true beyond all expectations.
What a strange carousel!
As one plane descended, another one just like it circled Iow over the field.
The steady drone of its motor covered the landing and takeoff of the first plane, which then covered for the other.
That night, in two operations, four men arrived from London and four others returned.
Le Bison, Le Masque,
Jean-Francois and Mathilde handled security for the operation.
And your husband?
Does he know about your activities?
Certainly not.
Neither does my daughter.
That's her.
She's 17.
Don't carry it on you.
You're right.
I'll get rid of it.
Before we get back to what l don't dare call "routine" matters, we have to take care of Felix.
He has no cyanide tablets on him.
I'm not worried about him talking... but he probably can't escape torture.
The Gestapo won't let you commit suicide.
We have to spare him the suffering that could go on for days, even weeks.
I've given it some thought.
There are no two ways about it.
- You found a way?
We have to get into Gestapo HQ and bring Felix out.
Mathilde, I want to save Felix, but I can't commit a combat group to such a desperate mission.
Who's talking about a combat group?
With Le Masque, Jean-Francois, and Le Bison, I should manage.
And how!
What's your plan?
Le Bison, can you get us three German uniforms?
- Sure thing.
- Go to it.
Our first obstacle is to contact Felix and let him know. l haven't figured it out yet, but I will.
Felix has to be ready and waiting for us.
I've been trying to reach him myself.
You'd think a German architect built that medical school.
You can't get in.
- True, it won't be easy.
It's hot.
Mr. Gerbier...
I have neither
Le Masque's courage... nor Le Bison's strength... nor Mathilde's daring.
I won't take part in this mission.
But I'm sure that Mathilde and my comrades will succeed.
Don't try to find me.
"Mr. Dupont, 6 rue du Boeuf.
Saint Jean knows lots of things about the Resistance."
How did you manage?
Oh...
We'll only use two uniforms,
Guillaume. l know, Madame Mathilde.
NO ADMlTTANCE
You're not doing this without me.
We're certainly not doing it with you.
Remember what you said.
"You have no right to sacrifice anyone."
Least of all when it's you.
But that goes just as much for you.
Now, about Felix -
- May l?
Two men - that looks normal.
But three would be too many.
When Jean-Francois was here, you wanted three uniforms.
But at the last moment
I'd only have used
Le Masque and Le Bison.
Jean-Francois... l trusted him.
Me too, but that's not what I mean. l just never thought he'd leave us like that.
Who is this man?
The man denounced in the letter.
You can go in.
Naturally, Dupont is the only name you have.
Naturally.
What organization are you with? l don't understand.
You know the risk you're taking?
Being shot under a false name.
Your fate would remain a mystery.
I decided to leave that haven.
Maybe I felt it coming.
Three days later, the baron and his men were arrested and shot without trial.
What is it?
We're to transfer a certain Felix Lepercq to Paris to the headquarters of Obersturmfuhrer Bomelburg.
Yes, a terrorist. Hurry up.
It's urgent.
- Get out.
Wait here.
An ambulance from the Paris Gestapo is here for a terrorist,
Felix Lepercq.
Notify the doctor on duty.
Let him issue the transfer permit.
Can you hear me?
Mathilde, Le Bison and Le Masque are here.
I'll help you.
Are you in a lot of pain?
It's no use.
He'll be in great pain... right up to the end.
It's impossible. l can't let you transport a dying man. I'm sorry.
Very welI.
I'll file a report. l have some cyanide capsules.
Do you want one?
We could have saved Felix.
No one could.
Not even you.
Besides, you're wanted by the police.
You'd better lie low for a while.
Take the next plane out.
You're not serious.
And the maquis groups springing up all over?
They have to be organized, trained and given supplies.
No one can replace me for now.
And if you're caught?
Then we'd have to replace you.
Police!
So Germaine serves good food?
Meat at every meal without tickets? ldentity check for everyone!
Get a move on!
I'll save it for later.
He says to smoke quickly.
They're coming for us.
He could get in trouble.
To each his own troubles.
This is it.
TRANSFlNlTE AND CONTlNUUM
Love has meaning for me only as it applies to the chief.
He means more to me than anything.
More than anything but less than life. lf Luc Jardie died,
I'd still want to live, but I'm going to die, and I'm not afraid.
It's impossible not to be afraid of dying.
But I'm too stubborn, too much of an animal to believe it.
If I don't believe it to the very last moment, the last split second,
I'll never die.
What a revelation!
The chief would Iove it.
I've got to look into this more deeply -
You will turn your backs to the machine guns and face the far wall.
You will run as fast as you can.
We will not open fire at once.
We will give you a chance.
Whoever reaches the far wall will be shot later with the next group of condemned men.
We can always try.
There's nothing to lose.
He knows what my legs want.
He's ready for the show.
His confidence shackles me more than my irons.
Go!
I won't run.
I won't! lt had to be timed perfectly.
Thank Mathilde for that.
We were well informed.
And what if I hadn't run?
Something wrong?
Thinking about the others?
No, about the officer who was so sure I'd run too, like a scared rabbit.
Step on it! lsn't safety great?
You have enough for a month.
The water's okay, but I'll bring some wine.
No, don't come back for a month.
I'd better run.
The car mustn't be seen here.
Then run along.
See to your arm and thigh.
Don't let them get infected.
- All right, Guillaume.
You'll find a razor on the table.
For three weeks
I've been holed up alone like a frightened animal.
I wrote a Iong report for London. l kid myself that I'm still of some use.
I haven't seen Mathilde or anyone else.
ESSAY ON THE PROBLEM OF THE
FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS
NOTES ON THE DEVELOPMENT
OF ABSTRACT SET THEORY
ON LOGIC
AND THE THEORY OF SClENCE
AXIOMATIC METHOD
AND FORMALISM
My only link to the outside worId are the five books
Luc Jardie wrote before the war.
They keep me company.
At night, I'm haunted by Jean-Francois' disappearance.
Le Bison? Or Le Masque? ls that you?
It's you?
We have to talk.
- When did you get back?
- Four days ago.
After Mathilde's arrest.
We have to talk about her.
We have to, Philippe.
Mathilde was arrested on the 27th.
She wasn't hurt.
She found a way to let us know.
The Gestapo discovered her real identity and her family's address.
She was carrying her daughter's photo on her.
You can guess the rest.
The photo?
Mathilde's only slipup.
The Germans sensed it was that remarkable woman's weak point.
The photo...
How could she have kept it?
I warned her.
It's extraordinary, Philippe.
She begged them to give her back the photo.
What?
Mathilde sent us an SOS.
They've given her a choice:
Either she names all the agents she knows in our network or her daughter is sent to a Polish whorehouse for soldiers from the Eastern Front.
Those are the givens of the problem.
We must find a solution.
She can escape.
She can neither escape nor kill herself.
The Gestapo is confident.
The daughter will answer for everything.
She can play for time.
How much time?
That doesn't solve the problem.
Here's Le Bison.
Don't tell him I'm here.
Go into the back room. l got you a new pair of glasses.
The same as before.
Any news from Mathilde?
WelI?
- I don't know anything.
What? l don't know anything.
It's all in the letter.
She was released yesterday morning.
Gerbonel and Arno were arrested last night. ls that right? lf that's what it says.
Le Masque... you knew about this?
I'm not in charge of reports.
Mathilde is to be eliminated at once, by any means.
You can't be serious!
I won't lay a finger on Madame Mathilde. l worked with her.
She saved my skin. l watched her at Gestapo HQ.
She's a great woman!
If it was a man, whenever you say.
As many as you want.
But not Madame Mathilde!
Over my dead body. Never!
No arguments, Guillaume.
She has to die and she will.
You can't do that.
We have other killers. lf need be, I'll do it.
You wouldn't dare!
You have no right!
In the shooting range, you could've run like mad, but she saved your life with those smoke grenades.
You mustn't do it.
Let her sell us all out if she wants.
She protected me.
She protected you.
Now it's her daughter.
We can't judge her.
That'll do!
The matter is settled. lf you're coward enough to do it,
I'll get you first.
Stop!
Get off me! You were still a kid when I was in the Foreign Legion!
Think I'll stand by and let you do this?
Are you crazy?
Back off before I kill you both!
What we need here is a man who knows nothing about weapons.
Sit down, my friend.
Have a cigarette.
It'll do you good.
Right, Gerbier?
You heard it all?
You're right.
Mathilde is a marvelous woman, more than you know.
But we're going to kill her.
- You can't.
We can, and here's why.
We're going to kill her because she's begging us to.
She told you that?
No, but it's obvious.
Think for a moment.
If she just wanted to save her daughter, she'd only have to supply some names.
You know her memory. lnstead, she tells them our agents keep moving around, that she needs to reestablish contacts.
So she gets herself released. lsn't that clear enough?
Now put yourself in her place, forced to hand over your friends, and unable to commit suicide.
I'd want to be killed.
You think you're any braver or better than Mathilde?
- I'm sorry.
- Find a German car.
Le Masque will drive.
I'll be in back with you.
Are you crazy?
I'm sure she'll want to see me.
Don't! It's no place for you.
It's an order.
That wasn't necessary, chief.
You sure of what you claim about Mathilde?
How should I know?
My theory might be correct.
Or she wanted to see her daughter again, making it harder for her to die.
That's what I want to find out. l have to be with you for the hardest part.
You in a car full of killers!
Nothing's sacred anymore.
SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1943
Go!
Claude Ullmann, alias Le Masque, had just enough time to swallow his cyanide capsule on November 8, 1943.
Guillaume Vermersch, alias Le Bison, was decapitated by ax in a German prison on December 16, 1943.
Luc Jardie died under torture on January 22, 1944, after revealing one name: his own.
And on February 13, 1944,
Philippe Gerbier decided this time he wouldn't run.
Shall I turn it off?
No, leave it.
It's no good blaming yourself.
What else? What else?
The weather, the men?
I planned it.
I led it.
La Plage was my baby.
I went wrong.
But it won't happen again.
The next one will be right.
I'll make it right.
Happy birthday, Daddy.
Entirely consistent with the war effort.
That's fantastic!
Make a wish, Daddy.
I'll get the champagne.
Champagne! By golly.
- Would you like to pass them around?
- Yeah.
- Nothing like champagne.
- One there.
- Thank you.
- And there.
I'm trying to get mine.
What about me?
I'm sorry, General.
Pub just closed.
A toast. To Jamie.
To Jamie.
Jamie.
Where'd you get this?
I've got connections, too, you know.
Connections? I hope the airport knows where you're coming from.
We have an understanding.
We have an understanding whereby he shares my beer, and I share his champagne.
- That's not a bad deal.
- Very good.
What about... Thank you.
I'm just saying...
Sweetheart?
A very happy birthday.
Hey, what's this?
Jamie, it's all I could think of.
How nice.
Engraved and everything.
"To Jamie.
Love, Sue. "
Okay, lovers, break it up.
Come on.
Give him a chance to get drunk at his own party, Sue.
You have just ruined a very beautiful moment.
Sorry, my dear.
How do you like the present my wife gave me?
Ah, it's nice.
- Can I be the first?
- It would be a pleasure.
Allow me. Please.
Jamie, I hate to change the subject, but you do know that Operation Mad Dog is under heavy attack, don't you?
Yes, I know.
Captain Franklin.
He stopped you once.
He'll try and stop you again.
We'll see what happens at that meeting tomorrow.
And am I now being told that in spite of the negative opinions of the naval and military planners, plus the doubts expressed by the Air Vice Marshall on Air Support- in spite of all this, we are still considering Major Wilson's lunatic operation Mad Dog?
That is correct.
I was under the impression we'd killed Mad Dog months ago.
So we had.
It was dead, but it wouldn't lie down.
We're reevaluating it.
You'll forgive me if I fail to see why.
I Branch came through with a massive up-to-date intelligence from French underground sources.
Soft points, dummy gun positions, sea patrol timings.
A very revealing picture of Le Clairé's overall defense plan.
And you think that's enough to destroy a target which up to now has defied all our efforts, including pinpoint bombing by the RAF?
When added to the new demolition plan
I've already submitted, yes.
To go into Le Clairé, to launch Mad Dog, is madness.
Another disaster like La Plage, where 390-odd out of 500 men were killed in a matter of minutes.
Captain, if I may-
Where Major Wilson's own
Commando Unit lost 60% of its men- a record casualty rate by any standards.
This operation can be a suicidal mistake, and I want no part of it!
Major?
Not to go into Le Clairé would be a mistake.
As long as this installation- the heart and sinew of a German surface fleet-is in being, thousands of tons of our shipping will continue to be sunk every week.
Why? Because at Le Clairé,
German warships can be refitted, refueled, and repaired in almost complete safety.
Destroy this big dock, and you immobilize the German surface fleet, to say nothing of putting a fatal dent into what the Nazi High Command so proudly calls the "Iron Coast. "
Commander Kimberly, have your views on Mad Dog changed at all?
Well, sir, I think that Major Wilson's idea of packing the bow of a destroyer with tons of high explosives and then ramming the dock at Le Clairé is...
Well, it's imaginative.
But I think it's more romantic than practical.
I'm afraid, sir, much would have to be done to give this plan even the smallest chance of succeeding.
For example, we've gone into great detail about how to get into Le Clairé.
Nothing has been said about how we get out.
Major? How would you get out?
I was under the impression that getting in was the important thing.
Mad dogs and Canadians.
From a purely military point of view, the operation must be viewed as unsound.
However, so was the idea of the Trojan horse.
I think Mad Dog is well worth the risk it involves.
Dammit, sir,
I request permission to withdraw from any further participation in this!
Not granted.
Yes, sir.
Captain, I respect your concern with this operation.
You may be right...
...but Number 10 Downing Street wants something like this.
It's audacious, gentlemen.
It's mad.
It's just mad enough to work.
Go, go!
Move fast, men! Move, move!
Come on, move! Move!
Let's go! Come on!
Over to the target!
Up! Up, up and over!
Don't wait for the man in front of you! Go! Go!
Well, he's certainly got them cracking.
Come on, come on!
Come on, move it there! Move!
I doubt if the Germans will be impressed.
Well, we've selected a moonless night to go in.
This blindfold lark should really help their orientation.
Go, go, go!
Come on! Go!
Come on, come on! Move!
Pick your feet up!
Move fast, men!
Move, move!
Don, we've got to stop him.
Go around!
Move now! Move fast!
There are easier things to stop than a dedicated man.
Dedicated? He's a fanatic!
Swing along those poles!
Keep your feet together!
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
Daddy!
Hi, Timmy.
- You're so late.
- I know, I know.
- Let me fix you a drink.
- Good.
I waited up for you.
Come on, play with me.
Not now.
Maybe-maybe later, huh?
Straight whiskey.
You promised.
All right, Timmy.
That's enough.
Off to bed now.
Good night, General.
- Here you are, darling.
- Thank you.
Relax.
Daddy, how many soldiers did you kill today?
I didn't have time to count them all, General.
Go!
Come on, keep your heads down!
Keep your heads down.
Go! Go!
Go! Keep it down!
Keep low! Go! Go!
Go! Keep down!
All right, go!
Keep down! Keep down!
Down!
Move! Fast, fast!
Still at it, eh?
I saw the RTS test.
It's a beautiful job.
It really does scramble radar.
I told Captain Franklin that we'd like one mounted on the masthead, okay?
- Look, if I'm in your way-
- You're not.
Jamie,
I told you from the start what I think about this operation.
Now, if that offends you, get someone else.
I don't want someone else,
I want you.
But I want all that you have to give.
You're getting it.
And Franklin?
Well, he's hardly a convert, but despite what you think of him, he's a very good officer.
This scrambler was his brainchild.
He delivers, Jamie.
Then where are the ships and equipment that I ordered three weeks ago?
Supplies are pretty tight these days.
You wouldn't kill me, would you?
The Royal Navy wouldn't be trying to give me the Royal you-know-what.
- A lost order here, a slow delivery-
- Come off it, Jamie.
You think the Royal Navy's got nothing better to do than to wet-nurse you?
Kimberly here.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Bye.
That was Franklin's office.
Your equipment will be in at noon tomorrow.
Put some beef into it.
Make it real.
They must be out of their minds.
Who do they think they're kidding?
They're not kidding.
Captain Franklin and Don are aboard the Sweeper inspecting her now.
This is it, huh?
This is it.
This stinking little bathtub.
Now, just a minute, sir.
- This is a fighting ship?
- I beg your pardon.
Major Wilson, Lieutenant Forrester.
Sir, this vessel's a ship of the Line in His Majesty's Navy and has had nine battle engagements.
I am her skipper.
According to Captain Franklin, she is now expendable because of some crazy notion of the Army, who, it seems to me, ought to stay in their own britches.
With your permission, sir,
I'll leave you to figure out the details of the execution while I go below and comfort her ancient bones.
You don't miss a chance to slur and downgrade this operation, do you?
Even to the skipper of this garbage scow.
Well, it won't work.
You want to scuttle Mad Dog, but it won't work.
This heap of scrap is not acceptable, and neither are those waterlogged fishing smacks.
I'm going over your head, Captain.
To the Admiral.
He's on his way.
Good, but before he gets here, let's get a few things straight.
It's the La Plage raid, that's what's burning inside you.
You and your staff room heroes should've called the whole thing off.
The conditions were wrong, but you let us go in anyway.
And when we lost how many men, Captain?
You quote the figure often enough-
390 out of 500.
Your own son among them.
You couldn't accept it, could you?
You needed an out.
Did I?
Yes. Yes, and I was it.
Suddenly, it was my raid.
Suddenly I was the-the pied piper.
But you know better than that, don't you?
You know that I didn't kill those men, that I didn't kill your son any more than you did.
Jamie, for God's sake.
At least he's got a reason to scrub this operation.
What's yours, my friend?
Look, Jamie, for the last time-
Now, now, Don, let him rave on.
I never charged him with killing anyone.
He's charging himself for that.
And that's why he wants this operation.
He wants to wash the blood off his hands.
Well, he's not going to use me for it.
And you're not gonna stop me!
Jamie, what are you-
Nor your cabin boy!
Ship's company.
Attention!
Morning.
- Everything in order?
- I think so, sir.
Not for me it isn't, sir.
This-well, whatever it is- is absolutely impossible.
I just don't understand this kind of cooperation.
It seems to be solid enough.
It's not ideal, but it's a sturdy little ship.
Aye. Sturdy she is, sir.
Sturdy as a-
As a cattle boat.
Major, I hope you didn't expect something just off the slips.
I didn't expect something off the junk pile either, sir.
I was promised a destroyer, two escorts, and torpedo boats.
What I got hardly fit the description.
We made no promises, sir.
We said we'd try.
I appreciate your difficulties, Captain.
In the circumstances,
I think you've done very well.
A damn sight better than I have.
The RAF still won't give me a firm commitment for the air strike.
Combined operations.
Good God, sir, how can you expect-
I expect this operation will go forward whether conditions are ideal or not.
Unless you, as officer in charge of the military assault, ask to scrub it.
We're going across.
Now hear this.
No smoking, and all naked lights to be extinguished until further orders.
Now hear this.
No smoking, and all naked lights to be extinguished until further orders.
Go!
Move!
Faster, men, faster! Move!
Fast, fast!
Go, go, fast!
No, no, no.
Keep going!
Don't wait for him.
That's his problem.
You're under heavy fire!
Come on, get up, get up!
Faster!
Come on, get on your feet!
Get moving in there!
Move, move, move!
Now hear this!
The next troop will be landing under simulated battle conditions.
Do not deviate to right or left.
Your job is to get to your objective.
Stand by!
Go! Go!
Come on!
Go! Go!
Come on, move!
Go!
Sergeant, get an ambulance!
Bring a stretcher, quickly!
Don?
Look at me, boy, look.
Where's that stretcher?!
Will he be able to see?
- You hear me?
- I heard you, sir.
I'm sure the doc will be able to tell you everything you want to know.
What do you think?
I think somebody ought to know better than to play such games.
Doesn't Jerry do enough without you blokes getting in the act?
It was an accident.
- Who was to know that-
- I should have.
I should have known.
I wanted it rough, but...
Stop blaming yourself, Jamie.
Jamie?
Yes, Don. Yes?
That commando...
Is he gonna be all right?
How many soldiers did you kill today?
...soldiers did you kill today... soldiers did you-
Yes, Timmy?
Darling, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Sorry I woke you.
I've been watching you for some time.
I don't know what's wrong with me, what's the matter.
I thought I'd turned everything off...
...that nothing could touch me anymore.
If it's Don you're worried about, the doctor said he'll be all right.
It's just a matter of time.
I can't seem to get him out of my mind.
You can't blame yourself.
It was an accident.
An accident!
Military risk!
Fortunes of war!
I'm scared, Sue.
All of sudden... I'm scared.
I'm wondering if what I'm doing...
...is right.
I'm wondering if-if one man should have this power to...
...this power to decide on... life and death.
Nobody has that power.
So get it over with.
Finish it.
Come back to me before it's too late.
You've been a stranger.
And over a period of six weeks, eight men dead, killed, thirty-two men injured, fourteen hospitalized.
Training accident.
Three small boats destroyed.
Training accident.
And what's even more to the point, the only senior officer ready and capable of taking this expedition into Le Clairé is now...
Training accident.
Mad Dog must be cancelled, the men and materials must be released for duties elsewhere.
Frankly, gentlemen, an operation of this caliber must have a respectable chance of succeeding.
Obviously, we've been fooling ourselves.
With your permission, sir.
Carry on, Commander.
During the past several weeks,
I have had time to think about Operation Mad Dog...
...and about Major Wilson.
I think I understand him better now.
I saw him forced to accept inferior and substandard equipment.
I saw him pushing his men on ruthlessly.
Training them under simulated battle conditions.
I saw men die in his training, and I was sickened by it.
But for every man we lose now, ten will survive at Le Clairé.
It's part of the risk.
It's the price you pay for success.
Major Wilson knows this.
And he has my support.
Thank you, Commander.
Any comment, Captain?
I strongly advise a postponement of two or three months until Commander Kimberly is fit for duty. Then we can-
Postponement is out of the question.
We've got to move within six days or not at all.
The tide and moon are right.
Weather predictions are good.
Also, there's a strong rumor that the Ostwind has suffered heavy damage and will put in at Le Clairé.
If we destroy the docks, one of Germany's largest battleships will be helpless.
An open target.
Did you hear that rumor, Freddie?
No, but that doesn't mean it's not true.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose so.
I want this operation.
I want it badly.
But without the commander-
There is an officer, sir.
One of the best I've served under.
Would you accept going in without a senior naval officer?
Admiral, I won't accept it!
The Major can go in with his own men, but I'm damned if he'll command mine!
Captain, I want this operation.
Have you established rendezvous?
Yes, sir.
Our ETD is 1700 hours Portsmouth.
On Wednesday.
Very good.
I think that's all, Michael, isn't it?
I think so, sir.
The party's yours, Captain.
Good luck.
Is that an order, sir?
That's an order.
Say when.
When.
I'd never have done it without your help.
I sure thank you, Don.
No need to thank me, Jamie.
Well, they've given you the green light, but God knows what you're letting yourself in for.
I hope you meant what you said.
Yes, I meant it.
Jamie, I'm sorry about Franklin, but there was no other way.
All I want is for him to do his job.
He'll do it.
When did he last see action?
A man like him never loses his sea legs.
I hope to God you're right.
You'll get well again.
All in good time.
Who knows?
Maybe they've given me a break.
Be lucky, Jamie.
Yes. Thank you.
- Port ten.
- Port ten, sir.
Ten degrees, port wheel on, sir.
- Midships.
- Midships, sir.
- Steady as she goes.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Captain, if it's a few more revolutions you're wanting-
Skipper, she's doing just fine.
Bless her old heart.
It's just like a mill pond out there.
The weather boys' predictions were right on the nose.
Well, there'll be no seasickness on this trip.
Don't be so optimistic, Major.
A steady swell, cramped conditions below, and the thought of the job ahead- some of your men are bound to throw up.
And it won't be any better on those launches either.
No. Not if we have to crawl along at this speed.
Major, we are not crawling.
Our speed's governed by the load in the bows and the launches' ability to keep station with us.
You mean they'll have to play follow the leader all the way across?
They're neither equipped with wireless nor radar.
They're depending on us for protection and accurate navigation.
And if we're intercepted, what then?
Major, let's get something straight at the outset.
You have your responsibilities, and I have mine, which happen to include the safety of those launches.
Well, Jamie, here we go again.
The way things were going, I thought we were making this trip in a dinghy.
How are they below?
Complaining.
Puking.
They'll get over the puking.
Everything all right?
For a vessel sailing to her own funeral,
I'd say she's bearing up mighty well.
Don't worry, sir.
We'll get you there all right.
Truce, Captain?
I am not at war with you, Major.
This ship is blacked out.
What kind of a sailor are you?
I'm a scared sailor, sir.
You'll be a lot more scared after you've been court-martialed.
I'll decide about that.
He could've blown this whole mission.
- Get back to your station.
- Yes, sir.
That man should be disciplined.
That man's a naval rating.
He's my responsibility.
Then assume it.
Radar to bridge.
Radar to bridge.
Contact, sir.
Contact, Red 3-0.
Hold it and keep reporting.
Red 3-0.
Aircraft closing fast.
- Course?
Action stations, gun crews close up.
Signal disperse to the launches.
Hold fire unless attacked.
Lookout, aircraft coming up fine on port bow. Identify.
- Course?
- 1-7-6, sir.
- Port ten.
- Port ten, sir.
- Steer, 0-9-0.
- 0-9-0, sir.
- You'll meet her head-on, sir.
- That's the idea.
Steady as she goes.
Aye-aye, sir.
Steady as she goes.
Can't you do a zigzag?
She's too heavy in the bow, sir.
Gun crews, hold fire until ordered.
All guns independent, open fire.
A life on the ocean waves.
Home on the rolling deep.
Anybody want my dinner, just hold out your canteen.
Cease fire. Cease fire.
All stations keep closed up.
Chief reports no damage, sir.
- Casualties?
- Every gun's crew, sir.
Their pride's been hurt.
He got away.
Tell them not to worry about their pride, and signal close up, keep station.
Aye-aye, sir.
Well done.
Normal naval procedure.
When are we getting back on course?
When I damn well say so.
As long as you realize we're losing time.
Losing time is better than losing a ship.
That plane has reported our position and course, and I don't want Jerry to know we're heading directly for Le Clairé.
Any more questions?
And Major... that cigarette incident had nothing to do with the attack.
The plane was 30 miles away at the time.
And that man wasn't a day over 16.
You sent for me, sir.
- What's your name?
- Pringle, sir.
Ordinary Seaman Thomas Pringle.
How old are you, Pringle?
Nineteen, sir.
Sixteen.
How long in the service?
Six months, sir.
And at sea?
Three weeks.
I'm sorry, sir, about the cigarette.
I don't know what come over me, if you know what I mean, sir.
I know.
I just didn't stop to think, sir.
Nor did I.
Between the two of us, I lost my head.
But maybe that's because
I didn't want you to lose yours.
Thank you, sir.
Pringle.
Sir?
I can't take a thing like that, sir.
Take it.
Just come in, Herr Oberst.
Hans, is this important?
Nothing is more important than the ladies.
"From K2C to Le Clairé BHQ.
Immediate.
"Coastal air patrol report enemy minesweeper and escort
"intercepted at Red 4-7-1, course due east.
Attacked.
Negative result. "
Minesweepers, huh?
What do you think, Erich?
Where is it now?
Red 4-7-1.
Contacts like that every day.
They sweep east up to Red 400, and then always turn back.
Routine.
Just routine.
Nothing from our surface patrols?
Nothing, Herr Oberst.
The harbor approaches are well covered.
If our ships get a sighting, you'll hear about it.
Keep me informed, Hans, will you?
The English are predictable, but they're not stupid.
Jerry must've been alerted by now.
It's strange we don't get another visit.
The RAF has some heavy bombing raids planned.
The Luftwaffe might well be too busy to worry about a minesweeper.
They know darn well we're not sweeping.
On the contrary.
We've had sweepers visit this area a number of times during the past few weeks.
Sowing minefields?
Yes. But that's not the point.
The idea was to let Jerry think that we were sweeping regularly, so that Mad Dog would look like a continuation of the routine.
It was a subterfuge that may well play off.
Who dreamed that one up?
Their Lordships readily agreed to the value of the idea.
Did you put it to them?
It was a suggestion.
...on the earnings of a lady friend I know
Don't want bullets in my basket...
Hark ye to the serenade of brutal and licentious soldiery.
How do we go, pilot?
Most excellently, sir.
Temperature 51, barometer 1-0, 1-0.3.
Wind veering northwest, but nothing to worry about.
Visibility good.
On time, on course, sir.
I don't want to be a soldier
I don't want to fight the foe
I would much prefer to roam or be kept right here at home
On the earnings of a lady friend I know...
A wee singsong's good for the nerves, they tell me.
True, Skipper, true.
I'm much happier, by far, with my mother and my pa
So I wouldn't be a soldier any day
Hey, Nobby!
If you get hit on the beach, don't bleed all over me, all right?
I'll remember, mate.
And don't sleep on duty!
All right! Once again!
I don't want to be a soldier
I don't want to fight the foe
I would much prefer to roam or be kept right here at home...
You know, if they sang a bit louder, maybe Jerry would clear off.
I know I would.
I'm surprised old Franklin hasn't sounded off about it.
I don't think he will.
Why? Has he gone deaf or something?
Ever since that plane attack, he's loosened his collar a bit.
Just the same,
I think I'll tell them to pipe down.
I don't want to fight the foe
I would much prefer to roam
Or be kept right here at home
On the earnings of a lady friend I know
All right, fellas!
All right, boys!
Knock it off!
All right, fellas.
All right, boys.
Pipe down, pipe down.
Fellas, fellas!
Pipe down.
You don't want Jerry to know what he's missing, do you?
Hello, there.
Hello, there.
This is your captain speaking.
We have now reached halfway.
From this point on, all commandos will remain below deck until ordered.
Ship's company will remain closed up.
I'm now handing over to Major Wilson.
At this moment, sealed orders are being opened aboard each of the craft astern of us.
For the past three months, you've been training to attack a target
without knowing its name or precise location.
Here it is. Le Clairé.
The German fleet's most vital and important installation on the French coast.
Our task, destruction.
Our method, blowing up the dock, supported by commando assault.
To that end, the bow of this vessel is packed with high explosives.
We are, in fact, riding a floating torpedo.
Our intention is to plow headfirst into the dry dock gates.
We ram, scuttle the ship, and run.
Run where?
I'm sure you'll be interested in knowing that we will not explode on contact.
Now, that's what I call considerate.
From the moment of impact, we will have five minutes- repeat, five minutes- to get ashore and get clear.
From then on, seek and destroy secondary targets.
The signal for retirement- red, white, red by Verry light.
You will embark on the small craft as designated,
and, God willing, will be returned to England.
Should you miss the boat, then proceed inland to points Freddie, Charlie, Baker, our French underground contacts.
Good hunting...
...and good luck.
And the best of Canadian luck to you, mate.
Now, don't forget, boys.
We're past the halfway mark- keep your voices down.
I went on a day trip to Le Clairé once.
Any good?
No. Horrible tea, horrible grub.
But the women!
They could hardly get me to go home.
You'll be glad to go home tomorrow, matey.
Bosun's Mate, break out the rum.
Double tot for each man.
God bless the Navy on a night like this.
The night signals, Herr Oberst.
You know something, my friend?
We Germans, we eat too much.
French food is fattening.
Remind me to put in a strong complaint.
There's been another attack on that radar station.
You can hardly call it an attack.
The saboteurs included a twelve-years-old boy.
Those French will never learn.
Of course, they are a nuisance.
Have you heard any more about that minesweeper?
Not a thing.
Minesweeping.
How those British waste their energy.
Is perfect weather for an air attack and not a sign of the RAF.
Twenty-four hours ago, you promised me RAF support.
Where it is?
Read this.
I think this explains it.
Yes, we've had heavy losses over Dusseldorf tonight.
Take it from me, they gave us hell last night as well.
The squadrons assigned to Mad Dog are not even respectable scrap.
What have you got in reserve?
Nothing we can spare without leaving ourselves wide open.
- I'm sorry, but-
- Sorry?
I'm sorry for one rather ancient minesweeper and four cockleshells just hours away from Le Clairé.
They happen to be without escort of any kind.
They're naked.
Without a divisionary raid from Bomber
Command, they'll be out there dead.
Why didn't you give them some support?
A couple of destroyers or even a cruiser.
Because we don't have-
That's what I mean.
Not far now, huh, Pringle?
Yes, sir.
Time to quit being scared, huh?
Have you been on one of these before, sir?
Yes.
This lighter, sir.
It's brand-new.
Who is Sue?
My wife.
She wouldn't go for you giving it to me, sir.
She'd understand.
You'd better hang on to it.
I've got something with me from my sweetheart.
Just received from DCO, sir.
- Well, what is it?
- It's an immediate, sir.
"Immediate NOC 7-2 B4.
Urgent.
"Air diversion not available.
"Cancel Mad Dog and return.
Acknowledge. "
No reply.
Sir?
I said no reply.
Aye-aye, sir.
- Pollard.
- Sir?
You didn't hear a word, did you?
Me, sir?
I've got cloth ears, sir.
Thank you, Pollard.
Captain.
- Here you are.
- Thank you, sir.
It's 10:25 now.
- Any acknowledgment from Mad Dog?
- No, sir.
- Send that off at once.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, what is it?
- Signal, sir.
Read it.
Read it.
"Emergency.
Await acknowledgment of 9-8-7-B-1.
"Cancel-repeat-cancel Mad Dog.
"Insist you comply with this instruction
"and return at once.
Acknowledge immediately. "
Who's that addressed to?
The captain, sir.
All right, Sparks.
Well, what do you make of that?
Laddie, it's none of my business...
...but I think this old lady might be getting a reprieve.
Why?
Mad Dog cancelled.
Why?
What reason did they give?
I don't understand, Franklin.
You've been fighting this operation from the very beginning.
Yet now they've called it off, you don't have a thing to say.
Standing on the bridge, Major...
...it's different than sitting behind a desk.
What's that supposed to mean?
You feel closer to death.
That makes you closer to life.
And the truth comes rushing in.
You didn't kill my son.
He was a casualty of war.
And it's a war we have to win.
A war we have to win.
Now, I have made the decision.
We are not turning back.
But you realize what it means.
With no RAF to keep Jerry busy elsewhere, of course.
Bombing the outskirts of that town
15 miles north of our target would've been a good diversionary tactic.
Exactly.
But is it essential?
If Le Clairé is ready for us, yes.
If not, if we surprise them, no.
Your guess is as good as mine.
For the record...
I am in command as long as we are afloat.
And I'm clearly disregarding an order.
You can object on the grounds that without RAF participation, your force is inadequate.
For the record, I'm deaf.
Thanks.
I didn't hear you.
- Any word from them?
- Not a word, sir.
And the RAF?
No change.
2300 hours coming up.
This been checked?
Double checked.
What happens if the ship's power supply is cut?
The firing circuit is entirely self-contained.
Once it's set, nothing can stop it.
Not even hitting the gates?
No. The shock of impact won't detonate the charge.
Only that clock can trigger the fuse.
That's how we can guarantee the time interval for you to get clear of the ship.
Well, we won't need much time.
Anyway, the longer the explosion is delayed, the greater will be Jerry's surprise.
With luck, by the time she goes up, this old lady will be crawling with inquisitive Germans.
You can pass the word.
In exactly 60 minutes from now, this ship explodes, whether we're aboard it or not.
Aye-aye, sir.
Time to start the minstrel show.
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir.
They've got the picture?
I trust they're clear on the function of the launches.
Once they've been deployed, we'll be on our own.
If they can reach the jetty without giving the game away and silence those batteries, we'll be in clover.
Once the men have disembarked, will the launches lay off, sir?
No, they'll stay alongside the jetty, ready and waiting to take us home.
I want you to stress this to your men.
If things get sticky, you'll be in a hurry.
But that doesn't mean panic.
Orderly embarkation.
Understand?
Yes, sir.
There's room for everybody.
Providing they keep to their groups and don't rush the first launch they see.
They understand that, sir.
Good. Then get them blacked up and standing by.
That beard helps, but you need a touch.
Thanks.
Come on, girls!
A little faster with your makeup.
We'll be on pretty soon.
We're not going to a party, you know.
Come on, behind the ears, all over.
Look nice for Daddy.
How do I look, me darlings?
You're not fit to be seen!
You'll scare 'em to death, Sarge!
Take your teeth out, Sarge.
He looks like my grandmother.
Battery D, sir.
Patrol sighted, unidentified.
What patrol?
- Inside the estuary?
- Inside, Herr Oberst.
What do you mean, unidentified?
German markings,
German camouflage, but they don't give the correct code signals.
"They"?
What do you mean by "they"?
The ship's in company with four launches.
Four launches?
What kind of launches?
- I don't know, Herr Oberst.
- Well, find out.
Light flashing off the starboard bow, sir.
Light flashing off the starboard bow, sir!
He's challenging, sir.
- In code?
- Yes, sir.
Make the repeat sign.
Request repeat!
He's called for an identification signal, sir.
Then give it to him.
Whitehall. 1-2-1-2.
- But that's-
- Enough to really confuse him.
- What was that code number?
- Whitehall 1-2-1-2.
Well, you won't find it in there.
Then it doesn't exist.
Of course it exists!
It's the telephone number of Scotland Yard.
Stand by to signal deploy.
Deploy.
Sound the general alarm.
Alert K Command.
Send C and D companies to cover the airfield.
Inform WB and Luftwaffe.
All batteries to engage the enemy.
I've released the launches, Major.
They're on their way.
If we knock out those heavy guns, we've got a chance.
The launches should be ashore by now.
There's a boat making for the dock.
Making for the docks?
Are you sure?
Where are the gates?
Open or shut?
Shut.
B Battery's under attack, sir.
B Battery under attack?
What are they, parachutists?
Don't know, sir.
Radar to bridge.
Radar to bridge.
1-4- 1.
1-4- 1.
Distance, five miles.
Aircraft.
Bridge to radar.
Bridge to radar.
Is there any IFF showing?
Radar to bridge.
IFF showing.
Aircraft friendly.
They're ours, sir.
Remind me to compliment Bomber Command.
Rather like the Navy, Major.
They get there in the end.
You give me that normal procedure bit again, and I'll...
There you are, Commander.
Some tea.
I don't understand it.
I've tried them five times already and no reply.
They should be here, or they're...
They could've ignored us and gone in anyway.
RAF reports sighting Mad Dog in estuary, approximately three miles from target.
Thanks for the good news.
Three miles.
She can't take much more of this.
She won't have to.
They're coming in under our guns, sir.
Targets below our maximum depression.
- And the number two position?
- Minus 15 degrees.
Clear the safety stops.
Move target right!
Pill box, dock corner.
Yes, you're hitting them!
Keep firing!
Stand by for ramming.
Stand by for ramming.
Starboard a little.
Meet her.
Steady as she goes.
Engine room, give her all she's got.
If you'll pardon the expression, sir, you're about to see the ship hit the fan.
She's all yours, Major.
All commandos on deck.
All commandos on deck.
Get moving.
The ship hit the dock.
Hit the dock?
Why? Why?!
- What damage can it do?
- Not much that can't be repaired-
- Are we concentrated there?
- Up to a point.
Are we or aren't we?
Companies C and D have moved to cover the airfield, sir.
Bring them back, and get that ship out of the dock!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on!
- Sir, you all right?
- Keep moving, sailor.
Keep moving!
Major.
I don't know.
But the wheelhouse got a direct hit.
Was he still inside?
I'm going back.
Stay with him.
Come on, move.
You British.
You are mad.
Still fighting storybook wars.
Do you really think that old tin can of yours can seriously damage 35 feet of concrete and steel?
It's pathetic, Captain.
Pathetic.
You haven't got an answer, have you?
There's your answer.
All right, check them.
Are you all right?
The Major said to keep an eye on you, sir.
Let's go.
All right, come on, move!
That's it, Graham.
That's it, sir.
- Fire the retire.
- Yes, sir.
It worked this time, Jamie.

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Sir, we request the Navy approve of an alliance with the Axis powers.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Army is out of patience.
We can wait no longer.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It is possible that the rightists are plotting a coup.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The best way to prevent more attacks is through an alliance with Germany.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I disagree.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Why? Are you worried about the reaction of the Americans and the British?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We must stop these attacks once and for all! We must act!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What do you think, sir?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="8.25" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Navy will not drag Japan into a war.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Then the Army will act alone.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Army can cross the ocean?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Sir, I will be leaving for Germany soon.</font>

- 400 hours!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Do not try anything like that again until you have 1000 hours!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Didn't you realize you were about to crash?
Did you have any idea? Answer me!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">No. </font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You nearly killed the squadron commander!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- The squadron commander?
- Go and apologize to him. Now!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yes, sir!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Lieutenant Kimura.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What is it?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I froze during a dive and put myself and you in danger, sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I have come to apologize. Sorry.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Don't worry. As long as we all work together, we can do anything.  Don't  apologize for being agressive.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Yes
- You're Kimura!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Sawada! </font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I didn't expect to find you here! Things going well?</font>

- Yes, sir.  We're classmates.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Really? Sit down.
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- You've got guts, kid.
- What has Kimura done this time?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">He nearly collided with me while flying.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Sorry.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I'm sure you will become a fine pilot.
Let's toast to your success.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I do not quite understand, sir,  What is the purpose for all this special training?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"> I have no idea.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Impossible! We can not afford to sacrifice all our carriers on such a risky mission.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Six carriers are essential for the attack.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral Yamamoto insists.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It's certainly a very risky attack. It could be a catastrophe for the Japanese Navy.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It just seems like sheer madness.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Why is Admiral Yamamoto in such a hurry to start this war?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Excuse me but that's not true.
- How?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Let me explain on behalf of the Admiral.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Our goal is to avoid war  with the United States at all costs. 
But there are several circumstances ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"> .... which seem to make it inevitable.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I doubt that the government can stop this, it's too late.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">If we enter this war, there is only one way that Japan  can emerge victorious:</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Destroy the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.
Unless we attack Pearl Harbor we will not be able to ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... win this war. The Admiral said that if the Army did not accept his plan, the Imperial Navy ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... can not take any responsibility for the outcome of the war.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Really?
Yamamoto said that?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">He did!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I give you my word of honor that I have come to convince you for the sake of us all.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Well ... all right.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- But sir!
- Stop! Yamamoto is a man of his word.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We can trust him.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yes.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Also ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What now?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"> The Admiral asks to assume command of the attack. If you give permission, ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... he will command the fleet from the Nagato.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I can not deny him that.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">He told me to say one last thing, sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You ask him to start a war ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... but his greatest desire is to not have to participate in any war.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I recognize that the situation now has become complicated in the worst imaginable way.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It is unfortunate that we face such a fate, but I no longer feel any guilt.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I am in a situation where I must act against my principles.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It's really odd.
This must be fate.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Pearl Harbor is only forty feet deep.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... which should ensure success.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Let's talk about the itinerary.
There are three possible routes to Pearl Harbor.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We decided to take the northern route which ensures minimal risk of contact with the enemy.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"> Any bad weather will hamper resupply though.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We have allowed for that possibility.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I recommend we sail guided by scouting aircraft.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I'm against that. Using scouting aircraft increases the chance of being detected.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I think so too.
Surprise is essential in this.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Now, I will listen to headquarters staff opinions.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Our enemies on the bases at Midway, Wake and 
Johnston Island are constantly patrolling.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Their submarines are undoubtably searching for us at this very moment.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I do not see how our fleet can travel 2,000 miles without being discovered ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... by enemy patrols.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The staff believe that this attack has very little chance of success.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Do you have an alternative?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We should not take on such a risky plan.
Instead, we should ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">That's enough.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But Admiral, in the event that we were defeated at the beginning of the war...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Japan is a small country with little industry.
 In a war against the United States, we will lose.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Still, if we must fight them, the only way to beat them will be  ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... to try to take advantage of a suprise attack.</font>

- Yes, sir.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I need you to work out the necessary strategy.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Aye, aye. I will not oppose this decision. I will do everything possible to carry out the plan, Admiral.</font>

- What?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Find a good husband for my sister.
- You fool!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- I'm serious.
- By the way, did you get my letter?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Which one?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I sent you a letter. Tomoko's parents have agreed that she marry.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">When did you write this?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Well ... in late December.
- At the time, I was at sea.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- I have to go, Sumie.
- But it's still early!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- I know.
-I'll walk with you.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Good idea. See you later.
- Come on.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Good evening.
- Take it easy.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Fleet won victory after victory. The
U.S., British and Dutch forces were ...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Japan got it's raw materials from the south.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">This is a good time to reach a peace agreement.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We could dictate our own terms and conditions.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">For example, we could agree to evacuate the occupied areas.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- That will not be easy.
- Would it be impossible?</font>

... a thirst for war.</font>

Lieutenant Kimura!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- What!
- Back from your visit home more boastful than ever!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- He has reason to brag.
- Let's see? Come on! She's very nice!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Let me see. Yes ... beautiful.
- Can I see?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Captain!
Teach them a lesson!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">All right, listen up.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I'll tell you what happened to me fifteen years ago aboard the
Akagi. The weather was really bad; poor visibility </font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">One aircraft landed halfway down the landing deck.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The plane was about to fall into the sea when an officer ran over and grabbed his wing.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">He saved the plane from imminent disaster.
Who do you think that was?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Don't know?  It was the captain of the Akagi, lsoroku Yamamoto.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- What? Our commander-in-chief?
- The same.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">That was great.
I'll tell another about the Admiral.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You? Tell us!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">About when the Admiral was Navy
Vice-minister. Let's see ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Are you going to be up all night telling this?
You better not even start.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Are you going to leave us in suspense?
- It's kind of a secret  ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Much ado about nothing.
- Never mind. It's better that no one knows.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Why? Did you have an affair with him?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">600 miles behind the carriers, Admiral
Yamamoto leds the rest of the fleet eastward.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">June 5, 1942. The first wave of 108 aircraft took off towards the island of Midway.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Midway Island in sight!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I imagined it bigger.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Such a small target.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="8.25" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We didn't need all these planes!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Enemy fighters!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Attack!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Dive!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Now!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"> Completed attack. Almost no effect. Necessary second attack. Send immediately.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The second wave we reserved if needed to attack enemy carriers.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We can not send the entire second wave.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">When will the first wave return?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Our scouts have been gone for two hours.
Why haven't they reported in?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Our most important priority is Midway.
If we do not destroy their bases ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... we leave ourselves open to a counter-attack.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We're here.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Are we ready?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yes, commander. Everyone is prepared and awaiting the arrival of the enemy.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What the hell are our scout planes doing?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Enemy ships!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Scout number 4 reporting ten enemy ships, repeat ten enemy ships 240 miles and 10 degrees north of Midway.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What kind of ships?
Find out if there are any aircraft carriers!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yes, sir! Report ship types.
Are there any aircraft carriers?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">No aircraft carriers.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Five cruisers, five destroyers, no aircraft carriers.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">No aircraft carrier.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Still no sign of enemy aircraft?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">No enemy in sight, Captain.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Sir, ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... a few days ago, their carriers were seen in the Coral Sea.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- There can be no ememy carriers near us.
- We should attack Midway again.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, a second attack?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Change course towards Midway. Start replacing torpedoes with bombs on the second wave!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Replace the torpedoes with bombs!
Replace the torpedoes with bombs!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I hope for all our sakes that enemy carriers are all far away.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Ready? Go!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Ready? Yeah!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Ready? Now!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Bring it in!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Come on! Hurry!
Go ahead.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What is that?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Scout 4 reports detecting two enemy aircraft carriers!
Two enemy carriers!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Captain, this is a disaster!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yes ... We should attack the enemy ships immediately.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But we're still replacing torpedoes with bombs to attack Midway.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I know that!
And we need fighters to escort our attack on the enemy carriers!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Just send our bombers.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Urgent message from the Hiryu:</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Enemy ships have been sighted!  We will attack them!
Replace bombs with torpedoes!
Go!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Have you finished reinstalling the torpedoes?

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- If the Americans attack now, we are helpless.
- Tell them to finish as quickly as possible.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Five minutes.

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Take off when ready.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Take off as they become ready.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Captain!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="8.25" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Read it.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Attacked by enemy aircraft.
Akagi, Kaga and Soryu destroyed.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Message from Admiral Yamaguchi: 
Hiryu undamaged.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Hiryu ready to launch attack.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Send a message to the Hiryu.
Wish them a good fight.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We'll join up with the planes taking from off the Hiryu.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Captain, we're low on fuel.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Low? How much longer can we fly?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We've been flying 30 minutes.
We have fuel for 300 miles more.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Not enough.  We won't make it back.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- So what?
- Our ship has been sunk anyway.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">All right, we will continue.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">U.S. Navy aircraft carrier "Yorktown"</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Now!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The attack sank the Yorktown. 
But the Americans struck back and sank the Hiryu.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">All four Japanese carriers that participated at the Battle of Midway were lost.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yamamoto, willing to gamble everything in a night battle,</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">proceeded aboard the Yamato toward the American fleet.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Where is the enemy?
- 400 miles away.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Still that far?
- Looks like they are trying to elude us.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, I do not think there will be a battle tonight.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Captain, why not attack Midway instead?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We could bombard the bases.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We should join up with the other ships for a joint attack.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- But ...
- Why not?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It makes no sense that we continue playing a game we've already lost.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We must retreat.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, how will we apologize to the Emperor?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Leave that to me.
I must go and apologize to His Majesty.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We lost four carriers. But this does not mean we cannot build others.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We are back at square one.
Wars are like this.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Make a list of all casulties from this operation.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yamamoto had again lost hope for a quick victory.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What was left of the Japanese fleet retired to the west. Then, three days later ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- I just saw the Bonin Islands.
- Yes, we're not far from Japan.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We received a message from General Headquarters.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">They decided to inform His Majesty.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">And so it goes ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I do not want anyone to blame Admiral Nagumo.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Tell everyone that I am responsible for everything.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, my poor management of this operation has had very serious consequences. I'm sorry ... I'm sorry.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We are deeply ashamed.
Admiral, we beg you for another chance.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You will.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You have my trust.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The defeat at Midway was a blow to the Japanese Navy.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But the people were never told about it.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">IWAKUNI AIR BASE</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I'm Lieutenant Kimura.
I'll be taking you to the Saeki air base.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">From there, you'll be assigned to aircraft carriers or land air bases.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But first, the Commander-in-Chief will inspect our ranks.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Hold your heads high as the
Commander-in-Chief passes by!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Pilot.
- Yes!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- How many hours have you flown?
- 220, Sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- And you?
- 230 hours, Sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- And you?
- 200 hours, Sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">They have very few flight hours. They really need about six months of practical flying.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But we badly need carrier pilots.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We had pilots at Midway with over
1,000 hours of flight.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- How many hours have you had?
- 210 hours, Sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Flying time?
- 230, Sir!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- No need to raise your voice.
- Understood.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- You can shout if you want. How old are you?
- Eighteen!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">These men remind me of a young officer who came to visit me ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... at the Navy Ministry when
I was Deputy Minister.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, do you mean me?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yes, I do.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Do what you can to guide these young people.
I trust you.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">A few months after the Battle of Midway, the U.S. Navy headed west ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... to build a base on the island of Espiritu Santo.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral Yamamoto deduced this would happen and reinforced the island of Rabaul.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">So began the battle of Guadalcanal.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">BATTLE OF THE EASTERN SOLOMONS

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... and forced it to retire after having inflicted grave damage.  The results as of today are:</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">One American aircraft carrier sunk, another aircraft carrier and a battleship damaged.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But Japanese troops on Guadalcanal were surprised by several waves of ...</font>

Everyone take cover!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">TRUK ISLAND</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You two will travel to Rabaul and participate in the meeting called by the Army.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Army is very stubborn.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Well, try not to argue with them.
Clear?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">-I think he's talking to you.
- I thought it was you?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Try to reach an agreement with them.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Army and Navy should act in unison.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What means of transportation did you use to get here?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Destroyers ... moving at night to avoid being spotted.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">How many men can fit in a destroyer?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">ARMY HEADQUARTERS - RABAUL.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">A maximum of 170 men - fully equipped.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We must send
15,000 men to Guadalcanal.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I want to organize a large convoy to strike in one night.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You have warships at anchor now, correct?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Tsuji, that is a matter for the Navy, not the Army.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You should not get into subjects you are not experienced in.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Reinforcing Guadalcanal is our top priority.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">That is why Headquarters sent you
 to negotiate with us.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We know. Admiral Yamamoto is concerned about the same thing</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I hope the Army understands.
Destroyers are very valuable to us ...

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">-  Ever since the defeat at Midway ...
- That's the Navy's problem.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">How can you ...?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Tsuji, back to the question that concerns us all.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral Yamamoto said that the Army and Navy should be in agreement ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... and act in unison. We are willing to do everything possible to help.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Have Admiral Yamamoto accept my sincere thanks for those words.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">From now on, we will act together to address this complicated situation. This is my decision.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Japanese destroyers, loaded with provisions and ammunition, ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... departed for Guadalcanal ...
 ... timed to arrive at night.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Will this be enough?
- I don't think there is food for everyone.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I'm sick of being a mule, bringing food up and down ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Attention!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"> Our comrades on Guadalcanal are waiting for these supplies!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Can you imagine how they feel?
Can you understand that?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Every grain of rice, every drop of  water means new hope for them ... Understood?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Into the water!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Release provisions!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Enemy aircraft!
Man the anti-aircraft guns!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Attacked by enemy aircraft ...
Destoyer Murakumo damaged, Natsugumo sunk.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, we can not afford afford to keep losing ships like this.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Commander Watanabe!
The Admiral looks very tired.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Is something wrong?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Admiral carries the weight of Japan on his back.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What is it?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Tell me.
- I was remembering my father, Admiral.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Really? That much like me?
- More or less his age.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- And how is he?
- By comparison, he looks much older.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">He must rely on you a lot.
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral ... I beg you to rest.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Petty Officer Omi.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">From now on I always want to take the second uniform.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What do you mean?
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I mean ... the white uniform</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Very well. I'll get it now.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Staff Officer Tsuji.
I have come to report on the Guadalcanl situation.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, I would like to apologize for what I said that time in the Ministry.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">No matter ... a long time ago.
Tell me, how are things at Guadalcanal?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The enemy has received reinforcements much more quickly than we have.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Despite the help of the Navy, we have been
 unable to get enough supplies to our troops.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">They're starving. We still must save
Guadalcanal no matter the costs.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We have an entire division prepared in Rabaul but
General Hyakutake does not want to cause you more trouble ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... and so he plans to go to Guadalcanal by troop-ship.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">That's nonsense.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I remember you opposed this war from the beginning.
You cannot imagine how much ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... I regret not having listened.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">That's ancient history .
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">If necessary, I will take this battleship, the Yamato, to Guadalcanal.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">So try to convince General Hyakutake not to take a troop-ship.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I want to do it properly ... aboard Japanese warships.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I will. Thank you.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">No need to thank me.
Why don't you stay for dinner?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Thank you for coming.
I know Ugaki is against it but ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Admiral wants to take the Yamato to Guadalcanal.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Kurita, I wish I were you.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Me?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We have to destroy the enemy airfield on Guadalcanal.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Take the Kongo and Haruna and bombard it.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral. I'm afraid it will be very difficult to get there.  The Americans have radar.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Last time, we were detected and turned back without completing the mission</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- This time, there can be no turning back.
- I know.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I will go.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Are you sure?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I will give the crews rifles. If the bombardment fails then we land in boats ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... and have the men attack the airfield from the ground.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I wish you luck .
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">BATTLESHIPS KONGO AND HARUNA</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Battleships departing!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Why is the Admiral wearing his white uniform?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Perhaps as encouragement.
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- That's possible.
- The color white is very striking.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I don't know why but this worries me a little.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">For the next 100 days, I will behave in a most dignified manner.
At the end of the day, I can not tell my men ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... that I was unprepared for death.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, Battleship Division 3 just reached their destination.
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">They report  "We have started the bombardment."</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">October 14, 1942:  Battleships Haruna and
Kongo shell Guadalcanal.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">More than 900 14-inch shells are fired against Henderson Field causing ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... severe damage to the enemy airfield.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral Nimitz moved his fleet northward to meet the Japanese ships.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Japanese sent the three carriers Shokaku, Zuikaku, Zuiho for ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... the decisive battle in the South Pacific.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">OCTOBER 26, 1942
BATTLE OF THE SANTA CRUZ ISLANDS</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Enemy aircraft detected!
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">General Quarters!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The decisive hour has come.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We attack!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Now!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- One aircraft carrier sunk and another warship damaged.
- Well ... very good news.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Hopefully nothing but good news.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- I do not think that's possible.
- We have lost many planes.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- It will soon be dark.
- Why don't we go after them?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">That's what Headquarters decided.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Mikami, don't give up !</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Mikami, hold on!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The battle was over.
The Japanese fought well and won ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... but the men on Guadalcanal had run out of supplies.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... out of ammunition ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... and out of food.  They survived by ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... eating fruits and lizards ... whatever they found in the jungle.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Imperial Army Headquarters considered the situation critical and organized more reinforcements.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">General Imamura was appointed commander.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Imamura visited Admiral Yamamoto aboard the Yamato, which was anchored in Truk.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yamamoto received him personally.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- I'm the last one to get into the war.
- Thanks for coming. This way...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The enemy outnumbers us in men and resources.  The
Guadalcanal situation is desperate.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Winning this battle is critical.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yes. In fact, before leaving Tokyo
I got an audience with the Emperor.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">His Majesty expressed his great concern for the men on Guadalcanal and begged me ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... to support them at any price. 
There were tears in his eyes.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I'm so sorry.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I am prepared to give my life for this mission.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I know. But I beg you to be realistic.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It is very important that we do not rush things.
I'll do what I can to help.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Agreed.
Thank you very much.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">At that time, of the 36,000 Japanese who had landed at Guadalcanal, 24,000 had died.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Survivors suffered terrible hunger, stifling heat and all kinds of diseases.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Death was imminent.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">General, we must make a decision!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">This is our last chance to organize an attack.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It's been a week since we received any supplies.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Our men are forced to drink sea water or die of dehydration.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I know. But, as things stand, we have no chance of success.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">General, I beg you!
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Contact Rabaul and ask for instructions.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">HEADQUARTERS
EIGHTH ARMY IN RABAUL.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Message from Guadalcanal.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">That's all.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">What is it?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The submarine with supplies did not reach
Guadalcanal. It was sunk by the enemy.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Damn!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">It's impossible to get supplies to the men on Guadalcanal!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">They need reinforcements. We must immediately send the 20th Division.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"> No. I will not allow that.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We will just end up losing more men at sea.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But if we do nothing, the men on
Guadalcanal will all die soon.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">All 12,000 men ... will die.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Commander Watanabe from the Imperial Fleet just arrived.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I'd like to speak to General Imamura on behalf of the Admiral.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Tell me.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral Yamamoto is very concerned about the situation on Guadalcanal ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... and would like to know the General's intentions.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Regarding what?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Well ... He wanted to know if the general would be willing to consider an evacuation.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I have come to ask 
Imamura that directly.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">No, you can't.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Why not?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The general isn't ready ... to face that.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But ... it is necessary.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">If you phrase it like that, it only worries him more. 
Impossible.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You'll have to understand. Unfortunately, I can not do anything for you, Commander.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Do not insist on this.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Very well ... but what about the Admiral?
What do I tell him?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I couldn't get in to see General Imamura.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Imamura and I have different points of view. So, I alone must decide.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The Navy will conduct an evacuation.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Proceed with Operation 'K' - total evacuation.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We will rescue everyone at Guadalcanal ... not leaving a single man behind.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Hey! Is there anyone still here?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The boats are leaving!
Is there anyone here?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Come on, let's go!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I can't move. Go on without me.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Come on!  I'll carry you !</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">February 7, 1943:  13,050 survivors of
Guadalcanal were evacuated in the darkness.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral Yamamoto moved his forward base, along with all it's aircraft, to Rabaul.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">He came with the intention of recovering air superiority in the Solomons Islands.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Lieutenant Kimura reporting with 130 men!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I wish you good hunting.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">April 7, 1943:
227 planes attack Guadalcanal.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">April 11, 1943:
94 planes attack New Guinea.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">April 12, 1943: 162 aircraft attack the air base in Port Moresby.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Today, we can now consider our mission as completed.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Send the aircraft back to re-group.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">But sir, the air battle in the
Solomons is intensifying.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We can not afford to send the crews home now.  Admiral, give them more time.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Japan has lost all chance of a quick victory. This will be a long war.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We must now reorganize our forces.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">By the way, commander ... 
I will be going to the front for inspections.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Where, sir?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Bougainville ... Ballale...
That's where.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You should be aware that there are daily air raids in those areas.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Yes, I know.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Then I will send escorting fighters while you are at the front.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">No, that will not be necessary.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">All I want is to visit the men on the front ... to give them encouragement.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">When I think back over this past year, 
I realize that I can not count how many ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... friends I have lost.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Lieutenant Kimura reporting.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">So, it's you. ... What is it?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We will not leave you here and go back to our homes. We want to stay with you.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Idiot! ... This war is not being waged by me alone!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You must have a broader view.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">During these very difficult times ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... you have done an outstanding job.
But I ask each of you to strive even harder from afar.
I wish you luck.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">We will now board these aircraft to fly back to Japan!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, are you sure?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">When does my plane take off ?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Tomorrow -  0600 - we take off from Rabaul aboard a bomber.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... scheduled landing Ballale at 0745.
... I advise you to rest until then.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I want to go visit the hospital now.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Where are you hurt ?
- Chest.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Does it hurt much?
- No, sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- What do you have?
- Malaria, sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Doctor!
- Yes, sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Is there enough medicine?
- Yes, sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Are you cold?
- No, sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Get well soon.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif"> I apologize on behalf of my father.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Sorry ... my father made you fall into the water.
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">So you're the son of the boatman!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I remember it like it was yesterday ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... yet so long ago.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Where does it hurt ?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Head injury.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Where were you?
- On the destroyer Naganami.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Squeeze my hand.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">With all your strength.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">You're strong already.
Soon you'll be fine.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Your father is well?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Tell him hello for me.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I found this in the Admiral's cabin.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">For the next hundred days, ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">... I must prepare myself for death.
I can not tell the men ...
</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I understand now why the Admiral has been wearing his white uniform.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">'Take a few days preparing for death...'
Commander, let me go to Rabaul.  Please!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I have to see the Admiral!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Petty Officer Omi, sir!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- Is something wrong?
- Admiral, I brought your other uniform.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Change, please.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing, but on the front, the white color attracts attention.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I beg you.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">All right ... if you insist, I'll change.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, I'll be waiting for you back on the Yamato.
Good luck.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I'm Lieutenant Yonichi.
Tomorrow, I will be escorting you to the front, sir.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- We've met before?
- On the field at Iwakuni!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">I remember. You're the pilot who was shouting so much.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">- How many flying hours do you have now?
- 630 hours.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">A considerable amount. Have you learned a lot?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">How about your classmates?</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Only seven of his twenty classmates are alive, sir. The others died in combat.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Tomorrow, I want you to show me what you've learned.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The next day, Yamamoto and his men took two bombers to Ballale Island escorted by six fighters. </font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Japanese troops eagerly awaited his arrival.
But they were not the only ones waiting for the Admiral ...</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">There were others.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Japanese messages had been intercepted and decoded.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral ... landing in Ballale in ten minutes.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">The fighters escorting the Admiral had almost empty fuel tanks.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Then they were surprised by enemy aircraft.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Damn!</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Admiral, we'll land at the base of Buin.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">April 18, 1943:  Admiral Yamamoto was killed while flying over Bougainville.</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="9" face="Microsoft Sans Serif">Isoroku Yamamoto, 16 months after the attack on Pearl
Harbor and after leading a war that he opposed from the beginning, died on the front line.</font>
Detachment, halt!
Left, face!
Parade rest!
I am detachment commander...
...responsible for training and employment of this detachment.
These compact, highly-trained detachments may be employed...
...to assist friendly governments in counterinsurgency operations.
They may also be utilized in unconventional warfare.
In training, survival under varying conditions is stressed.
I speak Norwegian and German.
I am Executive Officer.
My duties include the supervision...
...of all administrative and logistical matters.
In the event the detachment were to be split into 2 teams...
...I would command one of these.
I speak German and Spanish.
That about covers the central area, Colonel.
As you know, the C detachment commander in that area is Colonel Franks.
In the southern area there has been approximately...
...a 30°/° increase in our operational detachments over the past year.
Sir, since you served as a C detachment commander...
...I won't elaborate on the southern corps.
Thank you.
In summation...
...the bulk of our problems seem to be in the northern areas of the country.
This concludes our briefing.
Any questions?
I think not, Colonel. Thank you, gentlemen, that will be all.
You stay behind.
Captain.
Leave the Jeep.
- All right, Mike, what's on your mind?
- What do you mean?
Something's bothering you.
What?
When do you expect me to take over, sir?
Lmmediately. Why?
When I get over there, they're going to snow me under with paperwork.
And I'd like to get oriented to the critical area.
- I want to look at those forward camps.
- How much time do you need?
- I'll need 3 weeks.
- You got it.
And when you see old Cactus Thomas, who's over there now, give my regards.
Thank you, sir.
Hello, Bill.
Morning, Mike.
Up early?
Not for Airborne.
This yours?
Yes, sir.
- These yours?
- Why don't you ask them?
- Who are you?
- Airborne!
- How far?
- All the way!
- I'll get part of them.
- You always do!
I am combat engineer specialist, with the same basic knowledge...
...as the engineer sergeant.
I'm cross-trained as medic and weapons.
I speak French and Vietnamese.
I'm radio operator supervisor.
My duties: Maintaining a communications link with my next higher detachment...
...and supervising communications training for native military personnel.
I'm trained in intelligence and weapons.
I speak Danish and some
Norwegian and English.
Detachment, attention!
Muldoon, take over!
I'm Master Sergeant Muldoon and this is Sergeant McGee.
Between us, we've had 3 tours of duty in South Vietnam...
...which makes us experts, so we've been ordered...
...to volunteer to answer questions here for you today.
I'm Hume Parkinson.
I happen to be a newspaperman.
Perhaps you can answer a question many of our subscribers ask.
We'll try.
Why is the United States waging this ruthless war?
Foreign policy decisions are not made by the military.
A soldier goes where he is told and fights whomever he's told to.
You agree with that, Sergeant McGee?
The Green Beret's just a robot with no personal feelings?
Can I have your name?
- George Beckworth, Chronicle-Herald.
- Thank you, sir.
Sybil Sutton, Washington Sentinel.
Will you please answer that question?
Do they press a button?
Do you do what you're told to do without any personal feelings or opinions?
We have feelings and opinions.
It's hard not to form them out there.
Everyone knows the South Vietnamese are fighting and dying for their cause.
As soldiers, we can understand the killing of the military...
...but the extermination of the civilians...
...the murder and torture of women and children...
I guess horrible things happen in war.
But that doesn't mean to say they need us or want us.
I'll try to answer that question for you.
Let me put it in terms we all can understand.
If this same thing happened here in the United States...
...every mayor in every city would be murdered.
Every teacher that you've ever known would be tortured and killed.
Every professor you ever heard of...
...every governor, every Senator...
...every member of the House of
Representatives...
...all would be tortured and killed, and a like number kidnapped.
But in spite of this, there's always some little fellow out there...
...willing to stand up and take the place of those who've been decimated.
They need us, Miss Sutton.
And they want us.
Sergeant, I'm Gladys Cooper, a housewife.
It's strange we've never read of this in the newspapers.
Newspapers! You could fill volumes with what you don't read in them.
That's sometimes very true.
But how do you know we should fight for this government?
They've had no free elections.
They have no constitution.
6 months ago a committee was appointed to form a constitution. Still none.
The school I went to taught us that the 13 Colonies...
...with proper, educated leadership, all with the same goal in mind...
...after the Revolutionary War, took from 1776 to 1787...
...11 years of peaceful effort...
...before they came up with a paper that all 13 colonies would sign.
Our present Constitution.
That's very good, Sergeant.
But there are lots of people... that believe this is a war between the Vietnamese people.
Let's let them handle it.
Let them handle it, Mr. Beckworth?
Captured weaponry.
From Red China.
Chisom K Fifty.
Chinese Communists.
S. K. S., Soviet-made carbine.
Russian Communists.
Ammunition.
Czechoslovakian-made.
Czech Communists.
No, sir, Mr. Beckworth...
...it doesn't take a weight to fall on me or a hit from those weapons...
...to recognize that what's involved is Communist domination of the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, pardon us...
...for giving a little more than a
"yes" or "no" answer to your questions.
Are there any more?
Section "C," take the blue trail...
...and sections "A" and "B" the red trail...
...for further orientation...
...on the capabilities of the Green Beret.
Kowalski, break out the gear.
Okay, Sarge.
- Colonel.
- Yes?
Your brainwashed sergeant didn't sell me.
Didn't sell you what?
Didn't sell me on the idea that we should be involved in Southeast Asia.
You ever been to Southeast Asia?
No, I haven't.
Sergeant Provo requests to speak to you.
Provo?
Heavy weapons specialist.
I'll see him.
Sir, Sergeant Provo requests permission to speak to the Colonel.
At ease.
I appreciate your seeing me, sir.
I know how busy you are.
I understand you're picking 2 "A" teams for Vietnam. Is that true, sir?
We might be, and we might not.
I think it might be, sir. Since I haven't been picked, I'm volunteering.
You're a heavy weapons specialist.
Not if I can find a light one, sir.
Why are you volunteering, Sergeant?
I'm a soldier.
That's where the action is.
We'll let you know.
Thank you, sir.
Sergeant McGee.
Pull his record.
I did.
He's a good man.
- Thanks, Doc.
- Yes, sir.
There he is.
Right on time.
Quite a character.
A tour in Korea...
...a year in Vietnam...
...speaks 3 languages, but are you sure about this soldier?
What do you mean?
I checked his jump record. Every time, the jumpmaster has to push him out.
That's why I want him.
He won't quit.
Hold it, soldier.
Nice day.
Yes, sir.
Out of your territory, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
What are you doing here?
Watching a basketball game, sir.
And what were you doing here yesterday?
And the day before?
And the day before that?
You spend so much time here you'd think you wanted to join our outfit.
No, I don't think I'd care to join the Fifth Group, sir.
I'm sorry to hear that, soldier.
Muldoon.
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on.
- Mike, what's that?
- That's the guy I was telling you about.
Pull!
Hello, soldier.
- So you decided to volunteer.
- My pleasure, sir.
Good!
Pull!
Nice shooting, sir.
That's normal.
Why did your outfit always send you when they needed something?
I guess I'm good at it, sir.
But not good enough.
You got caught.
Yes, sir, your men did catch me.
1 time out of 100.
You better hope that your luck holds out...
...because your first assignment is to go back to your outfit and bring back...
...everything you took.
- You understand me, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
See to it.
Carry on.
Sergeant?!
That's what the man said.
Sergeant.
Sergeant!
Everybody hit the deck!
Up and at 'em!
Rise and shine!
Up and at 'em!
Let's go!
Get the lead out!
On your feet!
Let's go!
Come on, soldier, out of the sack!
Everybody up!
It's 3:30, let's go!
On your feet, soldier, on your feet.
Holy Toledo!
It's only 3:30.
3:30? Is that right, Sarge?
That's right, soldier boy.
You'd better get some sleep.
We got a lot of work to do tomorrow.
On your feet, soldier, on your feet.
What kind of a...
You got 10 minutes to pack.
Pack in 10 minutes? Takes me longer than that to get my heart started.
- What are you doing?
- I'm packing!
You pack what Uncle Sam issued and that's all. You got 9 minutes.
- Why the countdown?
- You got 8.
Where are we going?
You'll get the word.
On the way out, everybody grab his gear.
Welcome to Da Nang.
Hi, Mike.
- Good to see you, Frank.
- Me, too.
- Captain MacDanial.
- How are you?
- I got the jeep right over here.
- Fine.
Captain, will you see the men get all their gear?
Here we go. Hop in.
- I've been on that plane for hours.
- You'd rather walk?
- I sure would!
- Good, let's stretch our legs then.
Reynolds, meet us at Colonel Cai's office and watch that weapon.
Yes, sir.
I'm sure glad it's you relieving me.
- Don't hurry me. I got three weeks.
- I know. That was a great idea.
- How's your back?
- It's coming along slow but sure.
Be glad when I can move around and burn off some of this.
This truck for us?
That's service.
Okay, grab your gear.
Arthur E. Fuller.
I knew that guy.
Named a field after him.
He won the Distinguished Service Cross.
Posthumously.
Better grab your gear.
I suppose you'll take the long way back home.
Go through Hong Kong, pick up a little yardage and some screens.
No, I don't think so.
My wife said not to bring anything she couldn't either cook or play with.
- What's my opposite number like?
- His name's Colonel Cai.
He's a good man, resourceful, intelligent and has a lot of initiative.
- Outstanding?
- Outstanding!
- Chung See Bado! Good to see you.
- Thank you, sir.
Glad you're in the outfit.
Smart looking honor guard.
I recognize most of them.
Even those you don't recognize know of you.
- How come?
- They got the word.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Colonel Cai, Colonel Kirby.
- I'm happy to make your acquaintance.
- Thank you.
Sit down.
I have heard much about you from Colonel Morgan and others.
If half of what I have heard is true,
I'm positive we'll work well together.
We build many camps, clobber many V. C. Affirmative?
Affirmative.
I like the way you talk.
Let me get to the point.
We have two new camps.
Here and here.
This one is all right.
Everything is STRAC...
...a full complement of
Montagnards and Special Forces.
The other one?
Camp A-107...
...code name two-niner Savoy.
This camp we build in the heart of V. C. Country.
One day is nothing.
Next day we are there.
Big surprise for V. C.
Unfortunately, "A" camp 107's only about half-finished.
The Viet Cong hit it with mortar fire
3 or 4 times a week.
The villagers tell us that the V. C. Are making a big buildup across the border.
We're hoping that weather does not keep us from having air support.
Without it,
Charlie can overrun camp.
The "A" team's tour of duty will be up in 10 days.
That puts that camp between the rock and the hard place until it's completed.
I brought 2 "A" detachments with me. I could...
...leave one here to form a Mike Force...
...and take the other up for replacements.
I think it's a good idea.
I have to pay my respects to the General at 1500.
- Nice to have met you.
- Likewise.
See you later, Colonel.
- Sorry, I didn't see you come out.
- That's all right.
- Everyone looks at pretty girls.
- I wasn't looking at them.
I was thinking about that sign there.
"In Honor of William J. Wallace."
I noticed the buildings and streets around here...
...got the names of heroes on them.
Dead heroes.
It kind of sets a man to thinking.
That it does.
And I also think we'd better get moving.
You all right?
I'm still thinking about those name plates, sir.
The ones about soldiers killed in action.
My worry is that my name don't fit any of our buildings or streets.
You got a real worry there.
Must be tough...
...having a problem like that.
"Provo's Barracks," "Provo's
Commissary." You see what I mean?
- No.
- It just don't sing.
If you think of something that does sing, you let us know.
We'd want you to have the best.
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate that.
Remember me?
- George...
- Beckworth.
This is Colonel Morgan.
I took your suggestion.
I came to see for myself.
Good for you.
They said at Group I could go, but it'd be up to you.
- What do you think, Colonel?
- Pretty hairy operation.
I don't think this area's ready for writers. Hate to get one greased.
- Is that the real reason?
- Come again?
My paper believes we shouldn't be in Vietnam.
Afraid I'll see something to substantiate that belief?
Be my guest.
Good luck, Mike.
With joyous memories, we leave the mystical city of Da Nang!
What gay adventure lies ahead!
Brother...
...this trip is going to make
LSD feel like aspirin.
Mr. Beckworth...
...you going to write about us?
- That's right.
- What are you going to say?
I don't know yet.
Man, oh, man!
Look at all those trees down there.
My dog could go crazy!
We have "A" teams out along the Cambodian and Laotian borders.
They each built their own camp.
We're headed for one of those now...
...Camp "A-107."
There's our destination.
Good to see you again.
You know Lieutenant Sachs.
- Captain MacDanial, your replacement.
- That's good to hear.
Sergeant Kenny, pick up the extra gear and the mail.
If you gentleman will follow me, we'll get inside.
You got about a 150 foot killing area here, Captain.
The first thing I'd do...
...is cut that back another 300 feet.
We've wanted to do that, but we've been short of help.
We tried to get some engineers. They're all busy. I requested some Seabees.
If that detachment ever gets here, you put them on that first thing.
Mail call!
Dodge City?
You can buy it cheap.
Those what they call pungi sticks?
Yes, it's a little trick we learned from Charlie.
But we don't dip them in the same stuff he does.
Could increase the effectiveness of that concertina with more tanglefoot.
- FRONT TOWARD ENEMY
- The claymores are great.
Got any more of them?
- Double the number on the perimeter.
- We'll get right on it.
Brings us up to date.
They mortared us again last night.
It's becoming a fairly regular thing.
- How many operations do you have out?
- 3 recon and 2 ambush.
- And that counterpart of yours...
- Captain Nim. He's out with a patrol.
The one that just got zapped.
He'll be in tomorrow with 3 wounded.
- Will you be staying with us awhile?
- I'll be in camp, off and on.
We fixed a place for you in the commo bunker. Not much, but it's dry.
Good.
After mail call,
I've assigned my men...
...to get Captain MacDanial's team bedded down.
He's a newspaper man.
This is Captain Coleman. Mr. Beckworth is with the Chronicle-Herald.
- Can you find a spot for him?
- Affirmative.
Take Mr. Beckworth here to my hooch, get him squared away.
This way, Mr. Beckworth.
Can I give you a hand?
If it's all right, the lieutenant and I will stay with the team.
This way, sir.
The captain has the bottom bunk. We'll get somebody to make this one for you.
- Is there drinking water?
- Yes. I don't know if it's cold.
It'll be fine, thank you.
You've got a pad in the storage bunker.
You can have mine in a few days.
I hope.
To the right here.
You funny!
I see you've made
Hamchunk's "A" Club.
You funny!
You not.
This is Hamchunk.
He's become a permanent fixture around here. He's an orphan.
Lived most of his life with missionaries
10 clicks south of here...
...until they were assassinated.
Maybe you could use an interpreter.
- Missionaries taught him English.
- I don't want an interpreter.
You number one.
I choose you.
I don't want to be chosen.
- I don't think you have much choice.
- Choice, Mr. Hobson?
I haven't had a choice since I was selected for this...
...outfit.
You get used to me.
You funny.
In here.
What's the status of your crew-served weapons?
We have two 81's, four 60's...
...twelve 30 calibers, three on each wall.
One 4-deuce. Besides crew-served, we have six M-79's.
No 50 calibers?
I'd give an R and R in Bangkok for the smell of a 50.
- You hear that, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- Know where there are any 50's?
- No, sir.
Neither do I.
You better tell Sergeant Petersen.
I almost forgot, sir. Captain
MacDanial needs more corrugated tin.
It's been hard to come by lately.
Yes, sir. I know, tell Petersen!
Tell the scrounger.
What happens if Charlie hits this camp before you get it completed?
If he does, and he's too strong for us to handle...
...we have 3 LZ's within 4 clicks to send 10 choppers each to reinforce us.
One is by that shale cliff you saw on your way in.
And the second is to the west of here...
...near a deserted Montagnard village where some of these people used to live.
The third is to the north near an old bridge.
What if Charlie overruns the camp?
In that case, sir...
...the camp is prepared to escape and evade on order...
...through places in the wire and mines...
...only "A" Team and Captain Nim know about.
- My compliments.
- Thank you, sir.
Commander of this area runs everything by the book!
And I am with him to the nth degree!
And every piece of this equipment will be painted...
...and every piece of this equipment will be numbered...
What in the hell is that?
- You make good coffee.
- Cholong coffee.
- More coffee, Sergeant?
- No, thanks.
Brother!
Boy, is it miserable out there.
And believe me, it's sure in hell stay-awake weather.
Don't you men have rain gear?
Yeah, but it doesn't do any good in this lousy climate.
Skipper!
Savoy 3 is on the horn, sir.
Savoy 3 to Savoy 6.
- Over.
- This is Savoy 3.
I'm nearing home base.
I've thrown smoke.
Can you identify?
I see the red smoke.
Come on in.
Give them a hand.
- Morning, Max, Collier.
- Morning, sir.
- Hell of a mess!
- Looks like we're going to float away.
What's this outfit coming in?
That's Captain Nim, your counterpart...
...with the patrol that just got zapped.
Alert the dispensary.
Tell them casualties are coming in.
I'll go find Colonel Kirby.
It was a close one.
Get those casualties over to the dispensary. Let's go. Snap it up!
The rest of you...
...get some dry clothes and chow, report for debriefing.
Move it out!
Fill me in.
As you know, we were hit yesterday.
Three casualties.
This is sure Charlie's weather!
But they didn't follow us.
- You sure?
- Affirmative.
Skipper, I would like to look after my casualties.
Sure. Come on.
- What's the situation?
- He'll be all right.
More painful than serious, sir.
I want you to meet the Camp Commander.
Dai-uy Nim.
Stay where you are, Dai-uy.
Tran Nim.
I've read your name on many reports.
You're very active.
We try, sir.
Meet your new counterpart, Captain MacDanial.
Welcome! We will have a good post here when it gets finished.
I've no doubt, Dai-uy.
Your outfit looks pretty beat up.
- 11 days is a long patrol.
- We're short of men.
We've got everything we need except strikers.
What seems to be the trouble?
The natives have been so exploited by
Viet Cong, they trust no one with a gun.
Same old story. How many villagers are there in the vicinity?
We've got 7.
There were 5.
And we've got 2 in camp.
If you got all the villagers in, what would that do for you?
That'd give us 3 to 5 hundred.
- Better get on to SyWar about this.
- When you leave, Dai-uy?
Tomorrow.
Hopefully.
Da Nang, Nha Trang,
Saigon and home!
My home is in Hanoi.
I'll go home too, someday.
You see.
First, kill all stinking Cong.
Then go home.
Will there be anything else?
That's all, Nim.
Thank you, sir.
He sounds like he means it.
He keeps score on the wall of his hooch.
He personally greased 52 this year.
Says he'll double it by next year...
...if all the yards get out of his way for a clear field to fire.
I noticed a load of corrugated tin has miraculously appeared overnight.
- Sergeant Petersen provided.
- That's a good man you got there.
- Sergeant Petersen say where he got it?
- He said the good fairy left it.
I hope he said,
"The good fairy left it, sir!"
Captain, will you join us in the commo bunker?
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Relax. Sit down.
- My, it's a beautiful evening.
- That it is.
Captain Nim.
Thank you.
This would be great country...
...if not for the war.
And the damn monsoons.
Give me a beer, will you, Petersen.
You won it all.
Why ain't you in this game?
Mr. Beckworth showed him 3 aces.
Be sure and check the guard roster before you turn in.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
Where's McGee?
- Doc, you got the 4-to-6 watch.
- Delightful! Thank you.
Jim Beam! You're not feeding him that stuff? You sure it's good for him?
You questioning...
...my professional competence?
- He sure looks bad.
- He's dying, poor old thing.
- Can't even eat anymore.
- What seems to be wrong?
I'm not the best doctor in the world, but I'm the best one without a license.
My diagnosis is plague, tuberculosis, old age...
...and no hope.
He's tired...
...bone tired.
The Captain's in there!
Check the damage in the dispensary!
Everything's all right here, Colonel!
A near miss, but nobody hurt.
- I think they've stopped.
- Yes, sir.
This is the usual procedure.
About every other night.
Harassment.
It's pretty good shooting.
Commo bunker, the dispensary, the team house.
It's a sure thing that they have eyes inside our camp.
Check gear, they hit the commo bunker.
Lieutenant Green, form a recon patrol, ASAP!
Petersen, come with me.
Who is it?
It's the captain, sir.
Better...
...move him out of there.
Colonel Kirby!
Be right there.
He was going to go home tomorrow, wasn't he, sir?
All the way.
- What do we got, Green, 10 pounders?
- 10 pound warheads, sir.
- Ready to go hunting?
- Be a couple of minutes yet.
I'll be gone about 3 hours.
Mind the store.
Don't worry.
Two-niner Savoy.
This is Savoy Eight.
Over.
Savoy Eight, this is Savoy Five.
Over.
This is Savoy Eight.
I'm nearing the camp.
Have thrown smoke.
Identify.
Savoy Eight, this is Savoy Five.
I see green smoke.
Come on in. Out.
We'd better get out of the way of the copters.
Those choppers are very important out here, aren't they?
Couldn't win this war without them.
I'm sort of new out here.
What's this all about?
Muldoon and MacDanial, in those choppers...
...fly low over the treetops and hope to draw V. C. Gunfire.
You mean there are V. C. That close?
Yes.
Mr. Beckworth, I have V. C.
In my own strike force.
Pardon me.
I have to check the perimeter.
There they are, building a boat bridge.
They're not Cong, they're hard-core regulars.
You worry me.
3 tours of duty and you still act like a civilian.
Sergeant Muldoon,
I'm not a Marine.
I believe in my comfort.
We got the tin.
What about the 50 caliber?
Don't worry. Next drop.
How'd you do it?
A guy in Kho Sahn wanted 2 cases of bourbon.
Bourbon! How'd you get
2 cases of bourbon?
From a guy in supply in Bien Hoa.
Why would he give you that much booze?
He didn't give it to me.
I traded him for it.
Traded him what?
I traded him a Montagnard crossbow...
...a number one address on Tu Do Street...
...and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals.
And where did you get a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals?
I made them.
I work hard.
I've gone to church.
I was a Boy Scout.
I was an Eagle Scout!
He funny!
How did you get in here?
Where do you sleep?
Where's...?
Anywhere.
All right, come here.
- Colonel Kirby?
- Affirmative!
Lt. Jamison, 91st Navy Seabee detachment out of Cho Min.
This is Captain MacDanial.
We'd have come sooner, but the
Marines wanted a strip up north.
It's going to get a little hairy around here, Lieutenant...
...so we're glad to see you, late or not.
The rest of my outfit will be coming with the heavy equipment.
They set it down right where the work is.
- How's that, sir?
- Could you move that jungle back for us?
Just say the word, and I'll move it to China.
We don't need that much.
Just a clear killing zone.
Will do, sir.
Arrange pads.
How many men?
Lucky number.
13. Hop to it!
- I'd like to run an equipment check.
- Go ahead.
Sight for sore eyes.
That thing sure does a day's work!
Easier than mowing the lawn.
Everybody's as busy as little bees.
Hello, Charlie.
Get me Captain Nim and Colonel Kirby.
The charge?
This man was pacing off the distance between the wall and the team house.
We could've been there tonight and caught a round.
I certainly hope you can prove that, Sergeant.
Easy, Tran.
Kowalski.
He was a hell of a soldier, sir.
Is that what you do?
Sponsor an inquisition over here?
- Is that what you'll tell the people?
- I'll tell what I saw.
- That was nothing.
- Brutality's not nothing.
That man was lining us up for a V. C. Mortar crew.
There's still due process.
Out here, due process is a bullet.
I want you to keep that lighter.
It belonged to a medical specialist in Captain Coleman's team.
After delivering a Montagnard baby, on his way back to camp a month ago...
...his friends found him about 3 clicks out...
...beheaded, mutilated.
His wife couldn't have recognized him.
And that V. C. In there did it!
That has nothing to do...
Tell it to Captain Coleman.
And shout it loud...
...because Arlington Cemetery's a long way from here.
Next. Now what is it this time?
That old ear bothering you?
Methiolate.
I'm not going to hurt you one bit.
Now just hold still.
That's it. Don't move.
There. Now that's my good girl?
Candy.
That's for you.
Take it. That's it!
Next.
What is it this time?
Want me to take a look?
Depressor.
Now that's a big boy.
You know something?
You're all well.
Candy.
Here, that's for you.
Montagnards, sir. The old man's chief of the main village.
Great!
I'll take her.
Right here will do it.
The little girl is his granddaughter.
She stepped on a pungi stick.
He's afraid she's going to die.
- How is it?
- It's a nasty wound and it's infected.
But if we can control it, she'll be all right. Good as new.
Pretty tough way...
...to find out about pungi sticks.
Sure is.
This is the chieftain of the village.
Does he speak English?
No, sir.
- He must trust us.
- How's that, sir?
Letting Sergeant McGee take care of his granddaughter.
- Tell him to come in.
- I did, sir. And they won't.
Then why did he come to us for help?
He says papers fall from the sky.
Papers say white man...
...long nose, round eyes, called Americans...
...help Montagnards.
But Viet Cong say our papers lie.
Pardon me, sir.
You like this?
She's a woman, right?
She said she won't ever take it off.
And don't you take this off either.
Now you make your old granddad...
...bring you back when this is dirty and I'll put a clean one on for you.
That's a good girl!
He says the Viet Cong takes all the rice, pigs and chickens...
...and forces all the young men to fight for them.
He hates the Cong.
Tell him if he'll bring his people in with us...
...that we'll give them protection, money and food.
What's he saying?
He said, "What's money?"
How do you answer that?
I think the United States Army can spare a litter.
Working on it, sir.
He says you're very kind.
Tell him if his people are afraid that we'll go out and get them.
Captain MacDanial will take a patrol out tomorrow morning and pick them up.
He says he'll deal with you alone.
He'll come with you and you only.
Tomorrow morning at sunrise, or never.
That's pretty positive.
Sunrise it is.
Here's another one.
Let's move out.
Freeze!
You suppose that old chief was wearing more than one face?
I don't think so.
But we're sure going to respect your hunch.
We'll back off to the river again...
...and make a detour.
Cut him down.
Do you want to hear the story, sir?
I know the story, but go ahead.
Charlie came at night to take the young men.
Most of them listened to the chief and refused to go.
They killed the chief.
And did this...
...as a reminder to anyone who resisted them.
How many of them were there?
And where did they go?
Safe...
...across the border.
What happened to the little girl?
What did she say?
Five Viet Cong soldiers took her in the jungle.
They didn't bring her back.
It's no use.
I'll do what has to be done.
It's pretty hard...
...to talk to anyone about this country until they've...
...come over here and seen it.
The last village that I visited...
...they didn't kill the chief.
They tied him to a tree...
...brought his teenage daughters out in front of him...
...and disemboweled them.
Then 40 of them...
...abused his wife.
And then they took a steel rod...
...broke every bone in her body.
Somewhere during the process she died.
These people need better medical care than we can give them.
Where is Colonel Kirby?
I'll find him.
We've got 3 people who'll make it if we get them to a hospital.
Send for my chopper,
I can take 3.
Coming along?
I'm staying.
I see them, Dai-uy.
Pardon me.
Weapons check in 30 minutes!
Fall out!
Our information checked out. Charlie's building lots of caskets and ladders!
How far away?
About 15 clicks.
That gives us plenty to do before they get here.
Restrict all operations to within 4 clicks of the camp.
- Systems will be operational by dark?
- Affirmative.
May I suggest we contact "C" Team?
See about the weather.
What was all that about ladders and coffins?
When Charlie knows he's got...
...a nice box to be buried in, he's just as brave as hell.
The ladders?
They throw the ladders across the wire to get at us.
Later they use them for litters.
By later you mean when everybody's dead?
Everybody.
Women...
...children. Everybody.
Come on, Hamchunk.
You like?
What is there not to like?
Who is she?
Her name's Lin. Her father was chief of the Hang Pham Province.
Until he refused to cooperate with the Viet Cong.
- And then they killed him?
- They murdered him.
And her little brother.
In a most hideous way.
That's their style.
Besides being one of our top models...
...she could be most helpful to our government.
Are you trying to tell me something, Colonel?
That gentlemen seated with her?
He's a double agent.
He works for us and for General Pham Son Ti.
Then tell me, Colonel...
...who will she be helpful to?
Colonel Morgan, there's a big buildup around Camp A-107.
It could be the real thing.
They request Tac Air and a flare ship. We're working on it.
That's fine.
Keep us informed.
Captain MacDanial had a word for you.
- What is it?
- Tabasco.
I've never known
Captain MacDanial to run scared.
I'd kind of like to eyeball this situation.
Don't you get killed. I don't want my plans for going home to be upset.
I'll give you full cooperation.
Good night.
You didn't get a chance to give him the whole story.
I'll arrange another meeting.
Kill that light!
You better check the gun placements again.
I'm going to have a look-see.
Over there.
A heavy concentration to the south.
Let's see what
Starlight-Starbright has to say.
That's a ruse.
Kowalski, MacDanial, pass the word. Quietly.
Strengthen the north wall.
I repeat...
...strengthen the north wall.
Out.
Every third man, north wall, quietly.
Every third man, north wall.
We had better inform the mortar crew.
Pit one.
Pit two.
Pit three.
Zero in on the village, four rounds, AG. Fire on order.
- What's this?
- You know what it is. Stay here.
- Alone?
- No, you've got your pal.
Now, don't get out of there until I tell you.
You get down there!
You stay quiet!
- Been assigned to your position?
- No, I haven't.
You better come with me.
Right front, 200.
Get some AG. We'll be dropping it pretty close so make it charge seven.
- Level?
- Check.
Everything copacetic?
Ready to fire.
Hit the bunker!
Fire!
- The lieutenant?
- He's gone.
- I was just talking...
- Forget it.
Hang!
Fire!
It's on target.
Pit one. You're right on.
Give them 3 rounds of WP.
We're on target.
Three more rounds. Hang!
Fire!
That's what it's all about,
Mr. Beckworth.
You going to referee or help us?
How?
Give the sergeant a hand!
I'll take them.
Hang!
Fire!
This is Bulldog.
I've got the picture.
The Mike Force is right behind me.
We'll try and make it in before sunrise.
Bulldog, this is Two-Niner Savoy.
This is no harassment, sir.
It's the real McCoy.
They're storming the wire right now.
Bulldog, do you read...
It's us.
Check those generators.
That's got to be Bulldog.
Bulldog!
This is Savoy Six. Over.
Hello, Savoy Six, this is Bulldog.
The Mike Force is...
Savoy Eight, this is Savoy Six. Over.
- This is Savoy Eight.
- This is Savoy Six.
Bulldog's somewhere near you.
Can you get to him?
Savoy Eight.
We saw it.
We're on him. Out.
Let's go.
Damn.
Bulldog!
Hit the deck!
- This man needs attention.
- Medic!
Machine guns are positioned around LZ green.
Get this man down the hill.
Charlie's got all landing zones covered.
Mike Force is coming behind us.
We've got to secure one of them.
Why not this one?
Let's move out.
Bring in the dependents.
Here, dog.
Fire!
Skipper's worried about the inner perimeter. Can you close the breach?
That just fits our pistol. We got a little machine that can do that.
Let's get them, Seabees!
Come on!
Take over!
Medic!
Hit the phoogas!
Petersen!
Going back to the commo bunker!
Yeah. I'll be right with you!
He was all you had, wasn't he?
You don't have anybody else in the whole world, do you?
Except you.
Let's get the hell out of here!
We can't hold out any longer!
We're leaving!
Let's go!
Pit One!
- Pit One, Roger.
- Fall back and destroy the tube.
Orders to fall back.
Let's get the hell out of here!
Troop one, we're moving back.
Let's go!
You heard him, move out!
Medic!
- Can you walk?
- Get me on my feet and I can run!
Sir, the Mike Force is all in.
Savoy Six, this is Bulldog.
Over.
This is Savoy Six.
Go ahead, Bulldog.
Mike Force is on the ground.
We're on our way in.
We'll try and make it in before the damn sun comes up.
Will keep you informed.
Move out.
Savoy Two-Niner...
...this is Blue Leader.
This is Savoy Six, Blue Leader.
This is Blue Leader. 2 birds are coming in. Where do you want it dropped?
Air strike.
Savoy Six, Blue Leader.
400 meters from the north wall...
...southwest to northeast.
Do you roger?
This is Blue Leader.
Roger and out.
Savoy Six, this is Bulldog.
Go ahead, Bulldog.
This is Savoy Six.
This is Bulldog. Mike Force is in position. Tell us when you're ready.
Roger, Bulldog.
Savoy Six.
We'll use the air strike to keep Charlie's head down.
Execute plan three in two minutes.
Do you roger?
Roger. Out.
Two minutes, pass the word.
Fall back, damn it! Fall back to the commo bunker! Everybody!
Let go with the phoogas!
Let's go! Keep down.
Take a platoon down and reinforce Evans.
I'm going to the tower.
What's the situation?
We can't even hold this place with that air strike.
Take that 30 end and give support to the 50 caliber.
Give me that, I can handle it.
Check the team house.
Traitor!
I'm prepared for that.
Medic!
Parks, how is he?
He's pretty bad, sir, but still alive.
See if that 50's operational.
I'll check it.
Beldo, give me a hand!
Fall back!
Swing her around 180 degrees.
Give them 4 H. E. Maximum elevation...
...and destroy the tube.
Fall back!
Move them out!
Choppers are on their way.
Keep your heads down!
- What about the radio?
- Charges are set and it's ready to go.
- Claymores?
- We got a few spread out.
Move out!
Let's go!
Keep it down. Let's move.
Everybody...
...fall back!
Choppers are here. Hurry up!
- Everyone out to the LT green.
- Fall back!
- Hi, Tom.
- How you doing, Pete?
Take care of that kid, no matter what happens.
Will do, Pete.
What happened to Nim?
He bought the farm, sir, but he took a lot of them with him.
Puff the Magic Dragon's on the horn.
This is Two-Niner Savoy. Over.
Puff to ground, where do you want it?
Put it on the camp.
Those people have it, we don't.
It'll only take a minute.
I think Puff broke their back.
We can probably move in there tomorrow.
God willing, and the river don't rise.
What do we do now, sir?
First we get some sack time.
Then we start all over again.
Check the perimeter. Make sure the outposts are set for the night.
It couldn't have been much worse, could it?
We're still alive.
What happens now?
We keep doing our jobs.
You got one to go back to, haven't you?
Yeah, I guess so.
What are you going to say in that newspaper of yours?
If I say what I feel,
I may be out of a job.
We'll always give you one.
I could do you more good with a typewriter.
It's Sergeant Sooby's.
He didn't make it.
Funny thing.
Fellow takes one of these into battle...
...and by the grace of God he comes out in one piece...
...he carries a strange sense of guilt all the rest of his life.
I'd like permission to take my men into "A" camp to check equipment.
And also, that sergeant who was pretty badly hit was asking for you. Provo?
Thank you.
Captain Johanson is taking the Mike Force...
...back this afternoon.
You can go in with him.
- Happy to have had you aboard.
- Thanks for the ride, Colonel.
Why wasn't he put on the chopper?
The wounded go before the dead, sir.
We thought it better not to move him.
They zapped me good.
You're not gone yet.
Would you do me a favor, sir?
Would you take a touch with me?
I sure will.
Thank you, sir.
Would you do me another favor, sir?
What is it?
You remember the decision I was trying to make, about my name?
The signs?
I remember.
That's it.
There it is, sir.
That's what he said he wanted?
Affirmative. That's what he wanted and that's what he's going to get!
Maybe he liked the idea of having so many men think about him every day.
Besides...
...it sings.
Sings?
Yeah, that's what he said.
It sings.
Provo's Privy. It does sing!
Last time we met, Colonel Cai and I were going to tell you about a plan...
...and "A" camp 107 got hit.
This can't wait till you take over.
I want you thoroughly briefed.
- Why way out here?
- This is top secret, Mike.
I repeat, top secret.
- How was Saigon?
- Very interesting.
I attended a meeting with the premier and his staff.
The main subject was General Pham Son Ti.
He has assumed command of the entire Viet Cong forces in the south.
Which makes him Number One!
Affirmative.
And it could mean a major offensive.
I had my hands on him the last time I was out here.
But I couldn't get enough evidence to hold him against political pressure.
Want to get your hands on him again?
Who wouldn't? But if I know General Ti, he's surrounded by a regiment.
- My people think several.
- And that brings us up to the plan.
He's somewhere in Hang Phau Valley.
Surrounded by the regiments you mentioned, which makes...
...a capture impossible.
Precisely.
Except for one woman...
...and a certain hand-picked team.
Go on, Colonel.
This is the rat.
And this is the trap.
My father was a simple man.
All he wanted was to be free...
...his wife to love, and his children to raise.
He tried to remain neutral.
That was his mistake.
What he didn't realize was that...
...man has to pay a price for that freedom.
Therefore, he suffered the ultimate penalty.
Since that day...
...I've lived but with one thought.
To find the man who ordered my father and little brother murdered.
I found him.
His name is Pham Son Ti.
And I will give him to you.
When?
One week from tonight.
At the old Costeau Plantation.
Colonel Cai knows where it is.
How much do you know about this girl?
Her father and General Ti's father grew up together.
Their families were very close.
Even before he moved to Hanoi...
...he had more than a friendly interest in Lin.
Do you trust her?
Of course.
She's my brother's wife.
Let's see, it's 0400 hours.
That means we'll hit the drop zone...
...around a little after sunrise.
Everything set?
Your gear's on board with Colonel Cai's.
Thank you.
Let's get aboard.
You heard the man.
Stick formation, let's go.
- Keep your head down.
- Don't worry.
Colonel Cai, you haven't said a word all night.
You know why?
He's never jumped before.
First one's easy.
It's the second one that's hard to get them to make.
We use the alternative plan Bravo, don't we, sir?
Alternative plan Bravo!
Kowalski, that means you take the point.
If you see anything, don't let them spot you. Freeze!
- Let us know. Got it?
- Got it.
One minute to drop, sir.
The recon was a success...
...probably be no trouble.
But the word is alert!
Get ready.
Port side, stand up.
Starboard side, stand up.
Hook up.
Stand in the door.
Go!
You ready?
Sir, Kowalski's got about a 5 minute start on us.
Lieutenant Moore sprained his ankle badly.
Moore, you'd better stay here with the skylift detail.
You come with us, Watson.
Move out!
Bulldog!
Savoy Three.
Over.
This is Bulldog, Savoy Three. Over!
Savoy Three, Savoy Three.
This is Bulldog. Over.
Trouble.
Won't need that anymore.
No.
But he took them all with him...
...or they wouldn't have left this!
Form the burial detail.
Yes, sir.
There it is.
It's your baby. We can never get back here before daybreak.
What do you think?
- It'll make a nice mess.
- How many men will you need?
- Doc and two of Colonel Cai's men.
- You got them.
If we don't get back by 1100 tomorrow...
...you blow it.
Head for the rendezvous.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Move out.
How come you like blowing things up so much?
When I was a kid my dad gave me a chemistry set...
...and it got bigger than both of us.
The waiting's over.
No escort.
You all know your jobs.
Remember...
...we don't go back without the general.
Not one of us.
Question?
Move out.
Wait here.
Wine?
Later.
Come on.
There are two guards on the porch.
I'm ready for them.
- Where's the lady?
- Right here.
Here.
Watch his leg.
Get him in there.
Nearly finished?
What next?
Wait.
Roadrunner...
...this is Bulldog. Over.
Bulldog, this is Roadrunner. Over.
How's the traffic?
Traffic is scarce this early in the morning. Everything's set.
How will you evade?
We have spotted motorcycle.
We'll be there in seven minutes.
Do you read me?
Right. Out.
We're as ready as we'll ever be.
Go ahead, Doc. Here.
Take him!
Hit it!
What the hell?
What happened?
- I caught one.
- The first aid kit!
No, not now! Five minutes, this road will be like downtown.
Let's get out of here, Sarge.
- Get him out of the way.
- Release the brake.
- Two minutes to lift-off, Colonel.
- Move out.
You better stay here.
Stay there.
Colonel, there's the plane.
Inflate.
Take the rear.
Let's get out of here.
Sir, could I have a choice?
Yeah, you can have a choice.
- I'll take the point.
- I said you have a choice.
Yes, sir, that's why
I'm taking the point.
We're close to that rendezvous area.
You better...
...get out there ahead and see what's waiting for us.
Relax.
- She's your sister-in-law.
- She is.
Her whole future, her self-respect...
...everything is in your hands.
It isn't that I...
Thank you, Mike.
You're a brave woman.
No, just a woman praying that her family will forgive her.
There is nothing to forgive.
Thought you'd never get here.
Choppers are coming up the valley.
Where's Doc?
Caught one in the back, but he's going to be all right.
Let's get the Colonel.
The LZ is a meadow just over that rise.
Let's move out!
Bastards!
Move out.
You heard him, let's go!
Can you tell me what area's designated as offloading ramp today?
Last pad over, next to the water.
See that runway over by the beach?
That's where your Peter-son's going to be coming in.
You take care of yourself.
Thank you.
- Mister, you Beckworth?
- That's right.
If you want to go where the war is, this is the way.
- Who's that for?
- I don't know, boy.
Wait until the choppers are down, son.
Colonel, I got a jeep for you and Mrs. Cai.
Successful mission, Mike.
But very costly.
Is there a Petersen here?
Must be in another chopper, sonny.
Not here.
Medic!
- What happened?
- It's Doc, Hamchunk.
He's going to be all right.
There's none of them left in here, sonny.
This is one job
I don't envy you, Colonel.
You always knew it could happen, didn't you?
But I didn't want it to.
None of us did.
Was my Peter-son brave?
He was very brave.
Are you going to be?
I'll try.
I know you will.
And I'm sure that...
...your Peter-son...
...would want you to have that.
What will happen to me now?
You let me worry about that,
Green Beret.
You're what this is all about.
Back at home, a young wife waits
Her Green Beret has met his fate
He has died for those oppressed
Leaving her this last request
Put silver wings on my son's chest
Make him one of America's best
He'll be the man they'll pick one day
Have him wear the Green Beret
I say, the Archduke's got his wife with him.
I thought they usually kept her out of sight.
Today is their 14th wedding anniversary.
I see.
So that's why she's been allowed out.
It's a pity he married beneath him.
What on earth will they do with her when he inerits the Austrian empire?
Perhaps by that time, madame,
Austria will no longer have an empire.
My dear Monsieur Poincaré.
Don't tell me you've got some delicious piece of gossip.
You must understand, my dear, that France doesn't approve of Austria at the moment.
- Oh?
- Against Austria, nothing.
But their foreign minister...
Count Berchtold?
Why, he's absolutely charming.
He wishes to make a war against Serbia, so he crawls to the Kaiser for aid.
I don't think there'll be any war.
There speaks the true diplomat.
And if there is, there's certainly no need for us to get involved.
Yes. Well, I mean, you know, who cares?
Serbia's such a little country anyway, you know.
And I mean, they're always up to something, aren't they?
Serbia is little, madame, but it will not be a little war.
Well, that's up to you and the Russians, isn't it?
As you wish.
Please excuse me, madame.
Enchantée.
Sir Edward.
- My dear Edward.
- Poldy.
Your Majesty, you know the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
Sir Edward Grey.
Count Helmuth von Moltke,
Chief of the German General Staff.
Still expanding your army and navy?
We like to keep busy.
Yes, we're off to sign the...
He's forced me to mobilise...
I see the French President is hobnobbing with the Czar again.
I really think they mean to fight with us over Serbia.
Quite ridiculous.
Couldrt you persuade your king to have a talk to the Czar?
After all, they're cousins.
Why not ask the Kaiser?
He's a cousin of Nicholas, too.
Well, I hope the French haven't encouraged you to do anything foolish.
Germany is with us.
It could be embarrassing.
- Because our royal family is German?
- Precisely.
I think they may be relied on to play their part.
Excellent. Excellent.
After all, the last thing any of us want is a war.
War?
War is unthinkable!
It is out of the question!
It would upset the balance of power.
We Germans are an industrious and moral people.
We have earned the right to have our say in the world's affairs.
The Republic of France is the seat of reason, the centre of world civilisation and culture!
Now, look here. The British Empire is the most magnificent example...
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen.
Ready for the shot, if you please!
Would the Italian and Turkish gentlemen move in a little closer, please?
Right. Nice smile for everybody!
Austrian Archduke assassinated.
Austrian Archduke assassinated!
Austrian Archduke assassinated!
Hey, wait for me!
I want to see the Emperor, too!
Count Berchtold? Count Berchtold!
Wait for me! Count Berchtold!
Have you signed the declaration of war,
Your Majesty?
Have you signed the declaration of war,
Your Majesty?
I have this report from the Commander of the Fourth Army Corps.
"Serbian troops have fired on our positions
"from steamers on the Danube.
"Our troops, in order to defend themselves,
"were forced to return the enemy fire.
"A considerable skirmish developed."
"Assassination, terrorism...
"Failure to accede to our legitimate demands," et cetera, et cetera.
"Austria now at war with Serbia."
The more so since Serbian provocateurs are already attacking
Austrian troop positions.
Hostilities have already begun.
But that wasrt true.
The Serbians haven't attacked anyone.
Of course not.
And as the information about the
Serbian attack has not been confirmed,
I have taken it upon myself to erase all reference to the incident from the declaration of war.
Your Majesties,
Your Excellencies, my lords, gentlemen.
Ready when you are.
Take your places, please, for the ever-popular war game.
Complete with songs, battles and a few jokes.
The whole of Europe will explode at any moment.
Can Germany do nothing to stop the Austrians?
Apparently not.
We are the only country prepared to help the Serbs.
If Russia mobilises, so will Germany.
France is bound by treaty to aid Russia.
Britain must make her position clear.
I think we should all stay calm.
I think we should all stay calm.
The world will be engulfed in the most terrible of wars, the ultimate aim of which is the ruin of Germany.
England, France and Russia are conspiring together to destroy us.
Your Majesty, we know for a fact that you are mobilising the Russian army.
Upon my word of honour, you are wrong.
I do not doubt it, but we have irrefutable proof.
- You want my word of honour in writing?
- No.
Thank you.
In that case, I can only repeat to you, at this hour not one man, not one horse has been called up.
I must congratulate you on persuading Italy to join us.
Our allies are dropping away from us like rotten apples, even before the war has started.
General mobilisation is ordered by the St Petersburg Council of War.
France has mobilised, too,
Your Imperial Majesty.
The encirclement of Germany is an accomplished fact.
We have run our heads into a noose.
England?
She has not yet made up her mind.
- Abandon the plan.
- It is too late.
The wheels are already in motion.
Get in touch with my cousin, King George V.
Inform him my troops are being prevented, by telephone and telegram, from passing through Belgium.
They've gone into Luxembourg, sir.
The lamps are going out all over Europe.
We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.
Notify Lieutenant Feldmann.
He is to withdraw immediately from Luxembourg.
To retreat now would be disastrous.
We must go forward.
Very well.
Advance into Luxembourg!
The sword is drawn!
I cannot sheath it again without victory and honour!
All of you shall and will see to it that only in honour is it returned to the scabbard.
Let every man look into his own heart and his own feelings and construe for himself the extent of his obligation for himself.
Sir.
They've invaded Belgium.
Now you'll have to go to war.
You're wanted at headquarters, sir.
Your Majesty.
General's brigade, march!
We do not see any reason, however distant, for a conflict.
May I beg Your Excellency to express to His Majesty my profound gratitude for all the marks of friendship and consideration which I have received in the last eight months.
And assure him of the profound respect of His Majesty the King, who regards His Majesty with deep veneration and expresses the hope that the most regrettable state of war between Great Britain and the monarchy may be of no long duration.
I am extremely perturbed at the thought that we should find ourselves at conflict with England since the two countries are so near to one another politically and morally, with traditional sympathies and interests.
Allow me to share your hope that the present, most unfortunate state of war will be of no long duration and that normal relations will shortly be resumed.
Mum, a band! A band!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Coming.
Grandpa, look! It's a band!
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!
By the centre, quick march!
Ha'penny won'th of chips, please.
Oh, I do like to live beside the seaside
I do like to be beside the sea
- Good morning, Sir Douglas.
- Good morning, Miss Bates.
Oh, I do like to see a lot of soldiers
Oh, soldiers are what I like to see
And if they've got a sword and horse
Then I like them more, of course
Because I just love the cavalry
Oh, I do like to live beside the seaside
I do like to be beside the sea
Oh I do like to stroll along the prom prom prom
Where the brass bands play tiddley-om-pom-pom
Right. Come along, then.
First man, please.
Brownley, Cecil. One, please.
Thank you very much.
- Lang, Mary.
- Thank you.
Take her, love.

Thank you.
Smith, Bertram Biddle.
Come on.
Come down off of there.
- Jack, here.
- Hello.
Come on.
Don't be daft, we're on holiday.
Harry.
Hot potatoes!
Hot potatoes!
Here, Freddie.
Potatoes!
George!
No.
George.
Grandpa, look, there's a soldier.
Mesdames et messieurs, presenting for your greatest entertainment, the most fantastic spectacle of the world today, the armée française in all its glory!
Its banners, its uniforms will pass now before your very eyes. Rideau!
- Bonjour, soldier.
- Bonjour, mon colonel.
- It's a good day for the chase.
- We await your orders.
A battle won is a battle in which one will not confess oneself beaten.
A silly German sausage dreamt
Napoleon he'd be
Then he went and broke his promise
It was made in Germany
He shook hands with Britannia and eternal peace he swore
Naughty boy, he talked of peace while he prepared for war
His warships sailed upon the sea they looked a pretty sight
But when they heard the bulldog bark they disappeared from sight
The Kaiser said, 'Be careful if by Jellicoe they're seen
'Then every man-of-war I've got
'Will be a submarine'
Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser
Europe took the stick and made him sore
On his throne it hurts to sit
And when John Bull starts to hit
He will never sit upon it anymore
He'll have to go to school again and learn his geography
He quite forgot Britannia and the hands across the sea
Australia and Canada the Russian and the Jap
And England looked so small he couldn't see her on the map
For Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser
Europe took the stick and made him sore
We shall shout with victory's joy
Hold your hand out, naughty boy
You must never play at soldiers anymore
He'll never sit upon it anymore
Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser
Europe took a stick and made him sore
On his throne it hurts to sit
And when John Bull starts to hit
He will never sit upon it anymore
On his throne it hurts to sit
And when John Bull starts to hit
He will never sit upon it
He will never sit upon it
He will never sit upon it...
Paper! Paper!
Brussels falls!
Brussels falls!
- Paper! Paper!
- Here, boy!
Paper! Read all about it! Brussels falls!
'The battlefield is unbelievable.
'Heaps of corpses lying everywhere, rifles in hand.
'Thousands of dead in row after row.
'Night has fallen, and the rain has started.
'Shells are bursting and screaming.
'Artillery fire is the worst.
'We are all utterly exhausted.
'I lie at night listening to the wounded groaning.
'The cannonading goes on and on.
'Whenever it stops, we hear the wounded crying out
'from all over the woods.
'Two or three men go mad every night.
'I feel a great pity
'for many of the civilian population who have lost everything.
'But they hate us.
One of them fired at us.
'He was immediately taken out...
'Taken out and shot.
'Yesterday, we were ordered to attack the enemy flank
'in a forest of beeches,
'but the enemy gunner saw us first and opened fire.
'The casualties on both sides were truly terrible.'
Are we downearted?
No!
So let your voices ring and all together sing
Are we downearted?
No!
Not while Britannia rules the waves
Not likely
While we have Jack upon the sea
And Tommy on the land we needrt fret
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But we're not downearted yet
Are we downearted?
No!
So let your voices ring and all together sing
Are we downearted?
No!
Not while Britannia rules the waves
Not likely
While we have Jack upon the sea
And Tommy on the land we needrt fret
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But we're not downearted yet
We watched you playing cricket and every kind of game
At football, golf and polo you men have made your name
But now your country calls you to play your part in war
And no matter what befalls you
We shall love you all the more
So come and join the forces as your fathers did before
Oh, we don't want to lose you
But we think you ought to go
For your king and your country
Both need you so
We shall want you and miss you
But with all our might and main
We shall cheer you, thank you, kiss you
When you come back again
Oh, we don't want to lose you
But we think you ought to go
For your king and your country
Both need you so
We shall want you and miss you
But with all our might and main
We shall cheer you, thank you, kiss you
When you come back again
The Army and the Navy need attention
The outlook isn't healthy, you'll admit
But I have a perfect dream of a new recruiting scheme
Which I think is absolutely it
If only other girls would do as I do
I believe that we could manage it alone
For I turn all suitors from me
But the sailor and the Tommy
I've an army and a navy of my own
On Sunday I walk out with a soldier
Monday I'm taken by a tar
Tuesday I'm out with a baby Boy Scout
On Wednesday a hussar
On Thursday I gang oot wi' a Scottie
On Friday the Captain of the crew
But on Saturday, I'm willing if you'll only take the shilling
To make a man of any one of you
I teach the tenderfoot to face the powder
That gives an added lustre to my skin
And I show the raw recruit how to give a chaste salute
So when I'm presenting arms he's falling in
It makes you almost proud to be a woman
When you make a strapping soldier of a kid
And he says you put me through it
And I didn't want to do it but you went and made me love you
So I did
On Sunday I walk out with a bosun
On Monday a rifleman in green
On Tuesday I choose a sub in the blues
On Wednesday a marine
On Thursday a terrier from Tooting
On Friday a midshipman or two
But on Saturday I'm willing
If you'll only take the shilling
To make a man of any one of you
Come on, lads! We need a million!
A million!
- Be a man! Enlist today!
- Enlist today!
Have you a man digging your garden when he should be digging trenches?
He should be digging trenches!
Are there any able-bodied men in the house?
'Cause on Saturday I'm willing if you'll only take the shilling
To make a man of any one of you
Now, you heard what the lovely lady said!
- We need a million of you!
- Able-bodied men.
Come along, my lucky lads!
Take the King's shilling.
We'll make a man of you!
- I'll turn you into a man.
- Give you the time of your life!
I'll give you the time of your life.
We'll give you the time of your life!
A kiss! A kiss from this lovely lady for the first man to volunteer!
You, sir! How about you, sir?
That's right, sir! Why, step forward!
Step forward now!
That's right, my lucky lad!
Maudie!
Come on, lads! You heard what I said!
We need a million of you!
Well done, my boy. Proud of you.
Proud of you.
All right, dear. Lil!
Hold on to him, love.
That's right, boys! Up you come!
Three more! Get on stage! Get up!
You, sir!
Make your girlfriend proud of you.
Be a hero and step forward, sir.
Thank you, sir.
One young lady still left unescorted.
You, sir! You may be fat and 40, sir, but your country needs you.
Come and join the army!
'Cause on Saturday I'm willing if you'll only take the shilling
To make a man of any one of you
To make a man of any one of you
What are you up to?
Get back into line, you horrible little man, you.
And all of you, from now on, your bloody life won't be won'th living!
And you won't bloody die laughing, either!
Now, then...
Party, attention!
Quite right, lad.
We've just crossed the Belgian border.
We should be arriving in Mons in about two hours' time.
Now, see that?
The commanders of the British expeditionary force,
Field Marshal Sir John French,
General Sir Henry Wilson.
Off to a big conference, more than likely.
I must confess,
I'm not looking forward to this meeting.
What do you think the French will say, sir, when they hear we only have four divisions
- instead of the six we promised?
- They can say what they like.
Damn it all, Wilson, we're not under any obligation to help the French.
We've got our own war to fight.
What?
Yes, well, I've no doubt that they will appreciate our point of view.
One must always remember the class of people these French generals come from.
They're mostly tradesmen, I believe.
I shart understand a damn word they say anyway.
In regard to our plan, sir,
I've actually worked out the number of gun carriages we shall need for the first stage and even the amount of forage for the horses.
Would you care to see the figures?
Well, I thought, considering the terrain...
Yes, yes. We know all about your bicycling trips through France, Wilson.
I realise it's a bit late, sir, but do you think
I should try to arrange for an interpreter to help us out at the conference?
Don't be ridiculous, Wilson!
The most vital consideration at the moment is to maintain absolute secrecy.
Well, I never seen one of them before.
I think I've won a prize.
- So have I.
- You have, my lad.
So have you all.
Left turn! Quick march!
Right then! Three shots for tuppence!
Come on, lad. How about you?
That's right. And what about you, lad?
Come on, step up.
Three shots for tuppence.
- That's the ticket, Jack, lad.
- Right, don't fire the gun till I tell you.
Get a good grip, firm and steady.
The British riflemars the best in the world.
No, don't jerk.
Squeeze the trigger.
That's right.
Steady now.
- Don't blink, lad.
- Don't blink, lad.
- Left eye shut.
- Left eye shut.
- Pick your targets carefully.
- Pick your targets carefully.
Don't fire till you hear my command!
Right, lads. Enemy in front, 400 yards.
Five rounds! Rapid fire!
Cease fire!
Stand down.
Smith! Stand to until relieved.
Yes, sir.
Listen to this.
"In this new experience, you may find temptation
"both in wine and women.
You must resist both.
"Order to the troops. Signed, Kitchener,
"Secretary of bleeding State."
- Hot, isn't it, Sergeant?
- It'll be hotter still tomorrow, lad.
They've pulled out the Suffolks and the Warwicks and most of the rest of the corps.
We'll make your mother proud of you yet.
What's happened to the French Army?
The French Army's nothing to do with us, laddie.
We ain't asking any help from them, and they ain't getting any help from us, even though they've asked.
So, we shall be here on our own then?
Well, someone's got to look after the shop, haven't they?
Here they come again! Fix bayonets!
Hold your fire, hold your fire. Wait for it.
Pick your target at 300 yards!
Wagstaff, you horrible little wretch!
I'll tell you when!
I wish somebody would tell me what's happening.
Send for the boys of the girls' brigade
To set old England free
Send for me brother
Me sister or me mother
But for God's sake, don't send me
Enemy in front!
Five rounds, rapid fire!
Wounded home from France!
First boys back from Mons!
Read all about it!
Careful, now.
Read all about it!
Watch it, lads. Careful does it.
Nurse!
Come on, let's have you outside.
Outside!
- Look lively with that crutch, Spinks.
- It can't bring itself, can it?
Come on! On your feet!
- No flags, then, Sarge?
- Very comical, Burgess.
- Sergeant!
- Yes, lad?
Oh, just smell that soot, boys.
Lovely.
Right now, smarten yourselves up!
Eyes front!
Attention!
Thank you, Sergeant Dodds.
Stand the men at ease.
Stand at ease! Carry on.
Ambulances are ready, Sarge.
Officers only.
What about the other ranks?
No arrangements made for them at the moment, sir.
We'll be all right, sir.
Transport's this way, sir, if you care to follow me.
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- Sir.
Nearly home, George.
Hello, Smith. Sorry about your leg.
- Are you all right?
- It's better than being at Mons, eh, sir?
- Yes. Good journey home?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
Good. Chin up, then.
See you back at the front.
Now, gently. Gently. Stretcher down...
You're wasting your time with him, darling.
It's in splints.
- That's enough of that.
- What about us, then, Sarge?
I'm awaiting further orders.
Will you sign this, please, Sergeant?
We're here because we're here because
We're here because we're here
We're here because we're here because
We're here because we're here
All right, all right, all right.
How about getting the train back, then, Sarge?
You'll get back soon enough, lad.
You'll get back soon enough, lad.
- Hooray. Mafeking's been relieved.
- I'll have you, Burgess.
- What is it, Corporal?
- It's all right, Sarge.
Some lorry drivers have volunteered to take the men to Millbank Hospital in their dinner hour.
Right, get them fell in.
I'll have a word with the RTO.
- Right you are, Sergeant.
- Right!
You heard what the Sergeant said.
Get yourselves fell in!
Dontemann, Gray!
Fall in as markers!
The rest of you men, dress off from the left in two lines, across the platform!
Come on, come on!
Double round the back there!
I said dress off from the left!
Some of you don't know your left from your right!
Carry him gently, boys.
Don't worry.
We'll soon have you back at the front.
You're like a load of pregnant women!
Blimey, if this is the way you've been carrying on out there, we ain't got no chance!
Hey, you! Pay attention, will you?
You're back in Blighty now!
And I want to see you set some good examples!
A couple of days with you lot, we'll soon whip you into some shape.
We want some spit and polish here.
We're going out in a minute, marching off.
We're going down the street, you'd better look lively.
Right. Get your stretcher party moving, Corporal.
Now, get a move on!
- Stretcher party, ready.
- Right, now pull yourselves together.
Form up in two ranks on the left!
Come along!
Party, attention!
Left turn!
By the right!
Quick march!
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Come on, now! Pick 'em up!
Quit smiling!
Smile, smile, smile
While you've a lucifer to light your fag
Smile, boys, that's the style
What's the use of worrying
It never was won'thwhile
So pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile
Read all about it!
First wounded boys home from France!
Read all about it!
Thank you.
I'm so glad it's real champagne.
So many of even the best people give one cider nowadays.
I'm not using my German wine, not while the war's on.
I think that's a splendid gesture, Stephen.
I say, isn't that Olivia?
Doesrt she look adorable?
That black dress is stunning.
So many women simply look depressing in mourning.
Now, come along, Elenor.
Come along, come along.
It is a bit rotten, you know, all those chaps getting killed and all that sort of thing.
Not at all.
The men at the front simply adore the war.
I had a letter from Julian the other day.
- Oh?
- Champagne, sir.
He said it's like a great big picnic.
Nobody grumbles at him for getting dirty.
Oh, dear.
Not a bit like Christmas, is it?
No. It's awfully dull.
Father's business has had the most frightful knock.
We'd all agreed that the French and Germans shouldn't touch the iron ore works in Alsace-Lorraine, until some idiot French pilot goes and drops a bomb.
Oh, dear. That is too bad.
What happened?
He got court-martialled.
- Splendid.
- Yeah.
We're hoping to get the contracts for tin hats.
The whole army has to have them.
How nice.
I thought of asking Nanny to knit something,
- you know, mittens and things.
- That's a good idea.
We sent a parcel to the chauffeur's son.
Some Benger's Food, a tinder box, compass and some nerve tonic.
- How very nice.
- Yeah, I thought so.
Do look.
Bleeding Benger's Food and nerve tonic again?
Well, you shouldn't have thanked him for the last lot.
"In the actual battle zone,
"phosphorine gives immediate relief and freedom
"from the severe exhaustion
"and steady loss of nerve force
"which occurs when under constant shellfire."
Hey, what's up with you?
Have you got company?
Yeah, you know last time I went down to that delousing station, all they did was stick a hot iron over my trousers.
I came out with more than I went in with.
You wrote another one, then?
- Yeah.
- Well, give us a read of it.
"If I should die, think only this of me
"That there's some corner of a foreign field
"That is forever England There shall be
"In that rich earth a richer dust concealed
"A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware
"Gave, once, her flowers to love
"her ways to roam
"A body of England's breathing English air
"Washed by the rivers blessed by sons of home"
Hey, Mac. Will you listen to that?
Yeah. They're copping it down Railway Wood tonight.
No. That's Hill 60.
No, not that. Listen.
What is it?
Singing.
It's those Welsh bastards in the next trench.
No. That's Jerry.
That's an hymn.
No, it's a carol.
They sing well for a lot of bastards, don't they?
Sing up, Jerry. I cannae hear ye.
Put a sock in it. Let's listen.
Nice, wasrt it?
Very nice, matey!
Hello, Tommy!
Hello, Tommy!
He heard you.
Hello!
Eh?
How are you?
I'm very well, thank you.
Good night!
Happy Christmas!
Well, there's another day gone.
- Hey, it's Christmas.
- Not today.
Tomorrow, you great goonie.
I forgot it was Christmas.
Tommy! Tommy!
He doesn't give up, does he?
What's the matter?
It is for you now to sing us a good song for Christmas, ja?
- Ja!
- Ja.
Who's going to sing, then?
Give them up one of yours, Garbett.
Aye, give them yours, Ben.
It was Christmas day in the cookhouse
The happiest day of the year
Mers hearts were full of gladness
And their bellies full of beer
When up spoke Private Shorthouse
His face as bold as brass
Saying, 'We don't want your Christmas pudding
'You can stick it up your... '
Tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
It was Christmas day in the harem
The eunuchs were standing round
And hundreds of beautiful women
Were stretched out on the ground
When in came the bold, bad Sultan
And gazed on his marble halls
Saying, 'What do you want for Christmas, boys? '
And the eunuchs answered...
Tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Bravo, Tommy!
English carols is very beautiful.
Hey, Tommy.
Hey, are you still there?
- Aye!
- Yeah!
You drink with us, ja?
- Ja!
- Ja!
You like some good deutschen Schnaps?
- That's whisky.
- Yes!
Sling it over!
Tomorrow we meet you in the middle!
Aye, the middle of Piccadilly.
It's funny to hear them speak in English.
Yeah, well, they learned it all at school, didn't they?
See you in the penalty area!
Happy Christmas!
- Happy Christmas.
- Aye, happy Christmas.
Good night, Jerry.
Ta.
Jim?
Cocoa.
Ooch, ta.
Hey, Jack.
Hey!
Hello, Tommy.
About bloody time, too.
That's good stuff, Jerry.
Aye. Thank you very much.
Fritz.
How are you, Fritz?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
How's the Kaiser?
Freuter.
How do you do? Hawkins.
Do you know when the war will end?
After our spring offensive, I should think.
- How are your trenches?
- Terrible.
Not fit for pigs.
When it rains, we're up to our knees in mud and water.
Arert you sick of the war?
Before the war, I was staying in Suffolk, and I left there a three-and-one-half horsepower motorcycle.
And also a girl.
Hey, do you hear that?
This chap's got a girlfriend in Suffolk.
You can send her a message, telling her that I am all right over here.
I mean, I will write name and address for you.
I suppose it's all right.
Cigarette?
Are they Virginian?
Aye. Straight cut.
Ah, nein, danke. I only smoke Turkish.
Have a cigar.
Thank you.
We will not ever shoot again, unless you start.
Do you hear that?
That will suit us, man, I can tell you.
Here. We'll drink to that.
That is Scottish schnapps.
This is your guns that are shooting?
No. It's the bastard English, not us.
They will not shoot at us while you are here.
Don't believe that, man.
It's us they're shooting at.
Oh, well...
Thanks very much, mate, and give my love to the Kaiser.
- Morning, sir.
- Right. Carry on.
Yes, sir.
Morning, sir.
Well done.
Fraternisation, you call it?
It could be interpreted as treason.
We could have them all shot.
Stop the leaves of all units in any sector where it's happened.
And a happy New Year to you, too.
Come on. Come on, quickly.
Brother Bertie went away
To do his bit the other day
With a smile on his lips
And his lieutenant pips
Upon his shoulder bright and gay
As the train moved out he said
Remember me to all the birds.
Then he wagged his paw and went away to war
Shouting out these pathetic words
Goodbye, goodbye
Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eye
Though it's hard to part, I know
I'll be tickled to death to go
Don't cry, don't sigh
There's a silver lining in the sky
Bonsoir, old thing
Cheerio, chin-chin
Nap-poo, toodle-oo, goodbye

Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh?
Oh, it's a shame to take the pay
As soon as reveille is gone
We feel just as heavy as lead
But we never get up till the sergeant
Brings our breakfast up to bed
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war
Oh, what do we want with eggs and ham
When we've got plum and apple jam?
Form fours, right turn
How shall we spend the money we earn?
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war
Up to your waist in water
Up to your eyes in slush
Using the kind of language
That makes the sergeant blush
Who wouldn't join the army?
That's what we all inquire
Don't we pity the poor civilian
Sitting beside the fire?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a lovely war

Smithey!
Smithey!
Hello, Mavis.
Morning, Sir John.
Oh, Smith. Been wounded, I see.
Yes. Got a blighty one at Mons, sir.
Yes, yes. Well, the wife must be glad to have you home.
I'm not married yet, sir.
Oh, no, no. Of course not. It was your...
Brother, sir.
Jack.
Married Cook's daughter, sir.
Yes. That's right. That's right.
They've got a dear little boy, haven't they?
Yeah. A little girl actually, sir. Emma.
Rest of the family all right?
Well, touch wood, sir.
Got five at the front now, sir.
Well done. Well done.
Nothing like a bit of shooting, eh?
No, sir.
Well, I must be off.
August the 12th tomorrow.
Grouse won't wait.
Keep up the good work.
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.
- Everything all right up there, Mavis?
- I'm attending to it, sir.
Well, look, come and see me in a month or so.
We might do something about getting your old job back.
- What do you say to that?
- Well, if I can't get back to the front, sir,
I think I'd sooner have a job in munitions, if it's all the same to you, sir.
As you wish...
Jack.
Drive on, Mavis.
That's better.
Right, lads. You can take your masks off now.
Masks off! Stand down!
Not you, Leary.
- Sentry.
- Yes, Sarge.
Bombed last night
And bombed the night before
Gonna be bombed tonight
If we never get bombed anymore
When we're bombed
We're scared as we can be
God strafe the bombing men
From higher Germany
They're over us
They're over us
One shell hole
For just the four of us
Thank your lucky stars
There are no more of us
'Cause one of us
Could fill it all alone
Gassed last night
And gassed the night before
Going to get gassed tonight
If we never get gassed anymore
When we're gassed
We're sick as we can be
'Cause phosgene and mustard gas
Is much too much for me
They're warning us
They're warning us
One respirator for the four of us
Thank your lucky stars
That three of us can run
So one of us can use it all alone
Hey, Sarge.
Right, lads, on your feet! Attention!
It's me cousin Bertie, the only officer in the family.
Have you got the trench consolidated, Sergeant?
All present and correct, sir.
Except we lost Mr Laver, sir.
That's bad.
Major Mallory wants to have a word with the men.
You can stand the men at ease, Sergeant.
Stand at ease!
Shell attack!
On your feet, lads.
Come on! Jump to it!
You can let the men smoke if they want to.
Right, sir.
The major says you can smoke, but don't let me catch you.
Now, you men,
I've just come from having a powwow with the Colonel.
We think you've done some damn fine work.
We congratulate you.
I know you've had it pretty hard the last few days, bombs, shells and snipers.
We haven't escaped scot-free back at staff either, I can tell you.
Anyway, we're all here...
Well, not all of us of course, and that gas of ours was rather nasty, damn wind changing.
Yes, indeed, sir.
But these mishaps do happen in war, and gas can be a war-winning weapon.
Anyway, so long as we can all keep smiling, you're white men all.
Sector all tidy now, Smith?
We've buried most of the 2nd Yorks and Lancs, sir.
Still a few DLI's and the men from our own company left.
I see.
Well, look, let the lads drum up some cha.
- Look out!
- Look out, sir!
Good God.
Stretcher bearers!
Stretcher bearers! Stretcher bearers!
You have no stretcher bearers over there?
No. I'm afraid they went in the last attack, sir.
I'm waiting for reliefs from HQ.
Oh, well, they're stout chaps.
Yes. You better let the men keep under cover.
Thank you, sir.
Take cover!
Damn place still reeks of decomposing bodies.
I'm afraid it's unavoidable, sir.
The trench was mainly full of Jerries.
Yes, of course.
You were more or less sharing the same frontline
- for a couple of days, werert you?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, well.
- Carry on, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.
Ye gods. What's that?
It's a Jerry, sir.
What?
It's a leg, sir.
Well, get rid of it, man.
You can't have an obstruction sticking out of the parapet like that.
Yes, sir.
- Sergeant Smith.
- Sir.
Remove the offending limb.
We can't do that, sir.
It's holding up the parapet.
Besides, we've just consolidated the position.
Yes, well, you heard what the Major said. Just get a shovel and hack it off.
Right, Bertie, sir.
Where the bloody hell am I going to hang me equipment now?
Right, lads! Brew up!
Get yourselves some cha!
Smithey.
Johnny's regiment's doing rather well for themselves.
Champagne, dear?
Let me give you a glass of wine.
There you are.
Field Marshal Sir John French,
Commander in Chief of the British Expeditionary Force.
Wasrt that Sir Douglas Haig, the new man?
Damned upstart.
That other blighter Robertsors here, too.
Intrigue upon intrigue.
General Sir William Robertson,
Chief of the Imperial General Staff!
Willy, I'm so thrilled to hear about your new appointment.
One takes these things as they come, you know.
Sir Henry Wilsors green with envy.
Quite.
Talk of the devil.
I've nothing against Robertson personally, but to make him CIGS is absolute disaster.
I'm sure Haig doesn't think so.
Well, of course he doesn't.
Now Haig can do exactly as he likes.
I can see that perfectly well.
General Sir Douglas Haig,
Commander of the British First Army, and Lady Haig.
Canter in the row before breaffast
- tomorrow morning, Dorothy?
- Lovely.
Don't forget the fitting for your new boots, Douglas.
Yes.
By the way, we're lunching at Number 10, without Sir John French.
Congratulations, my dear.
It's wise to remember
Haig has powerful friends.
What on earth do they see in him?
Shoots pheasant with the Prince of Wales.
Lady Dorothy was one of Queen Alexandra's
- maids of honour.
- Was she?
So now, of course, he has the ear of the King.
Haig?
Sir Douglas Haig. That name's familiar.
Whisky.
Trade?
Afraid so.
Remember Geoffrey?
He was Ralph's ADC in Delhi.
Of course.
Excuse me, sir.
May I ask Lady Haig to dance?
I should be delighted.
Could we have a few words together, Douglas?
The trouble is that people back here just don't realise there's a war on.
That's why we need conscription.
Well, I've just volunteered.
Oh, wonderful. Congratulations.
What for?
The VAD.
The uniform is so becoming.
I wish there were more people like you.
I will tell you in confidence, my dear.
His Majesty very much hopes that my husband will succeed Sir John French.
My God.
Douglas has always felt that French was quite unsuitable to the position.
What do you think of French's little lady friend?
Rank outsider.
Is she?
He's always been very generous with the ladies.
I heard he once borrowed rather a lot of money from you.
He was commander of my cavalry brigade at the time.
Damn bad form.
Appalling.
Haig.
Sir John.
Do you know Mrs...
Comrades
Comrades
Ever since they were boys
Sharing each other's sorrows
Sharing each other's joys
The right man in the right job, if I may say so, sir.
You may. You may. Thank you, my man.
To friends in sunshine and shadow.
- What? What?
- Hear, hear.
Well, Douglas, how did you leave the men at the front?
Oh, in fine heart, sir.
Just spoiling for a fight.
Makes one feel very proud.
Tell me, Douglas, what do you think of this fellow, Kitchener?
Well, sir...
Yes, yes.
A perfectly howling rotter.
You're far too nice to say so.
He's only a damned politician, and he behaves like some damned generalissimo.
You know he turned up in Paris in his uniform?
My God.
The fellow's got no right to a uniform at all.
I mean, he's Secretary of State for War.
What happened?
Well, it raised some pretty ticklish points of protocol.
We'll have to do something about him.
I mean, he's more dangerous than the whole of the damned
German General Staff.
What?
Johnny.
Mrs...
Johnny.
Excuse me. They're playing my tune.
How did Haig get where he is?
Didrt you tell me he failed the staff college-entrance examinations?
- Duke of Cambridge.
- What?
Friend of the family.
Oh, yes, of course.
On her side.
They waived the formalities and let him in.
He's quite bright, though.
Thorough sort of chap.
Ambitious, of course, but means well.
You off, Henry?
- Afraid so, Douglas.
- So soon?
We hope to see you next weekend at Isabel's.
Lovely.
Do come along, dear, or we shall never get home.
- Good night, Douglas.
- Good night, Henry.
I'm quite sure we've met before, but I can't remember where.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Julius.
Frankly, I'm quite looking forward to the new year.
Hurs on his last legs.
- It should all be over in a few months.
- Yes.
By the way, Douglas, pity about that letter to The Times.
After all, you did capture Loos, hmm?
Yes. I could have done with some more support.
Well, I mean, you can always count on mine.
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.
- Good night, Douglas.
- Good night, Johnny.
Sir John French's carriage!
Sir John French's carriage!
That mars a terrible intriguer.
You've been loyal long enough, my dear.
Well...
Number 10 tomorrow, Dorothy.
And a Field Marshal's job for you.
Sir Douglas Haig's carriage!
Sir Douglas Haig's carriage!
Hush.
Hush.
Here comes a whizzbang.
Hush
Here comes a whizzbang
Now, you soldier men
Get down those stairs
Down in your dugouts
And say your prayers
Hush
Here comes a whizzbang
And it's making straight for you
Look out!
And you'll see all the wonders
Of no-man's-land
If a whizzbang
Hits you
Hush
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang
Hush
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang
Now, you soldier men
Get down those stairs
Down in your dugouts
And say your prayers
Hush
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang
And it's making straight for you
And you'll see all the wonders
Of no-mars-land
If a whizzbang
Hits you
Come on now. Do us a Charlie Chaplin.
Come on. Let's see you do it.
And you'll see all the wonders
Of no-mars-land
If a whizzbang hits you
Gentlemen.
Germany has shot her bolt.
The prospects for 1916 are excellent.
Permission to speak, sir.
Of course.
If we continue in this way, the line of trenches will stretch from Switzerland to the sea.
Neither we nor the Germans will be able to break through.
The war will end in complete stalemate.
Nonsense.
We need only one more big offensive to break through and win.
My troops are of fine quality and especially trained for this type of war.
This is not war, sir. It is slaughter.
God is with us.
It is for King and Empire.
We are sacrificing lives at the rate of
5,000 to sometimes 50,000 a day.
Intensive bombardment, superior morale.
Just one more battle.
Sir, tell us what to do, and by God, we'll do it.
We're going to walk through the enemy lines.
Try this one, Dickie.
Cor, this is a good one, Grandpa.
Come on, Dickie, love.
They're all the same.
Come on.
Let me look at this one, please.
There's a long, long trail a-winding
Into the land of my dream
Where the nightingales are singing
And a white moon beams
There's a long, long night of waiting
Until my dreams all come true
Till the day when I'll be going...
- Name?
- Connor.
- Chellis.
- Holland.
- Littman.
- Horace.
Complete victory.
The destruction of German militarism.
Victory march on Berlin.
Slow, deliberate fire is being maintained on the enemy positions.
At this moment, my men are advancing across no-mars-land in full pack, dressing from left to right.
The men are forbidden, under pain of court-martial, to take cover in any shell hole or dugout.
Their magnificent morale will cause the enemy to flee in confusion.
The attack will be driven home with the bayonet.
I feel that every step I take is guided by the divine will.
This is most unsatisfactory.
Where are the Sherwood Foresters?
This is the latest position.
- Whisky, sir?
- Thank you.
Where are the East Lancs on the right?
Out in no-mars-land.
They're sluggish from too much sitting in the trenches.
Most of them, sir, will never rise again.
We must break through.
Regardless of loss, sir?
The loss of, say, another 300,000 men may lead to really great results...
We lost 30,000 men before lunchtime yesterday, sir.
...and will not impede our ability to continue the offensive.
In any case, we have to calculate on another great offensive next year.
If the slackers on the home front see it our way, sir.
Quite.
We are rather short of men, sir.
Oh? What's left?
The new chappies from Ireland have just arrived.
I see.
They are a wild, untrained lot.
Still, they'll be raring to have a crack at the Boche.
They've only just got off the train.
Most haven't eaten for 48 hours, sir.
They're moving against a weakened and demoralised enemy.
What they lack in training, they'll make up for in gallantry.
Capture the German line without further delay.
I think we made it.
Where are we, Sarge?
I reckon we've broken into a bit of a lull.
Yeah.
Nice, ain't it?
Aye. And peaceful.
Sniper.
I'd keep under cover if I were you.
Trouble is we've been fighting too well.
We've arrived ahead of ourselves.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's that, Sarge?
What's what?
It's somebody shouting.
Hey, look.
There's some fellow in that shell hole over there.
- Where?
- There! Do you see him?
There.
Back!
Come back!
Is it one of our boys?
Can't tell from here. Too far away.
He must have got it in the last attack.
Does he want any help then?
No. He's telling us to get the hell back out of here.
Jesus, that's easier said than done.
You can say that again.
Keep down, Seamus.
- Did you see that one?
- It came from our boys!
- Hey, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
Now look what you've done.
You bloody idiots.
- Seamus.
- Sarge.
You're the fastest on your pins.
Nip back to HQ.
Tell the artillery to save their shells for the Jerry, and tell them to raise their bloody sights a bit.
- Back through all that lot?
- Aye, sure.
Why, it's hardly nothing at all.
- Bring us back a couple of wee girls.
- Good luck, lad!
Good luck, Seamus!
Well, somebody's got to go.
Come on. Who's next?
- I don't mind, Sarge.
- Right.
Tell them there's hundreds of us stranded up here in this ridge.
- And, Driscoll...
- Eh?
Watch it.
I'll do that.
Good luck, buddy.
If he's been shot now, I'll kill him.
He has, Sarge.
Well, I think it's best if we all stick together in the one spot.
They've started shelling for the next attack, Sarge!
Sit tight, lads.
We're out of the war now, boys.
Good morning, Mrs Howard.
Been at church today?
Well, I think we'll start.
I don't think we're going to need the umbrellas.
Now, before I talk to you,
I should like to read you a letter from George Bernard Shaw to my mother.
Aye, aye, aye.
- Does your father know?
- He says,
"The men of our country
"are being sacrificed by the blunders of boobies,
"the cupidity of capitalists,
"the ambition of conquerors,
"the lusts and lies and rancours
"of blood thirsts who love the war
"because it opens their prison doors
"and sets them on the throne of power and popularity."
Now give us a song!
For the second time, peace is being offered to the sorely tired people of the civilised world!
I don't like the title.
At the close of 1915,
President Wilson offered an immediate armistice to be followed by a peace conference.
Don't think much of the words, neither.
And in April of this year,
Germany herself proposed peace.
How do you know?
Got friends over there?
The exact terms of Germany's offer have never been made known to us, and I should like to ask Lloyd George what his war aims are.
And I should like to ask you what your old man has for dinner.
The politicians chatter like imbeciles while civilisation bleeds to death.
Now you're talking like a traitor.
Pacifists is traitors.
I ask this gentleman...
Don't ask me. I don't know nothing.
I'm stupid.
...to consider the plight of the civilised world after another year.
You do not know what you do.
And the statesmen wash their hands of the whole affair.
Why don't you wash your face?
Old Douglas Haig's got them on the run!
He's got them going!
Who tells you this?
The newspapers.
Who refuse to publish the pacifist letters, who distort the facts about our so-called victories.
We are killing off, slowly but surely, the best in the male population!
Here, don't you address them words to me!
The sons of Europe are being crucified on the barbed wire because you misguided masses are crying out for it!
- Her boy's at the front!
- My boy's at the front!
War cannot be won!
No one can win a war.
Is it your wish this war will go on and on until Germany is beaten into the ground?
Rule, Britannia Britannia rules the waves
Britons, never, never, never shall be slaves
Rule, Britannia Britannia rules the waves
Britons, never, never, never shall be slaves
I don't want to go to war
I'd rather stay at home
Around the streets to roam
And live on the earnings of a lady typist
I don't want a bayonet in me belly
I don't want me bollocks shot away
I'd rather stay in England
In merry, merry England
And fornicate me bleeding life away
Now, then, my lads, move along there.
No need to make a nuisance of yourselves.
Well, where can we go, eh?
My sister-in-law Flo's place.
Your sister-in-law Flo will talk about food rationing.
Then we go round to the boozer, and old Charlie will talk about the zeppelins.
Then we go down the street, and I'll say...
I'll say, "What shall we do?"
And you say,
"Let's go to my sister-in-law Flo's place."
And we get down there, and she'll tell us all about the food rationing.
Then we go round to the boozer for a pint, and old Charlie...
Oh, I wish I was back with the bleeding battalion!
Parlez-vous

Halt!
Left turn!
Put down arms!
Stand at ease!
Stand easy!
Hey, Corp!
You reinforcements?
Yeah. We're on our way up to Wipers.
Wouldrt go up there if I were you.
They've got a shortage.
What of? Ammunition?
No. Coffins.
Parade, attention!

Hello. GOC-in-C here.
Clear the line, please.
Has the 8th Division moved up on the right?
I see. Severe casualties.
No. You must reserve the artillery.
We're using too many shells.
Well, where is the 8th Division?
What?
I must have the 8th Division forward on the right.
Thank you.
"70% casualties in the last attack.
"Then there is some corner of a foreign field that is forever England."
Forward Joe Soap's army
Marching without fear
With our old commander
Safely in the rear
He boasts and skites from morn till night
And thinks he's very brave
But the men who really did the job
Are dead and in their grave

Marching without fear
With our old commander
Safely in the rear
Amen
Take up your places! Straight through!
Dearly beloved brethren.
I'm sure you will be glad to hear the news from the home front.
The Archbishop of Canterbury has made it known that it is no sin to labour for war on the Sabbath.
And I'm sure you would also like to know that the Chief Rabbi has absolved your Jewish brethren from abstaining from pork in the trenches.
Likewise, his holiness the Pope has ruled that the eating of flesh on Friday is no longer a mortal sin.
- It's high time we had an Irish pope.
- You're right.
And in faraway Tibet, the Dalai Lama has placed his prayers at the disposal of the allies.
Now, brethren, tomorrow being Good Friday, we hope God will look kindly on our attack.
We will now sing from
Hymns Ancient and Modern.
Number 358.
The Church's one foundation
We are the ragtime infantry
We cannot fight
We cannot shoot
What bleeding use are we?
And when we get to Berlin
To be his holy bride
And from his lot
What a bloody rotten lot
Are the ragtime infantry
Amen
Let us pray.
O God, show thy face to us as thou didst with thy angel at Mons.
The choir will now sing
What a Friend We Have in Jesus, as we offer a silent prayer for success in tomorrow's onslaught.
- Amen.
- Amen.
When this lousy war is over
What a friend we have in Jesus
No more soldiering for me
All our sins and griefs to bear
When I get my ciwy clothes on
What a privilege to carry
Oh, how happy I shall be
Everything to God in prayer
No more church parades on a Sunday
Oh, what peace we often forfeit
No more putting in for leave
Oh, what needless pain we bear
I shall kiss the Sergeant Major
All because we do not carry
- How I'll miss him
- All to God
- In prayer
- How he'll grieve
Amen
Well, God, the prospects for a successful attack are now ideal.
I place myself in your hands.
Land of our birth.
Land of our birth.
The fields are full of tents, O Lord, all empty as yet except for unmade and naked iron bedsteads.
Every ward has been cleared to make way for the wounded that will be arriving when the big push comes.
The doctors say there will be enormous numbers of dead and wounded, God.
I ask thee for victory, Lord, before the Americans arrive.
That we may bring, if need arise, no maimed or won'thless sacrifice.
O Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.
Parade, by squads!
Dismissed!
F squad, attention!
My troop, attention!
Whiter than the whitewash on the wall
Whiter than the whitewash on the wall
Oh, wash me in the water that you wash your dirty daughter in
And I shall be whiter than the whitewash on the wall
On the wall, on the wall
Oh, wash me in the water that you wash your dirty daughter in
And I shall be whiter than the whitewash on the wall
Quick march! Left, right, left, right!
Oh, wash me in the water that you wash your dirty daughter in
And I shall be whiter than the whitewash on the wall
On the wall, on the wall
On the wall, on the wall
O Lord, I beg you.
Do not let this dreadful war cause all the suffering that we have prepared for.
I know you will answer my prayer.
I want to go home
I want to go home
I don't want to go in the trenches no more
Where whizzbangs and shrapnel
They whistle and roar
Take me over the sea
Where the alleyman can't get at me
Oh my, I don't want to die
I want to go home
Take me over the sea
Where the alleyman can't get at me
Oh my, I don't want to die
I want to go home
I thank you, God.
The attack is a great success.
Fighting has been severe, but that was to be expected.
There has been some delay along the Menin Road, but the ground is thick with enemy dead.
First reports from the clearing stations state that our casualties are only some 60,000, mostly slight.
The wounded are very cheery indeed.
Well, that's the lot, then.
Right. Lead them off, Corporal Smith!
Right. Let's get back to the truck, lads.
Lead on this file.
Forward!
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling
For you but not for me
And the little devils how they sing-a-ling-a-ling
For you but not for me
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling-a-ling
Oh grave, thy victory?
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling

For you but not for me
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Sir, I've been wondering...
Or rather, the staff and I have been wondering, perhaps this policy of attrition might be a mistake.
After all, it's wearing us down more than it is them.
Couldrt we increase our efforts on other fronts?
Nonsense. The Western Front is the only real front.
We must grind them down.
You see, our population is greater than theirs, and their losses are greater than ours.
I don't quite follow that, sir.
In the end, they will have 5,000 men left and we shall have 10,000, and we shall have won.
In any case,
I intend to launch one more full-scale offensive.
And we shall break through and win.
Rum ration.
Old soldiers never die
The young ones wish they would
Those poor bastards still moaning out in no-mars-land.
Somebody ought to do something about it.
It's terrible, terrible.
Sounds like a bleeding cattle market.
Right. Wakey-wakey. On your feet.
The order's come through for the attack.
We kick off at 5:00 ack-emma.
Right! Move!
That's a bloody fine time, isn't it?
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind
Though he's just a bloody sod
Let him take the bleeding lot
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind
Never mind
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind
Though the blasted sandbags fly
You have only once to die
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind
Never mind
Right. Come on, lads. Come on.
If you get stuck on the wire
- Never mind
- Never mind
If you get stuck on the wire
- Never mind
- Never mind
Though the light's as broad as day
When you die they stop your pay
If you get stuck on the wire
Never mind
Oh, never mind
Far far from Wipers, I long to be
Where German snipers can't get at me
Damp is my dugout, cold are my feet
Waiting for whizzbangs to send me to sleep
Sir! 5:00 ack-emma, sir.
- Press the attack immediately.
- Sir.
If you want the old battalion
We know where they are
We know where they are
We know where they are
If you want the old battalion
We know where they are
They're hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them, we've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them, we've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them, we've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them, we've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
We've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire
Right! Over the top, boys!
Come on, now, fast as you can!
Come on, lads.
'Our counteroffensive commenced this morning.
'Satisfactory progress.
'Yesterday, the King inspected the troops.
'Trouble was
'that the men waved their hats instead of flags
'as His Majesty rode by.
'The King did clutch the reins too firmly... '
Correction.
The King did clutch the reins rather firmly, no reflection on
His Majesty's horsemanship.
The grass was very slippery, and the mare moved backwards.
I'd exercised her every day for a year.
So unfortunate it had to be my horse that threw the King.
They've all gone.
They've all been killed.
No, they haven't.
They're just under cover.
- Where are you going?
- Forward.
It's no use staying here.
You've got to keep moving forward.
Look, as soon as the next shell bursts in front of us,
- you follow me into the hole. Right?
- Right.
Why don't our gunners do something about that bleeding machine gun?
They are doing something.
They just haven't hit him yet.
Let's have a try with one of these.
I'd like to catch that bleeder who threw that bleeding smoke bomb.
I can't see a bleeding thing.
Far far from Wipers, I long to be
Where German snipers can't get at me
This is the life, eh, Sarge?
Damp is my dugout, cold are my feet
Waiting for whizzbangs to send me to sleep
I must have drawn you in a sweep.
- I've had enough of this.
- Yeah, me and all.
Let's get that bleeding machine gun.
- They're just as scared as we are.
- All right.
Where do you reckon you're going?
Just to have a crack at that gun, Sarge.
All right. Careful, now.
- I'll give you covering fire.
- Right.
- See you after the war, Sarge.
- Yeah, at your sister-in-law Flo's place.
- About 8:00.
- Make it half-past.
- What?
- I might be a bit late!
Right.
Right.
You can close the battle of the Somme now.
The final British losses are 607,784 officers and men.
- And the French losses, sir?
- They are still to come.
And ground gained, nil.
'Thank you for the copy of The Times.
'I'm glad that in spite of all, it is still a victory.
'lt does not seem so here.
'lt is beyond belief, the butchery.
'The men look so appalling when they are brought in,
'and so many die.'
They were summoned from the hillside
They were called in from the glen
And the country found them ready
At the stirring call for men
Let no tears add to their hardship
As the soldiers pass along
And although your heart is breaking
Make it sing this cheery song
Keep the home fires burning
While your hearts are yearning
Though the lads are far away
They dream of home
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining
Turn the dark cloud inside out
Till the boys come home
Come along, Harry, lad.
Have to move you onto the ground now.
Need the stretcher, see?
There's a casualty list up.
I wonder who's on it.
Excuse me, love.
Hey, there's another Arkwright again.
Oh, I never did.
Hey, Milly, another Arkwright gone.
Yeah. I know her.
- That's three she's lost.
- No, four.
No, three.
They're bringing them back at night now.
What is it?
It's just another list, Flo.
- Ethel's boy's just been let out of prison.
- Why?
- There's another big push coming.
- Oh, never.
Ask Flo. She's in munitions.
They're always first to know.
Is that true, then?
It's true. It's starting again.
Don't worry, love, your Jack will be all right.
- Can't go on much longer now, can it?
- Of course not.
Must be rotten for you working down there.
- It's not bad.
- I wouldn't like it, all those men.
Our old foremars bad enough.
One girl earned £3 last week with overtime.
- Go on.
- It's true.
They're paying a fortune.
They need to, after that explosion last week.
Never found nothing of them, did they?
We're going on overtime next week.
What you making?
Big new order's coming.
It's funny stuff, they say it's for shrouds.
- Oh, it makes you shiver.
- Milly.
What's that?
It's the Yankees!
Come on.
Over there
Over there.
- Our infantry...
- Have the reserves been...
The Yanks are coming The Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere
So prepare, say a prayer
Send the word, send the word to beware
We'll be over, we're coming over
And we won't come back
We'll be buried over there
Hello, Ben.
- Who's that, then?
- Smithey. Jack Smith.
Hello, Jack.
- One of Jerry's, eh?
- Yeah.
Must have thought they were staying.
- How are you, mate? All right?
- Fine.
Good to see you.
- What's it like outside?
- They're still strafing.
I'm bloody sick of it.
Do you know where we are?
Mons.
First big battle of the war.
We're right back where we started.
Look at that.
Wouldrt catch me eating it.
My brother Harry, he was at Mons.
They're bloody starving in Germany, you know?
We both were.
I heard the Germans is going Bolshevik.
That's when he got wounded. First time.
They say the German Navy's mutinied.
There's going to be a revolution.
They're just like the Russians.
Right, on your feet. Outside, you lot!
Then he came back again.
Corporal Tanner, he's read this bloke Lenin.
He reckons it's all going to be different.
Well, it's got to be, isn't it?
It stands to reason.
They say the war will end anytime now.
Get your mask on, or you won't live to see it.
Halt!
Right. Come on.
Who the hell are you, then, the unknown soldier?
No, sir, I'm 294, Smith, J.
You'll have to move some. It's 10:58.
You're the last one.
Come on, lad, just follow the tape.
Granny.
Granny, what did Daddy do in the war?
And when they ask us
How dangerous it was
Oh, we'll never tell them
No, we'll never tell them
We spent our pay in some café
And fought wild women night and day
'Twas the cushiest job we ever had
And when they ask us
And they're certainly going to ask us
The reason why we didn't win
The Croix de Guerre
Oh, we'll never tell them
No, we'll never tell them
There was a front
But damned if we knew where
And they're certainly going to ask us
The reason why we didn't win
The Croix de Guerre
Oh, we'll never tell them
No, we'll never tell them
There was a front
But damned if we knew where
North Africa, September 1942
A darkest hour...
The world watches as Adolf Hitler high stepping Africa Corps sweeps onwards to Egypt and the
Suez Canal while the British, our strength dissipated by defeat make a desperate regroup at
El Alamein.
Two years had passed since the fall of France.
France now officially neutral lives under Nazi domination and the French city of Algiers is a port of embarkation for British, Italian and
German soldiers caught and interned by the French.
Prisoners for deportation.
Forward.
Captain.
Well, Leftenan... bring them aboard.
Faster.
- A Canadian, 5 Italians.
- Come quickly.
Faster, come on.
- All in order, Captain.
- Very good, Lieutenant.
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.
- Beware!
- Fire!
Extinguishers!
Stop!
Back or be shot.
- That one.
- Join us, Commander.
Ain't you forgetting this is neutral territory.
Sorry, we have no tea.
Perhaps you will settle for chocolate?
Not even name, rank and serial number?
Very well.
Name: Donald Craig.
Rank: Major, long range desert group.
Serial numbers 762513.
Born... Montreal.
Studied topography... Quebec, London.
Graduated work... School of Mines
Kensington.
Worked three years for Standard Oil.
Shall I continue... Major?
- What's my mother name?
- Elizabeth.
Father, John Foster Craig, retired and lives in Vancouver.
Your reluctants to talk is understandable.
If I have been force to escape across
300 miles of enemy held desert, and if after all of that...
I've been captured by
French authorities,
I too would be embarassed.
Captian Bergman.
Very British of you, Major.
Before you go any further, take a look at your escort.
I'm sure you can recognised an English fighter when you see one.
Who are you?
Special Identification group.
The G. E. I.
- I thought they were all...
- Jews, Major.
Yes, we are.
German Jews serving with the British.
However as German's, we still have our uses.
French will think this is a Nazi raid.
Have more respect for the enemy, Major.
What's all these? Haven't you seen a bloody airplane before?
Go away!
Lieutenant Boyden, signals.
Welcome to Kufra, Major... such as it is.
- Colonel Harker is expecting you.
- I would hope so, Lieutenant...
I would certainly hope so.
Yes but of course.
Come along... man.
The Colonel's waiting.
Colonel Harker, sir!
Major Craig and Captain Bergman reporting.
Oh... thank you, Boyden.
Captain Bergman. Hello Craig!
Glad you could come.
I'll get right to it.
Sometimes ago you submitted a plan to staff... hardlining a proposed raid on the
German fuel bunkers at Tobruk.
In his infinite wisdom, staff turned my plan down.
Things do have a way of changing, don't they... Major?
Rommel is 90 miles from Suez.
Every shell, every gallon of petrol he gets has to come 300 miles from Tobruk.
The RAF is doing its best but still too much is getting through.
So we're gonna have a go at Rommel source of supplies.
Didn't I said something to... provoke humour?
Staff has a genius for sitting on it's brain and coming up with perfect hindsight.
Would you cared to expand on that?
When I submitted the plan we could have blown up their fuel bunkers with a handful of men.
How in the hell are we supposed to get through their defences now?
Drive through, Major.
Disguised as prisoner of war guarded by
Captain Bergman personal
African Corps.
The plan is still basically yours but now it will be maximum effort land, sea and earth.
Colonel, could you direct me to the nearest bus stop?
We are here...
Tobruk, here.
Your primarily responsibilities is to route our convoy through 800 miles of the west desert the Sahara has to offer right into the back door of Tobruk.
That's why we went to so much trouble and it was no lark, you know... Major, to bring you halfway across
North Africa.
I didn't ask for the trip, Colonel.
- I've been here before.
- Precisely.
Staff believed that your practical knowledge of the terrain is essential on the success of our mission.
That is your job, Major.
Ours begin when we get there.
After we've knocked out their harbour guns installation, we linked up with naval assault troops, destroyed the fuel bunkers and evacuate by sea.
Their heavy guns are here,
Mersa Cove...
- It's suicide.
- It's orders.
- How many days do we have?
- Eight.
Impossible.
Impossible or not, it will be done and on schedule.
Do I make myself clear, Craig?
Welcome aboard, Major Craig.
We don't get many volunteers.
Keep your eyes and ears open around the Jews, little trust all right, there's no point in overdoing it.
Six years in Palestine taught me that.
And for your information,
I'm the genius with perfect hindsight.
Never doubted it, Colonel.
We leave in 1 hour, Lieutenant Boyden will see to your needs.
Major Craig... don't let personal differences of opinion interfered with our operation.
I understand, Colonel.
I liked you to bear one thing in mind when and if we reached Tobruk, my mother didn't raise any heroes.
A bloody work of art, matey but I do say so meself.
Save the Jerry the trouble of repainting if we are taken.
Now, that's a cheery thought.
Handsome.
Come on, get cracking.
Never get the Victoria Cross for admiring yourself.
It's chai cross we're after, sir.
I think Dolan is a feeling a touch of the sand and sun, Major.
You'll be feeling a touch of my boots if you don't hop to.
This is Libya, not London.
Well, damn bloody hell!
Soldiers, get off the vehicle!
Line up, hurry!
Attention, stand still!
Lieutenant, troops in formation.
Ooh... got a cold feeling down the back of me neck just looking at 'em.
What kind of bleeding mission are we going on anyway, sir?
You know when you're supposed to and not before.
Maybe you don't know either,
Sergeant Major.
All right... all right, what is this going on with the lot of you?
Come on now.
Sergeant Major!
Sir!
Do you have your orders regarding my men?
We'll have no dealings with you as soldiers unless otherwise instructed, sir.
See to those orders are complied with,
Sergeant Major.
Sir!
Attention, break ranks!
Taking orders from a ruddy Kraut!
What's this bleeding war coming to?
If my father in Tel Aviv could see me here now, fighting for the British, he would take back my Bar Mitzvah.
War and politics, Mohnfeld.
They're always mix.
There are just the same if he ever finds out. He'll give me an a bris.
Well, now we know how the Italians must feel with their German allies.
And the English will throw us to the wolves just as quick...
If we let them.
Get the men ready, Sergeant.
You got bullets in that thing, mate?
- Talking to the blighty enemy.
- We're supposed to be prisoner...
...Alfie. You know the orders, no fraternizing.
No fraternizing, I just asked him if he's got bullets in that chopper.
I don't want him to take his play acting too much to heart.
An opportunity, he says.
- Who says?
- The judge.
I'm giving you the chance to serve your country and to come back to society as a respectable citizen.
God bless him.
You wouldn't want to be back in London, Alfie... not with all them bombs the Jerry are dropping.
Do us a favour, all they ever did.
It's always been hospitals and churches.
They couldn't hit Brixton prison in a 100 years.
God, it ain't half hot.
Just like being on a roller coaster.
Bruckner!
- Yes!
- Come here.
Enemy column, tanks!
Italian's, sir.
No flanking scouts.
If we were an attack force, they'd have little chance.
They should cleared us by 1000 yards.
Unless they altered directions,
- Lieutenant Boyden.
- Yes, sir.
- I want every man armed and ready.
- Sir!
You know when you come to think of it,
Brixton prison's really a nice place.
You're getting soft in the konk, Alfie.
All 8 feet thick of regular bleeding bomb shelter.
If I could get my hands on that judge...
- Sending innocent to the slaughter.
- Innocent?
I will give something.
The whole damn Sahara and they have to stop here.
- So, Major?
- More company, sir.
Over there... on the other side.
They must be Germans.
The Italians are too fond of comfort to travel this late.
Their sentry hasn't seen them yet.
Take what man you need Bergman and make sure they don't.
Bruckner, come with me.
What do you estimate the range?
2.000 yards, maybe even less.
Twice the reached range of our mortars.
I'll get the range finder.
And prepared mortars.
You all right?
You, okay?
Lieutenant Boyden, sir.
You don't mind me asking...
What's the old man up to now?
A lovely scheme, Alfie.
A lovely scheme.
He's going to start a bit of fighting between the Italians and the Germans.
How's he going to do that, sir?
First we open fire on the Germans, then our mortars hit the Italians.
Now the Italians see the German's column and vice-versa.
So both of them got to thinking it's the British army on the other side that's doing all the firing, you see.
And you got themselves a bloody battle going.
Right.
- Blimey, you think we'll make it sir?
- Know any good prayer, Alfie?
Range?
Eight hundreds.
- Sergeant Major....
- Sir.
- Tell Mr Boyden to open fire.
- Sir.
Gentlemen, it's time we're moving.
It's like a bloody furnace.
Cheer up, it could get worse.
What's the devil are you doing?
We're making excellent time on the flats, why head into this area?
We leave our calling card back there in the wadi, Colonel, the Germans bound to find.
Exactly why speed is our best advantage.
They know that too.
That's why they'll spending the major part of their times guarding Kalafsho Flats while we cut through here.
Do you realised what you're suggesting, Major?
Yes, sir!
- That's a German minefield.
- That's right.
Where they're not likely to looks for us.
I don't like it.
We're turning around.
Do that Colonel and you'll reached Tobruk as a real prisoner.
It's out of the question.
Colonel Harker you went to an awful lot of trouble to shanghai me in on this mission.
If you're not going to follow my advise, what the hell am I doing here?
You can't take heavy transport through that without mine detector.
Why are you telling me?
You brought me along to tell you.
All right... Major, tell me.
Thank you, sir.
Bring up the half-track.
This time of the year, the wind is from the south.
It blows for months at a time forming a sand cushion at the base of the slope.
By keeping to the slope the deep sand will act as a pillow dispersing our weight.
Our heaviest pieces of half-track can make it, the others can.
I know the lorries wheel will bogged down but the half-track with it's track can maneuver.
But how do you propose to get the lorries through?
This is an old mine field, Colonel.
The sand covering the mines had plenty of times to settle.
By keeping to the slopes,
I will be able to see the depression over the mines.
So you intend to clear the way and pied piper us through?
That's right.
- Sergeant Major Tyne!
- Sir!
Bring a drum from the lorries with branches and camouflage
- to wipe out our tracks.
- Sir.
It may not be so simple.
The Germans often set their mines at tandem.
Tried to move one and you could take out a dozen.
It's very effective. That's why the rest of you will wait behind me.
Behind us, Major.
You can't drive and watch those depression of yours.
Suit yourself.
You're the one who volunteer.
Go to the left.
Stay to the left. It's digging in.
Goes any deeper we're going to blow up your whole theory.
To the high side.
Stop!
- Wait here.
- My pleasure!
He looks so calm, you think he was planting daisies.
You know one wrong tickle with that bayonet and we will be pushing up the daisies.
Does he expect to dig up the whole damn Sahara on his own?
- Sergeant Major Tyne.
- Sir.
Get some men with bayonets and follow me, will you?
Sir.
What have you got your fingers in your ears for?
What have you got your
- fingers in your ears for?
- I can't stand the sight of blood.
Then why don't you put your hands over your eyes?
Well, I want to see what's going on, don't I?
- I've got some men coming up.
- That won't be necessary.
Give that first one a burst, Bergman.
Down!
It's just our luck to strike oil.
Next one.
- We can move on down, Colonel.
- Let me drive.
We can move on then.
They didn't teach us that at Sandhurst, sir.
Look out the
Bungalore torpedo, Boyden.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Get cracking, there's a schedule to keep.
All right, Boyle?
Any complaints?
How about some more sugar for the cocoa, Sergeant Major?
You've had your rations that you need.
- Grub all right?
- It's wonderful.
- Any complaints?
- No, sir.
- Grub all right?
- Lovely.
- How's your arm?
- Oh, fine.
- Make good use of it, boy.
- All right.
Sir.
- Trouble?
- Carburation's off.
I'll say one thing for the Germans, they certainly know how to build an engine.
It doesn't cost much, either, when they use slave labor.
Two hundred Jew power, Major.
We all know what's going on in Europe.
Well, if you do, if you really do, there must be a little of the Jew in you.
They say there's a little of the Jew in everyone.
Jah, a little of the Nazi, too.
Your war's going to last a lot longer than mine, Captain.
It's 2000 years old now.
For the first time since Jesus, you begin to think and feel as a people.
Days of the wandering Jew are coming to an end.
We're going home.
- Palestine?
- Israel, Major.
Israel.
It's where we begin.
Anyone looking for trouble in the future, will know where to find us.
Good evening, Major.
Take cover!
- You bleedy fool!
- We're British!
Open fire!
- Sergeant Major Tyne.
- Sir!
Formed burial party and see to the wounded.
Sir!
You four, over here... on the double!
Come on, move!
We be moving since the burial parties is finished.
Why waste the time? A few bit of sand won't make any difference.
- You heard the order.
- That smoke can be seen for miles.
Look Bergman, if you have any complaints take them to the Colonel.
Or find yourself a rabbi.
It's no use, sir. It's had it.
- The emergency transmitter?
- It's dead, it was in lorry 3.
Our orders were not to break silence except in an emergency.
Cairo will assumed we're proceeding as schedule.
Let's see that we do.
Tuareg.
Hold your fire.
There's one there's more.
Wouldn't be the first time
- they attack a column.
- English column.
This column is currently listed as German.
Craig.
I'll find out what he wants.
Sergeant... your tunic and cap.
They have 2 prisoners. They want guns.
Blast!
We've to go along.
It wouldn't look right otherwise.
German's prisoners.. it's all we need.
Craig.
Agreed!
Cover me.
Krug.
Look at them.
Wish I had me rifle.
Cor, I wish I had me camera.
Trust an Arab to argue.
And if you are not interested, we will take your heads.
Peace be to you.
Well, what was that little display all about?
A bargaining point, Colonel.
He'll settled for 10 rifles and some ammunitions.
The prisoners?
British?
Father and daughter.
They wanted to be taken to the Germans.
It's absolutely essential we reached
Cairo as quickly as possible.
If we don't this campaign as well as the war itself would be vitally affected.
You expect me to believe this from someone found wandering in the desert?
Father and I left
Von Hellstern's headquarter in Benghazi three nights ago.
We would to be dropped outside
Cairo and met by a resident agent's.
Our plane had to make a force landing.
The pilot was killed.
Poor chap broke his neck when we hit.
The tribemen found us the following day.
Well, if you are to say who you are, certainly you agent's had some means of identification.
There! Signed by
Field Marshall Kesselring acting for the Führer himself.
That paper is an agreement between the Reich and a group of important Egyptian army officers.
For certain considerations they will arise against the
British in a holy war... Jihad.
The signature and seal beared all the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.
One of the most powerful men in the Muslim's world.
With Egypt on our side, we have every reasons to believe the rest of the Muslim's world would follow.
Captain, the Turks alone could put
4 millions men into the war against Russia.
Exactly, and once Rommel takes Cairo, the army of the Grand Mufti will moved against the British.
If you'll only contact Benghazi,
Captain... they can have a plane here within hours.
Regrettably our radio was destroyed.
- By a British fighter.
- Then you must provide a vehicle.
And escort us immediately to the nearest base.
Are you presuming Herr Portman to give orders to a German officer?
- But I explained.
- That you did.
And now, you will leave the rest to me.
Our destination is Tobruk.
And that's our nearest base.
Make our guests comfortable, Mohnfeld.
Of course, Captain.
Mohnfeld.
Odd name for a German officer?
We can't all be named Schmidt,
Fraulein Portman.
We've been awared of an anti-royalist faction in the Egpytian military but this...
I'll do the honours, gentlemen.
That uniform is a disguise, Bergman, don't carry it too far.
Shooting the girl wouldn't trouble the Nazi's.
If that's what bother you, Colonel.
What bothers me is going into action with officers who make rash and thoughtless move.
Portman's think this is a German column transporting British prisoners.
I want him to continue in that believe.
When we reached Tobruk,
Colonel, what then?
This paper and the Portman's guarantee our entry.
Is that all, Colonel?
No, Captain Bergman, that is not all.
While you served under me I'll expect you to conduct youself as a British officer.
You'll at all times obey my orders no matter how disagreeable it may seem to you.
That is all, Captain.
I can understand his feelings.
You flattered yourself, Major.
Their only emotions are based on percentages.
Eight men were killed today.
Five of them were Bergman's.
How does that fit into your percentages?
Craig!
Dismissed!
May I tell you something, Colonel?
You may.
You're a real joy!
Come on then sit-up.
Four.
Three.
One.
Good evening, Corporal.
I think I'll take a short walk.
- Goodnight, Corporal.
- Goodnight.
At 13:00 tomorrow we move on Tobruk.
If all goes well, we should be in position to take the harbour defense guns by 20:00 hours.
Our attack coincides with the massive raid by the RAF.
At 21:30, naval units will shell the harbour, while assault troops come ashore to link with us.
Our primary objectives,
- are the fuel bunkers here.
- Colonel...
If we can't reached the guns, how do we warn off the navy?
Jerry has a large transmitter here in the central of the city.
Let's hope it won't be necessary.
And if it's necessary, where does that leave us?
We revert to your original plan, Major.
Do what damage we can to Rommel's fuel supply, make a run for it.
Well, I don't mind running but to where?
If we're not rescue by sea, we don't get out.
I'm aware of that possibility, Major.
That's why we have an alternative pick-up down the coast at Sollum.
It's a long way to go with the
Germans on our back.
If we're capture it means a POW camp.
What about Bergman's men? They can't let themselves be taken alive.
I'm quite sure that Captain Bergman and his SIG gave that a very careful consideration before they volunteer.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Bergman.
I thought you Jews were supposed to be smart.
Enemy propaganda, mate.
Why in the hell you didn't speak up in there?
What reason?
There's no Geneva Convention for us.
Begin thinking of death and you're no longer sure of your life.
- It's a Hebrew proverb.
- A dead martyr's just another corpse!
What in God's name drive you people.
Perhaps his name is enough.
God and Colonel Harker.
Colonel is a soldier of the old school and has old school attitudes.
He doesn't care much for us.
We don't care much for him.
But he'll be there when we need him.
Let's hope they both will.
Good night, Major.
Don't turn your head.
Who are you?
A friend.
Then why hide?
Listen carefully, my life as well as yours are at stake if we are discovered.
This column is not what you think, Herr Portman.
You mean Captain Bergman and the others are not German?
Jews... SIG.
Their prisoners are commando's.
Member of the long range desert group.
Tobacco.
The tobacco of that sentry was smoking.
Our troops haven't had anything to light since the beginning of the war.
- Who the devil are you?
- That is not important.
Your mission is and these men know about it.
- You must get word to Tobruk.
- But how?
Two kilometres from here due west, you'll will find a myriad of stones in the sand.
Buried in the sand 6 metres north of that marker is a telephone cable connecting
Jalo with Tobruk.
Now...
Turn carefully... and look!
In the cistern you will find the field phone.
A pair of camouflage capes and a weapon.
Very well...
If all this has been arranged, why haven't you send for help?
I cannot miss leaving the camp.
Once you contact Tobruk, they can have an armour column here within hours.
And if I refuse?
The Iron Cross will still be yours.
Posthumously, Herr Portman.
Turn back to the wall.
Do not move for 30 seconds.
At ease!
Bruckner,
A military phone.
An English revolver.
- Take her to the car.
- Yes, Lieutenant.
Wait!
Come forth!
Come on.
- How did they get that telephone?
- It's very simple.
One among us is the enemy.
- Lieutenant.
- Sergeant.
Attention, stand still!
Order your men to unload their weapons.
I must refused to give that order, Colonel.
Sergeant Major Tyne.
Sir!
- Disarmed these men!
- Sir.
You, you and you, come with me.
That's more like it.
I never did trust 'em.
Once a Jerry, always a Jerry.
Once a thief, always a thief.
That right Alfie?
Come off it now.
Who else you think let that damn spy escape?
Captain Bergman, you have 2 hours to deliver your traitor.
Try not to move, miss.
There's a plasma tube in your arm.
- Britwaite...
- Sergeant Major.
Get the Colonel. On the double!
I'll get the M.O!
The message... did you get through?
Answer me!
- You left her alone?
- Sir!
- It's bolted, sir!
- Break it.
No one inside it seem.
Sergeant Major!
- Sir.
- Assistance!
Cyanide, I've seen it often enough.
You'll find your spy right down the shaft, Colonel.
Who is it?
I don't know.
It's very dark down there.
I found the sentry at the cistern... stabbed!
But the traitor was still in the tunnel.
He's dead!
Bruckner.
Impossible, I have known him for 10 years.
You said yourself, the girl died from cyanide.
His suicide tablet gone.
Here... Sergeant Major, look at this!
Cor, what a mess.
It's a diabolical liberty.
You know what they say, Britwaite...
Lightning never struck in the same place twice.
That tunic could be your lucky charm!
That guy can sure bleed,
I can tell you that.
Well, Boyden... what do you think of that?
- Pretty convincing, sir.
- Thank you.
I'd like a word with you, Colonel.
- Excuse us please.
- Sir!
All right Major. Get it off your chest and you'll feel better.
Do you realised what will happen if your men are taken in those uniforms?
They'll be executed.
And that doesn't bother you at all?
It's a calculated and most necessary risks.
I've given orders to return ammunitions to the SIG.
I'm also assigning armed
British troops in German uniform to cover each lorry.
How does Bergman feel about that?
This is not a popularity contest.
I don't give a damn what anybody thinks of my actions, least of all a dozen odd Jews.
No Bruckner, when the chips are down.
You passed judgement on people quickly, don't you?
Just like that and head's are supposed to roll.
Well, I 've never considered dying for a cause no matter how noble.
- And I'm not about to begin now.
- Frightened, Major?
You may have ice water running through your veins, Colonel... but I have blood and
I need every drop of it.
The way I see it, we have
2 chances of coming out of this.
- A poor one and a slim one.
- Yes, Craig.
From the beginning your boundless enthusiam has been an inspiration.
But I'm getting rather weary of being the cross that you've to bear.
Don't flatter yourself, Colonel.
I've trunks full of crosses to bear.
Feeling better, Major?
We leave in 10 minutes.
Head hunters!
Field police.
Is that necessary, Lieutenant?
I hope not, Herr Oberleutnant.
Sorry mate... orders!
Keep pace with them... 50 yards back.
Colonel, this road takes us through
Tobruk and then it branches.
To the right is the prison compound, to the left is Mersa Cove.
Well...
You're an officer, clear the way.
Move away!
Move away!
Congratulation!
Their radio towers behind us.
Colonel, I think I'd like to put in for a transfer.
Half the Africa Corps.
- The foxes done it again.
- While the British lion slept.
Gentlemen, the importance of our mission is even graver than staff realised.
That's doesn't solved the problem, Colonel.
Our men are going to land expecting light opposition and they're gonna run into
Rommel's total reserve strength.
They must be stopped.
We've to take that transmitter.
And alert Jerry, for all we know staff may have scrubbed the mission already.
- So, we just sit back and wait.
- Exactly!
If it has been cancel, we won't have given ourselves away.
What can a handful of men do against 2 full divisions?
We can try, Major.
If those tanks reach El Alamein, the Germans have Egypt.
They may have the lock, but we have the key.
Without fuel, Jerry goes nowhere!
You don't look too well, Major.
Not surprised to hear it.
We'll have to have a word with the admiralty about this.
I thought Tobruk was the name of a blockade.
Someone forgot to tell the Germans.
There's our objective.
Rommel's underground fuel dumps.
Easy to see why aircraft had such little effect.
We've located the communications cable.
The bunker can be cut off from the city anytime.
While we go for the guns, two detachments will take out those pillboxes.
Right on schedule.
Right into a meat grinder.
- Boyden, the air raid's your cover.
- Sir.
Take what men you need and go for the Jerry's transmitter.
Send an open signal to Cairo. Cancel landing, repeat... cancel landing.
And advise staff of the
Kesselring paper.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Harker.
If Lieutenant Boyden should be stopped, he doesn't speak German.
- Volunteering, Mohnfeld?
- It would improve his chances, sir.
To the air raid shelter.
Stretchers. Make room.
Make way!
Come on, move... come!
Well done.
Harry, are you all right?
Oh yeah, I'm lovely.
Let's do it again.
That's more like it, my boy. Come on!
Sir...
Sir...
He's dead.
Hurry up, it will be all over us in a minute. Lift him up.
Pry open the door.
- Got him?
- Yes.
Quick, in here!
Quick. Take cover.
Everyone, come on, quickly!
Leave him.
They have succesfully hit headquarters.
Stretchers.
Cor, that was a whisker away.
- What do we do now, Alfie?
- Good question, mate.
First of all, unload these Jerry uniforms.
My mama didnt bring me up to be shot as a bloody spy.
Dear God!
What's the matter, you hurt?
I'm dead and gone to heaven, tell her. Look in there!
Here look, English pound notes.
Millions of them!
British paymaster wrappers, Alfie.
The Jerries must've grabbed it when they took Tobruk from our boys.
Well, we better grab it back then.
Here now, wait a minute.
You've got it wrong.
We weren't going to nick this money--
We're up next, Major.
It's 21:30.
Do you think Boyden got through?
We're under attack!
Quickly, to your posts!
Landing is still on, the buzzers are coming in.
- Sergeant Tyne.
- Sir!
Take the half-track and four men up the approach road.
Use the oil's lamp to turn those barges back.
Keep flashing as long as you can, Jack.
- It's our last chance.
- Sir.
- Come in, come in?
- What's happening?
- The line is dead.
- Try again.
It's not working.
Satchel charge.
- What's happening here?
- Outside!
- Flare pistol.
- Sir.
Good try, sir.
- Seems to lost the old magic wand.
- Regroup now.
Heil Hitler!
- Colonel Harker.
- Craig.
- They're coming in.
- Get down to the beach!
They're gonna need all the help they can get.
Take cover!
Jerries!
Half-track! Open fire!
Get the bastards.
They're turning back.
- The Sergeant Major got through.
- Thank God.
Take cover under the cliffs!
Bloody tanks!
They would have chopped our barges to pieces.
Take a look!
We're just not going anywhere with those damn tanks out there.
They've pinned us here until their infantry moves in.
I think I can get up there, Colonel.
Still determined to be a martyr, aren't you?
I never did believe we'd get through this so long.
Besides, German hospitality does not appeal to me.
You pull those tanks... and I'll give you the fuel bunkers as a going-away present.
Best job I've had all day.
Krug.
I'll take three men.
The rest of you stay here with Major Craig.
Shalom!
Shalom, Captain.
I wish you luck, Bergman.
I mean it.
We're both going to need it, Colonel.
But don't steal any from mine.
I'm going back up!
Mazeltov.
Look!
They're coming down!
Watch out. Cover the rear!
All right lads, at the double!
- We gotta take that tank.
- My pleasure.
No, let me have that.
Need that tank operational.
Field knife.
- Grenade!
- Get out, get out!
Dig in!
Hard left, Sergeant! Take her through!
- 88 on the left.
- Lieutenant.
Ready.
Ready.
Hub station, off to the right.
They're at an impasse.
We'll hit the top level first.
Then work our way down.
Get us out of here, Sergeant, before we blow up with it!
Good lord!
They have blown the reserve.
With any luck...
We've seen the end of
Rommel's push to the Suez.
Colonel Harker.
Your continued resistance will only result in a futile loss of lives.
I ask you to surrender.
He knows your name, sir.
And our situation.
We've done what we set out to do.
Hands up.
Come on, quick.
Nobody move.
Whoever moves, dies.
My compliments, Colonel.
I have your assurance that our wounded..
...will receive prompt medical care?
The best we can provide.
As soon as you surrender the
Kesselring document, Colonel Harker.
Mohnfeld.
The name is Von Kroeger.
Von Kroeger, need I remind you of protocol?
This is an intelligence matter.
And it wasn't Bruckner.
What I told you was the truth, with one slight alteration.
That you found me in the tunnel.
The paper please.
As soldiers, we have few saving graces.
Perhaps our willingness to die for what we believe... is all that matters.

Here, Ben, you know
I was just thinkin'.
Back home they wouldn't let me drive a scooter without taking a test.
Marvellous, isn't it?
Marvellous.
Here, Ben, look.
Get out of it, you bunch of stupid...
Blimey. He was exceeding the speed limit.
Hey, watch the road!
You say there's reckless abuse of power!
And to free ourselves.
To free ourselves from...
Sorry, gents, no passengers allowed.
Hey, Ben, what do you reckon they're up to?
I don't know.
They got rid of our government.
Perhaps they wanna get rid of their own.
- Come on, lads. Let's be havin' ya.
- Good trip, Sergeant?
Dusty. Get 'em cracking with the unloading, Corp.
- Yes, Sergeant. Hurry up!
- Corporal. Corporal.
When you've done that, here's the mail for the officers' mess.
Right. Hurry up.
- You got any mail for me?
- Who'd write to you, Dig?
Blimey, I'd forgotten what women smelled like. Where's it from?
Sydney
One, two, one... Ben?
- Ben!
- Nothing this time, Muscles. Sorry, mate.
Come on! Louder yourselves up!
One, two! One, two!
So, our head man is the prime minister.
- Your head man is the...
- President.
Now, our prime minister works in Parliament.
- Your head man works in...
- House of Assembly.
Good. Splendid. Now, one of our members of Parliament is coming to this camp.
- I'm sure she'll want to talk to you.
- She, sir?
Oh, yes, a woman.
A woman member.
Oh, women in Parliament have their uses, you know.
What uses, sir? To carry water?
Yes, well, uh, we won't go into that one now.
Class dismissed.
Fire!
- Hey, Ben, is that for me?
- Yeah. What is it then?
- Good, that's my degree course.
- Oh, blimey, haven't you had enough education?
Come on, Abou.
What about that dirty pint?
I got a mouth on me like a gorilla's armpit. Ben? Schoolie?
- No, thanks.
- All right. Just a quick one.
- Been down to the railhead?
- Eighty miles of dust track.
- Enough to boil your brains.
- And there's something queer going on down in Batasi.
When we came through the main square just now... it was choked up with Africans running all ways and hollering.
- Yeah?
- Fill 'er up, Abou.
Ta. Some of them tried to stop us and all.
Probably celebrating something.
Maybe one of those durbars.
No, these characters were dead serious.
They were really giving it big licks.
Banners and drums and all.
Look out, here comes the R.S.M.
We'll have to get changed.
If he comes in and catches us like this, he'll do his tank.
Remain there!
Come here!
When you pass a commissioned officer... you don't wave your end about like a pregnant penguin.
You execute a salute in the following manner.
Raise the right hand by the longest route... till the second finger rests one inch above the right eye.
Turn your head and eyes in the direction of the officer.
When past the officer, return eyes to the front and hand to the right side. ls that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Right.
Let's see you do it then, lad.
Come along. Come along!
Salute me by numbers...
One!
Two!
One! Two!
Put that in the file, will you?
- A message from Command, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
- You'd better wait.
- Sir.
Come in.
Priority signal from Command, sir.
Oh, read it out, Tony, will you?
Yes, sir. "Serious political riots reported in the capital.
"For the duration of these disturbances...
"British personnel will retire to their respective messes...
"and take no part in regimental activities.
"British officers commanding
African formations...
"will hand over command forthwith to senior African officer... and await further instructions from this H.Q."
It's all right. We made it.
He's still at it.
One! Two!
- What'll you have, Dodger?
- A pint, please, Digger.
Right.
And the usual for Ben.
Well, this will be my last queen's birthday dinner.
- So, you're really off? They won't let you extend?
- No, mate. Too bloody old.
Ah, we'll come and see you off at the airport.
We'll sink a few pints that day.
I reckon old Ben's got himself a smashing job out there.
No, they've got no time for hairy old soldiers in civvy street.
Now, mate, you'll be all right.
Once they see you standing up there... straight as a ramrod, holding your gut in, slammin' your feet down, they'll say...
Give this man a kick in the crotch out of here.
Why don't you become a doorman, Ben?
I know a bloke, he's knockin' off 16 pounds a week.
Right. Stand around a doorway all day, saluting every stray bastard that comes and goes?
Not likely I'm chucker with that bloody lot.
Never mind, Ben. The great British public will see that you get your reward.
Slap your foot down.
Slap it down hard.
R.S.M.'s getting carried away out there.
He's three and a half minutes late.
Must have fractured his elbow by now.
He wouldn't let a little thing like that hold him up.
You won't get away with that.
He'll spot it in two minutes.
You want a bet?
Pints all around.
- You're on.
- Right.
- There's nothing for you, old man of muscle.
- Now leave off.
- Why don't you call me Muscles like everybody else?
- Muscles?
- Yeah?
- You notice anything different?
Why? What's going on?
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.
What's it gonna be, sir?
- I'll have a whisky for me.
- Sir.
How's the marriage prospects,
Corporal Abou?
Oh, very fine.
Thank you, sir. Very fine.
- Dodger, weren't you supposed to have the lawn mower repaired?
- Yes, sir.
I tried it this afternoon.
I regret to say it wouldn't cut up butter.
We'll have to get some more table mats.
Down at Command HQ... they've got some new ones stamped with the regimental crest.
These old ones are shabby.
They're a disgrace.
Silver could do with a polish too,
Corporal Abou.
- Sir.
- Anybody got a light?
Yes, sir.
Now tell me which bloody fool among you removed Her Majesty's portrait?
I'm afraid that was me, sir.
I bet Ben pints all around...
- you wouldn't spot it under two minutes, sir.
- Put it back!
Yes, sir.
I'll have proper respect shown in this mess.
You may think you know me, gentlemen.
You may think you can see me coming.
But let me tell you this.
There's no alteration celebration, no argumentation... and no qualification in this mess that escapes my little eye.
Read, learn, and inwardly bloody digest,
I've seen Calcutta!
I've eaten camel dung, my knees are brown... my navel is central, my conscious is clear.
And my will is with my solicitors, short and curly.
I believe you're on the chair, Dodger.
Guard, stand at ease!
Come in.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Captain Abraham.
Take a look at that.
"Serious political riots in capital.
British personnel will take no part in regimental activities."
Few political hotheads, sir.
"Will hand over command... to senior African officer."
You will assume command of this battalion... as of now, 1900 hours.
This is quite a shock, sir.
- I'll, uh, call my officers together.
- Right.
I would, uh, welcome your advice, sir.
Of course.
Anything I can do.
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, Abraham.
Come on, Charlie.
Move!
Come on!
Move! Move!
- Ah, get stuffed!
- Don't seem to like us very much.
Of course they do. It's just their way of expressing themselves.
Proud as a peacock, he was.
Saluted like a guardsman.
Thought I was back at the depot for a minute.
Except for his colour, of course.
That's what you need in the army.
Isn't that so, Ben? Pride.
Remember the church parades in Singapore before the war?
Everybody marching through the town on Sunday morning... beyond the band and drums, bags of swank.
Siamese, Catholics, anti-Baptist, everything bloody thing.
There was a man name of Smith, 279.
Refused to go to church on the grounds he was an atheist.
I had to whip him up in front of the colonel, of course.
Old Colonel Killinback, it was.
He was a wicked old bastard.
When Smith said he was an atheist... old Killinback looks at his documents.
You stated you were ch...
"You stated you were Church of England when you enlisted," he says.
Smith says,
"I know, sir... but I've changed my mind in the meantime."
"In this regiment," says old Killinback...
"only the officers change their mind... and even they have to get permission in writing."
- Twenty-eight days glasshouse they gave him...
- The best station... which was something to shout about in those days.
Wonderful station, Singapore.
- What was your favourite station, Muscles?
- Sir?
The best station I ever knew was mortared before the war.
The navy used to go on fleet manoeuvres and leave their wives behind.
All soft and pink... and willing.
We made sure they never got lonesome.
You didn't have time to wipe your boots.
You couldn't beat India though, you know, Ben.
"Jewel of the East" they used to call it.
What a pity they had to give it away.
Well, gentlemen, do you all understand the new situation?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
I just want to remind you of one thing.
It is your duty to carry out the orders of the elected government.
It is not for us to concern ourselves with politics.
- Is that quite clear?
- Yes, sir.
Very well. I shall want to see you all again at 9:00 sharp tomorrow morning.
That is all.
- Boniface.
- Sir?
Boni, your company's on duty tonight.
- Yes, sir.
- Treble all pickets... put guards on the arms and ammunition stores.
Don't issue any ammo except on my instructions.
Somebody might shoot somebody.
Recall "A" and "B" Companies.
Here's the signal.
- Will that be all, sir?
- For the moment.
- You'll come back later, we'll do rounds together.
- Sir.
Well, the battalion seems to be in very capable hands.
I'll put Mr. Lauderdale in the picture... and then we can get changed for the party and relax.
Hello?
Yes, yes, he's here right now.
It's for you, sir.
Oh, thank you.
Colonel Deal speaking.
Yes, well, I could be there in a couple of hours, sir, but...
Well, won't he wait until morning?
Very well, Sir William.
- Damn.
- What's the trouble, sir?
The deputy commissioner wants to see me... tonight.
Oh, uh, phone Mr. Lauderdale and say I'll call in on my way.
- Right, sir.
- Oh, blast.
I nearly forgot.
The Barker-Wise woman.
She wants to spend an evening in the sergeants' mess.
- Lay on the transport, will you?
- With pleasure, sir.
What bad luck, sir, you having to go off this evening.
I mean, with the nurses coming to dinner and everything.
Yes, it is bad luck.
For you too, Tony.
You're coming with me.
Now you wouldn't credit a sausage fly had brains, would you?
But this little beast landed on my shoulder three times running.
- Real tame, sir.
- How do you know it's the same one?
Well, I can tell, can't I, sport?
Sergeants' mess.
One moment, sir.
Sergeant Major Lauderdale, it's for you, sir.
Here, let's try and see if we can get him plastered, shall we?
Regimental Sergeant Major.
Get your laughing gear around that, mate.
Very well, sir.
C.O.'s on his way over.
Ben, be ready to offer him a drink as soon as he comes through this door.
Sir.
Good evening, Mr. Lauderdale.
Evening, sir. Would you care to come in for a drink, sir?
Well, there's nothing I'd like better, but I'm afraid it'll have to keep.
- The war office have got a flap on.
- What, again, sir?
Squad, halt!
In the meantime, you will be responsible... for the safety of the members of your mess.
There shouldn't be any complications if we keep our heads down... until this little spot of bother blows over.
- And then we can carry on as usual.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, and don't forget what I told you about Miss Barker-Wise.
She's a member of Parliament... so tell your chaps to be a bit, uh, diplomatic.
I'll tell them, sir.
Ah, look, he can hardly walk straight.
He's got the hiccups now.
- Oh! The little bastard bit me.
- Oh.
What the hell's going on? If I had the colonel with me, I'd have bit you.
You were so long, sir, we couldn't think what was happening.
Does the gallant colonel bring good news from the front, sir?
He has marvellous news.
News to set your little ears a-tingling.
Pay attention!
- You're all confined to the mess until further notice.
- What have we done, sir?
Nothing you've done.
It's due to the political situation.
- Well, how long's till further notice, sir?
- In this case... till order's restored down in the town.
Marvellous, isn't it?
Bloody marvellous.
Two hot chocolate mechanics chuck bricks at each other...
- and the whole British Army's immobilised.
- May I remind you, Sgt. Brown... they are not hot chocolate mechanics, they're Africans.
And you're not the whole of the British Army. Thank God.
- Corporal Abou.
- Sir.
I want an extra place laid for dinner.
We shall be entertaining a lady.
- Yes, sir.
- A lady?
- Blimey, a woman?
- Not one of those nursing bits from the hospital.
We're entertaining a member of the House of Commons, Miss Barker-Wise.
- Oh, blimey.
- Right. I want this place tidied up.
- Digger, sling those empties over the bar. Muscles?
- Sir.
Get rid of these pinups.
Schoolie, hide these disgusting magazines.
- Dodger, make yourself useful.
Come along. Come along.
- Sir?
Now remember this.
If I catch any member of this mess... drifting about the hardships of a soldier's life... into the ear of a certain member of Her Majesty's government...
You're sure she's not a member of the opposition, sir?
I don't care if she's a member of the Royal Ballet.
If I catch anybody belly... bellyaching... it'll be harder after she's gone.
The army's a great life, and don't you forget it.
Right. Here she is.
Now, I want you all behaving like Little Lord Fauntleroy.
No blasphemy. No obscenity.
And above all, no bad language.
Who the bloody hell are you?
Evening, Sergeant Major.
Step inside.
Let's have a look at you.
Evening, all.
- What's your name, lad?
- Wilkes. Private Wilkes.
- I shan't be Private Wilkes for much longer.
- Oh, really?
What will you be then?
Field Marshal Montgomery?
Stand at attention!
Identification card.
Yes, well, Private Wilkes 714.
- What are you doing here?
- In transit, back to England for demob.
- Sir!
- Sir!
What's this?
Hello.
Uh, this is Miss Eriksson, sir.
She's, um...
She's on her way back to Paris.
She got stranded at the airport. Same as me.
- No planes taking off.
- That's right.
Mr. Wilkes was kind enough to look after me.
Well, this is, uh, all highly irregular.
This is a military establishment, not a hotel.
I couldn't do much else, could I, sir? She's, uh...
She's with the United Nations.
We're supposed to keep in with them.
Well, they are on our side.
Aren't they?
I came out as a secretary with a team of United Nations observers... and I stayed on for a little holiday.
Yes, well, we'll talk about that later.
- Perhaps you'd like a clean-up.
- Oh, yes, please.
Then we'll see what we can arrange.
- Ben? Ben!
- Sir.
Show her the ablutions.
This way, miss.
The rest of you stand fast.
- When are you due for discharge?
- Day after tomorrow.
Doesn't look as though you're gonna make it, lad, does it?
It's all highly irregular having a private soldier in the sergeants' mess.
You'd better kip down in the rations store through there.
Yes, sir.
- Wilkes!
- Sir?
Hang on to your card, lad.
Never move without your B2601.
Chin up, chin up!
Now understand this, Wilkes.
I can always stomach a good soldier, whatever his faults.
What I can't stomach are Bolshies, skivers... scrimshankers and bughouse barristers.
I've broken more of them than you've had eggs for breakfast.
If I take a liking to you, lad...
I'll be your good friend and counsellor.
If you offend me...
I'll pull out your sausage-like intestines... hang 'em round your neck and prick 'em every so often like they do real sausages.
Good evening.
Good evening, ma'am.
Regimental Sergeant Major Lauderdale.
- You're Miss Barker-Wise.
- I do hope I'm not interrupting anything.
No, ma'am. We were just having a discussion on discipline.
- May I introduce Sgt. Prideaux.
- How do you do?
Sgt. Brown. Sgt. Drake. Sgt. Dunn.
Colour Sergeant Smith.
- How do you do?
- And this is Pri... At ease!
- Private Wilkes.
- How do you do?
Take your cap off.
Won't you sit down, ma'am?
- Thank you.
- What about a noggin?
- May I have a whisky?
- Corporal Abou.
Large whisky.
What about you, Wilkes?
That's very kind of you, sir.
I'll have a large whisky too, please.
- And the usual, Corporal.
- Sir.
Come on, lads.
Quite informal.
This is the first time we've had the honour of entertaining ladies in this mess.
- Ladies.
- All right, sit down. Sit down.
Yes, there'll be another one out in a minute, typist.
Got stranded at the airport.
This is quite an occasion.
Indeed.
Well, it's an occasion for me too.
It's not often one gets the chance of seeing things for one's self.
Especially the new African Army.
Perhaps after dinner we could all sit round and I'll fire questions at you.
Yes, well, as long as we don't come against the Official Secrets Act, of course.
Oh, I don't think we shall do that.
No, what I'm most interested in is how you get along with your African colleagues.
How soon they'll be ready to take over completely. You know, that sort of thing.
Sir.
Come in.
Boni, ready for rounds?
What the...
Captain Abraham, you are under arrest... in the name of the new government.
He's got it - discipline.
You can't run anything without discipline... from an army down to a coffee store.
That's the trouble with the world today, isn't it, Ben?
They don't know the meaning of the word.
Why, the first church parade I was ever on...
I fainted, dropped down in front of General Arnott.
What does the general do?
Has me charged with leaving... the appointed place of parade without permission - Section 40 of the Army Act.
I never fainted again.
Well, now they've abolished church parade, the general must feel quite frustrated.
Oh, he's dead. Got blown off the sea wall at Ramsgate in a gale.
Broke his neck.
Very sad.
It's a bit cooler out here, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
- Get over that taxi ride yet?
- Just about.
But I'm glad you were with me.
I couldn't have done much if they'd got the door open except... except bark at them.
They were very angry, weren't they?
Yeah. And laughing their heads off the next minute.
I take it, Sergeant Major, that you do not believe that all men are equal.
Equal, ma'am, but different.
Now... you take the horse and zebra.
They're equal in a manner of speaking.
But if you was to plunk them down, side by side... feed 'em on the same grub, in the same climate... one of them would turn his toes up, wouldn't he, ma'am?
But there are thousands of Africans living in our climate... eating our food, and they don't turn their toes up.
My group entertains dozens of them every weekend.
Your own Lieutenant Boniface has been to my house on many occasions.
And you'd hardly suggest he was incapable of inventing the wheel.
No one is allowed to leave the confines of the mess.
- Is that understood?
- Who the hell are you to issue orders?
I have an armed platoon surrounding the building.
I don't have to remind you of the penalty for armed mutiny, Mr. Boniface.
I don't have to remind you of the penalty for armed mutiny, Mr. Boniface.
No, you don't.
But this isn't mutiny.
Let's us call it a change of structure.
You can call it what you like!
I advise you to go back to your party and await further orders.
What do you think?
Get on the sergeants' mess.
Hello? Line's dead.
They've got us.
Not a gun in the place... and cordoned all around and a dozen nurses on our hands.
They might keep us here for days.
Now that's a thought.
Young Masai, this one, ma'am. Lives on milk and bull's blood. Damn good fighter.
This chap, he comes from the northern district.
One of the Turkana chiefs.
And this...
Yes, well, time for dinner.
Dodger, tell the bugler to sound the mess call.
Sir.
That's a good one, Wilkie.
What's his name?
- It's Archie, our company mascot.
- Go on, make him talk.
I don't wish to interrupt the entertainment, Wilkie... but you haven't seen a bugler anywhere about, have you?
- A what?
- A bugler, Wilkie. You know, a man that plays the bugle.
There's been no one here but Wilkie...
Private Wilkes and myself, Sergeant.
Right. Well, thank you, miss.
Thank you.
That private's gonna get there first if somebody doesn't watch it.
The bugler hasn't reported, sir.
Hasn't reported? Put him on company orders in the morning.
- Yes, sir.
- Ah, Private Wilkes.
You don't, amongst your many other accomplishments, happen to play the bugle, do you?
- No, sir.
- No.
I'm pretty good on the harmonica though.
Are you having me on?
- No, sir.
- The prestige of the British Army... has taken a bit of a pasting in the last few years... but it's not going to think to having its bugle calls played on a spittle trap!
Still, we can't go into dinner without a mess call.
- Muscles!
- Sir.
Put on that record
"Bugle Calls of the British Army."
- It's got the mess call on that.
- There's a lot of others, sir.
- "Last Post" and...
- Never mind. Turn it on.
Sir.
- My handbag.
- There.
Marvellous, isn't it? The privates get the crumpet. The officers get it.
Look what we get.
Oh, I don't know.
She's looking better every minute.
Nothing to be ashamed of, Muscles.
Turn it up so people can hear it.
- Sergeant Major, take these men to the guard room.
- Sir!
Keep them under double guard. Tomorrow they'll be taken to Batasi and charged.
- Charged with what, Mr. Boniface?
- Treason... against the new people's government.
Sergeant.
Everybody got a little something in their glass?
- Yes, thank you.
- Good.
Well, this is a very special occasion, you know.
Still!
Sit down.
What's going on out there,
Sergeant Major?
Night firing exercise on the range, ma'am.
Well, uh, as I was saying... this is a very special occasion.
This is the first time that we've had the company of ladies in the mess... on the occasion of Her Majesty's birthday.
Yes, well, we mustn't let the talking interfere with the eating, as they say.
But, um, before we get down to it... as president of this mess... it falls to me to have the honour to propose the loyal toast.
Therefore, if your glasses are charged... uh, perhaps you'd all care to be up standing.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Her Maj...
- Do what you can for him, Ben.
- Right.
- Give him a hand, Muscles. Schoolie, first-aid kit.
- Sir.
Abou, you and your boys out of sight. Stay there.
- Come along then. Come along.
- Sir.
- Digger. Gentle with him, lads.
- Sir?
- See if it's clear out the back.
- Can I help, Sergeant Major?
- I've had training.
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you very much.
- Dodger, those lights in there.
- Sir.
- Wilkes?
- Sir?
Get your rifle.
- Got a pair of glasses in my kit bag.
- Right. Get 'em.
Good. Follow me.
Hmm.
I can't recognise the bastards.
Going back the way it came.
Probably to Company H.Q.
All right, Wilkes, you stay out here.
If you see anything moving, yell.
You don't have to be polite and wait for me to stop speaking, yell.
Right, sir.
- Dodger, your truck still out in the back?
- Yes, sir.
Get away from that window.
Get it started as quiet as you can.
- What's going on out there, sir?
- Did you spot anything, sir?
- See anything out in the back, Digger?
- No, sir, nothing.
- Hello?
- He's pretty rough.
- Hello. Say who did it?
- Not a dicky bird.
Still unconscious.
Mutiny, Ben.
It's like the Loch Ness Monster.
Heard of it, but never actually ran across it.
What are you going to do, sir?
Well, before I do anything, we're gonna get a hold of some weapons.
How are we going to do that?
Drive up to the arms store and draw 'em.
- Just like that?
- Just like that. Fluff it out.
Truck started up, sir, but I don't understand what you want...
You don't have to understand.
You have to drive.
- How are we for spud bags, Ben?
- Plenty in the storeroom.
Take 'em out to the sand bunker and get
'em filled. Schoolie will give you a hand.
Private Wilkes!
Oh, Ben, before you go, I'll need your keys.
Muscles, Digger, you're coming with me.
Now then, lad, keep your eyes skinned.
You're on your own for a bit.
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you know how to use that thing.
Well, I know how to use it, but I've never yet fired one in anger, as they say.
God, what an army.
- You're with me, lads.
- Sir.
Oh, get it in the sack.
We're not building sand castles.
Come on.
Come on. Get a move on.
We'll be here all bloody night with you.
Oh, give us that before you rupture yourself.
I'll shovel and you grunt.
Let's slow down, Dodger.
Come on then, get out of the way.
You've seen my face before.
- Lieutenant Boniface said no...
- Come on. Come on!
Right.
Hmm, that was
Corporal Ntimba.
Never make a sergeant... no initiative.
Halt!
Who goes there?
Stay!
Open up, Digger.
Take your thumb off the bolt,
Private Juma.
How many times have I told you?
Right, stand at ease, lad.
You cannot go in there, sir.
Lt. Boniface gave me orders.
Here. Let's have a look at that.
- How's...
- It doesn't look clean to me. Did you oil this bolt?
You'll have to do better than that, Juma.
Corporal Ntimba!
Rifles, Digger. Three of them.
Muscles, see to the ammo.
- Done.
- Keys?
- Here you go, Sterlings.
- Digger, magazines.
Dodger.
Give me one.
Quiet a minute.
Right. You two carry on.
And lock up after you.
Watch your back.
Watch your back.
Corporal Ntimba, come any closer you get brambles up your pipe.
Right, lads.
Let's get back.
Oh, then.
The old man missed the Siege of Tobruk.
That's his trouble.
Don't hang around doing nothing. Get those bags and start setting up some firing posts.
This isn't a holiday camp, you know.
Right, get a wiggle on.
Come on. Come on.
Here they are.
- Stay with him, will you, Miss Eriksson?
- Yes, of course.
- Don't strain yourself.
- Oh, so you're back.
Get these guns cleaned, lads.
Dodger, I want that one first.
- Muscles, get the grenades out of the truck.
- Sir.
Well, ma'am, how's Captain Abraham?
I demand to know what's going on?
What exactly are you doing?
Well, at this precise moment, ma'am,
I'm charging an S.M.G. Magazine.
Has it occurred to you that the rebels, or whatever you choose to call them... were leaving us alone because we were unarmed?
That what you are doing can only provoke more bloodshed.
Well, that's a matter of opinion.
I'm surprised at you, ma'am. I thought you believed in all men being equal.
- Of course I do. That's exactly the point.
- Dodger!
Well, they had guns and we didn't.
- That wasn't very equal, was it?
- Sir?
Private Wilkes? Put the safety catch on next time, Dodger.
- Know what this is?
- Yes, sir. It's a Sterling S.M.G.
- I've even fired one.
- Well, that doesn't make you unique.
Everyone in this room's fired one, except Miss Barker-Wise, of course.
- Take it and get back on guard.
- There must be some way to stop this madness.
Why don't you at least make an attempt to contact the other side.
I've already done that, ma'am.
- You have?
- Give me another box of nine millimetre.
- Why didn't you tell me? What happened?
- What's the matter with that?
- This barrel's in a hell of a state, sir.
- Let's have a look.
- Give it another pull through and take a chance.
- Will you tell me what happened?
Nothing much, ma'am. We ran into
Lt. Boniface's party down at the ammo dump.
Boni? Is he in charge?
Rust. I'll have somebody on a fizzle when this lot's over. Dodger!
Is Lt. Boniface in charge?
Well, he gave me that impression, ma'am, yes.
- Thank God. Thank God.
- I wouldn't be too hasty about doing that.
Let me go and talk to him.
He's a civilised and cultured man.
He'll listen to me.
Please arrange the transport.
You'll be safer here for the moment, ma'am.
Safer? In the middle of this gunpowder plot you're organizing?
- Very well, I'll walk.
- Muscles, stand by the door.
Do you intend to keep me here by force?
Now listen to me, ma'am.
You're not in Parliament now.
This isn't England. And I know more about these people than you do.
And don't run away with the idea I've got a down on them because their skin isn't the same colour.
Their best is as good as our best.
But their bad's as rough as ours, and that's pretty rough.
Now, I'm responsible for your safety while you're in this mess... so while you're here, you'll obey my orders!
- And if you don't like it, you'll have to lump it.
- This is intolerable.
I agree, ma'am.
But don't blame me.
Blame your harmless little Africans.
Blame them? Who put guns into their hands?
Who taught them to shoot? You.
And if it wasn't for people like us... you wouldn't be able to walk around, spouting your smarmy, silly... bloody, half-baked ideas!
That remark, Sergeant Major, may well cost you your rank.
Stay with her, Muscles, until she quiets down.
See she doesn't leave the mess.
- Sir.
- Ooh, what a right old cow.
No wonder the officers dumped her onto us.
All those nurses up there, I bet they don't mind being cooped up for a year.
As long as somebody can knit.
I must admit, the old bag's got guts.
I only hope to God she doesn't get to be prime minister.
- Russell.
- Colonel Deal.
Glad you've arrived.
Sir Williams waiting to see you.
- You're in for a long party tonight.
- I'm afraid so.
A change in government can affect an awful lot of people.
- Is it as close as that?
- Yes, I think so.
All right. Keep me informed.
- Hello, John.
- Sir William.
- Tony.
- Hello, sir.
- You made good time.
- Well, it sounded serious.
Yes, it is. Things have happened fast since I spoke to you. Whisky?
- Oh, fine.
- Thank you, sir.
To put it mildly, the position is, well, delicate.
I've just heard the buzz that the president is on his way out of the country.
Taking his wives with him.
That'll leave the rebels a clear field.
I think we should get out of the habit of calling them rebels.
By the morning, they may well be the government.
That's fantastic.
In less than 36 hours.
Yes, well, no doubt it was well prepared at first.
Harry Jobila has saw to that.
Seems to be no stopping him now.
Oh, excuse me.
Yes?
When did you hear this?
All right. Ring me back.
The Afro-Britannia mines.
The new boys have just taken over.
You know what that means?
The wealth of this country.
- Harry Jobila is no fool.
- It doesn't make sense.
Five years in jail and within six months of coming out... he's on his way to the president's palace.
He spent that six months here as a gardener.
Got to know him pretty well.
Lousy gardener.
I hope he'll make a better president.
Anyway, going to jail is considered a shortcut to power these days.
I hope it never happens in the army.
Come in.
Radio message from the airfield, sir.
Jobila's men are in control.
- Any casualties?
- No, sir.
- Good.
- Get on to the camp, Tony.
- Is that all right, sir?
- Yes, yes, use this one.
I want to talk to Captain Abraham.
Get me Batasi Camp, please.
What's gonna happen?
In the future, I mean.
I should think that once the position is stabilised... they'll want us to carry on as usual.
And Jobila will need all the support and advice he can get... if he's gonna fulfill some of those promises he's made.
The thing to do is to hang on.
And above all, keep our noses clean.
Excuse me, sir. There's something wrong with the line to the camp.
They can't make contact.
Give me that.
Halt! Who goes there?
Squad, halt!
Sergeant Major?
Armed party, a dozen men.
Who goes there?
Lieutenant Boniface.
Advance, sir, unarmed, and be recognised.
You two, come with me.
- Muscles?
- Sir?
Go back and keep your eyes on Miss Barker-Wise.
See she doesn't come in until these people are gone.
- Understand?
- Sir.
Good evening, Sergeant Major.
I hope this call isn't too inconvenient.
It's a pleasure, sir.
Let us hope it will remain one.
Indeed, sir.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.
Now, sir.
Sergeant Major,
I've come to inform you... that I've taken over command of the battalion from Captain Abraham.
You'll therefore regard me as your commanding officer.
I've only got one C.O., sir, that's Colonel Deal.
As far as I'm concerned, Captain Abraham is in temporary command of the battalion.
As far as I'm concerned,
Captain Abraham is a traitor.
Anyway, he's dead.
I'll believe that when I see the casualty return.
In the meantime, sir, will you please remove your headdress... while in the sergeants' mess and request your escort to do the same?
Leave them on.
Sergeant Major, I'm not interested in points of etiquette at the moment.
Mr. Boniface...
I've been a member of this mess for 23 years, sir.
In all that time, I've never seen anybody... man, woman or child... sergeant or field marshal or prime minister... walk into this mess with his hat upon his head!
I do not see you now, sir.
All right.
If it worries you.
Now, sir, can I be of service?
I wish you'd understand,
Sergeant Major...
I will give you protection if you cooperate with me.
Your future in my country is very limited, you must appreciate.
Limited, did you say, sir?
That's a very elastic word.
No doubt you'll be sent back to your own country in due course.
At this very moment, the new president is considering the matter.
And where do you come in, Mr. Boniface?
You as a loyal officer.
- So, where do you come in?
- Loyal to whom?
To the corrupt lackeys your government left to lead us... when they granted us our so-called independence?
So you consider that soldiers should not be revolutionaries.
Your Cromwell was a soldier, wasn't he?
Did he not grab Ireland,
Sergeant Major?
Well, you know, sir, it was only for their own good.
The micks have always been obstinate, sir.
Very obstinate.
As for myself, I'm a soldier.
- I don't understand politics.
- Well, I do understand them, Sergeant Major.
And for my political education,
I'm obliged to one of your compatriots...
Miss Barker-Wise.
However, I did not come here to discuss politics.
I've come to tell you all that you must remain here... until I receive further instructions from the new government.
My men will surround the mess and they will shoot anyone who tries to leave.
In the meantime, I am taking possession of the camp in the name of the new republic.
Sergeant Major, you will deliver to me all your arms and ammunition.
And I will be responsible for your safety.
Is that understood?
Also, I shall withdraw your servants who will be required to carry arms.
Corporal Abou.
Private Daniel.
You will collect all the mess silver...
and your kit, and report to me in the orderly room.
Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Now, Sergeant Major... if you will leave all your weapons on the veranda,
I will send a squad to collect them.
- I will inform you of any later developments.
- Just one moment, sir!
If you please.
Well?
Now you listen to me,
Mr. Boniface.
I'm a professional soldier, born across the road from Wellington Barracks.
I enlisted when I was 17.
By the time I was 24...
I was a sergeant serving on the northwest frontier of India!
Sometimes, Mr. Boniface, I'd lay awake in my tent with a hurricane lamp...
sometimes in the middle of a blizzard... reading about the exploits of other British soldiers.
Sometimes I'd be lying there in my freezing cold tent actually sweating.
Beads of sweat pouring down my face from a battle 200 years old!
And later on I had a little active service of my own to take notice of.
Now, what I'm coming to, sir, is this...
All this experience of warfare, imaginary and otherwise... gives me a certain amount of experience to face this misunderstanding... with a certain amount of sangfroid!
It's a fly on the wall, sir, a fight with a feather!
- I refuse to...
- As far as the weapons are concerned...
I was ordered by my C.O. to keep them to swat flies with.
And until I get further instructions,
I intend to hang on to them.
- Now look here, sir...
- Will you please listen to me!
You seem to have gained control of this battalion by an act of mutiny. Very well.
You're entitled to the mess servants because they're your countrymen, not mine.
You're entitled to the mess property... because it stands on your soil.
But if you think for one moment that
I'm gonna hand over the lives of these people... to the custody of a half-cooked, jumped-up, sad, little... blackboard warrior like yourself... you're very much mistaken!
Do I make myself clear?
Absolutely clear, Sergeant Major.
I always knew that one would turn out to be a savvy boy.
Squad, about face!
That's fixed him for a bit.
Provided the servants don't tell him we've got Abraham.
Abou won't.
Abou's the same tribe as Abraham.
Boniface comes from the coast.
Abou's people look on all the coastal tribes as several grades lower than bush rat.
Let's hope you're right.
Sergeant Major, what right has this man... to keep me confined to that room?
My authority, ma'am.
Am I under arrest then?
Not yet, ma'am, not yet.
Sergeant Major, I can end this ridiculous nonsense in five minutes... and get Captain Abraham to hospital.
I implore you, please send me to Boniface.
No, ma'am, and for a very good reason.
It'd be a waste of time.
He's already been to see us.
- That boy? You mean he's been here?
- He left a few moments ago.
He wanted to tell me that he'd seised control of the battalion by mutiny.
And if we'd all be good little boys and girls, he'd see we didn't come to any harm.
I sent him off with a flea in his ear.
You did what, you bloody fool?
Why didn't you let me talk to him?
I know Boniface like my own son.
- Did you tell him about Captain Abraham?
- I did not.
- Why?
- If you'll excuse me, I've gotta get on with battalion orders.
- If he doesn't get to doctor, he'll die.
- We've all gotta die sometime.
If I handed him over to your pal Boniface, he wouldn't stand a hope in hell.
Nonsense. He's a very humane man.
His principles are very sound.
- And they've all got a bullet up the spout.
- Let me tell you this.
Your stupidity is placing all our lives in danger.
When you talk of principles with a bullet up the spout... that's a perfect example of your own mentality.
You're a... a living gun.
They've turned you into a human rifle.
They've taken away your personality,
Sergeant Major, bit by bit down the years... and replaced it with a sort of military stuffing.
"Left, right, about turn, obey, fight, kill!"
- Don't be impertinent, ma'am!
- That's all you know!
You're an instrument, ready primed to put to someone's shoulder!
- A royal trigger in waiting.
- Just you be careful, ma'am, that I don't go off.
What's your life?
A dull routine round of boot licking, waiting for a war.
The only way you'll ever fulfill yourself is to die in action!
What are you huddling about there for like a brood of wet hens?
Wilkes, get back on guard!
Schoolie, get that ammo stored away.
Miss Eriksson.
- Do you cook?
- Oh, yes.
I expect the dinner is spoiled by now, but perhaps you do what you can.
- Yes, sir.
- Muscles! Digger!
Get that table tidied up.
It's the queen's birthday.
And even if we have to have paraffin and brick dust sandwiches... we're gonna celebrate it... with or without our distinguished guest.
Dodger, don't stand there like a spare wig at a wedding!
- Get me a drink.
- Yes, sir.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Now just do what you're told and you'll have nothing to worry about.
Throw down your revolvers, both of you!
Oh, no.
By what authority?
The authority of the new government.
Now you listen to me.
This revolver is staying where it is... until I see some signed order from a legal member... of your government.
All right, Colonel.
Now get moving.
Meanwhile, you might get your men to change that wheel.
- Private Wilkes!
- Sir?
You better hear this. I've drawn up guard detail and battalion orders for tomorrow.
Right. Now, about the sleeping arrangements.
Miss Eriksson will go in your room, Dodger.
You go in with Digger.
First time I get a bird in my room,
I'm posted absent.
Ben, Miss Barker-Wise will be in your little nest.
- You can go in with Muscles.
- That's a happy release.
Schoolie, you stand fast, and I'll be in here.
Now, you'll all sleep fully clothed, and that includes boots.
If anything does happen, I don't want anybody to get a burst up the backside... when you're bending down looking for your boots.
0600 hours.
The last man on guard can have a nice long lay till half past. Right.
Ben, as soon as you've changed over your kit, you relieve Wilkes.
Carry on.
- Come on, darling. Let's go to kip.
- Get out of here!
- Got a light?
- Yes, of course.
I suppose you realise this is strictly against Queen's regulations.
I'd better be getting back in.
Good night.
Um...
You know what you wanna do if it gets too hot in your bedroom?
No. What?
Just... just leave your window open.
All right, all right, Wilkes.
I'm relieving you.
I put opalescence in the rations's door, so you better go get some kip.
Well, I... I think
I'll just take a stroll before I turn in.
Take a stroll?
You've been strolling for two hours.
What's the matter with you?
- Insomnia.
- What?
- Chronic insomnia.
- Wait. You wanna see a quack about that.
You might get rings under your eyes.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
You crafty basket weaver.
Who is it?
It's all right.
It's only your blind Uncle Charlie.
- Hello, Wilkie.
- Hello.
Now wait a minute.
- Schoolie.
- Huh?
All quiet, Schoolie?
Quiet as the proverbial grave, sir.
Yes. Never mind the proverbs.
I didn't get my rank on a proverb.
- No, sir.
- Unless it's "God helps them that help themselves."
Miss Barker-Wise?
Will you please tell these men to take their hands off me?
You must forgive them. I gave orders no one was to leave the mess.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you, Boni.
I had to come and see you.
- What about, ma'am?
- Captain Abraham.
- Captain Abraham?
- He arrived at the mess last night.
He'd been wounded.
Perhaps it was an accident.
I don't know.
But he must have immediate medical attention.
That's no problem.
I'll see that he's removed immediately.
There. That's settled.
Thank you, Boni. I knew it was only a matter of common sense and reason.
If you'll give me an escort, I'll go see that
Captain Abraham is ready for the ambulance.
I'm afraid I can't allow that. I must ask you to stay here.
I don't understand.
Squad, halt!
Is that how you're gonna fetch Captain Abraham?
- If necessary.
- What's gonna happen to him?
He'll be charged with treason.
If he's found guilty, he'll be shot.
- But what has he done?
- He's known to have opposed the National Unity Party.
Is that all?
I forgot you're a member of Parliament.
We do things a little differently here.
Perhaps we're in more of a hurry.
But, Boni, I...
I don't understand. You...
When you were in England, you were... so different.
I was one of your African mascots then, wasn't I?
Sitting at your feet, listening to you talk.
My God, how you talked!
No one talks better than the British.
They drug you with talk.
When you wake up, they still have their heel on your neck.
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- But, Boni...
Now you listen to me, the lot of you.
Owing to a gross piece of negligence,
Barker-Wise has escaped from the mess.
I don't blame one man any more than the rest.
You've all been walking around in your sleep, so watch it!
Keep your eyes rolling and your minds ticking!
Be sure to check your guns.
Excuse me, sir.
Very well. Dismissed.
Now, what do you want?
Mr. Boniface is here, sir, with an armed party.
He's coming in on his jack.
Don't hang around the windows!
Disperse yourselves round the room!
Digger, Muscles, on the other side.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Sergeant Major, I'll come quickly to the purpose of this visit.
I understand from my friend, Miss Barker-Wise, that she's been kept here under duress.
For her own safety, sir.
I'd be obliged if you'd have her restored to my custody.
- She insisted on returning to Batasi, Sergeant Major.
There is something more important for us to discuss.
You have here a wounded officer,
Captain Abraham. Not so?
Miss Barker-Wise informs me that this is so.
- Well, she must be mistaken.
- Women of her intelligence do not make such mistakes!
I understand that Captain Abraham is badly in need of medical treatment.
If you'll hand him over to my custody, I'll see...
- There is no officer of that name here.
- Now don't waste my time!
I insist that you hand over
Captain Abraham!
He's required to answer for crimes against the new republic!
That's his hardship, not mine.
You are being very stupid!
The affair of Captain Abraham is the affair of government.
You will hand him over at once!
Mr. Boniface... suppose for the sake of argument
Captain Abraham was wounded... and had come to me for protection.
In that case, sir...
I wouldn't be at liberty to hand him over without an order from Colonel Deal!
You will appreciate that it is I who give the orders, and you who will obey!
For the first time in the history of my country, Sergeant Major... it is the African who is putting the shell into the breech... and giving the order to fire!
Really, Mr. Boniface?
I don't think I've ever come across a misfit... of your size and quality before.
You missed your vocation.
You ought to be in Hyde Park!
If you do happen to go putting a shell into the breech, sir...
I sincerely hope you'll remember to put the sharp end to the front.
You are in great danger, all of you!
You have already refused to give up your weapons... now you refuse to hand over an officer who's wanted for treason.
Sergeant Major, I will give you an hour to change your mind.
If you haven't delivered Captain Abraham into my charge by that time...
I will destroy the sergeants' mess and everyone in it!
One hour, Sergeant Major.
Squad, about face!
Do we get any danger money for this caper?
- No. He's probably bluffing.
- Bluffing like bloody hell he was!
They can't do this.
It's not in Queen's regulations.
It's there somewhere, boy.
They've got everything taped in there.
We oughta let him have Abraham on a written guarantee of safe conduct.
- Then we're in the clear.
- Safe conduct? How long do you think that'd last?
It's no skin off our nose.
We could always say they broke their promise. It's no concern of ours.
No concern of ours.
You stupid...
Pitch a man into the arms of a firing squad and you say it's no concern of ours.
You're bloody keen, aren't you?
What's he ever done for you?
- I'll tell you what he did for me!
- Men!
Look. I had a skinful one night.
Around 4:00 in the morning, I felt somebody shake me while I was sleeping.
It was Abraham.
You know what he said? I'll tell you.
He said, "Colour Sergeant,
I just had a strange dream.
A dream that I went to the arms store and helped myself to 100,000 rifles."
I didn't need any second telling.
I got up and bolted round the armoury and found I'd forgot to lock it.
If it was anyone but Abraham on duty,
I would have got court-martialed for negligence.
You tell me one European officer that wouldn't have stuck it on his report.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Are you all right, sir?
You shouldn't be walking about.
I'm all right.
Just...
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't allow you to leave the mess.
You cannot prevent it,
Sergeant Major.
Don't you see that while I remain...
I'm involving you in my own affairs?
- Is that good ethics?
- I'm not interested in good ethics or bad ethics.
Or politics, I trust.
Well, you're lucky.
Thank you for your hospitality.
Ben!
Before you go, sir.
Yes, Sergeant Major? Wha... what is it?
I've given you the protection of this mess, sir.
If you insist on going against my advice... would you please sign a chit to say you do so willingly?
All right.
But I must ask you to hurry.
Yes, of course.
I, Captain...
on this, uh...
day...
Abraham...
do hereby...
Declare that i... leave the...
European...
Sergeants' mess... at my own...
insistence.
Now, sir... would you please sign this, sir?
Just here.
I've signed for many things in the army, Sergeant Major.
First time I've signed for myself.
Muscles, give him a hand!
Take him back to his room.
I thought for one nasty moment he was gonna get off the hook.
There are more ways of killing a cat than sticking a poker in his ear, lad.
I think I'll have this framed.
Sir, take a look at this.
The ack-ack guns.
The Bofors.
So that's what the bastard meant when he talked about putting a shell in the breech.
The only weapons in this battalion... capable of blowing us all to blazes.
Not that the gunner's very smart, but... you can't very well miss a sergeants' mess at a hundred yards in broad daylight.
Now, the quickest way to put a Bofor out of action... is to shove a 36 grenade in the breech - simple as that.
There are two guns.
So, it will need two of us.
I know you're all itching to get out there and get stuck in... so I'll offer it to the first volunteer.
Well, come on, lads.
Come along. Don't be shy.
What's the matter with you?
Lost your tongue?
Surely I don't have to detail somebody.
Well, gentlemen... you amaze me.
You honestly amaze me!
I do honestly declare to you I've never seen anything like this in all of my service life!
Holy suffering!
The first chance we get for a bit of action...
instead of sitting on our duffs like a lot of prised billy goats... and there's not a man among you.
Not one man who's even got the guts to admit he's a coward.
I'll tell you what it is, sir.
In the war, all you had to do was go out and find the enemy and give him the chopper.
But these blokes are supposed to be on our side.
- We don't know if we're on foot or horseback.
- I'll go.
- Come on. Let's toss.
- I said I'll go.
Steady on, Ben. I'll go.
After all, Ben, you're a bit old for this job.
- I'm what?
- Well...
- Drop it, would ya!
- You got a family...
Ben, you've only got 10 days to do in the army, and I take that into full consideration.
If you want to leave it to Dodger or Digger, it's all right with me.
Leave it to them?
They couldn't fix a rat in a drain pipe.
- Sir?
- Yes, what is it?
It would be simpler to toss for it, wouldn't it?
Well, is anybody against tossing up for it?
All right, get a move on.
Ben.
Muscles?
Dodger?
Digger?
Wilkes?
The queen, God bless her.
All right, lad, that's you and me.
- Now is your chance to get smothered in glory.
- Wilkes.
The 36's are ready, sir.
Right. We better take two each, just in case only one of us gets through.
- Layout to the camp, sir.
- Good. Follow me, Wilkes.
The sergeants' mess is here, the guns there.
If we come up from the front, they'll make jam of us.
So we go out of the back around there.
How you gonna get across the road?
Will you stick a boomerang in that great Aussie cakehole of yours.
They're just lining up on us.
Right. We come out the back where there's plenty of cover and make our way round to there.
Now this is the tricky bit.
Ben, give us two minutes to get here.
Then I want you to attract their attention.
If you can hold it for even five seconds, we'll be across this road.
- How 'bout some cover fire, sir?
- With two Bofors sticking right up our jumpers?
No, no, no. Make out you're otherwise engaged.
A fight, a party,
I don't care. Do a dance.
- Wilkes? All right so far?
- Yes, sir.
I wonder they didn't make you a sergeant.
I had a stripe once.
Lost it after a fortnight.
After this is over, you'll probably get it back.
Not too late to stay on, lad.
Once we're across this road, we'll make our way through the firing butts.
- And then?
- There's plenty of cover there.
We'll play it by ear. Ben, we'll be at the end of the buildings in two minutes.
And then we'll wait till you start your fracas.
And keep it going till those guns go up.
I make it...
10 seconds short of 0633.
So, zero from... now.
Come on, Wilkes.
Good luck, sir.
Give me a hand with the piano.
All right, Wilkes.
A minute and a half to go.
- Wilkes!
- Sir.
Come on, Wilkes.
Quick!
Right. Come on.
Ten seconds.
Digger, open those windows.
I want them to get the full benefit of the choir.
Schoolie, come and do your stuff.
Three, two, one.

Good morning.
Is Mr. Lauderdale about?
Um, he's, uh...
He's doing something outside, sir.
I take it you've heard the news.
News, sir?
What news?
That we have a new government.
The old lot have already surrendered.
We got through the crisis without being involved.
And good show.
Tell Mr. Lauderdale I'd like to see him when he's finished, would you?
Well, go on,
Colour Sergeant. Go on.
Get on! The guns are going off!
Get on!
What in God's name...
I...
I think the sergeant major's finished, sir.
- Wilkes.
- Sir?
Put your betty on.
Put your button up.
Well, Miss Eriksson, thank you for your help.
- Good-bye, Sergeant Major.
- Bon voyage.
Good-bye, sir.
Uh, Wilkes.
Remember, some folks sleep light.
Next time, don't sling your boots around, lad.
- Good morning, Sergeant Major.
- Good morning, ma'am.
I'm leaving you today.
I trust your fact-finding tour has provided you with a few facts.
Perhaps one or two concerning
Lieutenant Boniface.
Colonel Boniface, Sergeant Major.
If it's any consolation to you, I disapprove of his methods as much as I do of yours.
- Colonel Boniface?
- Yes, Mr. Lauderdale.
I see that you're already dressed for the ceremonial parade.
Yes, sir. What's it all about, sir?
Well, it's a bit of a rush job, actually.
It's to celebrate the coming to power of the new government.
Colonel Boniface will be taking the salute.
He's now military governor of the province.
I think under the circumstances... it might be better if you handed over the parade to the colour sergeant.
Very good, sir.
You'll be glad to hear the new government has elected to stay in the commonwealth.
So, of course, we shall be carrying on as before.
Very well, sir.
What's going to happen to Captain Abraham, sir?
Well, the new president has given him safe conduct... out of the country.
That's good, sir.
Yes, but... we, um, had to compromise.
General McClellan told me this morning that Boniface had demanded... that you leave the country within 48 hours.
The general considers the request completely unjustified.
Boniface also wants us to take disciplinary action against you.
What does that mean, sir?
A court-martial?
Oh, no, no, of course it won't come to that.
We've asked for time to consider the matter, naturally.
But the general thinks it would be wise... if you were on the first available plane back to England.
Very well, sir.
I'll get my gear together.
I don't suppose it's any comfort to you,
Mr. Lauderdale... but in your place
I'd have done exactly as you did... step for step.
- Muscles.
- Sir?
- Digger,
- Sir?
Get the weapons back to the store.
- Schoolie.
- Sir?
- Get busy emptying them sandbags.
- Yes, sir.
- Dodger.
- Sir?
Check your vehicles and let me have a list of deficiencies.
Yes, sir.
Sir.
See what you can do about the mess silver, will you, please?
And, Ben.
You'll be taking the parade this afternoon.
Pour me a whisky, will you please, Corporal Abou.
That'll be all, lad.
Draw...
...swords.
11th Hussars present and ready for your inspection, my lord.
I do not propose to recount my life in any detail what is what.
No damn business of anyone what is what.
I am Lord Cardigan. That is what.
Them Cherrybums, you see them tight,
I keep them tight.
10,000 a year out of my own pocket
I spend to clothe them.
A master cutler sharps their swords, and I keep them tight-stitched...
...cut to a shadow. Good.
If they can't fornicate, they can't fight...
...and if they don't fight hard,
I'll flog their backs raw...
...for all their fine looks.
Nolan. lt's Nolan.
There. Lewis!
Nolan!
He's seen us. l've not seen him for years, and yet it will be like yesterday. l hope l can love him as you do.
Dear friend!
-This is Clarissa?
-This is my dear Clarissa. l've landed two days.
We were handed letters at Aden.
You do scribble a lot, William.
Still, dear friend, l'm here. l am gazetted to the 11th Hussars, you know that.
My brother is to join the 11th Hussars,
Capt. Nolan. l'm playing the spy in Mufti. l've not joined yet, so l took the opportunity of a spy's eye at them.
Are they good, William?
They look good.
Cardigan has them looking good.
Yes, the mounts do look pretty dressed up.
Still...
...it is good to see you both, and here of all places. lt is good.
England is looking well.
-Fanny!
-Clarissa!
Ladies and gentlemen, l am sure you will all be very glad to join with me...
...in wishing the young couple long life...
...happiness, and all that they wish themselves.
Hear, hear.
The bride and bridegroom.
Young men of London, fall in and follow me, boys. lf you would not be starved by cruel masters...
...if you would not be ruled by anyone except the Queen, God bless her...
...but who do have the urge to seek wealth, fine clothes, and glory...
...you can do no better than to enlist...
...for the 11th Regiment of Hussars.
Culloden. Flanders. Salamanca. Waterloo.
An escort to Prince Albert on the occasion of his wedding...
...after which he called us his own.
God bless him.
Our dress is bright and warm.
Our mounts is mastered and mannered, gentle in ride and calm in battle.
Our officers just whisper.
They being of the opinion, like myself...
...that more can be done glorious by leading from the front...
...than can ever be brought off by prods up the arse from the rear.
Hold your head up, sir. l believe you would look a rare treat in stable dress.
-Are you respectable?
-l've often thought of enlisting. l thought you had, by the fine way you carry yourself. l'm a bad character, just out of jail. ln that case, you've already served Her Majesty.
Lord Cardigan's Cherrybums, follow me.
Keep yourselves clean, that's important.
You'll never want for money, and the glitter of a Hussar...
...is something l've seen the gay ladies pearling their eyes after.
Be obedient, be clean.
What is a pitfall is drink.
That will not concern me, for l do not drink.
What will concern you is, you'll never speak to an officer in that manner again.
Attention!
Scrub the scum clean.
Old Swaddy will settle you into your troop, show you the way of it.
Bossing your kit and being clean.
Right, strip off.
-What is the condition of them?
-They're all wobbly-boned.
Recruits in England are mostly wobbly and bad-formed.
There is no such thing as a wobbly officer.
What you sergeants never seem to understand...
...is the state of responsibility that an officer is in.
They worry. They hardly never wobble.
There is no place happier than a cavalry mess.
If one is a stupid, inconsiderate and lazy man...
...one can fit as a round peg into a snug round hole.
At times I am so pent up with their languor
I could grab of two of them...
...and bang their noddles together till their doodles drop off. l'm Codrington. l've come to join.
-Come to join, young fellow?
-Yes. Fond of riding are you?
-He's as green as grass.
-Or soon will be.
A fine growed-up fellow, though, with very neat feet.
Rupert.
You're a madman, sir.
And you are on your arse, sir. l'm thirsty. lt's the salt from the mutton.
-Have you got no money?
-l have none.
-ln your clothes.
-lt was....
-l did have money in my clothes.
-Did you? l'm out for a wet, a drop of beer.
Pongelow is the drink, they call it.
''How d'you think l paid her? l met her in the barracks yard...
''...and gently down l laid her.''
Private Metcalfe, for the wives.
Get back in there.
Lady Scarlett is giving a ball.
-Capt. Nolan.
-Lewis, how do you do?
Clarissa, Mrs. Morris, it is wonderful to have you back...
...you both back, it is wonderful. Come on. l danced as a boy on the eve of Waterloo.
-There was a war.
-That was a war. l don't think l belong, Duberly. l'm sure l do. Oh, l'm sure you do. l'm more a scientific poet.
-Scarlett.
-My lord.
All this swish and tit gets me sniffing nose up. l shall have to fetch it off tonight, Squire.
Had me Cherrybums out today, always makes me randified.
Duberly says he is despised by his officers and feared by his men.
Duberly says the 1 1th have become a laughing stock...
...for the shortness of their jackets and the tightness of their britches.
He says it is wicked, he commands over the heads of gifted officers...
...when he is such a blockhead.
They tell me that her pitcher has been too often to the well.
Duberly says I must stop looking at Lord Cardigan...
...as if I want to be ridden by him.
Duberly says he has left his wife...
...and is the most notorious casual person with women...
...immoral and licentious. l want to dance with Lord Cardigan more than anything else in the world. ls he not the very picture of the finest Englishman?
Has he not an exquisite head? l've just been introduced to
Squire De Burgh, charming fellow.
-l believe the next is a gallop.
-l believe it is. l don't have a programme. l don't gallop very well with ladies indoors, but may l have the honor?
-l shall be pleased.
-Excuse us.
You have a clever officer in Nolan,
Lord Cardigan.
He has written a book, which is not a diary but of a scientific nature.
-To do with soldiering.
-What, some damn novelist? l do envy soldiers' way.
What it must be to hunt one day and fight the next. ls war terrible? lt is the stuff. lt is the stuff we're all hoping for.
Soldiers do, Fanny, those that are waiting to use their talents.
What is most a talented officer should have? Courage and dash?
Some of that. A soldier should have some courage, of course.
Most of all, to know what is right.
Judgment, a feeling for decision.
A cavalry officer depends on the strike in his eye.
When and where to use it.
Comradeship. How high is that regarded in military things?
High. But true comrades are rare, like the truly loving wife is rare.
-William has talked of you constantly.
-l shall tell him to stop.
He says you are the finest horseman in England.
Does he say l'm the finest dancer? l'm not.
He goes further than that.
He says, probably in Europe, also.
He exaggerates.
William is indeed fortunate.
Are you happy to be a soldier's wife?
Should soldiers have wives, Capt. Nolan?
William should.
That's the Duke of Wellington's statue. lt was subscribed for by the whole nation, and now they don't know where to put it.
There is great concern.
-He was a fine soldier.
-So are you, l am told. l learned from a friend that you have a system. l'd like to write an article on you for the Times.
Come on, now!
That is Cardigan's system.
A shilling a man it costs him.
Can you beat that?
He reckons to train up a troop horse in less than 14 days, is his system.
-Capt. Nolan.
-And his system. l am not one of your new lights with tea and a Bible canteen. lt is not a revelation.
Both of you have plenty of it.
You, dear friend, l know, and you, Russell, l am sure. lt is, in a word, kindliness.
-How are you today, my beauty?
-She's very well, sir. Thank you, sir.
Pridmore. Dismount.
Prepare to mount. Mount.
Move like a Highgate whore, put some spring into your back.
You'll not learn nothing from watching this...
...but l should stay watching. l want you, what your name is, on the right.
Your name, on the right!
Do you not know your right?
You, on the right!
Where l'm pointing now!
You! l want you to watch this blade...
...for should it waver, slice it down fairly through my head...
...as hard as you can. Face front!
You've got no hooks on!
Sergeant, on the left.
Hooks is spurs.
-Name?
-Metcalfe.
You will wear your hooks at all times.
Sgt. Smith, what he is doing, don't look down...
...is marking you right from left.
He can read, so he knows his left from right.
What you've got there is a new foot...
...an army foot you've never had before. lt's like a foreign language to them.
They don't know any direction, back or front.
They'll never find their front when there isn't a black face to it. l always tell them, they'll know their front...
...from the many black nigger faces waving knives at them.
What we will do now is finding left.
Try it.
Try straw foot forward.
That officer....
Capt. Nolan, my lord.
Does that black savage belong to him?
Capt. Nolan has served in lndia and has an lndian servant.
That's no excuse.
Who are you, sir? l am Capt. William Morris of the 17th Lancers.
-Are you another of these damned lndians?
-He is an old-- lndia?
Don't tell me of lndia, you and your black rogue.
No use rubbing under it.
Officers who have served in lndia...
...are considered less worth than those who purchase their way...
...from one regiment to another. lt is, Nolan, at Kaffirs and savages you have put your men...
...which is something more than a round of drills.
You lndians are the only officers who led your men in war.
Listen, a linnet. lt is good to have you with us.
When you were away, you were in my thoughts every day. Wasn't he?
You were, indeed.
-You are both good friends now.
-William is very happy. l am.
We all are.
He does love you dearly.
-Are we now to become horse marines?
-We are.
''For thy smile would make a summer
''Where darkness else would be
''For thy smile could make a summer
''Where darkness else would be''
One, two, three, four.
Who gave you permission to dismount?
One, two...
...three, four.
Sahib mighty good horsemen, both Sahibs.
You're all a-bleeding-sleep! Left leg over.
Do you have a hunter for rides in the morning? l am fond of riding.
Warsham! Bring our new friend, Newboy.
Now, this is a thoroughly useful animal.
Brother!
You stupid, drunken cad.
You've nothing but a queer upbringing amongst cattle and bad practice.
-Rupert.
-All right.
Damn you, if you want to get shot off.
Gently.
Steady now.
Walk on, now.
Trot on.
Gently.
Xenephon's words should be painted on every stable end:
''Horses are not taught by harshness but by gentleness.''
For classical officers like Mogg here...
...the inscription should, of course, be in Greek.
-Mogg!
-Sir. l will not have an officer of mine shown up by an lndian wretch.
He made a monkey of you, sir.
-That man.
-Sir.
That man has not watered his horse.
Tell him to water his mount...
...straight off before the bridle is off so that he cools off. Tell him!
Tell him l shall take orders from a man, not a monkey.
''For those that wander
''They know not where
''Full of trouble and full of care
''To stay at home
''To stay at home is best''
Oh! l daresay, yes, for a soldier, some song.
You'll have to find an appointment out of reach of Lord Cardigan and his regiment.
He is a dangerous man.
He will see you broken, it's his practice.
-lt is a fine regiment.
-Yes, it is a fine regiment.
Fanny, hello. l promised to help her school her bob.
You must be aware of my regard for you.
Yes, of course. lt would be an offence between us if l denied it.
Looking everywhere.
-Clarissa, l--
-You won't go.
No, please pay me no attention. lt would hurt William if you were to leave.
Come here. l don't say it lightly or easily.
Not look.
Not hear. lt is not easy, Clarissa.
No. lt is the Lordship's command that only champagne be served in the mess tonight.
Are you cosseted, young man? l have your orders, my lord...
...to be here and eat lettuce. l am eating lettuce. l have eaten lettuce.
What it tells, my lord, is that as youngest officer...
...you will expect him to eat as a rabbit does, only lettuce. lt is signed by you, my lord.
So green, boy, you have been drawn.
Not my order, you should eat lettuce...
...though perhaps it will put some sap in your pizzle.
Does this tomfoolery make officers?
Perhaps, but it makes comrades.
Do you think we could have some Moselle,
Nolan?
-Of course. A bottle of Moselle, please.
-Thank you.
We always depend upon being seen to do our duty. l know if l'm up to something glorious in the field, l insist upon being seen.
There ain't much point, otherwise.
-What color is the Russian enemy?
-Sneaky color.
Gray. Your Russian is gray, which is why he can't be seen...
...which is why his promotion is slow.
There ain't one above a corporal in the whole lot...
...which is why we will cut 'em up.
With a little breeding, an Englishman can buy his advancement.
He and l are not able to buy our advancement.
We've had to obtain it by our abilities.
No use decanting it.
You can leave it on the table.
Thank you.
Couleur de Noir.
You are drinking beer, sir, porter beer.
-No, my lord.
-Yes.
-No.
-See it.
No, my lord.
Don't you ''no'' me. That is a black bottle. l assure you, my lord.
That is a black bottle, and you are drinking porter from it.
Champagne only. ln point of fact, l asked Capt. Nolan--
-You knew that!
-l am not aware. l am aware you are drinking porter at my table.
Sit down, Capt. Nolan.
Sit down, Featherstonehaugh.
What his Lordship said was that champagne only would be drunk...
...in the mess tonight. What he said.... lt is not porter, it is Moselle, my lord.
Apologize. lf l am in error--
Error? Don't quibble with me, sir. Beer. l will not have beer drunk in my mess.
Come back, Nolan.
Nolan, you will not leave the mess. Dog!
Devil upstart. lmpertinent lndian dog devil.
As President of the Mess Committee, what Cardigan would have me say is...
...you are guilty of disorderly behavior.
What you should consider in the future...
...is that the mess should be conducted like a gentleman's table...
...not a common ale house with black bottles.
That is an offensive thing to have to say...
...to have said, one officer to another, in front of brother officers.
Do you not know that, unlike a farmer, a gentleman decants his Moselle?
He doesn't drink it like beer. lf you cannot behave like a gentleman, you are to leave the regiment.
Will you shake hands with me, sir?
-There is no quarrel between us.
-You will. l will not, my lord.
-You flagrantly insult this officer.
-No insult is intended to this officer.
Shake hands, damn you.
You shall be arrested.
Why shall l be arrested? l shall have you arrested.
You are arrested.
Go to your quarters, sir, and be arrested.
Have you seen the Times this morning, Raglan? l have seen the Times, Airey.
''Black bottle.'' l'm very worried about the British army when it gets into the newspapers.
Whatever Lord Cardigan does is public news within an hour.
-lt is unfitting.
-''Black bottle.''
-What?
-What is shouted at him when he goes out? lt do bring the army up for snooks, you know.
Vulgar things.
Shouldn't say these vulgar things at him, Airey.
But what can we do?
Where are they going to put that statue, Airey? lt can't stay there, to be enjoyed by me alone.
They won't leave it there.
They don't know where to put it. lt's very much in my light for paperwork, Airey. l wish they'd take it away.
You and l are always of the custom, when in difficulty, to ask ourselves...
...how the great Duke would have acted and decided in similar circumstances.
We are. l am. l will.
He was surely right that when there is danger...
...it is the persons with a stake in the country, land, position, wealth...
...that are best able to able to defend it. l am an old man, Airey...
...and l've only got one arm to fight the war with. lt won't be enough.
Duberly says it's going to be war.
He says the Russians will fight...
...and the Prime Minister is faced towards peace, but carried towards war.
Duberly says l can go with the army. l can go, Duberly says, as a wife, which l am. lsn't it exciting?
-William wants to go.
-Soldiers will.
''Answer me to what l ask you.''
''Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten her nine farrow.''
''Come, high or low.
''Thyself and office deftly show!''
''He knows thy thought.
''Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
''Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
''Beware Macduff.''
Lewis is arrested over the black bottle. lt is sure. He is under arrest.
-Nolan?
-lt may be the end of his career.
-Mr. De Burgh, how do you do?
-Without you, sir.
Being under arrest, is it certainly the finish of his career as a soldier? lt is serious. lt is a serious thing for an officer.
There's Lord Cardigan.
Late for the play. Going to the war.
Black bottles!
Shall we go and boo him?
-Black bottles!
-Sit still before l hit you, girl. l'll form a picket. Come on, Henry.
Present me as a picket come to get the black bottle from the horse's mouth.
What black bottle?
My wife, Mrs. Duberly.
She's been enquiring after Capt. Nolan.
Under arrest, that man. l have placed him under arrest. lndeed, my lord. On what crime?
Failing to behave like a gentleman and turning the mess...
...into a disorderly house with black bottles.
We must go, Clarissa. l'll find out about Nolan.
Duberly never tells me anything.
Company, attention!
-Sergeant Major.
-Sir. ls he shaping? l would put him forward as a good clean man.
-Could he take the trumpet?
-That will be a good step for him.
Good. Something for you, Sergeant Major.
Carry on polishing, men.
-Sergeant Major.
-Sir. l want a report of any conversation
Capt. Nolan has with other officers.
You are to take note of whatever he might say and bring the information to me.
-l shall spy, my lord?
-You shall.
My lord....
To be asked to take up the spy.... l am much distressed to be asked such a thing, my lord.
After 20 years of coming up from private trooper...
...and keeping off the pongelow...
...not a drop since corporal. l shall inform Capt. Nolan. l can hardly do other.
Sergeant Major, it is better that you take a ball and put it in your own brain.
You are finished now, as if you had not ever been made.
What a waste.
Your duties!
Main guard present and correct, sir.
Stable guard present and correct, sir.
Number 1 squadron, present and correct, sir.
Straw foot, right foot.
Staff parade.
Ready, present for inspection, sir. ls he drunk?
-Sergeant Major.
-Yes.
This is all according to the articles of war.
I was drunk at my post.
It is not my place to criticize.
But it will have a grave effect on the noncommissioned officers...
...for it will show there is a slender thread.
One slip, and a soldier is deprived...
...of what has taken years of steady effort to obtain.
-Permission to carry on, sir.
-Farriers, do your duty.
One...
...two...
...three...
...four...
...five...
...six...
...seven...
...eight...
...nine...
...ten...
...eleven...
-Stand still and be quiet!
-...thirteen...
...fourteen....
Always one or two of your younger tyro officers brings up or flops over.
Faints away like lily at bedtime.
The time should be past when such treatment is inflicted on a British soldier.
They will not fight unless they are flogged to it.
Would you ask that of them?
Would you ask they fight like fiends of hell for money or ideas?
That would be unchristian.
...forty nine...
...fifty.
Punishment completed, sir.
Unfasten.
What will you do now, Sgt. Major? l doubt if he'll have a pension now...
...and that worries me. l shall continue in the service, though no pension.
Shall you enlist as a private in some other regiment...
...and hope to make your rank again? l shall, sir. l am too humbled to stay in the 11th. lt is humbling. l have had some humbling.
You can't avoid it.
There is no making without breaking.
-My lord, l must protest.
-Nolan, we don't flog officers.
-Am l still under arrest, my lord?
-You would prefer that you are released? l do not wish to be released from arrest. l wish for a court-martial...
...that l may state some things of how you asked my fellow officers to spy on me.
You lie, sir. lt is you who spy.
Are spying up against me.
You shirk your duties, sir. l can hardly shirk my duties if l am not under command, but arrested.
You lying scoundrel. lndian rogue.
You will not have a court-martial.
You were born dishonored and a lie, and you will die in lies.
Come back here! l have not finished with you.
Try not to hit him, Nolan.
We must remember our rank.
You blackguard, what do you whisper? l am ashamed that you are not polite to our rank. We are your own officers.
Officer? Paymaster Duberly!
That ain't a rank, it's a trade.
One day, there will be an army where troopers need not be forced to fight...
...by floggings and hard reins.
An army...
...a Christian army, that fights because it is paid well to fight...
...and fights well because its women and children are cared for...
...an army that is efficient and of a professional feather.
I must fight for such an army.
Dear friend.
That army will bring the first of the modern wars...
...and the last of the gallop.
-lt does look like war.
-Does it? l do think the French have been asking for it for some time...
...ever since they had my arm.
But it won't be the French this time, will it?
Won't it be the French? l've got a map somewhere of who it ought to be.
-Will you see Capt. Nolan, 11th Hussars?
-Yes.
Well, it might be the French, it might always be the French. l knew it would be.
Nolan, Capt. Nolan, sir.
-Have you got a map?
-My lord, may l ask--
Speak up, he's a bit deaf when he's thinking, and that statue doesn't help.
My lord.
You're the chap.
You've been shouting at Lord Cardigan.
Calling him things.
You've put the army in the newspapers.
My lord, l request the privilege of being granted a court-martial.
Perhaps they could put it over one of the new railway stations.
Court-martial? My dear Capt. Nolan.
Well, what can we do about it?
You're becoming a laughing stock, gentlemen.
You're appearing far too frequently in the newspapers. ln the case of Capt. Nolan, now...
...Lord Raglan refuses his request for a court-martial...
...that it might be prejudicial to the good of the service and cause public disquiet.
-Gen. Airey, l--
-lf you persist in this matter...
...you will forfeit the sympathy of every officer of rank in the service.
As for the conduct of Lord Cardigan...
...Lord Raglan expects that in the future his lordship will exercise the forbearance...
...and discretion befitting an officer and a gentleman.
We are being taken towards war by popular fervor.
There is no reason for war, there is no real understanding of the issues...
...because there are hardly any issues involved.
Let us not pretend that Christian England can find common ground...
...with infidel Turkey against Christian Russia.
''Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.''
Restrain yourselves, my friends. Peace.
Peace, my brethren.
Restrain yourselves, my friends.
-So excited.
-Yes.
Everybody is so excited. l'm not excited. ls it such an exciting thing to do?
Yes, it is the most exciting thing in the world.
Perhaps there is no other life for a man, is there, Lewis?
No, there is not.
How sad.
-Why sad?
-Because it all ends in death.
-l will not have you thinking of death.
-No. l don't know what has made me think of death.
War has made her think of death. l do believe it has.
Dear Clarissa, it is inevitable.
Until such savages are sufficiently civilized to understand...
...and abide by decisions arrived at by arbitration...
...we will have, we must have, war.
Yes.
Now, l feel l should propose a toast or something of the kind.
-l'm not sure what.
-Not the Crimea.
No.
Lewis, what about you?
Your new appointment.
No.
No?
The three of us.
To the three of us.
Lewis.
-l am with child.
-You are. l didn't know.
William has been longing to tell you. l am so unhappy.
No. You should both of you be happy. lt is a happy thing. l beg you not to entertain any thoughts other than....
They're there, Lewis, like unwelcome guests.
No, not unwelcome, welcome.
Please take my hand. l long for it to be yours.
My dear, l must join William. lt is some madness in you that has infected us all. l shall not be the same from knowing you, nor William either.
When you are with him, there....
Remember, my heart is....
-Lord Lucan.
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Don't treat me as if l was a child, sir.
Sebastopol.... Now what is it?
-Lord Lucan.
-Lord Raglan.
Good, good. We have some things.
Do l get command?
You?
Control of the Mediterranean.
That's what the Czar's at, and then afterwards lndia, and he will have war.
The Duke of Wellington always thought of you highly...
-...found you very qualified, Lucan.
-He is.
That is fact.
To do it stylish and sicken the Czar...
...we are to put Sebastopol to the flames, and that is our intention. ls there something for Scarlett to have? l think Scarlett should have something. l'll tell him he'll have something, but you don't know what.
-l do know what.
-Am l to have the army, or am l not?
Not. l have the army. l will command the expedition myself.
Of course you will. l would. lt is my earnest hope that you will consent to assume command of the cavalry.
Very well.
What is Scarlett to have, Airey?
Scarlett will have the Heavy Brigade and Lord Cardigan, the Light Brigade.
Cardigan? The Light Brigade?
That damned never-out brother-in-law of mine.
You threaten me with Cardigan? l'll not have him or his red-shanked ridgebacks under my command. l'll not command him.
Capt. Nolan's reporting, sir, though his regiment is about to sharpen...
...l have persuaded him there is duty and honor for him with us. l'm sure you will see that there is much to be gained...
...by an amicable settlement of any difference...
...between you and Lord Cardigan, for the good of your country.
Then make it known to that empty-headed muff of a brother of mine, that Brudenell...
...that l command the cavalry, and l command him.
Tell the fool, in simple manner that he'll understand, he is under my command.
Of course.
-You've got Sebastopol.
-l don't want any damned Sebastopol.
-But l was shown it on the map.
-l told you. No damned Sebastopol.
Sir Colin Campbell, Highland Brigade.
Gen. Scarlett, Heavy Brigade.
Sir Richard England, Third lnfantry division.
Sir John Burgoyne,
Superintendent Royal Engineers. l came to be offered a command.
Not serve under that fool, Lucan. l knew...
...the moment l saw his biscuit face sopping up wet around the horse guards...
...he'd be here, starting his wheedling. l'm sure that after a little while,
Lord Cardigan...
...you may be persuaded such an arrangement may be made to work.
After all, you will have the Light Brigade.
Dash and fire, eh?
Yes, Cardigan, you'll have the Light
Brigade. Dash and fire it is.
Lucan couldn't make himself fit to command a tent. Command an escort.
Not fit to command a troop of knackered tailors on stubbed donkeys.
Airey, those two, don't let them sit together.
We must do what we can to keep them apart.
Things are serious and they are silly in ways.
-My lord.
-Lord Raglan.
Sit down, gentlemen.
War. This is war, gentlemen.
Our passage to lndia is threatened, l should think. Wouldn't you?
The honor, the reputation, the glory of England is threatened...
...and the Queen's majesty is sure to be threatened, she is. lf poor, brave, weak little, sick little Turkey....
''The sick man of Europe.''
Yes, though l prefer to consider her as a young lady, hands up, flutter...
...defenseless. lf she should fall to the tyrant.... lf the Turks go down like cards, flip-flop...
...then next up our own Solent...
...and our own Queen, will come the Russians, ships and guns...
...to rip our country into shame.
The Russians. The Russians.
The Russians. The Russians.
The Russians.
Poor little Turkey.
Poor little Turkey!
Attention for Mr. Cornet Codrington, the orderly officer.
Me darlin' soldier, wait till l kiss you clean.
Are they winking at you, sir?
Permission to speak, sir.
Mrs. Mitchell, sir.
Are all the wives going, sir, or just a few? l'm strong, sir.
And so am l. l can't say. l really can't say.
One in six, sir.
One in six?
You look tremendous.
This is the beginning of a very long test, my dear William. l see you have your cattle slung aboard. l must watch for old Treasurer, that he is handled gently. l have a letter of importance for you, but orders are not to be read...
...until we up anchor. lmpressed on me, from Clarissa.
Where's Lord Cardigan?
Get into line, Lord Cardigan.
Light Brigade, with me.
What?
Trooper!
Pull those ropes faster.
Soldier!
Tomorrow, Calamita Bay. ls it aptly named, do you think, William? l know you worry about my rheumatism. lt is gone, almost gone.
-l wish l could come with you.
-We're going to swim and things.
But Henry, l can swim.
When we're settled, l'll see that you're rowed ashore.
Dear husband, kiss.
Dear wife, kiss.
Lift it.
You! Corporal.
Inside.
Turn your pockets out, corporal.
You won this gambling, of course.
Why do you think it is?
Why do you think you have so much and the rest of us so little?
One day, you're going to make a slip.
All this wealth you've got won't check against my list.
And when you do, when that happens,
I'll be ready.
Then you'll be in there.
In my cage.
I'm not playing at being provost marshal.
And I never heard of luck that didn't run out.
Yours will, depend on it. Because you're like all criminals, you're greedy.
I'd like to point out that
I don't have to put up with this crap.
I'm not in your two-bit army.
I'm in our two-bit Army.
If you're looking for something to live for, when we get out of this...
...come looking for me.
I'll hand you your head.
We'll see.
But you make one slip, just one...
...and we'll see how long you survive in my cage.
And after my cage, I'll personally...
I'll personally hand you over to the Japs.
- What's happening here?
- Nothing, sir.
I'm just searching the corporal.
You're in order to search him, question him, Grey...
...but threats and abuse aren't on.
They aren't on.
You ought to know better than to go around dressed like that.
Asking for trouble. Just asking for it.
Even so, quite wrong to threaten.
Not the way to treat an enlisted man.
I think...
...an apology...
If you request it, sir...
...then I apologize.
- Very good.
All right, corporal, you can go, but watch the way you dress.
Yes, thank you, colonel.
- Yeah?
- He had one invite out to number four.
Okay, I'll take care of it.
Find Col. Brant and give him this.
Tell him not to be so late next time.
Right. Do you know where he'd be?
By the jail. It's his day for watching Grey.
- That's all?
- That's all for him.
Then go find that guy with the arm.
He's got a delivery.
Come on, Tojo, time for tea.
Choice of litter, right?
Right.
- You hear the news, Max?
- No.
The war's gonna last another 10 years. Official.
The last three years was just for openers.
Lee told me to tell you he'd done your laundry.
I asked him especially, and he told me to tell you.
Take one.
King, you don't have to...
It's okay. I'll call you if I need you.
You want my chow today?
- You bet.
- You got it.
Max. See that guy out there with the wog?
Get him for me.
Hey, fella.
The King wants to see you.
- The who?
- The King.
What, is it Garden Party Day or something?
Save the jokes.
He wants to see you.
I'm not joking. We take our royal family very seriously.
- What's he want to see me about?
- How would I know? Come on.
Extraordinary court procedure.
Come on. Come on.
- I was sent for, I believe.
- Yeah.
Yeah. Take a seat.
Do you smoke?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Well, help yourself.
How come we never met before?
- No idea. I haven't been anywhere.
- What's your name?
Marlowe, Peter Marlowe.
What's yours?
How's that chair feel?
Fine.
- Cost me 80 bucks.
- Did it?
- Yes. I'd never have guessed.
- You'd have said more, huh?
I don't think I'd have said anything, really.
I've never been a great chair-price guesser.
I was gonna fix some chow.
Wanna join me?
I've just had lunch, thank you.
You could use some more, couldn't you? You want an egg?
Excuse me, what's all this in aid of?
- Do what?
- People just don't give eggs away.
Well, I'm not people.
- Am I, Max?
- No. No, you're not people, King.
- Well, you want an egg or don't you?
- Well, of course I want it.
Okay, then, you got it.
How do you like it?
- Fried.
- Okay.
So you got yourself a fried egg.
You're not related to either
Fortnum or Mason, are you?
Who are they?
It doesn't matter. They run a little family grocery shop back home.
That's pretty neat, huh?
Max wired it for me.
Just telling him you wired the hot plate.
- It's working okay, huh?
- It better be.
- I gotta impress the British.
- The British are impressed.
- You speak it pretty good, don't you?
- British? I mean, English?
- No, you know, the lingo, out there.
- Yes, I suppose so. Not too bad.
Say something for me now.
- In Malay?
- Yeah.
- What sort of thing?
- Anything. I just want to hear you.
That's pretty good.
You hear that, Max?
What's that mean?
It doesn't really have a literal translation.
But roughly, it means:
"When do I have to kiss thee on the ass?"
After the egg, never before meals.
Plates.
Thank you.
How about that?
Not bad. Not bad at all.
The egg ain't been laid that tastes better than that.
Don't get excited, Fortnum.
When we say not bad, we don't mean "not bad."
- We mean it's bloody marvelous.
- Yeah?
What do you mean when you say it's bloody marvelous?
Bit dicey.
Forget it.
- Lift your feet.
- What?
Lift your feet.
- You're slumming, aren't you, Marlowe?
- Don't be a snob.
Never make a good policeman if you're a snob.
Everyone looks the same with their knickers down.
- Where's your armband?
- In my pocket.
It should be on your arm.
Those are orders.
- They're Jap orders. We stuff those.
- They're also camp orders. Put it on.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, sir.
Just recovering from the pleasure of seeing you twice today.
Col. Sellars has reported the theft of a gold ring.
A gold ring. Gee.
- Gee, that's tough, sir.
- I believe you know Col. Sellars.
- Could you describe him to me?
- You play cards with him?
That Col. Sellars. Yes. Yes.
Plays cards like an English officer and a gentleman. He would, wouldn't he?
Don't press your luck too hard, corporal. Just answer the questions.
- Did he ever show you the ring?
- No, he never even discussed marriage.
- I'm warning you.
- You sure you're not accusing me?
- Got a light, Grey?
- No. I'm not accusing anybody.
Then can I borrow your Ronson?
- Ronson?
- Yeah, it's in your top pocket, I think.
Thank you.
Well, now, this is new, isn't it?
Yes. It was mine.
- We were playing poker. I lost it to him.
- You what?
I lost it to him at poker.
I had a straight, but he had better.
Tell him.
- We were playing stud...
- What were the cards?
- His or mine?
- His.
- Aces on twos.
- You're lying, Marlowe!
Why, Grey, what a thing to say!
It was pathetic.
I thought I had him with a straight...
...so I threw in the lot.
Threw in the Ronson.
How do you play stud, Marlowe?
- Stud?
- Yes, how's it played?
- Stud? You mean ordinary stud?
- Yes.
We'll show you. There's nothing like a demo.
You see, it was my hole card...
- I said I wanted you to tell me!
- Temper!
Well, never mind. I don't need the cards to show you.
Four cards faceup.
You can imagine that.
And one down, one in the hole.
It's just like Happy Families, really, in the nursery.
We never had a nursery, Marlowe.
That was a close one.
Too bloody true.
Here.
You're on the payroll from here on in. Twenty bucks a week.
Okay, we'll make it 30.
Shove your money.
- What'd I say?
- It's what I said. Shove your money.
One can't expect bloody Yanks to understand.
All I did was up two 10s to 30.
When someone drops you in it, you don't pay them for getting you out.
So work your money.
- What'd I do?
- You did nothing, King.
Thirty's above scale.
You treated him right.
Well, screw the British.
Yeah, screw them.
Allied forces are still making progress in Belgium...
In the Philippines, forces drove a bridgehead in their thrust for Manila.
Formosa was bombed in daylight by B-29s without loss.
In Burma, British and Indian armies are within 30 miles of Mandalay.
Those were the news headlines.
The next broadcast will be at 0600...
- You okay?
- Yes, fine.
The old bladder's flaring up, though.
- What is it?
- Nothing. I just been to the park.
I'm happy to say the old bladder's working. That's good news.
Beautiful. Thank you for waking me up to tell me.
God, give me a piece of your courage.
I'm so frightened.
I'm such a bloody coward.
You really ate them in Java?
Not only in Java. Here in Changi.
So did you.
What?
Now, we agreed we wouldn't cook anything revolting...
...unless we discussed it. We agreed.
- I know we agreed!
You were dying.
And why do we collect them?
It's pure protein.
For the hospital, for the seriously sick.
You were sick, remember?
You were dying.
- I really ate them, did I?
- You asked for second helpings.
Well, next time, I want to know.
And that's a bloody order.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Huh?
- Okay, I'll take it.
- Right.
Col. Smedley-Taylor said two of your men were fighting.
Only two? That's a change. Who?
Cpl. Townsend and
Pvt. Gurble. I've got them in jail.
- I'll deal with them after roll call.
- Sir?
Pity about Marlowe's Ronson, wasn't it?
Yes, he should have been more careful. Mug's game, gambling.
- Do you mind if I see them alone?
- No, sir.
Let them out, will you?
Right. Why were you fighting? I want the truth now, no flannel. Townsend?
Well? I'm waiting.
This bloody sod accused me of stealing me mate's grub.
- You were.
- That's enough of that.
If you have a charge to make, make it.
Come on. We haven't got all night.
It's my month on cookhouse detail, and today we had 184 to cook for.
- He's me best mate, and I trusted him.
- I never touched a grain. I swear.
When I got back, we were short two blokes' rations.
- I know, but I never touched it.
- Were they short?
- Sir, I never touched them.
- Were they short like he said?
Yes, sir.
Check the weights.
- I checked them under his nose.
- We must check them again.
Lead the way, will you? We'll go to the storehouse and settle it.
That day, on my last leave...
...she said...
I said, "I'll always keep myself clean for you."
Oh, God, I'll make any sort of a bargain with you.
Just don't let her think that I'm dead.
Don't let her think that I'm dead.
As far as I'm concerned,
Gurble, the case is proved.
You're out of my regiment.
You're dead. You don't exist.
You keep your mouth shut.
- My bloody oath...
- Keep your mouth shut!
The news was good last night.
We're only 30 miles from where the flying fishes play.
By the way, I nearly forgot. The wife asked if you'd like to come to dinner.
We're just having a few people in, nothing formal.
Would you say thank you to her?
But I have a dinner engagement.
Well, there it is. Good.
Another time, perhaps. Good.
That was my mistake the other day.
I got stupid. I offered the dough because I wanted to thank you.
It's okay. I got a lousy temper and an awful accent. I sound toffee-nosed.
You British insult easy. Can't catch one of these cruds passing up a buck.
Nothing. Go find Prouty in the
Garden of Eden and finish the deal.
I'm different from Hawkins.
I let my doggy off the leash.
Look, can I offer you a Kooa?
I mean, is that all right?
Sure. That's different.
There is a radio in this hut!
Let me handle it.
Now let me in, will you?
- Good morning, captain.
- It is not a good morning.
There is a radio. A radio is against the orders of the Imperial Army.
Yes, well,
I don't know anything about it.
- Do you know anything about it?
- No, sir.
- What about you?
- No, sir.
Where's the wireless?
Now, look, it's got to be found, so where is it?
I order those responsible to hand it over immediately.
I'm asking you once more.
You, what's your name?
- It. Spence, sir.
- Where is it hidden?
I don't know what you're talking about, sir.
Grey! You're provost marshal.
If there's one here, it's your responsibility.
- I know nothing of a wireless.
- You should!
I'll have you court-martialed, and it'll show on your record.
- Brough! What do you know?
- Nothing. And it's Maj. Brough.
It's just the sort of trouble you bloody Americans cause.
- I don't have to take that.
- You stand to attention...
I'm senior American officer, and I don't have to take that from you!
There's no radio or wireless, as you call it, in this hut that I know of.
And if there was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell you, colonel.
Well, then, we'll search the hut.
That's what we'll do.
Every officer will stand by his bed at attention.
- Do you hear me? Attention!
- Shut up, Jones.
- There's a wireless in this hut, sir.
- Yes, and I said, shut up.
- Can I help you?
- There is a radio here.
- According to the Geneva Convention...
- I know the code of ethics.
If you believe there's a radio, search for it. If you know where, take it.
- It's your job to enforce the law.
- My job is to enforce civilized law.
If you want to cite law, then obey it yourself.
Give us the food and medical supplies to which we're entitled.
- One day you will go too far, colonel.
- One day I'll be dead, captain.
Probably I'll die of apoplexy...
...enforcing insane laws imposed by incompetent administrators.
I shall report your impertinence to Gen. Shima.
Yes, please do.
Then ask him who ordered that each man should catch 20 flies a day.
And that they should be collected, counted and delivered daily, by me.
Everybody outside, please.
Now you may make your search, captain.
Who belongs to this bunk?
I have no idea. I'll ask.
And this. And this.
Who uses this bunk?
- Your name?
- Capt. Daven, infantry.
- Did you make this radio?
- Yes.
I ordered him to make it.
It's my responsibility.
- Is this true?
- No.
- Who else knew about your radio?
- No one. I made it alone.
It's all right, old boy.
I'm just as frightened as you are.
You men, pick up this bunk and follow me.
Doctor, could you come here a minute, please?
He's lucky. No more aches.
What'd he die of?
Changi blues, mostly.
You mean, the will to live?
No, not quite that...
...corporal.
It is corporal, isn't it?
Cpl. King?
He quit believing in the pigheaded, totally unreasonable will not to die.
There's a difference, you know.
Perhaps you don't know.
I don't suppose that kind of subtlety bothers you very much.
Maybe not. Touch wood.
I wouldn't put much faith in that wood, probably contaminated.
You don't have any tobacco, do you?
- I hear you're good for a little extra.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I was just gonna bring some to him.
He won't miss it. Thank you.
You must tell me your secret one day, corporal.
Medically, it ought to be very valuable.
I'm just lucky, sir.
Oh, no.
That won't do.
Oh, thanks. Can you spare it?
I don't smoke. Never have.
Could you get my boots, old man?
I've got to get up.
- Where are they?
- At the foot of the bed.
I've kept those.
- I've kept them in good shape.
- Yes, you did.
There.
I've had enough, thanks.
I'm dying.
Yes.
- Orderly.
- Yes?
Get the corpse detail to take Sgt. Masters' bed.
Capt. Daven's will be free too.
But don't let them take the boots.
Yes, sir. What about Col. Hutton?
Do I give him quinine?
- Of course give him quinine.
- Well, I'm sorry. Just asking.
Only doctors authorize drugs.
Give him quinine and stop pretending you're Florence Nightingale.
There are two appendectomies for tomorrow morning.
Right.
I'll see them before I go off.
- Do you want me to do them?
- No, I will.
- Evening, doctor.
- Hello, Stevie.
By the way, I finished the autopsy on the man found in the borehole.
Death was from suffocation.
If you find a man headfirst down a borehole...
...death will likely be from suffocation.
- Yes.
Well, I wrote...
I put on the death certificate:
"Suicide while the balance of the mind was disturbed."
- Do you want that?
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Have they identified the body?
Yes. It was a Pvt. Gurble.
Unusual name.
- Not the way I'd choose for suicide.
- No.
- Unless, of course, he was put there.
- Oh?
- Why do you say that?
- Well, they held a court of inquiry.
- He'd been caught stealing rations.
- I see.
Either way, murder or suicide,
I'd say he deserved it, wouldn't you?
Yes, I suppose so.
- I'd better go and finish my rounds.
- Yes. Well, good night, colonel.
Want a smoke, Stevie?
- There it is!
- Don't let it get away!
- There it is!
- Don't let it get away!
- Watch out, watch out!
- Get it out!
- Get him!
- There he is!
- Get him! Get him!
- Right there!
All right, knock it off!
Just hold it! Knock it off.
Will you knock it off?!
Now, just leave it where it is.
Don't kill it.
- I got a better idea. Tex?
- Yeah?
Get a blanket.
- Blanket?
- Yeah. Yeah. Come on, will you?
That's it. You and Max trap it.
Come on. I want it alive.
- With my blanket? You crazy?
- I'll get you another one. Catch it.
Come on. Give me the other end.
Let's throw it down and jump, okay?
- Right.
- Come on. Now!
- I got it!
- Take it!
- Go on.
- Hey, I got it!
All right. All right.
Knock it off! Now, quiet!
- Max, you take it.
- I don't want it. It's his blanket.
Tex, you go put on the java while I work this out.
Gather around and hear the words of the King.
And the whole court strained in obedience.
Come on, come on, come on.
All right, so we got ourselves a real live rat, right?
- Yeah. So?
- So? So use your imagination.
What don't we have a lot of in Changi?
Yeah, besides that.
- Come on. Food. Right?
- What's that got to do with rats?
God.
You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you?
You got it.
- Only we're not gonna eat it.
- Eat it?
- Eat what? What's he talking about?
- Rat meat.
You're out of your mind.
Who would buy rat meat?
Let me finish. Of course nobody will buy it if they know it's rat.
But suppose they don't.
Suppose we say it's rabbit.
There are no rabbits in Malaya.
We'll think of something else.
What are you all knocking it for?
Do you think we can get away with squirrel?
That's it, squirrel. Good.
Still not a lip-smacker, is it?
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.
I know.
- I know. Deer.
- Deer?
What kind of game you got back home?
No, not the usual kind of deer.
I mean rusa tikas.
They're about...
Well, they're tiny.
They're about 8 inches high.
The natives consider them to be a great delicacy.
Rusa tikas translated means "mouse deer."
That's it, then.
We're in the rusa tikas business.
Now, first we got to find out whether it's male or female.
Then we get the opposite one, and we're on our way to our first million.
Now, how we gonna sex it?
Hey. I read in Reader's Digest that the Japs are big sexers.
- That's with eggs, dummy.
- Leave it to me. I'll tell you.
Okay. You got the job.
Now we got two things to do.
Liberate another rat, and then we gotta find out about their habits.
- Well, Vexley's your man for that.
- Vexley? Who's Vexley?
Join my class?
- You really want to join my class?
- If it wouldn't be too much trouble.
No. Delighted, old chap.
Delighted.
- Squadron Leader Vexley.
- Pleased to meet you.
Hello, Peter.
All right, then.
Comfortable?
Good. Now, today...
Today I was going to talk about...
...the largest of mammals: Whales.
Do you know anything about whales?
Huh?
Whales are, without doubt...
...the highest form to which nature has aspired.
Now, you take the sulfur-bottomed whale...
...the most powerful animal in existence.
Now, you take its mating habits.
Its mating is marvelous.
There's no other word for it.
The male...
...starts his titillation...
...by blowing glorious clouds of spray.
He then pounds the water with his tail near to the female...
...who waits with patient lust...
...on the ocean's surface.
He then dives deep and soars up out of the water...
...huge, vast, enormous...
...and crashes back with thundering flukes...
...churning the water into spray, pounding at the water.
- You have a question?
- Yes, what about rats?
I beg your pardon?
This is interesting about whales, but what about rats?
- What about rats?
- Do you know anything about them?
Rodents are entirely different.
Now, to return...
- What do you mean?
- What?
How are they different?
I'll deal with them in the next series.
There's nothing about them to like.
Why are they disgusting, sir?
I mean, do they have bad habits?
- Everything about them is...
- Cigarette, sir?
Why...
...thank you, corporal.
Take a couple, sir.
I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail.
Well...
Right. Now...
So, gentlemen, the female can have up to 12 litters a year...
...and anything up to 14 per litter.
The young being born blind and helpless 22 days.
Twenty-two days, gentlemen, after contact.
The young open their eyes in two weeks...
...and they become sexually active in two months.
- Holy cow!
- Know what that means?
That means in six months, we're gonna be knee-deep in tikas.
Holy cow.
On the other hand, they do have some rather nasty habits.
Number one: They're cannibals.
Number two: They'll fight if left to their own devices.
But on the credit side, they'll eat anything.
I repeat, anything, dead or alive.
Which means we got no logistics problem.
I got another one.
While you jokers are talking,
I'm out doing.
- It's the right mate too.
- How do you know?
- I looked.
- Well, what are we waiting for?
Tex, Dino, keep lookout.
Hey.
Looks like Vexley knows what he's talking about.
Start counting the days, gentlemen.
He looks different.
Don't you think he looks different somehow?
Yeah, he looks like a married man.
All clear?
Come on, we got things to do.
You wanna do something for me tonight? Do a little interpreting?
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
What have you got in there, Marlowe?
- Food.
- Could I see it, please?
Stop picking on me, Grey.
Where'd you get it?
- I was given it.
- We can guess who by, can't we?
- Where are you taking it?
- To the hospital.
- Who for?
- Mac. Any more questions?
No. Not for the time being.
Don't forget, you and your crook friend are on my list.
I haven't forgotten about the Ronson.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I haven't broken orders.
You will, Marlowe, you will.
If you sell your soul, you've got to pay sometime.
Don't give me all that sally army stuff.
I judge a man by the company he keeps.
Your friend's a crook, a liar and a thief.
You're right about one thing, Grey.
He is my friend.
But he's not a crook and he's not a thief.
But he's a liar.
We're all liars, Grey.
You denied the radio.
You gotta be a liar to stay alive.
Do a lot of things to stay alive.
Like kissing a corporal's ass to get food?
I said it first, Grey.
You won't believe me, but I said it before you.
He's not interested.
He says the market's very poor.
Yeah, that's why he's here risking his neck.
Tell him 3000.
Tell him I'm sorry it's overpriced.
- He offers 600.
- Tell him to work it.
No, no. That's a joke.
Now, you're doing very well.
Tell him I can't insult the owner with such an offer.
- How'd we do?
- Well, he's gone to 1000.
I'd need more than that to live with the smell.
Tell him I sold one just like it a week ago to one of his buddies for 3000.
Tell him it's only because I like his smiling face, et cetera...
...you know, the usual horse manure.
Work him up a few hundred at a time.
I gotta go consult with the owner.
Four hundred? Why, everybody knows an Omega's worth at least 2000.
I agree, sir, but you know, beggars can't be choosers, sir.
I did my best. I really put it to him.
I'm sure you did, I'm sure, corporal.
Not your fault, don't think that.
But... But what am I to do?
Could you have one more try? Please!
See what you can do. Please!
I have great faith in you.
I couldn't take less than 1200.
Well, I don't think I can do much, sir, but...
Okay, I'll give it another try.
- Twenty-six hundred dollars?
- Twenty-six hundred.
Watch it because he spits when he's doing the "I've been robbed" speech.
Poor man's Bela Lugosi.
He'll come back.
- He's gone to 2100.
- That's what he intended to pay.
Tell him 2600 or nothing.
Twenty-two hundred, and that's his final offer.
Yeah, it probably is too.
All right, tell him I accept.
Tell him he's too tough for me.
Tell him I'll have to give my commission to make up the difference.
- Only 900?
- Afraid so, sir.
I had to sweat blood to get that.
Nine hundred, less commission.
Terribly disappointed.
It's the last thing I owned.
Well, things are getting tougher all the time. Good night, sir.
- I didn't bring you much luck, did I?
- You owe me 2 bucks.
- Two what? For what?
- It's your commission.
You don't think I'd put you to work for nothing, do you?
I'm not entitled to anything for interpreting. I was happy to do it.
Listen, take it, $108. Ten percent.
It's yours. You earned it.
Look, how in the hell can I earn $108 out of a total of 2200...
...and there was no profit?
I'm not taking it.
Boy, I don't know how you survived in this world up to now.
Look, let's go through the facts of life.
Now, your gallant Maj. Prouty is selling me a phony.
So he deserves whatever he gets.
Think he gives a damn about me if the watch backfires?
Maybe he stole it, who knows?
Anyway, he asked me 1200.
Now, I asked Torusumi 26...
...and he settles for 22 because he knows he can get rid of it for 35.
I give Prouty 900, less 10 percent.
And he goes home thinking that he's taken me, so everybody's happy.
Now, as to overheads, I had to pay
$100 to get the watch fixed.
You know, so it shouldn't fall apart in his hands.
Another 120 for various safety measures.
That makes 1120.
Now 1120 from 2200 is $1080 even.
Ten percent of that is 108.
I gave you 110, so you owe me 2 bucks. Okay?
You worked for it. It's yours. Nobody is giving you anything for nothing.
No.
Well, cheer up, old boy.
Listen, on your way home, you'll see Brant.
Give him his wages, will you?
- Brant? You mean Col. Brant?
- Yeah, Col. Brant.
Give him his wages. He'll take it.
Well, trust me. Good night.
Good night.
Murder!
Murder. I want the charge of murder sworn out.
I demand a court-martial for murder!
Look. Look! Look!
That beast killed one of my children.
I want a charge of murder sworn out!
- What beast are you talking about?
- That beast, that murderer!
He's mad. It was an accident.
The dog got off the leash, that's all.
I keep telling him it was an accident.
He killed it. That bloody beast killed my child and ate it!
- Colonel, it's a hen, not a child.
- My hens are children, idiots.
I'll kill him and his bloody beast.
I've said I'm sorry.
If I had the money, I'd buy you 10,
20 hens, but I can't.
- For God's sake, do something.
- What can I do, except report it?
- You'll have to get rid of this dog.
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?
- What I said, get rid of it. Kill it!
- You can't order me to do that.
- Like hell I can't.
You've been told to keep out of this area. It killed the hen.
I'm gonna kill it. The dog's mine to kill, an eye for an eye.
Col. Foster, I have ordered
Capt. Hawkins to destroy his dog.
It's mine. I'm gonna kill it just like it killed my baby.
Col. Foster, accept my apologies.
I'll do anything you want...
...but let me keep my dog.
- If you don't get away, colonel...
...I'll put you under arrest.
I'll get even with you. Murderer.
I'll get even with you.
I'll get even with you.
I'll get even with you.
My baby.
My baby.
Grey, please take back that order, please.
It's such a small thing to ask.
I'll do anything at all.
But I can't. You know I can't.
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
You'll have to kill your dog.
I don't care how you do it, but do it quickly.
Help! Help us.
Somebody, please help us.
Somebody, help us.
Please.
You're sure about this, are you?
And that was the whole message, just "come here, 54"?
Come on in.
It's my birthday.
I thought I'd invite you for dinner.
It's real, is it? Is it real?
Is it real pig?
You fantastic sod, you're just the bloody end. Where did you get it?
A long story.
You couldn't invent the wheel, by any chance?
- What's all the big noise about?
- Griffiths, is that you?
- Want to get us jailed or something?
- No, sorry. Sorry.
- Keep the noise down, you stupid git!
- Who was it?
That's Griffiths. He owns this cell.
I hired it at 3 bucks an hour.
- You don't get nothing for nothing.
- You hired the cell?
Griffiths is a smart cookie.
Thousands of guys here, right?
No peace and quiet. Griffiths hires it out for anybody wants to do a Garbo.
I bet this wasn't his original idea.
There's no pulling the wool over your eyes, is there?
How much you make on it, corporal?
Just an honest 10 percent.
Check the door seals, Tex.
This smell gets out, we can get torn apart.
I think just a little more salt.
What do you think, sir?
I wouldn't know. I'm drooling so much
I lost my sense of taste.
Pete?
- Well, just a dash, just a dash.
- May I? May I?
You may be right.
Only a touch, mind.
Yes, well, thanks for licking the spoon.
Now, come on, you've got to tell us, where did you get it?
It's... It's Hawkins' dog.
- Mother of God. Hawkins' dog?
- You said pig.
- Now, don't kid us, will you?
- No, but you said pig.
No, you said pig. I didn't say anything.
Good night!
Oh, God, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
What's the difference?
Dog, pig, what's the big difference?
Meat's meat.
He's quite right. There's nothing wrong with eating dog.
- The Chinese eat them all the time.
- We're not Chinese.
- You're hungry, aren't you?
- That's not the point. It isn't any dog.
- This is Hawkins' dog.
- Now, wait a minute.
Just because you know it, that makes the difference?
Boy, that's really British hairsplitting.
- Why don't you smell it?
- We don't need to smell it.
It's the greatest thing since Bisto.
It isn't that. It's what Pete said.
It is, huh?
Did you ever eat live lobster?
Take a fish out of the water, put it straight in the pan?
Or what about them geese they got back in Europe?
They nail their feet down, then force corn down their gullets...
...through a funnel till their livers burst.
So don't tell me about Hawkins' dog.
Now, you don't want to eat it, just sit there and watch. It's a free prison.
I suppose nothing so shocking about it if you rationalize it.
I say there's a difference.
This is Hawkins' dog.
Correction, it was Hawkins' dog.
Now it's just meat.
You tasted it, didn't you?
Well, didn't you?
Tasted good, didn't it?
So, what are you pussyfooting about?
You've already eaten it.
Are we?
Are we under starter's orders?
Think fast. Off you go, lads.
Well, that's it for another day.
2163 officers and men...
...541 pounds of rice issued at 4 ounces per man.
One bag was short 10 pounds with a balance of 20 and a quarter pounds.
- Dysentery?
- Yes. Got it back bad today, sir.
- Thank you, sir. See you next week.
- Yes. Take care now.
- Don't bother.
- Sorry, sir. Careless.
This weight's been tampered with.
What? That's impossible. Let me see.
No, it's not been tampered with.
This is merely a corrective hole.
This weight was probably a fraction heavier than it's supposed to be.
You had me worried there for a moment.
- They've all been tampered with!
- They're corrective.
Don't give me that. I know enough about weights and measures...
...to know holes aren't allowed, no corrective holes.
If the weight's wrong, it's never issued.
- What do you know about this?
- Why, nothing, sir.
- I don't believe you.
- You can't accuse me, sir.
- I don't know anything about it.
- We'll put it to the test, shall we?
I'm gonna go outside and show everybody this...
...and we'll see what they do.
- Now wait a minute, sir.
You're right. But it wasn't me, sir.
It was the colonel.
He caught me pinching some rice.
Said he'd turn me in...
...if I didn't help him.
- Shut up, you fool!
You're not gonna listen to that.
The fool's trying to implicate me.
- I had no idea this was going on.
- But he's got the key, sir.
The key to the safe, where the weights are.
- It couldn't have been me, sir.
- Shut up, Blakeley!
Now shut up, do you hear me?
How long have these weights been in use, colonel? A year, two years?
I have no idea. If they're fixed, it's nothing to do with me.
But you have the key and keep them locked up?
Yes, but that doesn't...
Have you looked at the bottom of the weights?
- No, I haven't.
- Well, isn't that a bit odd?
No, it isn't. I won't be cross-questioned, lieutenant.
You'd better be telling the truth, colonel.
Are you threatening me? If you are,
I'll have you court-martialed.
I don't know. I'm here legally.
The weights have been tampered with.
- Haven't they?
- I suppose so, yes, but...
- Right.
- That doesn't mean...
I'll tell you what it means.
It means you or Blakeley is responsible.
- You're the only two allowed here.
- It wasn't me. I swear to God.
- I only got one pound in 10.
- You shut up!
Please, sir, don't say anything.
They'll tear us to pieces.
- I hope they do, Blakeley.
- Listen, Grey, we can sort this out.
Maybe someone has meddled with them, but the amount is insignificant.
Look, Blakeley, wait outside.
Stay where you are, Blakeley.
There's no need for Blakeley to go, is there, sir?
No. Walls don't have ears.
You'll get a pound of rice a week.
- Is that all?
- Okay, 2 pounds.
And half a pound of dried fish.
No sugar or eggs?
They both go to the hospital, you know that.
What do you say?
I tell you what I say, colonel.
I'm gonna go to
Col. Smedley-Taylor...
...and I'm gonna tell him what you've just said.
And I'm gonna show him this.
And if there's a borehole party...
...and I pray there will be,
I'm going to ask to lead it...
...and I'm personally going to shove you down, but not too fast...
...because I want to hear you scream for a long, long time before you die.
Oh, my God.
I figure you Australian thieves are the only thieves who can supply in bulk.
I'll tell you what I'm prepared to offer.
You supply the cages...
...and market the produce, we'll cut you in for 50 percent.
- Are you interested?
- Yeah, yeah, seems like a proposition.
So we got ourselves a deal, right?
Nothing like dealing with your own kind, is there?
When are you gonna start deliveries?
I got to get my organization primed.
Let me see.
- Kurt, what do you think?
- Five weeks outside.
They should have some meat on them in a month.
Okay? We figured hind legs only.
Ten a week.
You know, make it a real luxury trade.
I gotta mention this. I'm not too keen on selling to any cobbers.
You know, mates.
It just don't seem right, does it?
King, you know, he's got a point there.
Yeah, that's right.
We can't sell to buddies.
Yeah, well, I figured that one too.
Gentlemen, our policy will be brass only.
- Brass only?
- Majors and up.
Genius. I tell you, he's a genius.
I've seen It. Col. Jones,
Quartermaster Sgt. Blakeley...
...and relieved them of their duties as of today.
And now we'll forget the matter.
I say, "we," because you are to forget it with me.
In fact, I'll make it an order.
You're to forget it ever happened.
We can't do that, sir. We caught them red-handed, stealing the camp food.
That's your food and mine.
They deserve to be topped.
Nevertheless, under the circumstances...
...this is the decision I've made.
- What circumstances?
You can't let them off scot-free.
You can't.
Don't tell me what I can or cannot do, lieutenant.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.
But, sir, those men are thieves.
I caught them.
- I repeat, the incident is closed.
- By God, it's not closed!
I won't let it be closed. They've been eating while we've been starving.
- I insist that they...
- You can't insist on anything.
I intend sending the following to the camp commandant:
"I strongly commend
It. Robin Grey, Royal Tank Corps...
...for his work as provost marshal,
Changi Prison.
His consistent performance of duty in difficult surroundings...
...is, beyond question, of the highest order.
I would like to recommend that he be given the acting rank of captain."
You hypocrite.
I think you're in with them.
Well, none of you are gonna get away with it.
I can't prove anything against you.
I've got proof against the others.
- I've got this weight.
- What about the weight, lieutenant?
- I said, what about the weight?
- This... This isn't the same.
- This isn't the one I gave you.
- You're quite wrong, lieutenant.
It's exactly the same one.
Now, you're a young man, Grey.
I understand you want to stay in the
Army when the war's over?
Well, that's good.
The Army can use hardworking, intelligent officers.
I'm sure that I could prevail on the commandant...
...to add to my recommendation...
...that you be granted a permanent commission.
You're just overwrought at the moment, understandably so.
These are terrible times, Grey.
Terrible times.
But we must get them into the right perspective.
I consider it imperative that we let this tragic matter drop...
...for all our sakes.
No good purpose could possibly be served.
I'm sure when you've had a chance to think it over as carefully as I have...
...you'll appreciate the wisdom of my decision.
Have you any objection to my sending this forward?
Good.
We can take it as read, then.
Your promotion is confirmed.
Good night, captain.
Okay, guys, let's get it onto the truck.
Right.
All right, okay, swing it over to you.
You'll have to come back this way.
- Hold it!
- Hold it!
Roll it!
Don't eat too much rich food. You should live to play the violin again.
You're lucky. No bones broken.
Now, think about something else for a bit.
You got tickets for the play?
It should be a good one.
I helped write, or rather, remember, the last act.
I saw the original production on my honeymoon, believe it or not.
Jessica Tandy, I remember.
She played the character of the young lady living in freedom.
She had a line...
I remember as if it was yesterday.
The young man said to her,
"My dear Audrey."
It was his line, not hers. That's right.
"My dear Audrey," he said...
..."you'll get spots on your nose if you drink when it's hot."
I'll never forget that.
Even though
I was on my honeymoon...
...I fell in love with Audrey, young lady living in freedom.
And now our Sean will be playing the role.
- What's the matter with you, Stevens?
- Nothing, sir.
You're a liar, Stevens.
You shave your legs and you're a liar.
But you care. You care.
That's what saves you.
- Saves me from what, sir?
- Yourself, Stevens, yourself.
I thought you were gonna say,
"From a fate worse than death," sir.
There's no such thing.
Did you draw your tickets for the first night?
You know, I never saw a play before I came in here.
Movies, yeah, but never saw a play.
Buster Crabbe.
You ever see Buster Crabbe?
Yeah, I think so.
That's the kind of acting I like, boy.
Buster Crabbe, Edward G. Robinson.
Those movie guys, boy, they got it made.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It just aches a bit, that's all.
You know, before this, everybody had it made but me.
Closest I ever got was to read it out of magazines.
I used to watch fancy dolls getting out of cars...
...going in to eat the big dinner...
...and they were always with pigs.
You know, real pigs.
Fat old guys, but they had it made.
Let's go.
I'll see you.
I was saying to the wife, we did the right thing...
...having him put down like that.
- What?
The wife, she took it very badly, but I was explaining to her...
...they don't feel anything.
The vet just gave him an injection...
...and he went to sleep. And
I held him in my arms all the time.
He didn't feel a thing, just went to sleep.
Pete?
Where you been?
I've been looking for you.
What's wrong?
It's all set with Tinker. We're going through with the diamond deal tonight.
- What's wrong?
- They're gonna cut my arm off.
I've got gangrene.
Now, look, Pete, understand me, what I'm gonna say.
I'm not playing dirty pool, but you gotta be there tonight.
Pete, listen, I know what I'm saying.
This isn't just any deal.
If the war ends, the Japs are gonna massacre every man in camp.
The only chance will be if you have money to buy your way out.
This is gonna be our ticket.
- We gotta go through with the deal.
- Sod your deal! The war isn't over!
Shut up! Shut up!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Pete, but you've gotta translate for me tonight.
Now, I'll come up with something,
I promise you.
We gotta have that dough.
You see that, don't you?
Either way, it's just you and me.
I will come up with something,
I promise you.
Now come on.
Come on.
Never been licked yet, have I?
- You okay? Can you hold on?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes peeled down there.
I'll call you when I want you.
- He's got money.
- Count it.
30,000, five in Straits dollars at 8 to 1.
I'll be right back with the goods.
- It's all there.
- Right. Show him the diamond.
It's Grey! It's Grey!
Stay where you are!
Head them off!
Right down there.
See them anywhere down there?
There they are!
They're this way. Come here!
This way!
This way.
Double back! Double back!
There's one chance.
You go through the wire.
I'll cover for you.
- I'll never make it.
- Yes, you will.
When you get through...
...bury the dough and then come back through the same place.
- I'll cover for you. Now, damn it, go!
- Never make it.
Yes, you will.
You save the dough, and I'll save your arm.
- What?
- Yes. You heard me. Now go, go!
How can you..? How can you..?
You, corporal! Stand where you are.
- Search him.
- All right.
What is this?
- Nothing on him, sir.
- Where's Marlowe?
- I've no idea, sir.
- Where's the money?
- What money, sir?
- Money from the sale of the diamond.
What diamond, sir?
All right. All right, corporal.
The war will be over one day, and then you'll get yours.
All right, sir. I believe you.
But until then...
Pete's over the wire, behind hut 14.
Make sure he gets back safe.
- You wanted to see me, sport?
- Yeah. I want some drugs.
Antitoxin. A bottle of it.
And some sulfonamide powder.
- That's a bit strong, mate.
- Look, I'll level with you. It's for Pete.
If I don't get it, they're gonna cut his arm off. He's got gangrene.
So, what's it cost to save an arm?
For a cobber, I'll do it for 400.
That's a special rate.
- Okay, you got a deal.
- It takes three days.
- No, sir, buddy, I gotta have it tonight.
- It's gonna cost you another 400.
Okay. Okay, you win.
But you get it here tonight, do you hear me?
Oh, Pete, you gonna make up a fourth?
We've saved a place for you.
We dealt already, but there's no fiddle.
How are you, Peter?
My word, the news is very good, isn't it?
Man, who dealt this lot?
You did, McCoy, you twit.
Won't be long now. Oh, no.
Now, what have we got here?
Two spades, I think, if it's me.
Is it me?
As a matter of fact, it isn't. Pass.
- Pete?
- What? Oh, three diamonds.
Pass.
- Three spades, I think.
- Pass.
- Pass.
- Pass?
- Pass?
- You should have more faith, Peter.
- Still, I'll do my best.
- You'll do what?
- I'll have a go, as they say.
- No, what did you say? Faith?
Do what? Don't give me faith.
Don't give me that old line of bull...
...vicar, padre, whatever you like to call yourself.
You know what you can do with your faith? Work it!
- All right.
- Don't say, "all right."
He knows what I'm talking about, don't you, Father?
- Pete, look...
- Oh, shut up.
I like to talk about it, about God and faith and mercy and all the other stuff.
What can God do about anything?
And really do, I mean!
- He can heal.
- He can what? Heal?
Did you say, "heal"?
It's a good job he's done here, isn't it?
This is one of his major successes.
I suppose dying of dysentery...
...and blindness doesn't matter.
He couldn't be bothered about that.
Do you know what I think?
Oh, I think God's a maniac.
A vicious, sadistic maniac!
You can take your God, vicar, and his precious faith.
It's both a stinking, dirty joke.
- Where's the nurse?
- Stevens couldn't get here tonight.
- I'm gonna give him the first one.
- Know how?
Of course I know how.
You got water boiling?
- Yeah, right here.
- You better know how to do it.
Here, pour a drop in there, will you, mate?
Keep the rest on the boil.
I gotta give him a shot of morphine first.
And then I gotta clean the wound up the best I can.
Hey, give us some more light, will you? Quick.
Yeah, that's that.
Sterilize that again, will you?
Fill it up from this bottle.
Let's get around there, all right, mate.
There we are.
Get this bloody bandage off, that's all.
Grip up. It could be too late.
Get rid of them. Bury them.
Tex.
You've gotta watch this...
...because if Stevens don't come, you'll have to do it.
Now, the injection's gotta be intravenous. First you find the vein.
You see, there it is there.
Now you stick the needle in...
...and pull the plunger back until you draw a bit of blood back in the syringe.
See, like that. That way you're sure you've got the vein.
Now, when you are sure, you squirt the antitoxin in.
But nice and slowly, mate.
Easy does it.
Until it's all gone. There.
That's gotta be done every six hours till the stuff's used up.
If you miss once, you might as well not have started.
- How long will he be out?
- Oh, a couple of hours, I reckon.
Well, we might as well settle up now.
We settle up when the diamond deal goes through.
No, sport. I deliver, I get paid.
The diamond deal...
...has nothing to do with it.
- There's no harm waiting.
I'll tell you the bleeding harm, mate.
If I can't get...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Don't tell me you haven't got it.
Oh, I got it. I got it.
I just don't know where it is.
He's the only one knows where it is.
Well, there's a fair old bundle riding on his chances, ain't there?
We'll be in touch, sooner or later.
Good night, sport.
Have I been to get it?
- Don't worry about it.
- Have I been to get the money?
No, not yet. No sweat.
As soon as you get better.
You still got this.
I got the stuff for you like I promised.
You had the first shot.
That's why you've been out so long.
You know there's nothing I can say.
Well, you could say I'm a genius.
You could say that.
It's better. And I got your money.
You sod!
You sod. We did it. We did it!
We did it!
Come on, tell me, am I the King?
Am I the King?
- Can you smell cooking?
- Yes, sir.
I've been smelling it all morning, on and off. It seems to be all over.
I have to hand it to you...
...delicious, absolutely delicious.
A little stringy, perhaps, but nevertheless delicious.
Yes, just splendid, just splendid.
Just splendid.
Yes, well...
...I wouldn't say no to a second helping.
Any chance you getting any more?
Could be. I do have a certain amount of influence.
- Sir?
- Nothing yet.
The commandant's still arguing with them.
What gets me is, there are no reprisals.
When they find a radio, you know there's trouble.
Can't remember anything different that happened that night?
No, it happened too quickly.
When I woke up, they were being marched out. I didn't talk to them.
Well, as far as we know, they're still in there.
- They want to see us, George.
- Any idea what's happening, sir?
No, I haven't learned anything.
All very polite. But...
Unless they're planning to make an example.
They're usually overpolite when it comes to ceremonial death.
- Well, we'd better find out, hadn't we?
- All of us, sir?
Yes, they asked for all senior officers.
We, the emperor, have ordered the Imperial Government to notify...
...the United States, Great Britain,
China and the Soviet Union...
...that we accept their joint declaration.
The enemy has made use of an inhuman bomb...
...and is subjecting innocent people to grievous wounds and massacre.
To continue the war would not only lead to the annihilation of our nature...
...but the destruction of human civilization as well.
How could we protect our innumerable subjects, who are like newborns for us?
How could we ask forgiveness of the divine spirits of our imperial ancestors?
When our thoughts dwell on those, our subjects, who died in battle...
...and those who perished by premature death...
...and on the families they left behind them, we feel profoundly upset.
It is our desire to initiate an era of peace for future generations...
...by tolerating the intolerable and enduring the unendurable...
...remembering our heavy responsibilities...
...and the length of road yet to be covered...
...and concentrating all our strengths on the construction of the future...
...animated by deep morality and firm honesty.
We swear to hold the flower of our national policies high...
...resolved not to remain backward in the general progress of the world.
We ask you, our subjects, to be in the incarnation of our will.
Am I to take it that...
...the war is over?
Yes, the war is over.
The war's over!
We made it! We made it!
It don't make sense.
It just don't make sense.
Hey, Max.
You wanna make us all some victory coffee?
- What about my rats?
- What?
Who's gonna take care of my rats after I've gone?
- You haven't gone yet.
- What about them?
You don't realize they've been born in captivity.
They don't know no different.
Well, open up their cages.
They'll soon learn.
- Huh, Max?
- Yeah.
I wonder...
I guess there's been some big changes back home.
I bet there's been some big changes back home, huh, Pop?
You make it.
What are you doing?
Look at my shoes!
Make me a fresh cup of coffee, corporal.
Get out before I put my foot through your face.
Oh, you do that. You just do that.
I'll bust you.
Don't forget, I got the rank.
I am a top sergeant.
Top sergeant.
I can have you court-martialed.
- Tex, get that pot.
- Listen, listen!
What do you want? Money?
I got money. Good Jap money.
Here, 90 bucks.
Enough for one cup of coffee.
You make it. You make it, corporal.
- Tex, get that pot.
- Stay where you are!
Stay where you are. Stay.
As of now, I assume full military command of this hut!
Under the authority invested in me, this hut is now under full military..!
I'll kill you!
No! What are you doing?
What are you..? What are you..?
What are you doing?
I wondered where you were.
I missed you at the play.
What do you want?
Sir?
I just wanted to see you.
Well, you've seen me.
All right, soldier, salute me.
I said, salute.
Salute me, you bastard.
Now get in that bloody guardhouse and stay there.
Good. The next time I say salute, salute!
And you.
Hello.
I'm Weaver, paratroop corps.
Can you tell me or show me who's in command here?
You are British, aren't you?
There's no need to be afraid of me.
I was passing bricks back there myself.
I couldn't think what to say to them.
I just kept repeating myself.
You are British, aren't you?
Well, the war's over, you see.
I've been sent on ahead.
To look after you.
Smoke?
They're the real stuff. From home.
Players for you, remember?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
The war is over.
Welcome to Changi, sir.
Thank God somebody here is normal.
I'm Capt. Weaver. I've been sent to look after the camp...
...until the main lot arrives, which could be any moment now.
I began to wonder if there was something wrong with me.
Most of them are in a state of shock, sir.
It's been a long time.
Yes, I suppose it has.
- You're not British, are you?
- No, I'm American, sir. Cpl. King.
There are a few of us colonials scattered around.
Maj. Brough is our officer.
Maybe you'd like to meet him.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Who are those poor sorts, corporal?
Just some of the guys. Officers.
- Officers?
- Yeah.
These are officers' huts.
The enlisted men are inside the wall.
- Are they all like that?
- Sir?
Do they all look like that?
- Then why are you so different?
- Sir?
Why are you so different?
- How do you mean, sir?
- Why are you dressed properly...
...and they're in rags?
No harm in looking after your clothes, is there?
You're in good shape too, aren't you?
I've been keeping on the ball, sir.
- No harm in that either, is there, sir?
- No. No harm at all.
- Where's the commandant's quarters?
- Over there, sir. The end bungalow.
Right.
I won't forget you, corporal.
I'll certainly see Maj. Brough at the earliest opportunity.
- What do you mean by that, sir?
- Figure it out, corporal.
I wish I had your nerve, Fortnum.
I couldn't talk to him.
I ran away. We all did.
He was so real. It was too real.
God, it's mad, isn't it?
It's over, and we've survived.
But it's still all mad.
What did he say to you?
He just asked me a few things.
What did he say?
Did he tell you anything?
Nothing I didn't already know.
Hey, it's over, isn't it?
It's not a mistake?
No. Forget it.
You've got the luck now.
Forget it?
Hey, listen, I'm talking to you.
You called me "sir" last night.
That's the second time you've walked away.
The war's the only thing that's changed.
We're just the same.
Look, people don't change, because...
When the all clear sounds, do they?
I haven't changed.
I'm not ashamed because you're my friend. We survived it.
You and me.
Don't you remember what we had?
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
Don't you remember that?
You worked for me a couple times.
I paid you for it. That's all we had.
Fortnum.
Fortnum, friendship isn't a matter of a 10 percent.
Don't ask me to forget it all now.
Please, not that, otherwise what's it all been in aid of?
I'm not different.
But that's just you.
Mate. One at a time.
One friend.
That's good enough for anybody.
It's just a start.
- It's empty. Where have they gone?
- What?
Where have they gone?
Are you deaf or something?
- Where's who gone?
- King. The Americans!
Oh, the Yanks.
They're moving out.
They should be on their way now.
Come on, men, get in the trucks.
Let's go, boys.
Let's go, boys.
Come on, boys, we've got a plane to catch. Let's go, boys.
Get your butt in the truck, corporal.
Yankee, go home!
That was worth waiting for.
Seeing him cut down to size like that.
It's our turn now, Marlowe.
We're getting even back home too.
Our vote slung old Churchill and his mob out.
You people haven't got the world by the shorts any longer.
It's our turn now.
Still, you can always feel proud you were his friend, I suppose.
It wouldn't occur to you that you're alive because of what he gave you.
I never took anything from him.
He never gave me anything.
Only hate, Grey. Only hate.
No sign of life.
I don't see a thing either.
So anyway there I am, without a gun
and this kraut's got a schnauzer pointed right at me.
I see his trigger
 finger stiffen.
I say to myself, Kovac, boy, you better pray.
If you ever prayed before,
 pray he doesn't pull that trigger.
What happened?
He pulled the trigger.
It was terrible. 
Took me 4 hours to die.
Oh, you crazy nut.
Alright. Knock it off.
Yeah, sorry Sergeant.
The town up ahead looks deserted but maybe it's not so
From now on Kovac keep
 your mind on your business.
Strictly business Sergeant.
Cage, radio.
Checkmate King Two, this is White Rook, Over.
This is King Two. Have you
 reached Phase Lime Green, Over.
Roger. King Two out.
That was Saunders Sir. He said the
 town looks deserted but they're
 going in to check it out.
Mac, I didn't know private
 Kovac was married.
I don't know Sir.
Uh. Captain Jampel please.
Lieutenant Hanley calling.
-Jampel speaking.
-Uh Sir, I've got a
I got a letter from Clark 
General Hospital in Detroit.
I don't know if it's a gag
 or on the level.
-You got time
 to listen to it?
- Go ahead.
It concerns one of my men, 
Private Steven Kovac.
Here it is.
Dear Sir. I am a friend of Ellen Kovac. 
She and me are patients on the
 same ward and she's dying.
Her husband, Steve Kovac,
 is one of your soldiers.
He don't know me so I'd like you
to break the news to him, then send him home right away.
You better hurry. His wife
 ain't going to live long. 
Faithfully, Mrs. Pearl Wilson.
Yeah, that's rough, uh.
Listen. I'll have the Red Cross verify it. 
If it's on the level, why Kovac will need an emergency leave.
Uh Lieutenant. 
Be prepared to
 execute Plan A.
Yes Sir.
What a lousy break.
Always happens to
 the nice guys.
I got a meeting over at Battalion.
Tell the squad leaders to double
 up on the basic ammo loads.
Extra grenades for each man.
Tell doc to double up on his medical supplies.
Yes Sir.
Uh Sir.
I just remembered.
Kovac is on that
 patrol with Saunders.
Umm.
I thought maybe you'd like to have me radio and call him back, Sir.
No. They're due back at 1700 hours.
No reason to have him stew unnecessarily.
We'll see how the Red 
Cross checks it out. 
If it's on the level,
I'll tell him.
<font color="#9ffff7">Amerikaner.</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">Ja, Amerikana.</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">(German)</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">(German)</font>
Let me fix that for you Littlejohn.
Thanks Steve.
Any krauts in this town are probably up high spotting so keep your eyes open.
Remember, we're here to
 get information, not to fight.
Aired April 27, 1965
Oh. Oh nurse.
Smitty said you had
 a message for me.
Yeah, the Lieutenant wants you
to lay in a double basic load of supplies.
Double?
Yeah. Looks like there's a big push coming up.
Boy, must be a doozy.
And what's this about Kovac's wife? Smitty said she's dying.
That's right.
Steve doesn't even know yet.
Hanley wouldn't let me radio
 to get him in off patrol.
Maybe he had his reasons.
I better go get those supplies.
<font color="#f0ff0f">(gunshots fired)</font>
Grenade launcher.
Very nice.
 Mind if I try one.
Unnh.
-How is it Littlejohn?
-I'll be okay.
Kirby. Keep an eye out there will you?
Yeah. She's affected OP.
 Check it out huh.
Wheh.
 That's a bad  one.
Try to get the radio off him.
See if you can raise Hanley. 
Tell him what happened.
See if we can have some medics
 meet us on our way back.
Everything's kaputsized.
It's clean.
Come on. 
Let's get out of here.
<font color="#f0ff0f">(truck can be heard coming.)</font>
Sarge. A two pair coming down the street.
Krauts are coming back in here. 
This must be a headquarters.
Caje, is there a way out the back?
No, this one's blocked by rubble. 
But this one leads down to a cellar.
 There's good cover down there.
Alright, let's go.
<font color="#9ffff7">(German)</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">(German)</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">(German)</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">Jawohl, Herr Hoffman.</font>
-Saunders back yet?
-No Sir.
-Did he call in?
-No Sir.
Captain Jampel called Sir. 
He said to give you a message.
That letter about Kovac's wife. It's on the level.
She's gonna die.
Try to raise Saunders.
I already tried Sir.
After Captain Jampel called. 
But their radio must be
 on the fritz, or else.
Try again.
Yes Sir.
White Rook, this is Checkmate 
King two, Over.
White Rook, this is 
King two, Over.
White Rook, this is 
Checkmate King two, Over.
Keep trying.
Yes Sir.
White Rook, this is
 Checkmate King two, Over.
This is the only way out.
Ahh. Ohh.
Try to keep him quiet.
They'll probably be coming down here to flush this place out.
See if you could get a place for cover.
You gotta keep him quiet.

-Unh.
-Shh, Littlejohn.
Hey John. Hey John. 
Don't be such a woosy.
<font color="#f0ff0f">(grain dust fills the air)</font>
Unh. Unh huh.
Ah, that's pretty good Littlejohn.
Sarge. What happens if those
 krauts up there don't pull out.
Not much we can do.
Why, they could be up there for days?
So we'll stay put for days.
Hello, 2nd platoon.
Yes Sir. He's right
 here Sir.
Captain Jampel Sir.
-Lieutenant Hanley.
-Lieutenant.
We execute plan A.
Yes Sir.
I am asking Williams and Coates to meet me at your place for a briefing as we discussed.
Roger Sir.
I came to report Sir. You know that new replacement that kid named Roberts.
I had to take him back to Battalion
 aid. He had appendicitis.
Huh, lucky kid.
We push off on the big attack at 0400, tomorrow morning.
Mac. 
Alert the squad leaders.
Captain Jampel is holding a briefing session for the platoon leaders here just before the attack.
I'll fill the squad
 leaders in later.
Tell 'em to get the men to 2nd
 before we crew up tomorrow.
Yes Sir.
Lieutenant. Is there any further word on Kovac's wife.
She's dying and waiting for her husband.
He's been missing in
 action for 2 days.
Aw, those dirty stinking krauts,
 I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em. I'll
Easy, easy.
Try to keep him quiet.
It's been two days Sarge. No letup
 on the pain, no morphine and
 now we're out of sulfa.
I know, I know. But if he keeps up like that they're gonna hear him upstairs.
We gotta do something Sarge. 
We can't stay here forever.
There's only one way out and
 the krauts have got it blocked.
Umm, Uhh.
Littlejohn.
Littlejohn. Try and keep quiet huh.
I'm sorry Sarge. 
This isn't...not
I know. I know.
Umm, uhuh
Littlejohn.
Remember that uh, the little
 redhead I was telling you about.
The one with the big, uh, blue eyes.
You know what I'm gonna do when we get stateside. 
I'm gonna fix you up with her.
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. 
She's gonna go for you in a great big way.
She's got to. 
You're a big guy aren't you.
You mean the girl, the one
 that we met in Miami?
Nah, the St. Louis babe. Huh.
The one in Miami's a drag.
All she likes to do is sit home and listen to the radio.
No good huh?
Not for me Sarge. 
I'm a real hotshot.
Huh. But the St. Louis woman. 
She's a real deluxe model.
I mean big cylinder and good in every gear.
You give her a hot band and
a dance floor and she'll shag all night long.
Yup. Well I don't dance.
I always freeze up.
I wouldn't worry about that pal.
She'll defrost you.
Uh, uh, umm.
You crazy nut.
Nice babe in LA, an animal
 trainer, really wild.
First time I saw her she's wrestling this boa constrictor.
She was in a dress, with a
 neckline clear down to the floor.
Yeah, we don't stop till we reach the river. Now we'll be here
 in the center.
Fox company on the left, 
Charlie company on the right.
Now you can bet the Germans are gonna fight for every inch of land.
They know we've knocked out their
bridges so all they can rely on to get across the river are pontoons.
Of coarse the Sarge will have to make sure they do not get across that river.
Where do you want me Sir?
You'll be on the left Coates after the town of St. Marten.
 You'll be on the right Hanley
 up to this valley.
Furber's weapons platoon will be in general support with Williams in reserve. 
Now if you need me,
I'll be with Williams during the initial stage.
I have 0135
Ten minutes from now
 the bombers are due.
At 0200 our H and R fire starts.
Two hours after that is H hour.
At H hour minus 30 minutes the artillery preparation starts.
-Good luck.
-Sir.
Would it make any difference if 
Coates and I switched positions, in the push.
You want to go up
 through St. Marten?
Ah yes Sir. That is, uh if it's alright with Coates.
Be my guest.
Figure it's gonna be real rough going through that town.
Alright Hanley.
As you wish.
Thank you gentlemen.
That patrol with 
Kovac in it.
It was on it's way to St. Marten before it became missing in action. 
Is it not?
Yes Sir.
Lieutenant. The fact that a woman is dying back in the states and her
 husband is missing in action is rough.
This war is rough on a lot of people, and no matter who gets hurt the war goes on.
Yes Sir, but...
It was my decision.
Not to bring Kovac back from that patrol.
Yes, and in my book it was the right decision.
Just remember this. You are a
 Lieutenant in the United States Army.
You're not God. 
Nobody expects you to be.
Hell, won't be long now.
There go the bombers.
14 minutes and 5 seconds.
Then our guns open up.
Fifteen.
Ten.
Five, four, three, two, one. Mark.
<font color="#9ffff7"> Ja whol. NDas ganze
 Haus fällt. Es zittert.</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">(German)</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">(German)</font>
They're ours.
One fifty fives.
Put that 88 to the bar.
<font color="#f0ff0f">(Germans are busy upstairs)</font>
They've cleared out. 
Let's go.
Oh I'm sure to have
 more replacements.
Oh, I understand. 
Of course Sir. But you
Saunders's squad. 
They made it Lieutenant.
Captain. Saunders squad just got back. I'll call you in a few minutes.
-Guess we're late.
-What happened?
We were pinned down in a cellar. We couldn't get out until the barrage started.
Everything alright?
Everything except Littlejohn. 
He got hit pretty hard in the shoulder.
Doc met us on the way back and took him to Battalion Aid.
The way I figure it Lieutenant,
the army owes us about 9 hot meals.
What's the matter?
I say something wrong?
You better read this, Kovac.
You get shaved and cleaned up.
Mac will drive you back to Battalion.
Your emergency leave is waiting there.
They'll fly you back to the states.
We got word his wife is dying.
Well uh,
As you can probably tell from the uh, planes and barrage,
A general attack is being mounted.
Better get some rest tonight.
Yes Sir.
Captain Jampel Sir.
On the phone.
-Lieutenant Hanley.
-About Kovac.
Ah, yes Sir. I can have  him back to Battalion in about half an hour.
Can you reinstate his air transportation to the states.
Uh, Lieutenant. I just received a wire from the Red Cross.
Kovac's wife has passed away. 
His leave's been canceled.
Thank you Sir.
Hey uh, Steve. It's tough.
 But you needed to go home.
Thanks Mac.
Steve. You want a
 little shot.
Thanks Kirb. I don't much
 feel like it now.
Did your wife mention she was sick?
We were separated.
You might want some later. 
I'll leave it there.
Thanks.
We sure sweated you guys n out for almost 3 days.
The Lieutenant and me was afraid you'd all gotten it.
It's too bad that letter didn't get here before we left.
Yeah, it come a
 half hour after.
I wanted Hanley to let me radio
 and call you back, but he
 decided against it.
Alright. As you were.
Kovac. I've got some bad news for you.
Just got word from the Red Cross.
Your wife died.
I know there's nothing anybody can say that's gonna help much
 at a time like this, but...
If there's anything I can do.
No Sir.
Well, since your leave's been canceled, I'm sending you back to
 Battalion rear. Mac'll give you a lift.
Yes Sir.
Saunders.
Move out in 3 minutes. 
Saddle 'em up.
Lieutenant.
That um, letter from the
 woman in the hospital.
When did it come?
About half an hour after you left on patrol that day.
Half hour.
We weren't even in St. Marten yet.
I could have been back, back in the states by now.
Why didn't you radio me Sir? 
Why didn't you call me back from that patrol?
Kovac I. I considered it, and I decided to uh, save you the anxiety until the
 Red Cross confirmed the letter.
Time to move out.
Saddle up.
Anxiety.
You hear that. Doesn't want me to have anxiety.
My wife is dying, and he decides not to tell me 'cause I might
 have anxiety.
No, I call that good radio.
Why, Sarge.
I can't even go to the funeral.
What is this guy.
Who gives him the right to say when enlisted men will be told
 his personal business.
Now take it easy. Lieutenant Hanley thought he was doing the right thing.
Yeah, he thought huh.
And what he thinks goes.
Those bars on his collar give him
the right of life and death over guys like me?
Well that may be alright for some Sarge, but not for me.
Knock it off Kovac.
You're ordered to
 Battalion rear.
Sure. Sure Kovac.
Go to Battalion rear.
 Wait for a transfer.
Having me here reminds the
 Lieutenant of what he'd like to forget.
Now come on.
 Let's move out.
-All set.
-Yes Sir.
Lieutenant. I've been thinking about Kovac.
-What about him.
-Well, he's pretty well had it.
Yeah.
You better have him
 transferred to another outfit.
And hand my problem over to another platoon leader.
 No, he stays.
Okay Sergeant.
Come on Steve. 
I'll take you back.
What you doing Steve. You don't need to put on your gear
 to go back to Battalion.
Come on. Come on.
Hey. Where you going.
To follow my Lieutenant
 into battle.
Where do you think.
Where's King company.
I don't know. Everyone's that
 way, pushing for the river.
Where's Hanley. 
I've gotta find him.
I, I don't know him pal.
Where's 361st. 
King Company.
I can't help you buddy.
Come on.
Keep down, Lieutenant.
Ah, Steve. 
Am I glad to see you.
You alright?
I was just, coming back for
 some help. It's, it's Hanley.
Hanley. What about it?
 Where is he?
Well, he's trapped
 back there.
-Trapped.
-Yeah.
Hey, we got separated from the platoon and there was just 
Hanley and Sergeant and me.
What do you mean trapped? 
What happened to Hanley?
There's a bunch of krauts dug in real good up on the Hill.
Got 2 machine guns I didn't even see them 'till I got hit.
And then Hanley came up behind me, and I started to give us cover.
I made it back but Hanley didn't.
He's still out there
 now, wounded.
And, seeing how I did I don't think he's got much of a chance to get back.
You mean he's gonna die?
I'm sure he's gonna die if 
Sarge don't get some help.
I couldn't fire so I gave him my BAR and came running back here for help.
Hey, hey now Steve. Give him a hand to make it out.
Help us Steve.
We need you.
Sure Kirb, sure. I wouldn't want to
 be away from ole Hanley at a
 time like this now would I.
What are you doing here?
Kirby said Hanley was trapped.
Well I'll be.
Kirby was right. 
He can't get outta there can he?
As soon as you run out of ammo
those krauts'll come down and give him the works.
Listen Kovac. Those krauts think I'm here alone.
They think I'm here alone, you're gonna keep 'em thinking that.
Every time they fire, you fire back.
I'm going around, try to flank them. 
Maybe I can surprise them with a couple grenades, okay.
Sure Sarge. You do whatever you like.
-You do as I say.
-Why should I?
You can't change the way 
I feel man. I hate his guts.
You hate him, or do
 you hate yourself?
What's that supposed to mean?
You said you were separated.
-What did you do?
Walk out on your wife?
-That's my business.
What was wrong with her?
She sit around, listen to the radio.
She get in the way of all those
 girls you're running around with?
-Now you listen.
-No, you listen.
You feel guilty because you let your wife down.
You think this'll be any easier if you do the same thing to him?
Now you get this. Every time those
 krauts fire you fire back
 with this. You got it?
There's another one.
Knows all the answers.
(<font color="#9ffff7">German)</font>
(<font color="#9ffff7">German)</font>
<font color="#9ffff7">Aw schießen.</font>
I sure am glad you're here.
Yes Sir.
You alright?
I will be. Soon as they get these slugs out.
Here comes Doc.
I ran into Kirby
 back there.
Think he can make it?
I think so. Yeah, 
I gotta get him back.
Litter!
I gotta tell him.
Can you tell him later?
Think he'll understand?
Come on. Let's go.
 We got a job to finish.

Those who are frightened are dismissed!
You can pick the man to shoot you!
Please, all of you go away!
She's not guilty! She was forced!
Must I order you individually?
No one can be forced into treason!
We must split into two groups!
One takes the woods, the other crosses the Volga.
We'll toss!
Heads!
The woods. Pick your men.
The Hungarians will come with me.
Who is Hungarian?
Answer!
Hungarians with me! You too!
Come here!
Single file!
Stay!
Kiss me!
You know how to kiss.
Afraid of me, aren't you?
You think I'll die soon?
I won't die!
You and you! Come with me.
The others stay here!
Come back everybody!
Across to the river.
Hide in the rye!

Part V
Now we're in their land.
What shall we do?
We've very little choice.
Either to run across or...
Pass those lights?
What else?
Just 30 seconds... to get that sentry off our backs!
Kaji... shoot him from here!
Then you start running.
It's a good idea, but...
What about me?
Is there any alternative way?
Why don't you sneak up from behind and stab him?
What shall we do?
What are you doing?
Don't worry about me. Start running!
You're bloody!
Shooting a Russian soidier in the battle, was just one fire among millions, which share the guilt of killing people.
But... this morning...
Michiko... I'm a murderer!
These hands which have once... fondled your charms... have killed a man!
For the sake of crossing a mere road in safety!
Was I justified?
Or was it wanton murder?
Michiko! Tell me which is right?
Hon Sup. Pvt.!
How did you do it?
Don't ask me a stupid question.
Anyway, we've come this far.
Concentrate on what's coming!
Where to?
To Mutankiang... we hope.
It's that way.
But it'll be no use.
The Reds took it.
Oh? How about yourself?
Korea... that's where I'm heading.
It's closer to home.
What's your unit?
I had one until yesterday.
Beware the border area.
It's Commie territory.
Is that so?
Well... I'll just be another Red.
What's "comrade" in their lingo?
"Tonzu" in Chinese.
"Dommu," I think in Korean.
"Tonzu" and "dommu", eh? Thanks!
That's all I need. Good luck!
"Tonzu and "dommu", eh?
Bye-bye, dear tonzu!
A real crackpot!
Probably a deserter!
Should've asked his name.
What for?
To report him!
Silly!
You're saying I'm a fool?
I let you take charge only because you know this area.
I'm still the NCO here!
While I'm here, I give orders!
Forget your rank!
Listen carefully to what I say.
You, too, Terada!
Mutankiang is in enemy hands.
Our Kwantung Army is finished.
It's no use trying to rejoin them now.
Then what shall we do?
We return to our former lives!
We go this way!
That's where my life is.
I'll do my best to restore you to your former way of life.
If you don't agree with me, leave me... we're parting company here!
We might find our army.
You can join them if you like.
It's our duty to join them!
Kaji! It's an army rule.
We're defeated men now.
If you want to fight on, take Terada and go!
I'm going my way!
Kaji, will we make it?
Nothing but dense woods!
Two full days!
We have no maps, nor compass.
We must press on!
Our only hope!
We're on enemy terrain!
Must be a river.
River!
We're helped.
Like meeting Buddah in Hades!
We're saved! I can feed my baby again.
Do you realize... we haven't eaten in 5 days?
Help yourself to this.
What do you think?
Must we take them?
I'm undecided.
We can't leave them.
Our rations are low.
I'll keep it.
Who's a hog?
I won't say... but you can guess!
Well these men gave this to us to share it! Not only to you.
Have you ever brought any food to share?
Useless scum!
Making passes at the men.
We shared with you at the cost of my baby's milk.
Harlots!
So what?
We'll go ask the soldiers.
They won't share with us because we're harlots.
The filthy curs!
Those girls brought nothing to share in common.
You begged us when the Reds were raping your women!
Enough!
We all share alike.
Any more trouble and we leave you!
I wish I had a rice cake... as big as a women's ass!
Even cold rice and soup will do.
Oh, for a belly full!
Will you men stop raving about food?
Yeah, it just makes me feel hungrier.
Kaji! Aren't these edible?
They're snails!
Mmm... great!
Women, it may not be beef but at least we can get it down.
He's right! maybe we should try some of it.
It's the Kwangtung Army's fault!
Those arrogant parlor soldiers!
Hey, we did our best!
Only 3 of us survived... out of the original 160 men.
They could have evacuated the women and children.
We always co-operated with them.
At great profit to you?
You should gripe!
Please! Shut that brat up!
Get some sleep! No use griping.
Mommy!
Lay off those!
Play with them and you're dead!
You men have it easy. No children!
They walk too fast for us.
Soldiers... you'll never find paradise on this earth.
Is that my fault?
In Kaji's pouch... there remains a bit of paradise!
- What happened to the others?
- Who cares?
They're constantly slowing our pace.
Kaji... let's boil the rice and eat.
No! Not until we find our way out.
Or... when we're all ready to die!
All right? Come on!
You waited for us?
I like your guts!
Well, if we lose you... we're dead!
Come along... don't lose heart.
I won't let you die alone.
Forgive our slow pace.
Age can be an insurmountable barrier.
We'll keep walking until it's all over.
I'll always be with you.
It's all of us who are starved!
My baby is starving!
Even my husband is about finished!
So are we all.
Just a little, please!
For my baby and husband.
I won't touch it.
No!
Make do with what you can find.
My baby's dying!
The ones who survives... eats this rice. It's not for the dying.
You mean you're the one who will eat it?
If we're not out of here tomorrow we'll be dead anyway!
Live if you want to eat! Now, sleep!
Somebody... help!
My baby! My baby!
What'll I do?
My baby is dead! Dead!
Help me, someone!
Call a doctor!
Shut up! we're all dying.
How about your husband?
Pipe down! You drive me nuts!
Let her cry it out.
Let's go.. or we'll all die!
Get up... hurry! We mustn't stay here.
Will you shut up!
Too bad!
There goes our next meal.
Some marksman!
I'm sorry! My eyes are falling.
Where's the others?
The elder told us to go ahead.
They suddenlly doubled up in pain.
And they vomited blood.
Mushrooms?
If you want to die, use my rifle!
Who else ate the stuff?
They did! And it looked so good.
We've had enough of you.
Leave us to die in peace!
Let me bury the child.
He's dead!
And you killed him!
How many died today!
Where's your family?
What is it to you?
Nothing... I just asked.
Put them out of misery, that's what!
Seems there were other who were lost.
I won't give up!
Can we make it?
We'll see tomorrow morning.
We caught them. One is ours!
No! We share equally.
Don't try to pull rank on us.
You failed to shoot the bird.
We get one snake.
Go ahead... I'll shoot you.
Don't think you're the only one who can shoot.
Stop it!
Don't behave like little kids.
She's right!
What's got into us?
Kaji... we'll share the snake if you'll ration the rice.
Wait till tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow...
Will we get out?
I don't know.
You know how I feel?
When my unit was wiped out...
I survived the shootings.
I think my luck is going to hold.
Then... if I stick to you, will I get out, too?
It's one way of looking at it.
Wherever you go,
I'll always be with you.
Let's hope for tomorrow.
How are things down in the south?
I've a sister there.
My only living kin...
And she's not the kind of women I've become.
Are you going there?
Will you take me?
I hope they're safe!
They must be safe!
That's all the rice I have.
I'm breaking out of here at all cost!
I refuse to stop till I get it.
Stick with me.
Damn!
He's a fast walker!
I'd stick if I weren't injured.
Kaji, you once called me an idiot.
I won't forget it.
You saved me from the tanks.
I won't forget it.
Are you man or beast?
Damn it!
That bastard!
Where does that cur get all his energy, anyway?
Damn! I'll be eternally disgraced...
A full Corporal taking orders from a Private!
Oh... I should've died a hero's death in battle.
I'd be deified and having it easy.
The idiot!
We'll never make it out of these woods.
Help will come to us.
Why should we keep walking? I quit!
How are you, Chief?
I think he's leading us in the wrong direction.
This leads us to Vladivostok.
I've given up.
I'm quitting!
Get up!
Ume-chan... Ume!
I can still walk.
But... where does all this lead?
All this walking...
Is it worth the trouble?
The southern border might be... another mass grave for the Japanese.
We probably have no place to go or to live.
Wait! Don't kill her.
I'm coming back... to face charges.
Michiko!
Are you still alive?
Can you imagine what
I'm going through... to return to your side?
Will we find our way out today?
Terada!
Look! Do you see it?
What do think?
A dwelling?
Or other humans.
Someone lives there!
It's too early to rejoice yet.
Let's wait for the others.
Remnants of Ushijima Unit?
Yes, sir!
From the Doi group?
Yes sir!
The Ushijumi Battalion was wiped out.
What about Lt. Doi?
Dead sir.
Why are you alive?
Why didn't you fight on?
You dare live with your commander dead?
Must be deserters!
And women! What does this mean? Explain yourself!
No, I won't. All we want is food.
Never! We can't spare it.
After reaching the Korean border, we are making our last stand.
We've got no food for cowards.
Get out!
Move on or we'll hang you all!
Captain Nagata, eh?
Keep your bloody supplies!
I'll blow your head off! Don't move!
Don't move!
Terada... shoot if they make a move.
Damned parlor soldiers in dress uniforms!
Why don't you say you just want to keep your supplies?
You ran off with your supplies, leaving us to be wiped out!
Kaji... while we were at it, we should have filched some supplies.
Hell with supplies! That dog!
Corporal Hironaka, those are the men you wanted to join.
What a filthy man!
Someone comes!
Nice work, Kaji.
Remember me?
Tange?
Yes... I'm Tange.
You scared the hell out of me.
You look tough with those whiskers.
You've certainly changed!
Kill or be killed... we'll talk about that later.
Eat some of this.
Was the war over?
It must be.
If so, what will be the outcome?
Like Germany...
Unconditional surrender!
Yes.
But after that... what about us? what happens to the people?
The big question.
Defeat... means national collapse?
What is the nation?
The country you knew will be dead.
It should be.
We've been struggling to survive.
How to give birth to the country where men are free?
That's the question.
I hope democratic forces will unite... to cope with this defeat.
Japan has such forces?
They're mostly helpless creatures like myself.
They're no use.
Why so cynical?
The test is to come.
Beside the point.
We entered military service... and fought in battle.
Wiped out... and trudging aimlessly on.
Killers who failed our buddies.
How many of us are qualified for coping with defeat?
That enough!
Even your ideas seem distorted.
Hey I found one!
A corn field!
Fast asleep.
He seems greatly relieved since you joined us.
He had it rough.
But you... a woman... how'd you manage to do it? I'm amazed!
I just keep on going.
How often I thought I wouldn't make it!
But he was much nicer than he looks.
And I wanted to see my sister.
- Where is she?
- In Taishihkiao.
It's near Kaji's place?
Yes, that's why I'm with him.
We don't have to worry about food.
There's plenty.
Stop that!
Stand up!
We mean you no harm.
We just ask you our way
Have any Russians come this way yet?
Dog! He's pretending to be deaf.
We only wish to return home.
Which way is Jinpohu?
Thank you.
Damn! We've been tricked.
That cur! Should've shot him!
We raid their fields. So they hate us.
Strange! How come they're armed?
Taken from our troops?
They must have formed their own militia.
Come on. Let's run away.
There's no retreat now.
We're pushing on.
Hi! You're just on time.
Our scouts blundered and things are a bit nasty.
Front line unit?
Remnants of...
That's great!
What do you think of this plan?
While they search for us over there, you cover us from here... and we'll make those woods.
And then... we'll cover you from there
Sounds good.
But not for us.
Why is that?
How are your scouts?
See where those men are?
They got it there...
You shut up!
You didn't help?
How could we? Not enough men!
Then you might desert us, too?
You'll stay here with me.
My men will go first.
If you agree to this, we'll cooperate with you.
You don't trust us?
Wait! Why not wait till dark?
There's no time.
They've already spotted us here.
He's right.
Re-tie your laces!
Fire at random! Pin 'em down!
Come on! It's our turn.
- Does it hurt?
- Just a scratch.
Damn! I'm dead tired.
Poor Ujiie! They got him.
Killed?
Having a field day!
They formed militia...
The war must be over.
If so there'd be proclamations urging our surrender.
How come they are just trying to kill us?
Would you surrender?
Afraid not.
Yeah! P.O.W. has no freedom.
We may be paying dearly for our worthless freedom.
Blast it! It's getting cold.
If you listened to me, we'd be sitting pretty by this time.
The closer we come to town, the more intimidated he is.
We don't have to be so afraid of armed Chinese.
You okay?
Yes, except for the shivering.
How's your leg?
A bit painful... that's all.
I've come to realize how nice it is to have shelter.
I never realized before... but now I understand.
Know what I mean?
It's so nice to have a home... for protection from the rain.
Michiko.
Such fleeting happiness!
For the joys we shared... at the cost of Chinese sacrifices.
I am now paying dearly.
And I must kill and steal... or I cannot fight my way back to you.
Michiko, Is a new life possible for us?
Can we start anew?
No village in sight.
Strange! But shall we rest here?
Such pigs!
Someone lives here.
There's no threat.
A roof overhead, at least!
We'll stop here for rest.
Great! I'll grab the pig.
Aroma of steaming fat reminds of that Russian place.
What a joint! It was great!
Honey... and as much meat as you want!
Female flesh, too!
This wretch!
The gal had her legs spread... and he stands shaking.
You lucky dog!
About this time, we were eating snails in the woods.
Enough of that!
Touch another women and your dead!
Why not the white and Chinese dames?
They're raping our women!
It's war! Eye for an eye!
These eggs obviously don't know me!
I can guess.
Well, stop being a square each passing day of your lifetime.
A horrible wound!
It's healed now.
Kaji cleaned it out with gunpowder.
Kaji did it?
Hey, shall I wash your body?
- Pretty ass!
- Get away from me!
Must be itching by now!
It's a baffling.
A true oasis for those of us rejected by society.
Let's go out. Too dark in here.
Get the men! We're moving on.
Danger is everywhere.
Let them relax a bit.
Am I too harsh?
You tend to drag others up to the level of your own ability.
That's how you are...
Of course, that's probably why you're alive today.
We move on!
Go away! I'm shedding!
I'm all for it.
Never seen a naked woman?
You must haven't made love for so long.
How about with me?
Not with you!
You have nothing to lose... even if I can't pay you.
Come on! How about it?
Touch me and I'll yell!
Put on your clothes!
You're too careless.
Mind your own affairs, Hon. Private!
Now move. We're leaving!
I'll listen to your excuse later.
Stop teasing the men!
I'm not teasing.
Once your out of danger, you're so easy to be careless.
What does it mean?
To hell with you!
I prefer him to you.
So what?
Just remember... danger lurks.
You could bring us trouble.
I'll not trouble you anymore.
Hey, stop it!
The dog! He was spying on us.
Maybe he lives here. We ate his pig.
Good for you.
If I hadn't been crapping out there, we'd be in hot water now.
You live here?
I'm sorry we killed your pig.
What nonsense you're talking!
Break the wall.
They're coming!
Hurry up!
Will Kaji make it?
What'll we do if he doesn't?
We'll make out. He's no god himself.
We know our way around, too.
As of now, I quit running... and start fighting.
Kill us if they want!
But why non-combatants?
Women?
We're all on edge.
That's no reason!
Such logic justifies nothing.
His guts were hanging out.
I finished him.
The dogs! Did a horrible thing to her.
Where's the men?
Out there somewhere. Go find them.
I'll bury the girl.
- I'll bury the others.
- The Manchu?
Any objections?
If you're burying the girl, you can also bury the Manchus.
But I'll do it for you.
I wish we could keep going under cover.
If they spot us, it will be the end.
Here they come.
Don't rush. They're too far.
There must be others. What'll we do?
Can't let our goose be cooked too.
Let's hurry along.
What a pillage job!
No wonder we're unwelcome.
But we can't die because of their guilt.
Damn! This is getting serious.
What shall we do? We're surrounded.
Can't budge!
We did no damage!
You didn't?
Kaji! We see smoke from the rear.
Let's run for it.
It's no use.
They'll get us as we come out.
It's time to give up.
Let's surrender.
Fool!
Surrender without firing a shot?
They don't want us alive... just dead!
That's why they caught fire.
Team up, men! We're going.
There's the fire line! It's safest!
Terada, come!
A narrow escape!
We'll wait till dawn.
We made it but
I don't approve of your methods.
Lost another man.
Meaning Hironaka?
I'm not blaming you.
I understand.
When we reach the railroad, we'll learn the truth.
We'll part there.
Japanse refugees!
Looks like they're mostly women.
Should we call?
Wait! Let's wait a bit longer.
What is it?
Don't look!
I can't believe it!
The Red army wouldn't rape...
Only Japanese women.
When prison conveys pass, the sight is really sickening.
Any women will do!
Women in defeat are doomed!
There must be knaves in even the Red Army.
One in millions!
But existence of a few proves nothing.
It doesn't underestimate the theory of the Red... no... People's army.
A flaw of the transition period.
It will soon be corrected.
The Red Army must be different from the Japanese Army in Nazi.
Not even like the Americans!
Minor facts ignored in history. can be important to the individual.
He who has such failings can never erase it out of the memory.
The blood of hate will continue to seep from the wounds.
A breeding ground of distrust.
The insult to humanity...
How do you defend it?
Are Reds down south like that, too?
I have faith.
Hon. soldiers-
Are you headed south?
We we're visiting our uncle when the hostiles broke out.
And your parents?
I don't know.
Going to Korea?
No, back to Peihutow.
Though we're not sure what we'll find there.
Will you take as far as the lake?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
We're fast walkers.
We'll keep up. We did this far.
Had any trouble en-route?
We had geisha girls with us.
They sacrificed themselves.
And... they?
They took them away.
They said that kid went off his rocker.
Saw them raping his sister.
Enough!
I'm sorry!
Resting so often for our sake.
Takes good care of you, eh?
He'll revive when we're home.
I can't let anything happen before I return him to our parents.
Feels great! Try it.
Not like me, at all!
That's better! Fine!
Junpohu very far off?
Very near now.
Just follow this road.
We're you heading for?
We're going back to Korea.
Excuse me...
Is Peihutow still safe?
I come from a village some distance away. I can't tell you.
I think they evacuated.
All Japanese farmers... have left the sectors already.
Follow the lake from here and you'll find Peihutow.
Yes... for some 20-odd miles.
Can you make it by yourselves?
Yes, we'll be all right.
I've been thinking about what that Korean told us.
Even if you return there, you'll find your mother and father gone.
It may be unwise for you to go.
If you have no place to go, you can come with me.
Then you could contact your parents.
Or return to Japan.
Isn't that wiser?
I will keep on.
If... if my parents are gone, there's still our Chinese friends.
I'll escort them.
How about it? Let's see them home.
Okay, sister?
I'm sick of walking.
We'll rest awhile and consider our future.
But.. what if they're gone?
Well... we'll join the guerrillas.
Make her our leader.
They're walking fast.
They're in a hurry.
But Hon. Squad Leader... what if there's no one there?
Don't worry! Just leave it to me.
The witch! What a tempting body!
Strange...
They've been after us with fire and anti-tank guns... and over look spots like this.
It's paradise!
Hi, buddy! What unit?
Border unit.
Damn! We lost the war?
The big brass dragged us out to this Hell-hole!
They should take care of us to get out.
You may be right.
But they're all prisoners or have returned to Japan.
But we've lost...
The Americans taking Japan and the Russians taking Manchuria?
No, the Soviets will not.
They will return to Chaing Kai-shek?
Maybe... at least they'll be Chinese.
The Russians wants nothing.
Their sole aim has always been liberation of China.
You mean... the Reds did all that for nothing?
Tange
The liberation... how will they go about accomplishing it?
Chinese Communists...
Through revolution.
Civil war?
You guys communists?
Why don't you go to the Russians with your tails wagging?
We have no tails!
Fake commies, eh?
That's better! Be careful.
It' cold outside! Like winter.
Boy, were we happy when we saw this place from the woods!
Making a final stand there?
Plenty of supplies! What's the plan?
Hikita.. where'd you leave that girl?
Where'd they go?
We took her to the hill overlooking her home.
She left us there.
You liar!
That's 80 km more than I made today.
And what if we are lying?
What's it to you?
If you're worried, why don't you go?
Didn't get a chance at her because I escorted her.
Despite efforts to impress her.
She was worked over with the Reds.
She had nothing to lose!
And so what?
I let her have it.
Without the kid gloves!
Meaning what?
Want to know? Her honor is now safe.
What've you curs done? Talk!
Get out of here!
I'm confiscating your weapons.
Terada, disarm them!
You bastard! Crawl now on all fours.
Part VI
Who's there?
Show yourself!
Get out of sight or they'll spot you.
Hey, you fellows!
You can't go down there.
Why?
They're mopping up.
The road is down by those woods.
Our lines end there.
What's going on here?
We're dug in!
Go see our commander.
He'll be brief. Then you can decide.
We're entrenched here.
Our troops are of the best... armed with machine guns and mortars.
We'll manage until next year.
After next year... then what?
I'm getting to that!
You know what's happening in Japan?
And how about Manchuria?
Will Russia return it to China?
They will... I'm sure
To whom? Chiang Kai-shek?
No, not to Chiang.
Wouldn't he want it?
He'll try to get it with the U.S. aid.
Will the Reds fight?
They will.
Good!
We seem to agree there.
The U.S. will back Chiang in driving... all communists out of Manchuria.
Just wait... there'll be civil war!
And not too far off, either!
That's when we get into action!
With you 50-odd men?
Numerical strength means nothing.
Only spirit counts!
We'll join the Nationalist Forces...
It's suicide!
You're wasting the lives of the troops you lead.
How about yourself?
You lead your own men to meet a dog's death!
That's not true!
They're sick of fighting.
They only want to go home.
Why should they risk their lives for the Americans or Chiang?
Then go! Keep moving!
Don't interrupt!
We've plenty of supplies.
Those who wish to join us... make your own choice.
We'll camp nearby.
We'll depart early tomorrow.
I talked to some of their men.
Seems impossible to break out.
The scouting party was wiped out... by a Red punitive expedition.
Does that prove that it'll be safer to remain here?
Those who wish can stay.
Winter's coming.
We'll have to hurry.
A long way yet.
Can we break through?
They're bound to spot us.
The woods are dense. Why worry?
Tange feels we should surrender.
Where's Sup. Private Kaji?
Over there.
Kaji?
Over here.
Mind if we join you?
We've had enough of war.
You can do as you like.
Want me to inform your commander?
Don't do it!
Desertion will mean facing the firing squad!
Then how are you gonna leave the troupe?
We'll slip out and join you later.
As long as we get out of this place, we'll be alright.
We vowed we'd remain together... until death tore our ties asunder.
You can't shoot them!
The army is disbanded!
You have no authority.
This is none of your business!
The fact that you broke their vow is a minor matter.
But it could affect others.
It is our conviction, that the best way... is to bide our time and do battle!
We waste words, sir!
Sup. Private Kaji!
Just shut up and get out!
Our men are raring to go!
Let them try!
We'll see about your discipline.
Nothing but a pack of bandits!
So what? I'll cut your head off like a bandit!
Wait!
Call your leader.
He conspired with these men.
I'd not advise it.
He's ill-tempered like this one.
Mabye more so!
I am here.
Tange... step back!
Commander... can we make a deal?
I've some men that want to join you
I'm willing to swap.
They're are welcome to join us.
But deserters can't go unpunished.
Kitago... execute them!
Tange... pick up the rifle!
Commander... we're leaving now.
You'll be wiped out before winter.
But not us... we're going!
- What's that on their backs?
- Flame-thrower!
Without even advance or rear guards!
They're a pushover from here.
Go it alone then!
Let's go!
I'm giving myself up.
You're going?
After you move on,
I'm going over to them.
Call out before going, with arms raised.
We'll meet again.
If we survive.
Maybe you're right... and I'm wrong.
Who knows?
Let's just hope.
A woodpecker.
Why so worried?
As quiet as death!
I hope we can sleep under a roof tonight.
Split up here!
My poor back!
I've about had it!
If we hadn't split our party, we'd be dead.
When this chattered... I went cold!
Now I'll try it.
Don't take their weapons.
Why? There will help us.
Not necessarily.
If we're caught with those guns, we'd be executed!
They'll hear that and think that they won.
Use up their ammunition.
Then we're moving on.
That's no village.
Settlement, maybe?
Probably.
What'll we do?
Let's find out.
Maybe what the commander said was right.
We might be on the threshold of civilized society.
Split into fours!
300-400 meters between groups!
We'll go first.
If anything happens to us you can run or give yourself up.
Our whole future hangs on... what happens here.
Where are you men heading?
Past the railroad to the south.
Only three of you?
No, fifteen men are behind us.
You may not know, but the railroad is some
10 kilometers from here.
Just beyond that is the P.O.W. Camp.
Were there any soldiers passing through here?
They come by here quite often.
Bringing nothing but trouble.
They stagger in half-starved.
We have nothing left to share!
They've completely looted our fields.
Our main concern now is... what is to become of us?
What should we do?
Where did the soldiers go?
They went in various directions.
The chatter of automatic rifles always followed in their wake.
It is doubtful if any have survived.
Do enemy troops ever make trouble?
At first, we feared and loathed them.
But they're nicer than our own men.
And they bring us bread!
All in all, they're as naive as babies.
If we're nice to them, we're safe.
Not like our troops... who seek loot and a free ride!
You intend to remain overnight?
With our doubtful reputation,
I won't insist on it.
We can camp out.
Could you do us a favor?
Though the Russians promise to look after us, we can't wait.
I realize it might cause you trouble...
What is it?
They grow corn and potatoes... in a field some distance from here.
So you want us to steal?
It is an evil thing we ask... but the girls will do the work.
I only ask that your men protect them from any harm.
I understand! We'll do it.
Wait for us nearby.
Don't come too close!
Japanese!
It's cold outside, even with a fire.
Why don't you come inside.
I've kept a spot for you.
No sentry duty?
I'll stay up a while longer.
We'll take shifts.
It may shock the lad.
What?
After all... they're sleeping together.
And there are more women than men!
Are you angry with me?
For mentioning the Reds?
Not at all.
But... you think I'm filthy.
That's it... isn't it?
No...
You women... are you married?
Yes.
Need we starve because of it?
Must we bite our tongue off?
Who said so?
How many of us... can return to our normal lives... if we ever get home.
During a fleeting night with the men, the girls talk of returning home together.
When locked in one's embrace, it even seems possible!
But at dawn... it's all over!
The men become jittery... grab their weapons... and sneak off.
Soldier... you listening?
I hear you.
Women waste no tears!
They're waiting for the soldier who'll take them away.
We'll never get home.
Nor will we ever see our loved ones.
We don't know if we'll survive!
That's how it is. We're damned!
We think of only eating... to keep ourselves strong.
There's no hope left.
No happy reunions in sight.
It's our common fate. It's maddening.
It's maddening!
Our common fate... never get home...
No hope of reunion...
No place to return...
Never meet our loved ones...
Let's go inside.
It's safe at night.
No one will come tonight.
You go on inside.
I'll find some place to sleep.
Good-conduct men, eh?
You're quite a rare bird.
Too good to be dallying with my kind!
Are you saying I'd buy you with stolen food?
Michiko-
Michiko-
And walking towards you!
If you weren't waiting...
I could never carry on another step!
There's trouble brewing.
Some want to stay here or take their women.
How about you?
Seemed like a good idea while it lasted.
It was quite a night!
What's with you?
You're acting like a Zen priest!
No tails wagged your way?
None of your business.
I'm thinking of disbanding here.
Last night I really learned how... to appreciate women!
Why not discard our weapons and join them as refugees?
Women walk too slow!
They'd be getting in our way.
Not necessarily!
With men it's kill or be killed.
With women... they might go easy on us.
Some of the men would prefer to accompany us.
It's time we did something.
This may be our last chance!
But if we run into any Reds?
Men can fight their way out- but who knows what horrible fate would await us?
That lad... he's really afraid of you.
Why?
You tend to intimidate people.
Just remember... I seduced him!
Not my concern!
It is!
I hear you saved his life.
He insists on going with you.
So I'm coming along too.
Don't mind, do you?
This isn't play!
The past week we have made Terada a man.
Not that bad after all!
You were probably his first women.
You were probably his first women.
Though any man would do for you, he is still naive.
You are partly responsible.
And stay away from me!
I'm human too!
The girls insist on being allowed... to accompany you.
Become a refugee and take them along.
Wait till night fall, and take them as far as the railroad.
T hey can go their own separate ways.
It's not very long! Let's do it.
Is it too much?
I've heard of various opinions from the men and the women.
I don't know which is best.
It might be best if we formed separate groups.
You would then have free choice.
How about you?
I'm going straight on.
And weapons?
I go armed!
Are you sure you'll make it?
No. But I'll try.
I'm leaving now.
Terada, you'd better remain here.
You can pass as a young refugee.
Bury your rifle and bayonet.
I won't stay!
I'm going!
How about her?
She's depending on you.
You also wanted to be depended on.
She's nothing!
You rejected her... so...
Stop imagining things!
She's not interested in either of us.
She just wants male protection.
You can supply that.
Keep trailing me and you'll never become a man.
Emergency alarm!
Enemy troops!
Take cover!
Women... hide.
How many?
About twenty... Soviet and Militia.
Fire when I fire!
Then... the grenades!
Automatics first!
Wait till I fire!
Stop... please!
Don't do it!
What will happen to us? Please!
Please... men... don't do it!
Drop your weapons!
We surrender.
Terada, stay behind... with the women!
Stop crying!
It's not over yet.
Just starting!
Forward!
Get back in line!
In line!
Terada... get up!
Halt!
Halt!
No sitting down!
Get up! Keep walking!
Interpreter!
What made them halt?
Who gave orders to halt?
- From the rear.
- It came from the rear.
Who was it?
Better step forward!
The commander's mad.
Otherwise the whole unit... gets three days hard labor without food.
Who was it? Step forward!
Who's responsible?
You did it. Step forward!
Go ahead!
I'm the one.
Fool! Why'd you do such a thing?
I didn't mean to.
I didn't think they'd stop.
But I did wish they would.
He just wanted the column to halt.
That's the commander's prerogative.
It's insubordination!
You are a prisoner.
Just do as you're told.
Explain what I'm saying.
The commander doesn't know.
The men are hit by diarrhea.
This is inhuman!
I may have done wrong, but I want him to understand.
He says men in the rear have diarrhea.
The guard kicked one of these men.
He wants the case investigated.
He claims one of you kicked a prisoner.
Is that true?
There must be no maltreatment of prisoners.
Also... disciplinary violations by prisoners... will be punished!
Fascist samurai!
Let you off this time! Be careful!
Says you're a Fascist samurai!
Forward!
Filthy dog!
Excuse me.
It's okay. Forget it!
Fascist samurai? Great!
Shut up!
I, Noge, assume command of this work detail by orders of the Soviets.
The fortune of war was turned against us, and we are in defeat.
But our country still remains.
Some day we shall return to our homes.
A Japanese respects all authority.
We must endeavor to show the Red army... this national trait.
Our labor quotas must be met!
Only then I will be in a position to demand... improvement of your labor conditions, with Russian officers
Endeavor to maintain good health... and bear these bitter trials... and await the rebuilding... of our father country!
That's all.
They get officers' rations.
They should not talk!
Can't be helped. That's the law!
Oh? Discrimination even among Reds?
Terada-
From tomorrow, pretend you're ill and stay behind.
After we're gone, go rummage through their garbage heap.
Potato peelings, carrot scraps, anything!
It'll add to our rations.
If not... we'll starve!
We can't die yet!
Back to work! On your feet!
How can we without eating?
Come on, fellas, we're wanted!
What are you doing?
Making clothes... out of sacks.
What if they find out?
You have a good uniform, but I come directly from battle.
I warn you! Don't!
Though a mere gunny-sack, it's still enemy property.
You disgrace us!
Just leave me alone.
It's the cold season.
I'm wearing these gunny-sacks.
Unless you find me something better.
It's a hard work.
It's not too bad.
Except for that icy water.
After washing the food, I feel better.
I know we'll all live another day.
When I hear the singing,
I feel they must be good.
Their life must be good... outside the army.
When I joined up, I was so ignorant.
As you once said
"You fool!"
"Death in battle is a dog's death!"
You remember?
It was true.
We came a long way!
I didn't expect it to end up like this.
But I don't mind.
I'm beginning to realize how dear life can be.
This is the start.
It's rock bottom.
Now we can only go up!
Kitchen duty men usually chatter about women.
He's unusual!
He's talking about philosophy!
Then you stay behind!
I'll go work.
Ignore the bum!
He has the bad habit... of sneering at serious conversation.
I'd hoped for this meeting.
It's not mutual.
Are rapist-crooks allowed to run free in here?
I used my brains!
I'm one of the "active" elements here.
Me... Kirihara!
And your buddies?
Gone... to Siberia!
Must keep my eyes open.
Can't allow violations!
Kaji!
My day has come!
I must live... to see that dog unmasked!
If I talked 'down' to you,
I'll correct that.
After all, we must be
'democratic' from now on.
You're a good worker, but I hear you've ben sabotaging us.
No sabotage. He's a sick man.
It can't be helped!
I can't allow it.
The Red's officers are angry.
Though not your fault, other groups are pulling the same trick.
That's how they see it.
If this continues, they threaten to send us to North Siberia, from where no one ever returns.
That's how it is. What do you think?
I'm not impressed!
What was it that you wished?
No more sabotage!
On our rations, you'll live.
We must protect ourselves.
The Soviets are granting you... the privileges of military rank.
If you'll guarantee us protection,
I'll gladly change my ideas.
I'm P.O.W. myself.
You seem to enjoy defying officers.
Not enjoyment... it's necessity!
Then you refuse to end the sabotage?
It may not be right, but it can't be helped.
We can't let you do as you like.
Big aims demand some sacrifice!
We may be forced to deliver you to the Reds!
Yes, Mr. Noge!
I've faith in the future of socialism.
And in my countrymen!
I will work.
But I must also preserve the strength of those around me.
And that's it!
Such elements will bring trouble in the future.
Cope with him now!
What did Nage want?
Watch out or they'll take us off... this light labor detail!
You never work anyway.
It's guys like you who weaken my argument.
All I get is complaints!
You're a good egg, but stupid!
A serious life isn't always the best.
Delirious times call for delirious measures.
You're too naive!
A knaves logic, eh?
I'll show you what real labor means!
Dog! Loafing has made you go soft.
Stop it!
That's enough!
Regardless of the reason, that's going too far!
How can you stand there laughing?
Never treat your men like this.
Rest quietly... or you'll end up like that, too.
I won't die!
Not after coming this far.
I've had worse than this.
Get some rest.
Get a fire going.
Minegawa!
Interpreter Minegawa!
One of my men needs to go to the hospital.
They're packed!
They're releasing even the uncured.
Then get him some aspirin.
Can't... only in-patients.
I'll go ask. Will you interpret?
Sorry... I'm busy!
Can't be bothered with patients.
You know... you'd better get to work.
It's going too far.
Am I a suspect again?
Not you alone... but the
Red officers are mad at... the reactionary elements!
Superior Private; 1 year,
9 months of service.
Previous employment: labor supervisor.
Exploitation of labors, eh?
Yes... something like that.
Hey, what did he say?
I can't answer.
This is not a court.
I pronounce no sentence.
But resistance and negligence... cannot be condoned.
You will be assigned to a detail pulling up railroad tracks.
There are no barbed-wire enclosures, but there can be no resistance or escape.
To attempt either means starvation!
For sabotage, you're getting hard labor.
If you request or attempt escape, you will starve to death.
That's ridiculous!
I don't mind work, but be human! Let me have my say!
Tell him that.
What did he say?
What you say is nonsense.
And stupid!
Rascal!
Fascist dog!
What was that?
You wretch...
Somewhere... I have seen you before.
You're the one... the samurai!
I'd expect it from you!
The worst in the world are Nazi dogs.
The next are Japanese like you!
The meeting took considerable time.
What's going on? You look angry.
This one is a notorious Fascist,
Comrade!
An organizer of sabotage!
He dared to call us stupid!
This one who is addressed as, "Comrade" -
He might be... a Party member.
If only I could talk!
Stupid Minagawa!
I have so much to tell you.
It'd take all night.
However You'd never understand.
Explain why the sabotage.
Forget the fancy stuff!
I escaped with my life... from the field of battle.
But now I am convinced... that I have run too far.
It was an error of romantic miscalculation.
Russia's so called "historic mission"- sacrifices the individual... and tries to justify it.
Just or not... the individuals suffer.
They must protect themselves.
We have no choice!
After the battle was over, did you ever attack any of us?
I did.
Also the Chinese?
I did.
That makes you guilty of war crimes.
I could deny it... no evidence!
You... you deny that your troops... committed rape and pillage, right?
You deny it... though it be futile.
I admit my faults... and would point out yours.
Whether I was denounced by Kirihara or that officer, Noge, it does not matter... what matters... is that you use such mento... censure me for protecting my men, by sifting though your garbage heap.
Due to emergency, supervision is amiss, good is supressed and evil tolerated.
The fact that Socialism is better than Fascism, won't keep us alive.
Stand up!
You look angry.
You seem to dislike... our repartition of the work which doesn't... consider your situation, right?
If given more time a democratic movement will grow among you... and all will be well.
You must wait... not move on your own!
You admit to sabotage.
Such acts are not to be condoned.
Your leader has agreed to send you... to work on the railroad.
It's only one week. You must submit.
Anything else?
If possible... I'd like an aspirin.
He wants medicine.
He says his friend is ill.
I'll get it for you tomorrow.
You'll return, won't you?
One new life... remember?
If you're not up when I get back, you're a weakling!
Look after him.
Going away, huh?
Do me a favor?
What?
About Terada...
You wanted revenge on me?
You've had it.
But he's still. See that he gets food.
No problem to a "comrade".
You can't butter me up!
Squealed about Noge and me, but it didn't help, eh?
Too bad!
While you're sleeping in the cold, think what price you'll pay for kicking me out!
Here... have some!
I'll get you.
Kaji
It's you?
Tange!
It was stupid to run.
Also to be caught.
I might as well try again.
Are you sure you'll make it?
I couldn't say.
You'll be captured, killed, or frozen to death.
Not like you to trust in luck.
Why do you fear Siberia?
If you can't survive... no one can!
Send me to Siberia and forced labor if they will.
Their "Freedom" is phony!
Exploiting our labor and then re-educating us.
Is that their way?
It's not the amount of work.
Nor the short rations.
And even their guards... sleep on the ground with us.
What I'm saying... most prisoners aren't enemies of their class struggle!
Their treatment of such men... seems lacking in co-ordination.
In what way?
I may be wrong.
But they seem a bit self-centered.
Can't be helped!
Their strategy calls for a
Soviet First policy.
Can't be helped?
They're only human... can't be helped!
History will correct it.
That's not for us.
I'm fed up!
If they ship me off to Siberia,
I'm staking my life on that.
Terada!
Wake up... Terada!
I warned him not to try again, but he insisted on getting up.
And he went out after more food.
And Kirihara caught him.
He was beaten and given latrine duty.
We carried him limp and stinking to the hospital, but it was too late!
He died... calling your name.
You may not believe me, but I took the case to Noge!
He wouldn't listen.
The guards knew?
Yes, but they say it wasn't a crime.
No direct evidence.
Tange...
I've changed my mind!
I'm breaking out!
Don't stop me.
I'm making a mistake... but I'm going!
The big shot wants to see you about me.
At this time of the night?
I'm challenging you to a duel.
Are you afraid?
You're crazy!
We'll need Minigawa.
No need for interpreters.
There's one waiting.
Are you coming? Or will you apologize?
That's a laugh!
Siberia is too good for you.
This way!
You dog!
Had enough?
Stop it... please!
Please... I apologize!
I thought so!
Scum!
Die, you dog! You deserve it.
Your kind deserves to be liquidated!
Good people are suffering because of you!
Die!
Kaji-san!
Terada?
Are you still following me?
Don't Terada.
If you follow in my footsteps, you'll never grow to be a man.
No! You're already a man.
You need to be ashamed of nothing!
I'm walking on!
If I lose my way, you must guide me.
You're a man now! You must guide me.
Have I done wrong?
I never erred!
Tange is off in Siberia.
That rascal probably... despises and envies me!
Michiko!
Let me laugh if they want!
I'm returning to you.
I'm still walking on.
I'll beg for food at that village, then continue on to you.
Buzz off, beggar!
Are you deaf?
Get out of here!
You thieving rascal!
Thief!
This one is Japanese!
Look! A Japanese pig!
Michiko, forgive me!
I've come as far as I'm able.
Michiko, look... I've come this far!
Michiko!
I saved this for you.
I'll bring you this bread.
It's a manto for you.
My only souvenir.
After 700-odd days of being away, that's all I have.
I had to kill many men, to come back to you.
Killed many men!
Don't hate me for it!
I'm coming home.
Even as I'm walking towards you.
Michiko... do you still await my return?
I'm so happy!
I knew you'd return... no matter what!
Your whiskers! They tickle me.
You must bathe and shave.
No... the food must wait!
I had faith in you!
I knew you would come home.
I was so sure... so confident!
When I'm in your arms...
I seem to melt away.
Wait, Michiko! It won't be long now.
Here I am! It's not far now.
Trails dogged my footsteps, but it will soon be over.
Tonight I'll see you... hear you... and feel your tender hands.
And my memories will revive all that which we have lost.
Not far now!
Let me rest... just five minutes!
Then I'll continue on to you.
There were no 'Farewells' for us.
Michiko!
Tonight our life is starting again.
Michiko,
I'm back with you... by your side...
The End.
An RAF bomber
Night attack over Germany
Operation codename "Tea for 2"
Water's nippy this morning, isn't it?
Come quickly
Take my hand
American?
No, English.
Hurry up, the zoo will open soon.
Germans are everywhere.
Give me the parachute.
Take all your things.
Get back up!
He's gonna make me fall!
I'm sorry...
Did I dirty your uniform?
This is a misunderstanding.
No way.
I'm coming up.
Stop shooting. Search the houses and take them alive.
This is not a place to land!
Are you injured?
Very high.
Thank you Gentlemen. It was very good.
You over there: very good.
You were good, well so so...
You over there, we did no hear you.
We never hear you.
You do nothing but chit-chat
You better behave.
I have a personal vision of this work.
Not triumphant enough,
Not proud enough!
All this is mush actually.
It was not bad,
It was very bad.
Let's start again from Number 17
No Sir, chit-chatting again!
Stay focused.
Goodness gracious, you are talkative!
From Number 17 again
Who did this?
Me, Maestro
Where do you think you are?
The Opera, Maestro.
Amusing. Out!
Mephisto, Marguerite, Faust, out!
I want nobody here when I'm working!
Only Berlioz and I.
Keep it down please.
Sorry Mr Lefort.
Number 17
More flamboyant please.
Like lightning before thunder.
Are you coming darling?
In a minute.
Bébert, the explosives.
Wires
Make sure there's nobody outside.
You plug the hole.
If you keep making so much noise,
Lefort will poke his nose in our business.
Are you done?
Ready to blow.
This flower is poking out.
Do not touch it!
My wire is connected to it.
You'd blow the whole thing.
Silence!
Search everywhere.
Lights!
Everyone stay put.
Leaving is forbidden!
A British paratrooper has hidden in the opera house
Anyone giving him assistance will be shot
Herr Conductor, we have shot down a British bomber over Paris.
Two pilots are hiding here.
Very sorry to interrupt your rehearsal.
You heard the man...
Machine guns have reduced our rehearsal to 12 minutes.
It will be a nice performance tonight!
Let me through.
The nerve.
Stopping a rehearsal!
I am French... The Germans...
Please help.
I am fed up, fed up!
Open the door or we break it open.
Yes, yes, I'm coming!
Sorry Gentlemen.
This is a global house search.
Me too I'm fed up!
Shut up, you pain in the ass.
Can't you see we have visitors?
Do not mind her, please come in
You are lucky.
Your wife is far away.
You there soldier, since you're here.
Catch this suitcase and put it on the bed.
I'm out of here.
Stop it. Can't you see you're putting yourself on show?
I will not stay another minute with this idiot.
You'll see once they're gone.
I'll cure you...
Nobody on the balcony, sir.
Let's go.
I am really sorry.
They are upstairs.
Quick.
If the elevator goes to the top floor, the Brit will be crushed.
Wait.
Too heavy.
People never close the doors...
I lost it. What?
The key.
I always put it under the carpet but...
Quick!
Nothing to worry about.
Augustin Bouvet,
Paint and renovation
Bury this straight away. Dangerous.
U kidding? I have a wife and 6 kids. I have enough material for shirts til the war ends.
Thanks
Alright, they have left.
The street is empty.
We shall leave too.
I'll try to bring him to my place.
Your place?
The Germans must be there already!
At my place?
Do you have a telephone at home?
Yes, Clignancourt 1335 is the number.
Wait
It won't answer. I'm not there, since I'm here.
Augustin Bouvet please.
Speaking.
He's lying, he's not me.
Without you we would have gone home and been captured.
What a mess!
What shall I do now?
What's he saying?
He wants to go to the Turkish Baths.
He's supposed to meet his pals at the Turkish Baths.
Another English brain-dead idea...
Wounded, and not speaking French.
He will be caught straight away.
I'll find him clothing.
We'll meet at my grandfather's place
Where is that?
The Puppet Theatre on Champs-Elysees.
I work with him.
Search there
Search here
I go in to check
Come in
No no no like the birds,
Chirp chirp chirp.
This time I shall not interrupt your rehearsal. Please continue.
Enough.
What are you looking for?
Your Englishman?
Not him
Follow me
He's not here right?
Not here either?
Not here.
You interrupt my rehearsal.
Now you interrupt my lesson.
Forgive me Herr Conductor.
Yeah yeah I forgive you.
Come here. He's not here right?
There? He's no more there.
And here, what's here?
Allow me.
Ah. Black Market.
No - It's for the interval.
I'm always hungry.
My stomach goes like this...
So I need to eat.
That's why I keep provisions.
Big crook.
No, small crook.
Have some...
No thank you, Herr Conductor.
Sorry, I must be going.
Good-bye
Right, back to lesson Number 4.
Let's see...
No speaking, just shut up.
Do not say a word.
Sit on the music stool.
We shall now read a bit of music.
Me, go to the Turkish baths?
Do not whistle this.
American song
Forbidden here.
Gentlemen, I overheard you.
You were talking of Mc Intosh and Peter, right?
No no no
Don't know what you are talking about.
I am looking for a friend.
Lost him in the fog.
Have you met him by chance?
Big mustache.
I am... I was big mustache.
Follow me
His accent sounds real.
Let's follow him.
Herr Conductor, are you there?
Open this door, now!
Major, have a look.
He has fled
Catch him.
Put this back in its original place
Now, I wait for you, Herr Conductor.
Opera house, quick.
Coming.
Are you crazy?
Stealing German uniforms!
We need them for operation Mc Intosh tonight at the Opera house.
No, it is too dangerous
I do not want to, understood?
Where is the Englishman?
I am sick...
Not sick... It was him!
No, this is a harp.
Where is the Englishman?
There's an Englishman here??
Your explanation does not satisfy me!
But it's rather clear!
I am regular army not secret police
But if you refuse to talk
I'll hand you over to a department that will make you talk.
Naturally
Only after this evening's performance, held for our Brigadier.
Until then, you are my prisoner.
I arrest you, Madame Crook.
You have no right to arrest me.
Isn't it, children?
No
If Guignol was here,
He would save me.
He won't come.
Help me shout for him...
Guignol, Guignol.
What audacity, going around dressed as German officers.
What if the police asks for our papers?
You are talking too loudly.
She is only 3.
You're right, she's looking at me.
Two Germans at the back.
Fortunately, General AUGUSTIN will come to my rescue.
Help me call for him.
Augustin.
What a great day...
Two English pilots,
A French hero
My granddaughter spoke of you and your great courage.
Really? You mentioned me to your family?
How about her. She was great.
I am not surprised.
Gentlemen, my noble theatre is a poor hiding place...
However Juliette and I can help you leave Paris.
If we manage to sneak into unoccupied France, we sure can make it back to England.
England?
I bloody well can't go to England!
Go with them.
It's safer for you.
There you have it.
The beautiful France.
I summarize
Tomorrow morning 8h05 you take the train for Burgundy.
Once in Meursault, go directly to
"Hotel du Globe".
No need to take notes.
My granddaughter is going with you.
You're coming along?
Of course, the adventure goes on.
Isn't it exciting, Augustin?
Kindof.
Thanks. Thanks to all of you.
However tonight
I must first go to the Opera
To look for my friend Mc Intosh.
Augustin, you will come with me.
Well, err...
Ok, I'll go.
Won't take long. Get in, pick up
Mc Intosh and hightail out of there.
We have to get backstage.
Excuse me sir, how do we get backstage?
End of the corridor, to the left.
This way, Herr General.
Poor Lefort.
What do we do?
Shall we cancel?
Too late. Too bad for Lefort.
Let's go.
Thank you.
30 more seconds.
Shit. It failed.
This time it was not me!
Stop
Intermission...
It was not me, it was not me!
It's me!
Ah then it's me.
Pretend you are our prisoner.
No, go left.
The gates of Hell?
No, an underground river under the Opera.
Where does it exit?
According to Victor Hugo, nowhere.
God bless you.
With your bald head, you're gonna catch a cold.
Take my cap.
Leave me alone and mind your oars!
Would you please calm down...
Germans?
No, the subway
Get out? Ah, ok.
Come on, quickly.
We cannot get out dressed like this...
We will all be caught.
Wait
Who are you?
Do not worry.
We will not harm you.
My wallet
What time is it?
8h04 - Come on.
Excuse me, was this the train for
Chalons-sur-Saone?
Yes
When is the next one?
I don't know.
Ask the information counter.
Look - a roadblock.
Something must be going down.
Stop - What is this?
Postal Service
Don't bother.
It's out of gas.
Push the car this way.
To hide it.
Push
Come on! Push!
Speak to me politely.
Would you please push, maestro?
That's better.
Slowly, slowly
Stop
Now dear friends, let's share our food stamps.
French stamps, printed in London.
French money.
Not printed in London.
Let's go Augustin.
Why must he always call me Augustine?
Hey, why don't I get any?
Wait a minute.
I am short of one.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Wait for me, for crying out loud!
Hurry up!
My feet are swelling up.
Leave me alone.
My foot is huge.
Come on, let's go.
Stand up... Stanislas.
A little bit of respect, please.
You cannot order me around.
Listen, my dear.
We belong to two different worlds.
Between us, there will always be... this
Give me your hand.
You are so showy!
Be careful... Be very careful.
Fine.
Wait for me...
We'll be back!
Look, they ran off!
They are abandoning us!
Darn, I never thought they could be like that
What will become of us?
Do not worry, we will keep walking.
We will make it anyway, gentlemen!!
Wear your shoes
Lean on my arm for support.
See, that's what the English are capable of.
I'm surprised. They were rather nice.
You must have had an English nanny!
Thief! Thief!
These shoes are not made for long walks.
That explains why.
I accept your kind offer.
What offer?
To lend me your shoes.
What size do you wear?
Same as yours.
All right
Ah. That's better.
Wait for me.
Come on...
I have to get used to them.
Come on, get moving.
The Germans!
We're lucky you have quick reflexes.
Thank you
Don't mention it.
How about the Englishmen?
What?
They will be caught
You're right - they should had stayed with us
Alright. Let's go.
Wait. I return you your shoes.
I'm afraid of making them bigger.
Ah yes. You are damaging them...
Are my shoes ok?
A bit wide.
Sorry about that.
Are you coming?
Come on, come on.
Who did you steal this from?
Me. Good morning, sirs
Good morning, Sister.
Let's hurry. I am expected at the Beaunes hospital.
Get on quickly
Would you pass the salt please.
This needs pepper too.
[French Poem]
Charles Péguy.
Wonderful poet, isn't he?
You see,
I know your language well.
What is it?
What? Really? Excellent!
We searched the whole train.
There was no other Englishman.
Excellent.
Search the entire neighbourhood.
Yes Major.
Send him to the nearest Kommandantur
...Meursault.
Ok, Meursault.
I'll be there tonight.
Maybe we should turn around...
Sorry chaps, too late to go back.
What did he say?
Throw pumpkins at them.
Ouch Ouch.
You confuse my head with a pumpkin!
Stop pushing, you'll make me fall out!
To the right!
This is not England!
Give me a pumpkin, quick!
No more pumpkins, we're out of ammo.
We reached Meursault.
I know. I can see for myself!
Now we have to find l'Hotel du Globe'.
This you cannot see.
Enough. Push me.
No, the saddle.
Don't forget to brake.
You may fall otherwise.
What's the matter?
Why are you making so much noise?
My chain came off.
Give it to me. I'll fix it.
You are really clumsy.
To go faster, you ride my bad bike and I'll ride yours.
Second time you've done this.
First my shoes, now my bike.
It's normal, no?
Ah ok. I'm sorry.
Actually, why is it normal?
Because...
Because I am a manual worker is it?
Yes, that's rite, yes!
But you know,
It's not your fault.
It won't last.
I'm fed up of traveling with someone like you.
You are dumping me.
You found the perfect excuse.
This is all your fault.
There was no need to run errands for the Brits.
We could have stayed with them at the nunnery!
They could not fetch Peter themselves!
I don't give a damn about Peter.
And neither do you!
You dragged me here for that girl from the Guignol Theatre!
I forbid you from talking about the girl from the Guignol Theatre.
I'm fed up. Manage on your own.
Don't want to see you again.
Same here.
Quick!
Thank you.
Be quiet!
Nobody.
Do you have a match?
I don't have anything.
Look at the time!
And drunk again!
Forgive my husband, general.
And mine, general.
Go to the kitchen, there are dishes to be washed!
Scoundrel, come here!
Today is my birthday.
Champagne for these men!
Woman should not order man around.
Man wears the trousers!
Even if trousers are too big.
How to get to 'Hotel du Globe'?
Straight ahead, Major.
There you are. Number 6.
Sorry gentlemen,
But you will have to sleep together.
Unthinkable!
In the same bed?
This is wartime...
Leave me alone.
This belongs to war atrocities...
Leave me alone I said!
Why?
Sorry, please move over.
Augustin, help me.
With pleasure, Juliette.
We were afraid you would not make it.
They are combing the region for you.
It must be because of Peter's arrest.
Peter arrested? That's awful.
But us? What will we do? What will happen to us?
At dawn tomorrow,
I will get you smuggled you to Free France.
You will meet your British friends there.
What is that?
Curfew. They cut electricity.
Who is knocking?
It's the front door.
Stay put.
Yes?
We requisitioned a room, from Paris.
One moment, gentlemen.
Maybe they are coming for us?
No it's for me, a requisition. Good night.
Have a rest. You'll sleep well, the beds are good.
I will wake you up at 5 am.
Let's go, Juliette.
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Would you please come in.
Good night Juliette.
I wanted to say... I'm happy to be here.
Very kind of you Augustin but...
Quick, get back in.
Sorry gentlemen but the hotel is full.
I could only get you one room with a big bed.
Number 9
It's wartime, madam.
There's a washbasin in the room.
If you want to take a shower, it's at the end of the corridor on your right.
Thanks
You will sleep well.
The beds are good.
Do you mind?
Sorry.
Come to bed.
I will never get used to it.
Of course you will - don't be a prude.
Little Stanislas will be real comfy.
Please...
Get the covers back.
Sorry. You are not married rite?
No.
Neither am I. But it won't be long.
Cos Juliette...
War does have its benefits...
I want to ask you...
Do you find me attractive?
It is late, let's go to sleep.
Good night.
Forgot to tell you: I snore.
But it's ok. Just whistle and I stop.
I'm not gonna whistle the whole night long!
What's wrong? Are you upset?
It's Interval time.
I get hungry. My stomach goes like this...
I have to eat.
Are you crazy? You can eat tomorrow morning!
The hotel is full of Germans!
Am I not the owner's husband?
Close the door behind me.
Am I not Juliette's husband?
Steuber!
Yes Major?
Go get me some food while I have a bath.
Yes, sir!
During the war, a house painter... a charming man... met a lovely blond girl.
She passed him off for her husband to save his life.
Today, war is over.
Victory has arrived.
So of course, we must kiss...
Augustin...
Yes, I know. It didn't work.
But war is not over yet...
Do you really think we must wait until Victory day?
We must go to sleep, and for good this time.
What is it?
Sorry sir.
Lieutenant Steuber
Excuse me sir. Who are you?
Who are you?
I am the owner's husband.
I am the Maitre d'H
Are you the boss?
Not boss, boss's husband.
Is there anything left to eat?
Nothing left to eat, nothing!
How about this?
I forgot about this. It's eatable, yes.
Is that a German officer?
German officer, really?
Looks like a general.
General, really?
This one can be eaten.
Would you like some?
I cannot eat a German officer
Cannibal?
Good night, madam.
Thank you for keeping some food for my officer.
Naughty liar...
Your food, Major.
How nice of him...
Thank you Stanislas.
How are we today?
Do I get a smile? Yes, he looks better.
Continue the treatment for 48 hours
But decrease the dosage slowly.
Are you happy here?
Stop looking so glum.
Better be sick here than able-bodied elsewhere...
Next!
Ah, a new one.
What's wrong with you my son?
Oh, he does look ill.
Sit up.
Show me your tongue.
Your tongue.
White tongue, yellow eyes, red nose...
Liver disease!
Pain there, that's the liver.
You enjoy all good things in life right?
That's very bad.
Sit up.
Say 33...!
Say it!
I see...
I admitted those 2 patients, doctor.
This one and the one next door.
Best remedy is a change in scenery...
Straight away, doctor.
You will still need to keep an eye on this liver...
Juliette get up, go make coffee.
I'm coming.
Time to wake up!
What is the matter?
Sorry, wrong room.
5 am. Get up!
It's 5am! What on earth is the matter?
What is the matter?
Sorry, wrong room.
5 o'clock - Are you crazy?
The major is tired - He's resting.
What are you doing here?
Come on boy, come on!
Mine fits, but yours...
Your helmet
Yours
Your military police breastplate.
Your gun.
Be careful they are loaded.
Juliette, open the door.
They will be your guides. They know the way.
Don't worry they do not bite.
With my dogs and the uniforms, you are the patrol.
What if we meet the real patrol?
They will think you are another patrol.
Do not release them. It happened before and the men got lost.
Good-bye Juliette.
Are you going back to Paris?
Yes, back to Guignol.
No more General Augustin.
No
But he promised to visit me.
After the war.
Actually I wanted to tell you...
A wall. What do we do?
I don't know. They seem confused.
Hold onto the leashes. I'll get over the wall and get the dogs.
But they will bite me.
They can't. They are on the other side.
Don't move.
What are you doing?
Come on, climb over the wall.
Be careful! I'm here!
Help me come down.
I can't. I have the dogs!
Come closer.
Stop, stop.
Why would you want them to stop?
So that you can come down.
It's quite alrlight this way.
You don't actually believe I'm gonna carry you on my back??
Don't waste time chit-chatting. Let's go.
This is the third time.
My shoes, my bicycle...
Go towards the left, there...
You think it's this way?
Yes.
Ok
You are very heavy for your height.
Wait for me!
I am here.
You saved my life again.
I thank you.
We have no dogs. We are lost.
I'm exhausted.
If we stay here, we will be captured.
Great.
No, come on...
I want to stay here.
Leave me alone!
He's not gonna have a nervous breakdown!
I want to go back to Paris, back to my paints.
You'll see them again...
My brushes.. Silk, Brand new.
Let's go.
I'll buy you a box of big square ones.
You need round ones. You don't know anything.
You'll come to the shop with me.
And my paints?
We'll buy 3 tubs in the same shop.
Come on.
If Juliette was here, she would know.
But look, I'm here!
This is not the same.
You'll see her again, your Guignol girl...
Don't make fun of her, or else...
Sorry, are you feeling better?
Maybe another one would help.
You ok now?
Tell me, you don't want one yourself, no?
No, I'm ok, thanks.
You'll get one anyway!
First, we go to the Kommandantur
I'm delivering the 2 barrels of wine behind you.
And they renew my 'Ausweiss'
It is a pass that lets me enter the free zone.
What if they refuse?
Never happened. They like our wine too much.
They are right.
We will then cross the border line.
Hide, we are arriving.
These days they arrest each other.
They mustn't be doing too well.
Please do sit inside.
We will bring the Englishman.
Come out!
Quick!
Good morning, sir
I bring wine for your colonel
Excellent, sister.
4 barrels?
No, 2 only. This one and this one.
Do you understand?
Yes, sister.
You ausweiss, sister.
Come, sister.
No, these two.
There you go, sister.
Thanks.
Stop!
Turn back!
What is he saying?
Turn around!
March!
Halt!
Dismissed.
They captured Mr Augustin and Mr Stanislas!
What shall we do?
Let's have a quick drink.
Are these the 2 Frenchmen you are looking for?
Yes.
We have them. They are here.
They can kill me. I will not talk.
Same for me. They can kill you, I shall not talk!
I knew you could be relied upon.
We must get out of here.
Impossible!
I have an idea!
Since you played Wagner, how do you say 'Come in' in German?
Herein.
Bring him back to his cell.
What is wrong with him?
What a nice surprise...
This way please.
The Brits are here. We must stall for time.
Herr Conductor, this time I am the one conducting!
And you will be doing the singing!
12 bullets for you, 12 bullets for you.
What a waste for men like you!
Who gave you the dogs?
Who got you the uniforms?
Who are your accomplices?
Enough shaking!
Mr Chief of police...
I am not chief of police, I am major!
I shall not waste time. I shall tell you everything.
Excellent. You are becoming reasonable.
I had an appointment on November 15th.
Sorry.
I had an appointment with Commandant Jean-Pierre, who actually is Sergeant Henri.
His real name being Marechal!
No, no, there's a small mistake, Major Harbach.
It was not a Monday,
It was a Sunday.
It was not November, since it was January!
And Henri was not named Marechal just yet at the time...
But I was born in 1914.
It was the First World War.
For 4 years, 4 years
Frightful 4 years...
Who is Marechal!
I don't know anymore! He interrupts all the time, coughing and spitting, coughing and spitting!
Try to remember...
It happened in Victory Square.
Just opposite the bronze statue of Louis XIV
Is there a Louis XIV satue there?
Impossible.
Why?
Because at the time, the Germans had already removed the statues!
You dare take me for a fool!
I know we are missing 2 English pilots!
How many?
Two!
That's not much...
You know where they are, and I know they are not far!
Long live, Napoleon
I gave the wrong barrels by mistake.
What?
Wrong barrels!
Barrel? What is barrel?
Quick, there are two men downstairs. They will burn!
Take my mask!
Mr Lefort!
Ah, Mr Bouvet!
It's me. Stanislas. Come on, let's go.
French firefighters, put out the fire!
Get into the vehicules and pursue the escapees!
We are too heavy. Get rid of the barrels!
Quick, we are too slow!
Two armored vehicles just arrived.
Please send an observation plane straight away.
Thanks, over
This way!
Found them. Road 328, going South, over.
Understood. Over.
Let's go!
Be careful, for goodness sake!
It's not my fault!
Yes, it's you!
Look! Look!
They will strafe us
No. Reconnaissance plane.
Don't look at them. They are spying on us,
Let's look nonchalant.
Do you like cowboy movies?
The door is closed. There's a padlock!
Open the hangar doors!
Gliders!
I was sure they were still here!
Sadly, no propellers...
That's the problem...
Fugitives took a turn at the Marble Cross.
I did not understand. Please repeat.
I repeat, turn at the Marble Cross. Over.
Understood, thank you.
Come on, push!
I'm pushing, step on the clutch goddammit - Sorry Sister.
It's no use. There's no gas!
There's one litre. That's enough.
That's it. Get out and push!
Where is second gear?
It's in the car.
Where?
Between first and third.
Thanks... Push!
Come on, sister. Push!
I hope it's properly fastened.
What's he saying?
He says to get in.
I cannot...
You are scared!
No, I'm not scared!
This glider is for 2 and there's 3 of us!
Look there!
I'm climbing in!
Me first, me first!
My first time in an airplane!
I'm hanging outside!
They are already over the border.
The wind is bringing them back!
Not this way!
The air currents are pushing us!
Be careful!
Set up the machine gun!
There
Long live France!
If I may, sister!
Thank you lord!
Liz Eddington, pie-eyed.
- Where?
- Over there.
Happy, baby? l'm gonna put a stop to this.
- Paul Eddington can take care of her.
- No, he can't.
He's at sea on gunnery practice.
Please play something else.
- Thank heaven they stopped the music.
- Why did they stop?
- Come on, they've had their show.
- l don't wanna go.
- Come on.
- l don't want to! lt's a stuffy Navy joint.
Let's get outta here.
- We should take her home.
- Mac...
- One last dance.
- We can't let her...
She's with that officer.
What about her husband out there doing his duty?
Eddington knows about Liz. lf he wants to put up with it, that's his business.
- l love you.
- What?
- l just said, ''l love you.''
- Why?
Never mind. lf you've cooled down now, l think we can go. l'm not sure l want to go now.
You've got the duty in the morning, early.
- Lieutenant J G McConnel.
- Yes, ma'am?
You've got to play captain of your ship at 6 a.m.
Liz!
Come on in. lt's great!
Come on! l'm awake, Leary.
Tell the exec to join me in my sea cabin for breakfast.
Leary?
Oh.
- Well, then, bacon and eggs for me.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Eddington!
Paul, wake up. ln case it slipped your mind, it's gunnery stations at 0830.
So why don't you write me up?
Because your record already looks like a bunch of pig tracks.
One more scratch on it and your career in the Navy is ended.
That's how it should be, l should be scrapped. l'm obsolescing like this old straw-bottomed cruiser of ours.
We both know what's eating you, Paul.
You can't wash it out with booze.
- What would you know about it?
- l tried it one time.
You? The Rock of Ages? l don't believe it.
You're forcing me to throw my weight at you. Fish or cut bait.
Get on your feet or take your troubles elsewhere. l got a ship to run. l'll put in for a transfer.
You've had one transfer already, out of naval aviation.
- Might not get another chance.
- l don't give a damn.
Well, that isn't what l wanted to hear you say. l'm sorry, Rock.
OK. lf you can hold a razor, you might shave before you come topside.
Aye, aye, Father Torrey.
You bum!
- Cut that out.
- Take me home!
Come on, l need a bath.
Good morning, sir. lf the captain were aboard, would you dress that way? l suspect not, sir.
Put on your uniform.
You make us look like pirates.
Aye, aye, Mr McConnel.
All right, 1 5-2, 1 5-4...
Double run of 8 for 1 2, your crib.
- Anything interesting?
- l got a run of three.
- The carriers pulled out Friday.
- For where?
South. Lahaina Roads, maybe. l got that Hawaiian Sea Frontier dispatch decoded.
Give it to our captain,
Lieutenant J G McConnel.
- More fun and games?
- No.
Destroyer Ward dropped depth charges on a submarine contact inside the defensive sea area.
Some poor Joe's got it in the wringer.
Attacking one of our own subs...
Commence evasive zigzag pattern,
Commander.
- Set extra lookouts.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Morning, Captain.
- Morning. How are you this fine day?
Splendid, thank you, sir.
What's the alert?
Ward dropped depth charges on what they think is a sub,
1 5 miles away, near the sea buoy.
Another poor whale lost its blubber.
Sir, are we just looking for subs or planes, too?
Anything, son.
There's a formation of planes north of the island, sir.
The pilots are up early for squadron exercises.
Strange place to rendezvous.
Why aren't they over Diamond Head?
There's a formation off Diamond Head, too. l don't like it, Paul.
Sound General Quarters.
- Make it no drill.
- Yes, sir.
This is not a drill.
General Quarters.
All hands man your battle stations.
On deck.
Attention to colours.
Bridge. Aye, aye.
Mr McConnel?
- McConnel.
- We're getting some funny signals. lt sounds like plane-to-plane chatter, in Japanese.
- Japs!
- What?
Japs!
My God, they're Japs! Come on!
Emergency sortie signal from the yard tower.
Engine room? Light off all four boilers.
Make preparations for getting underway.
- Report readiness status in five minutes.
- Cut in all burners.
Disengage checking gear.
Open guarding valves.
Flip the electric rolls.
General Quarters!
Man your battle stations!
- Quoddy.
- Aye, sir.
- Can you take us out?
- You call it, Mr McConnel.
- Wait for the captain.
- Screw the captain.
- Ring up turns for 20 knots.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- 20 knots through the harbour?
- You heard.
Take her away. She's got enough to move now, building fast.
Quoddy, right 1 0 degrees rudder.
Steady up on 1 -2-0.
- lt's Captain Harding, sir, and the exec.
- Slow down!
How can we stop? lt'll take 20 minutes at this speed.
Does anybody here see anything back there?
Let us board! Stop! lf they does, l'll guarantee they'll never see nothin' again!
Let her rip, Mac!
Advise me of any further messages.
How many ships answered the emergency sortie signal?
Destroyer Cassiday's moving, sir.
The Harkness, Ballard, cruisers Greely and Jackson...
The battleships, man!
None, sir.
- Out of nine battleships?
- None, sir.
Lookout reports tin-can breaking out, sir.
Paul, signal all ships coming out to form up with us.
Aye, aye, sir.
- That can't be all.
- That's all Captain Torrey reports, sir.
Three light cruisers, eight destroyers and Captain Torrey's heavy cruiser.
- None is equipped with radar.
- 1 2 bat-blind ships.
Well, gentlemen. Your opinions.
We must position them to repel an invasion.
- You mean wait, Admiral Broderick.
- We have no choice. Wait.
Seek out and destroy, if at all possible.
What can 1 2 ships do against the Jap task force? lt would be a futile gesture. lt could give us time to bring our carriers within range.
What if Torrey can't contact the Japs?
Suppose they slip by him?
He has no radar, one scout plane.
The risk is too great, leaving our shores unprotected.
- l repeat, sir. We must wait.
- Thank you, Admiral Broderick.
Order Captain Torrey to assume command of his task group and seek out and engage the enemy if possible.
- All your personal problems resolved?
- Let's say they're cut down a size.
Dispatch has come in from Fleet Operations, sir.
- Burke?
- From CinCPac.
''Japanese believed retiring for refuelling.
''Proceed to latitude 1 8 north, longitude 1 62 west.
''Seek out and engage the enemy.
Godspeed.''
- Well!
- Well!
Have all ships report useable fuel aboard.
Break radio silence. Ask CinCPac for a tanker rendezvous at first light.
- After you figure our projected position.
- Aye, aye, sir.
We'll play hell getting a tanker out of Pearl. lf we don't, we'll be sucking air instead of oil by midnight tomorrow.
Sir, the starboard lookout has a ship on the bow.
A tanker, he thinks, sir.
She's riding high. She's empty.
She's going home, if a sub doesn't get her.
At this rate, we'll have to head home inside 1 0 hours.
We could reduce speed to save fuel.
Crawl at 1 0 knots?
We'd never find any Japs.
- lf we stopped zigzagging...
- That'd be an invitation to enemy subs.
There may be subs out there, maybe not.
Whether there are or aren't subs out there, if we steer a straight course, we'd add another six hours to our steaming time.
Resume our base course.
- Straighten us out, Commander Burke.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Rock, you just threw the book away.
How long will Torrey keep pushing?
We haven't enough fuel to hold the keel down.
He'll run the rope out and then add some string to it.
- Where'd you know him?
- He instructed at the Academy.
We call him the Rock.
Scared the hell outta you.
He's all Navy and nothin' but Navy.
He never left the campus, like he had nowhere else to go.
Sonar contact, sir, bearing 0-2-0.
Range 2,000 and closing.
Make turns for 20 knots.
Set condition able.
Close all watertight doors.
- Tell Sonar to keep the ranges coming.
- 1 800 and closing.
- Cline? You on the recorder?
- You know it!
Signal flagship we're about to attack sonar contact.
Cassiday reports submarine contact.
- Have all ships resume zigzag.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- 0-1 -5 it is, sir.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
Stern racks. Roll one.
Roll two.
They're on it, sir.
They hit the cruiser!
- Reports from damage control.
- She's dead in the water.
- Midship damage control won't answer.
- Shall l go below, sir?
- Tell me when you locate the damage.
- That arm's busted.
- What's wrong?
- The door's jammed.
Get a message to Pearl: ''Have taken two torpedoes'' - fill in our position -
- ''Will advise on damage.''
- And break radio silence, sir?
Burke, don't you think the Japanese know by now where we are?
Aye, aye, sir.
The door may blow. Stand clear!
Griggs, get those mattresses down.
Stand by to fire another full pattern.
Order the destroyers back to Pearl at best possible speed, zigzagging.
- Cassiday got the sub, sir. Definite kill.
- Hold it!
Have all ships return to Pearl at 20 knots, except the Cassiday.
Have her stand by in case we have to abandon ship.
OK...
- Compliments of Cdr. Eddington.
- Just give me the word.
Cdr. Eddington says this old tub'll float, sir.
- At ease.
- Thank you, sir.
Full report.
We halted the fires up forward where we took the first torpedo.
And we stopped the flow of water at Hatch 26.
Cdr. Eddington said to tell the old man - l'm sorry, sir, the captain - that he'd better start thinking about a tow.
May l also say, sir, that Cdr. Eddington is hell on wheels.
- What are the casualties?
- At least 40 men were trapped.
- 40 men, maybe more.
- Cassiday coming alongside, sir.
Take care of this boy.
Nice work, Harding.
You did a four-o job on that sub.
Thank you, sir. l'm not Commander Harding.
- Where is he?
- Ashore, sir.
- Who's in command?
- l am, sir. Lieutenant J G McConnel.
Did l hear ''Lieutenant Junior Grade''?
William McConnel, class of '38.
- Can you rig for towing?
- Can do, sir.
Can you pass some portable pumps to us?
Can do, sir.
Carry on, mister.
Can do.
Oh, Rock of Ages.
We got ourselves another war.
A gut-bustin', mother-lovin' Navy war. lt does seem to shape up that way,
Commander Eddington.
Captain Torrey, the admiral will see you now.
Thank you.
- Please sit down, Captain.
- Thank you, sir. l wasn't aware you'd been hurt.
A simple fracture, sir. lt won't interfere with my duties.
You have a remarkable record,
Captain Torrey.
- Thank you, sir.
- Save your thanks. l'm relieving you of your command pending a court of inquiry. l don't understand.
You weren't zigzagging when you took the torpedo. l was stretching my fuel, sir. lf you didn't have enough fuel, why didn't you turn back?
My mission was to engage an enemy of greatly superior strength. l could only take that one way: my group was expendable. l doubt a court of inquiry will accept that.
You're caught in the vacuum between a peacetime Navy and a wartime Navy.
Soon they'll make admirals out of captains with guts.
Now, they're reacting to Pearl Harbor and punishment is order of the day.
You don't have to abide by what a court of inquiry decides.
You can ask for a general court martial, get a couple of lawyers and fight it. l wouldn't care to do that, sir.
- Why not?
- Second-generation Navy, Admiral. l see. l don't plan to ask for a court martial either, and l've lost a fleet. l expect we'll both take what they give us and trust it'll be a useful job.
Yes, sir.
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you, sir. lf l haven't got him, maybe he's still alive. lt must be a mistake, he was clever...
Comb, compact...
- The child can't be lost...
- Two rings...purse.
- Maybe the police know where he is.
- Sign here.
He was my only boy, and l love him so much.
- Won't you do something for me?
- This way for identification.
- Go back to the police.
- l want you to help me.
- Lady...
- He was my only boy.
You don't have a boy!
Disposition?
What do you want to do?
- l'll send someone.
- Thank you.
And the man she was brought in with?
Army Air Force claimed the body a couple of days ago.
...a very pretty name.
- Been here long?
- l'm from Hawaii.
- l like Hawaii.
- Me, too.
- Where's my drink?
- l made you a fresh one.
- Thanks.
- Bourbon.
- Sorry, nothin' but beer. Martial law.
- OK, beer.
- How come the Air Corps rates a drink?
- They brought that bottle in.
Running dry, Commander?
Let me sweeten your beer.
Share and share alike, we're all in this war.
Little more? OK... How's that?
Would you like to join us?
Only two chicks but we can share...
Send the police to the Blue Lagoon.
Come.
Sir, l just got word on Commander Eddington.
- What about him?
- He's in the Honolulu brig.
- ln the brig?
- That's the word, sir.
Will you see my clothes are packed and sent over to the bachelors officers' quarters?
Yes, sir. Can l help you with that?
- ls that all, sir?
- l travel light.
Well, Commander Burke...
Oh, sir...
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.
You're released into your captain's custody, sir.
Sergeant.
This is yours, sir. l'll walk you to the Duty Boat. l've been relieved of command.
Bastards!
Sorry about your wife.
You got yourself into a pretty good fix.
A public brawl...
What the hell.
A new AA cruiser going out to join Halsey.
She's a tiger.
A fast ship going in harm's way.
A lousy situation,
Commander Eddington.
Lousy.
Stay still.
Good. Come with me, please, Captain.
Shoot those over to Dr Lyons as soon as they're ready.
- Doctor?
- Yes.
A 3-month-old fracture, some infection.
The X-rays will be along shortly.
Thank you. Sit down, Captain.
That's a real nice sound to wake up to.
- What is Vicki Marlowe's secret?
- Not what it says in here.
Her secret is that she's making half a million bucks a year and she still collects alimony from me, in my present reduced circumstances.
Well, anyway... l have the satisfaction that all her pictures have been stinkers since l stopped writing them.
Rockwell, my boy, l tell you never, l repeat, never marry a movie actress.
- You married three of 'em.
- lt's like eating peanuts.
Once l started, l couldn't stop!
Hey, look at you!
Two hands, congratulations.
- Shall we celebrate?
- How?
There's some action at a place in Moanalua.
No, no parties for me.
Anyway, when do you special intelligence officers do what you're supposed to do?
Seems you sleep all day and go to parties every night.
Us civilians need more rest and recreation than you old salts.
Not that you couldn't use a little. lt's time you crawled down from
Mount Rushmore and looked around.
You'd be surprised at the changes we've made in the last 1 00 years. l tell you, the women are smoking cigarettes, drinking whisky, doing the shimmy-sham-shimmy hot damn, man...
- Very funny.
- Come on, Rock...
No, no thanks.
- OK.
- What?
Maybe you're right. l gotta do something besides sit at a desk and count the ink stains on the blotter.
Who's our host?
Whoever knows the host?
Some pineapple moneybags.
Were you invited?
One sailor looks like another.
Gimme your hat.
Egan Powell! l want you to meet Captain Torrey.
This is Mrs...
- ...Let me see...
- Henderson.
How do you do?
Follow me.
Hello, Paula.
Well... Thank you very much.
Let's go over here. lt's very important to relax, old boy.
- Paul, how are you?
- Hello, Egan.
- lntroduce me.
- Gaby, this is Egan.
- How do you do?
- You don't mind?
Hold that, will you?
- Enjoying the party, Captain Torrey?
- Yes, thank you. Fine party.
- You think so?
- lt's great.
Thank you.
- Funny.
- What's funny?
Not exactly funny, it's just that you're so different from your son.
- My son?
- Ensign Jere Torrey.
At least he claims his father's a captain. l supposed you were it.
That's my son's name. Jeremiah. Jere.
He's been dating my room-mate.
Frankly, it worries me a little.
She's a green kid from Vermont, he's a smooth Harvard type. l think she's about to fall in love with him.
That's what worries me.
- Will it be all right?
- l hope so.
Not much comfort.
- How's the arm?
- l beg your pardon?
- Your arm!
- Oh, it's...fine. l'm Nurse Lt. Haynes. l took the X-rays today.
- l'm sorry!
- Thank you for not recognising me. l made a special effort to not look like a nurse.
Don't worry about your son. l'm sure he's all he should be. l'm flying under false colours,
Miss Haynes. l don't know my son. l've been divorced many years.
He was raised by his mother and her family. l didn't even know he was in the Navy.
Well... !
Much as l'd like to, l won't ask any more questions. l hate to leave but l have to get to the hospital. l don't have to get any place but out.
Share a cab?
Let me drop you. l borrowed a car from my landlord's gardener.
Thank you, Miss Haynes. l'm Maggie... if you'd like to be less formal.
Thank you for that, too.
But don't wait too long.
My unit's due to be shipped out soon.
- Captain.
- Maggie.
- Ensign Torrey?
- No, sir.
Your duty office said Ensign Torrey had the watch aboard this craft.
- Yes, sir.
- Well?
- l'll get him for you, sir.
- Thank you.
Get topside, quick. Brass!
- Did you hear me?
- l'm going.
- l shouldn't have stood your watch!
- Take it easy. l'm Ensign Torrey, sir.
You wanted to see me?
- l'm your father, Jere.
- Yes, sir.
- You look like your mother.
- Yes, sir.
- ls she well?
- Very well, sir.
Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
Do you often stand your watch in your cabin?
Ensign Farris relieved me for a few minutes, sir.
Motor Torpedo Boat duty.
How do you like it? l don't like it, sir.
Why did you choose it? lt's a voluntary duty. l volunteered on advice. This unit's assigned to Admiral Broderick. l was advised that a transfer could be arranged to the admiral's staff.
Who gave you the advice?
Cdr. Neal Owynn, the admiral's public relations officer. l'll be his assistant. l expect you've heard of Neal Owynn.
No.
He's quite a well-known
Congressman, sir.
He resigned from office to join the service.
Your mother's family can usually get what they want.
- You disapprove, sir?
- You trained on these boats.
You'd be a damn sight more useful here than in public relations. l majored in journalism at the university. lf l must do my bit in this trumped-up war, l prefer to do what l'm suited for.
Did l hear you say ''trumped-up war''? lt is Mr Roosevelt's war, isn't it?
You not only look like a Cunliffe, you talk like one. l remember they said the first one was Mr Wilson's war.
- What's your duty, sir?
- Routing convoys. l expect to be in the forward areas, if not actually in combat.
Admiral Broderick is to handle a very important offensive, Skyhook. l wouldn't know about that. l wouldn't expect you would.
Cdr. Owynn gave me the information.
Are you leaving, sir?
Yes. Before l pick you up and throw you to the fish. l was four when you left my mother. l don't even remember you.
And for 1 8 years you haven't bothered to remember me.
Why come here tonight?
Let's just say that l did come and let it go at that.
Goodnight, Ensign.
- How!
- Egan!
Where've you been for the last 1 0 days?
Or should l ask?
You shouldn't, but there was snow in Washington.
Washington! Got the war all worked out? lf you buy me lunch, l'll give you the date of victory.
- l am your man.
- Good.
- Run these courses off on the big chart.
- Aye, aye, sir.
We ensure information given to the press corps is good for the war effort and for the Navy.
And for Broderick.
What's good for him is good for the Navy.
With a little left over for Neal Owynn?
- How's the nurse?
- l'm seeing her tonight.
Why don't you come along?
She's got a room-mate that's not bad.
What do you know about an operation called Skyhook?
- Where did you get that?
- ls it important?
Only 20 people between here and the White House know that name.
There's 21 now, or maybe 22 or 23. l got it indirectly through an ex-Congressman named Owynn.
That's Broderick's drumbeater.
He needs a zipper in his face.
That's top secret. l can't tell you about it.
OK!
You say you got it indirectly, from Owynn?
See that young ensign, lighting his cigarette?
- That's Owynn he's sitting with.
- That's where l got it.
From that ensign?
He's my son.
Well... ! l'd like to meet him, Rock.
No, you wouldn't.
He had his chances to ask me.
Ten days' worth of chances is enough.
- He didn't call me. So l called him.
- How did you have the nerve?
Annalee, past a certain age, men avoid making sudden moves where women are concerned.
The women have to move before it's too late. lt gets late fast in these times. l like this man, l want him to know it. Now.
Suppose they meet?
Jere's very funny about his father.
Oh, let them. lt might be interesting.
- This must be Jere.
- l'll go.
- Hello, Ensign.
- Yes, ma'am, Lieutenant.
- Be a minute or two... She'll be down.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Lieutenant, ma'am... l'd like to invite you to come with us.
Dinner with Commander Neal Owynn.
Thanks, but l'm waiting for a friend.
You're more than welcome to bring her, or him, along.
Well, if my friend arrives in time, we'll see. l'm here to see a nurse.
What are you here for?
To see a nurse.
Seems like we have something in common after all. l'm just a chip off the old block, sir.
- Hello.
- Miss Haynes.
Captain Torrey.
Ensign Annalee Dorne.
- Miss Dorne.
- You've met my friend.
Sir, l've invited Miss Haynes and friend to dine with Cdr. Owynn.
- l hope you'll accept.
- That's very gracious of you.
But we have other plans.
Right, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
- ln that case...
- Good afternoon.
Miss Dorne.
- You run a taut ship.
- He's not a bad-looking kid, is he?
No, he isn't.
Oh...l brought you something.
- What is it?
- Candy.
Candy... ! Thank you.
- Shall we eat at the Chinaman's?
- No.
We're going to eat here, if you don't mind.
- l wouldn't want to...
- Please! l haven't cooked for a man in a long time.
Pour us a drink. lf l can get this oven hot enough, we're gonna have biscuits.
- Want water in yours?
- Yes, but don't drown the whisky. l'm not a lady. l started life as an army brat and never tried to change.
Here's how.
- Did you say Army?
- My father was a one-star general.
Daddy... He was an angel and a devil and l was nuts about him.
So nuts, in fact, that l married his aide.
Would you open this can for me?
You married his aide?
- He wasn't much of a man.
- This cutter's broken.
Not very smart or very brave.
Maybe l expected him to be Daddy and he wasn't.
That's quite a knife you carry.
Can opener, screwdriver, punch, straight blade, even a skinning blade.
That is useful. What do you skin?
Lieutenant nurses who pull my leg.
- Where was l?
- Just married.
Yes. l left him, right here in Honolulu, shacked up with a wahine from Kauai.
That was eight years ago.
He quit the service and married her. l drifted till l had to latch onto something or go down the drain. l went to nursing school and joined the Navy.
- Now l'd like to know more about you.
- Navy.
My father was a chief petty officer and l went to the Academy.
- That the best you can do?
- Unless you want my service record.
There's your son...
Aloha.
- Hi!
- Hello, Jere. Just the two of you?
- Miss Haynes couldn't come.
- l'm sure it's my loss.
- Cdr. Owynn, meet Ensign Dorne.
- What a beautiful place. l'm afraid my friend didn't leave much liquor when he decided to sit the war out on the mainland. l can give you a choice of...Pernod...
...and gin... Oh, yes, there is a little brandy.
- Brandy for me.
- Miss Dorne? l don't know...
Gin, l guess, but not much.
Gin, but not much.
My unit got orders today.
We're being assigned to ComSoPacSub
Area 3, whatever that is.
Commander Third Sub Area,
South West Pacific.
Sounds very impressive.
- Have you been alerted?
- No, just assigned.
Third Area is
Admiral Broderick's command.
- Jere's Admiral?
- The same.
Can't get away from the Torreys, can l?
We can sit down.
- Hey!
- We're alone.
- Where's Commander Owynn?
- lt's OK.
Dinner is ready.
- Aren't we waiting for Cdr. Owynn?
- He was called to Headquarters. l guess it's just the two of us.
- Ever hear the name Cunliffe?
- An expensive New England name.
She was a Cunliffe, Jere's mother. l met her at a Navy ball, 1 91 7.
She was beautiful. l don't know why she married me.
- l was just an ensign.
- l bet you were something as an ensign! l fell over my feet most of the time.
When l came back from the war, l had a son.
And the Cunliffes had great plans for me. l was to resign my commission in the Navy and do something useful, the stock market.
They sat with teacups on their laps and ticker tape coming out of their ears and l said ''No''. lt was quite a scene.
Then Athalie - that was her name, Athalie - said, ''Rockwell, l will not become a camp follower.
''Whenever you're not busy boating with the Navy, feel free to visit us.''
And that's the way it was. l visited. l was assigned to duty in the Philippines and that ended it.
You left out one small detail.
You were terribly in love with her.
You're a good cook, Maggie.
And you look lovely in the candlelight.
- You haven't had much to say.
- l guess l haven't.
- Would you like to dance?
- l don't think so.
Come sit over here.
- Please don't.
- What's the matter?
We'd better go home. l don't like this, any of it.
- Since when?
- Since your commander disappeared. l didn't know you missed him so much. l'm jealous!
You know what l mean. lt makes me feel cheap.
Take it easy!
He won't be back for a long time. l'm sorry, Jere, but l want to go.
- Think l'm an idiot?
- What?
- Nothing's cheaper than a teaser.
- What?
- lsn't that what you've been doing?
- l have not! l thought we... l thought you...
- Wait a minute!
- Let me go! l've spent my life learning about men and ships and how to use them in action. l just don't fit behind a desk, l...
...l'm not cut out for it, l feel dry-docked.
- Oh, well.
- Thanks.
Thanks?
Who else have you said these things to recently? Or ever?
- That'll be Annalee and your son.
- Oh, l'd better...
- Thanks, fellas.
- You're welcome. l think that had to happen.
Goodnight, Rock.
Goodnight, Maggie.
- Any time, Rock. Any time at all.
- Thank you, Maggie.
Yeah, go ahead and l'll be there.
- Sir, Cdr. Powell is waiting for you.
- Thanks.
- Greetings!
- What are you so happy about?
This... Want to close that door? l have a very private little job for you, no one but you.
Three convoys to be routed to this island, Toulebonne.
- Paul Eddington is stationed there.
- lt's Broderick's new base.
Skyhook again, huh?
Here's the shipping list.
- A lot of tonnage.
- Hard to come by.
CinCPac wants it all to arrive on time and intact.
The first convoy is loaded, personnel go on board Thursday, when they shove off is up to you. l think l see it.
See what?
Skyhook.
All right.
Jap supply lines must be spread out pretty thin south of Cape Titan.
So Broderick could hit
Lalatea, Muk or Gavabutu.
From any of those islands, he could launch a strike against...
- ...Levu-Vana.
- Why Levu-Vana? lt has a central plain large enough for B-1 7 airstrips.
Get B-1 7 s in there and we can control
1 ,000 miles in any direction.
Goodnight.
- Maggie!
- Hello, sailor!
Pleasant surprise.
You're not easy to talk to on the phone, so l decided to ambush you.
Come in.
- This is nice.
- Sit down.
- Can l offer you a drink?
- No, nothing. Thanks.
My unit is to report to Ford lsland in the morning at six.
We weren't told any more but it can only mean one thing.
You'll be at sea by noon.
- Did you know l was going?
- l knew there was a convoy pulling out.
Any hint about our destination?
You know l can't say.
You'll be told after you sail.
- ls it a long way?
- Long way.
Then we won't meet again in the foreseeable future, right?
Right.
Do you think we'd better let it go at that?
- Hello?
- Commander Powell.
Just a moment.
For you.
- Commander Powell speaking.
- Egan?
- Can you bunk out tonight?
- l can manage.
Thanks, Egan.
Maggie?
Yes, Rock.
Permission to board, sir?
- State your business.
- Cdr. Eddington. Toulebonne Base.
- l'd like to see Nurse Lt. Maggie Haynes.
- Permission granted.
Ahoy, there! ls this the admiral's harem?
Lieutenant Maggie Haynes!
- l'm here.
- Compliments of Capt. Rockwell Torrey.
Paul Eddington. l'll call you Maggie because that's what the Rock said.
''Make sure Maggie's welcome when she gets to Toulebonne,'' so...
Welcome, Maggie Haynes. lt's beautiful.
There's a bottle of cognac under the bananas. l know how dry these naval transports can get.
Will you excuse me?
Soyez la bienvenue.
This is Annalee Dorne.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You've been here a long time.
- Since January.
Getting this old French base ready to service our ships.
You have a barracks for 50 nurses?
We've been on this tub three weeks.
- Didn't you get the word?
- No.
This convoy sails again tonight,
300 miles to an island named Gavabutu.
- That's where they'll need nurses.
- An offensive? l guess so.
- Are you also going to Gavabutu?
- No!
The Navy can't do without me here, the island might sink!
You don't like what you're doing? lt's like working in a filling station, watching the cars go by.
Goodbye, Maggie Haynes.
When you write to the Rock, tell him l was sober.
He won't believe it, but tell him anyway.
Bye, Commander.
Control...? Station 26. l have him.
PBY approaching from south-west.
- Roger 26. Patrol plane off course.
- Hi.
- Spotter 26.
Formation north-east of your station.
Should be F4Fs.
Check, Control.
Three F4Fs proceeding north-east...
- ...to south-west.
- Roger, 26.
- You read those planes pretty quickly.
- At first l couldn't tell them apart.
How are you?
There's no way to make this easy,
Mrs McConnel. l came to tell you that your husband is missing in action.
You won't get the official telegram for a day or two. l read it in a report this morning and...
Ask Control to relieve you. l'll take you home. l'm all right.
Where did it happen?
His destroyer was working alone in the Gavabutu area.
Reported two aerial torpedo hits, then communications were cut off.
An aerial search the following day failed to produce anything.
- No survivors at all?
- None reported.
Station 26.
- Are you there, 26?
We have a bogey on the screen to the south. Can you see it?
AT-6, about 9,000 feet.
- Are you there, 26?
- AT-6, Control.
Those damn training planes wander around like bats.
OK, 26. Over and out.
Thanks.
Captain, was Mac wasted?
Wasted? What do you mean? l want to read you part of a letter from Mac.
''We are getting hell from Jap planes that are based right on Gavabutu.
''l don't know much about amphibious operations,
''but if Admiral Broderick knows anything, l'll eat my hat.
''This has been a mess since it began...'' l'm surprised that Mac would put that in a letter.
He wouldn't have, unless he were discouraged and angry.
Beverly, don't show that letter to anyone. l don't intend to... ls it true? lf it is, if things are that bad, l'm sure there'll be some changes.
Aren't they that bad, Captain?
Yes, l believe they are.
Station 26.
- 26, Control.
- Check plane to north-east.
Check, Control.
Small training plane moving north-east to south-west...
- Message from CinCPac.
- What is it?
You're requested to appear at 1 0 Makalapa for dinner.
Early, sir. 1 800.
- You'll just have time to change.
- OK, Simpson.
Take me home.
Gentlemen, we'll get to the business of the evening. l could have saved time and liquor by doing this in my office, but it needs a little ceremony.
Powell, you got that dispatch?
From Chief of Naval Personnel to Capt. Rockwell Torrey.
You are advised that the President has approved your advancement to temporary grade of Rear Admiral, lower half, date 1 August 1 942. ln regards to promotion, physical examination...
...acceptance of appointment, and so forth.
This came about, Admiral Torrey, because that civilian next to you wormed his way into my staff and had the audacity to suggest the Navy was wrong in judging you.
Well, we all know the Navy's never wrong, but...
...in this case, it was a little weak on being right.
- So, congratulations, Admiral Torrey.
- Thank you, sir.
- Powell, you can do the honours.
- Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, to Admiral Rockwell Torrey.
- May success follow your flag.
- Hear, hear! l do thank you and l'm grateful.
With your permission, sir.
To our country, our Navy, and all the best things they stand for.
Hear, hear!
Admiral Torrey, when the congratulations peter out, please join Cdr. Powell and me in my study.
- Gentlemen, l'll see y'all later.
- Goodnight.
Congratulations, Rock...
We gave him the molasses, now let's feed him the sulphur.
Admiral...
...know what that is?
Yes, from the shape of those islands.
This is Gavabutu, Levu-Vana,
Toko-Rota and Pala Passage. lt's Skyhook.
Powell says you guessed the strategy months ago.
- A wild guess, sir.
- Wild, but accurate.
- What's your opinion of it?
- ln theory, good. ln fact?
Delay has cost you the surprise element.
How far has Broderick advanced on Gavabutu?
He's bottled up behind these mountains.
Hasn't advanced an inch in four weeks.
He'd better take that whole island or you can forget Skyhook.
He's got to attack Levu-Vana before the Japs are ready.
You just named your own poison.
You're going to mop up Gavabutu and mount the invasion of Levu-Vana.
How about Admiral Broderick, sir?
Some smart man once said that on the most exalted throne we are seated on nothing but our own arse.
With Broderick, l'm on mine. l can't fire him, scramble his whole command overnight.
He's bad for our allies, a comfort to the enemy.
All l can do is put you in tactical command of the operation.
Abe Lincoln was once in the same spot with George B McClellan.
McClellan was a great organiser but he couldn't decide when to fight. lndecision is a virus that can run through an army and destroy its will to win, or even to survive.
Lincoln called in a Yankee named Grant who didn't care about organisation but wasn't afflicted with the virus.
He pointed his battalions in the right direction and shoved off.
Torrey, you're going to be my Grant.
How you deal with Broderick is your business. Just get the job done.
How far can l go with Admiral Broderick?
You can't kill him.
- May l name my own chief of staff?
- Who?
- Eddington, my old exec.
- l'll attend to it.
Take Powell with you, he's familiar with Broderick and l want rid of him.
- Reserve officers give me hay fever.
- Thank you.
Torrey, these were my stars before l picked up this heavy hardware. l like to think they brought me luck.
Wear 'em on your collar. lf there's any luck in 'em, you're gonna need it.
Thank you, sir.
Saree?
Saree?
Don't you know better than to disturb a man at work? l wouldn't interfere but you have an order to get back to HQ.
- For what?
- Don't know, sir.
No, l go, baby...
Yes, l come back, baby.
Don't you worry about that. l'm not going to take it, not for one by God minute. l've sweated marbles over this ill-advised, premature operation. l can't work miracles with the material they've given me. l'm gonna lay it on the line with CinCPac.
- Don't do anything hasty, Admiral.
- Hasty?
Torrey'll be on Gavabutu in three days.
Do you want me to be a doormat, with ''Welcome'' written on my backside?
Well, of course, you know best, but...
...if Torrey flops, you can blame
CinCPac for putting him in there.
And if we get some action out of the Gavabutu personnel that they haven't produced for you, you're still the area commander.
You'll get the credit.
Area commander or not, l won't know what he's doing till he's done it. l'll be sitting here on Toulebonne and every journalist in the islands will know.
That's simple. You need sort of a... a representative in Torrey's camp who can keep you informed about what's happening.
- Yes, that might help.
- Sir, Commander Eddington has arrived.
- You're Eddington?
- Yes, sir.
- ln charge of piers and warehouses?
- That's right, sir. l sent for you two hours ago.
What kept you? l was recruiting native labour for piers and warehouses, sir.
That doesn't mean you have to look like a native, does it? l didn't expect to be called to see the admiral, sir.
Didn't you see the directive that all personnel be clean-shaven? l must have missed it, sir.
Did the admiral want to see me about my beard?
Eddington, you're being transferred to Gavabutu, with the rank of captain.
Are you sure you have the right Eddington?
You're being assigned to Admiral
Rockwell Torrey as chief of staff.
That's all.
Admiral Torrey?
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!
Well, if that's a sample of Torrey's staff... !
You suggested l needed a representative on Gavabutu.
OK, you're it.
You'll be my liaison officer, we'll call it. l don't have any combat training, l don't think...
Don't crawfish, it was your idea.
Some forward area duty might be just the thing.
Think what a combat ribbon or a Purple Heart would mean to you.
Worth half a million votes when you run for office.
Let me be the first to welcome you to this land of milk and honey.
- Colonel Gregory, Paramarines.
- Pleasure, sir.
Egan Powell, lntelligence.
My aide, Mr Armstrong.
Colonel, your men in shape for a parachute drop?
Maybe a little rusty, sir, but eager as hell.
Attention!
At ease.
Tuthill, sir, Operations.
- Jefferson, Logistics.
- Lantz, Communications.
Carry on, men.
- Gottlieb, sir, Weather.
- Mr Gottlieb. l'm Clayton Canfil, l run the coast-watching system.
- He owned a plantation before the war.
- You're an Australian?
- That l am, sir.
- Happy to have you with us.
- Well, Lieutenant, how are you?
- Very well, thank you, sir.
Commander Neal Owynn, sir.
- What is your function?
- Personal liaison for Admiral Broderick.
The admiral felt close rapport should be kept with the forward areas.
He wants to give you all his support.
While on my staff, you'll communicate with Toulebonne through me.
- l repeat, through me. Question?
- No, sir.
Egan, break out that chart we've been working on.
There'll be a slight delay.
This way, please.
We'll call this Operation Apple Pie.
Not because it's going to be easy, but...
...because we're going to slice this island into three big pieces.
Where in this area could you parachute your raiders without getting tangled up in jungle?
- Right here, this meadow's big enough.
- Good.
- A low-level jump could be done.
- You'll land, dig in and wait.
- The Japs'll swarm in.
- That's the idea.
They'll have to weaken their defences to get at Gregory.
- Mr Canfil, you know these mountains?
- Yes, l do.
Could a battalion cross those peaks at night? lf they didn't have to lug cannons with them.
There's a narrow pass there at about 6,000 feet.
- l'd have to lead them through.
- You got yourself a job.
Paul, we'll mount a landing force, circle around and hit this beach.
At the same time, we'll send a third group through the foothills.
Three slices, all converging on Colonel Gregory's position.
When we make contact, we'll drive full force for the Jap airstrip and cut the supply line from Voyon Bay.
After that, we mop up Jap positions and Gavabutu is secured.
- Mr Gottlieb? Weather.
- Shaky. The rains are about to start.
- When?
- A week, maybe.
Then Gregory'll jump on Sunday.
Calculate your timetable accordingly.
Aye, aye, sir.
All right, sir. l want all facts and figures by 0700 tomorrow.
- Right, sir.
- Right.
One thing... Admiral Broderick only allowed us 1 0 planes...
Just a minute.
Cdr. Owynn, Lt. Torrey... That's all.
OK, Greg. l can only put 60% of my men in the air unless we get five more transports.
Aren't there any more R4Ds in Toulebonne?
- They're kept in reserve.
- For what? lt's how Admiral Broderick organised it.
- What if an R4D conks out?
- Toulebonne sends a spare till it's fixed.
- Five of them just conked out.
- Let's relay the news to Broderick.
- Mr Canfil, you've fallen in with thieves.
- l think so, too, l'm happy to say.
- Thanks for getting me out of purgatory.
- Forget it.
Now...
- Where's the hospital?
- l'll take you to her.
- Miss Dorne.
- Capt. Eddington!
- Where can we find Miss Haynes?
- She's in there.
- Thank you, Miss Dorne.
- Nurse!
Get out of my light.
Take him to Hut 3. ln the morning l might've looked better.
You look fine, Maggie, just fine.
- How do admirals feel about nurses?
- The same way captains did.
- Will there be time for us, out here?
- We'll make time.
Canfil's battalion is starting down the far side of the mountain.
Tell the amphibious group they can start moving in for landing.
Colonel...
You got room in your plane for me?
Sure, sir, if you wanna take the risk.
- Sir.
- Commander.
- No Admiral Torrey?
- He's with the Paramarines.
That's very colourful. Gentlemen, there's a story for your papers.
Let's go to HQ and see if our operation is doing what we intended.
Stand up.
Hook up.
Check your equipment.
Stand in the door.
- Good luck, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir!
Let's go, men!
Contact our fighter protection. l want two planes to cover us.
The rest can go home.
- May l ask what you're planning?
- Let's say a sightseeing trip.
You got a pencil?
Thank you.
Now, we have named this operation Apple Pie. lt's intended to cut the island into three slices, across the mountains, from the beachhead and through the foothills, converging on a position we have secured with our Paramarines.
Admiral, have these correspondents been instructed in security?
They'll be instructed, Captain.
You may return to your duties.
Aye, aye, sir. l'm sure you boys realise that you're not to file any stories until Cdr. Owynn gives you the word.
Now, back to Operation Apple Pie.
Carry on.
Lieutenant, do you have any idea how Broderick knows these details? l'm afraid not, sir.
You wouldn't know about Owynn sending special dispatches to Toulebonne? l wouldn't, sir. l don't know about you and your father but let me tell you this: bums like your friend Owynn are with us always, like bad weather.
But sailors like your old man only happen once in a while. l'm afraid l cannot accept your evaluation of Cdr. Owynn. l cannot accept you as Rock Torrey's son.
- l think somebody got in ahead of him.
- Now, wait a minute, Eddington!
Captain Eddington.
Yes? lt's all right, Captain.
On your feet.
- Lieutenant! You can head for the barn.
- OK, sir!
Change of orders from the old man himself, by God.
We'll romp this circus straight on.
Last man to Voyon Bay's a bloody 'roo!
Sorry, chums, kangaroo to you.
Baker D, don't move in on road Z-2, it's landmined. lt's moving so fast we can't keep up.
The admiral wants you to meet our war correspondents. l can't tell 'em anything.
Where's the admiral?
- He's with them.
- Say l'll join him as soon as l can.
Roger, Baker D. Keep pushing. Out.
We've had some luck.
Canfil should join Gregory soon.
Joined already.
Cutting across to meet the amphibs.
- Let me see those dispatches.
- Attention!
Carry on, gentlemen.
We were getting anxious about you.
Very courageous, going out on the firing line.
But risky leaving command centre at zero hour.
- l think it served its purpose.
- l'm sure it did.
- Shall we give the boys a rundown?
- Might be better in private, sir.
The press is not against us.
Give them a break.
- lf you insist.
- Fire away, boys.
Admiral Torrey, is the operation going according to schedule?
- Not exactly.
- We can be more specific than that.
After all, an offensive doesn't travel like an express train.
Fact is, it's going to be a long, hard job kicking the enemy off Gavabutu.
No reason why we shouldn't admit it.
We can project schedules, but they're hard to keep.
- Right, Admiral?
- Right, sir.
Except we're not behind schedule, we're ahead of it.
Our troops should be taking the Jap airstrip and our amphibs closing on Voyon Bay.
- But the enemy opposition...
- There is none.
The Japs moved out last night.
- The island's ours?
- Yes.
- When did you learn this?
- Why did they pull out?
- l think that about covers it for now.
- That it does.
Wait, we want to know something about this...
Admiral, would you check these dispatches and advise me on how we should mop this up?
Yes, certainly.
Use the staff room to write your stories. l will see to it that your stories get out, if Cdr. Owynn doesn't mind.
- That old man of yours crossed us.
- Yes, didn't he!
Gentlemen...
We must have a conference with the admiral before he goes tomorrow.
- The admiral's leaving?
- He feels everything is shipshape.
Gottlieb, Tuthill.
Heads.
Goodbye, Commander. Enjoy it.
What did he mean by that?
- Aren't you going with Broderick?
- No.
- l think you are.
- Now, wait a...
You'd better be on that plane unless you want to die on Gavabutu.
- You can't do this...
- l am doing it.
We've got a job here and no one is going to screw it up.
Understand?
And take this punk with you. l'll have him court-martialled.
You saw it, l didn't hit him back.
- l didn't see anything.
- What do you mean you didn't see?
As far as l'm concerned, a coconut hit you on the mouth.
You'd better figure out an excuse to get us on that plane.
Want a transfer back to PT boats?
One word from me to Broderick and you're on your way.
Say the word.
Well, here we are, gentlemen.
The marines are soaking their feet in Voyon Bay.
- The airstrip?
- Planes are landing on it.
- This operation's picked clean.
- We're already picking another one.
This one's tougher.
You're just in time to help.
- Right here.
- Levu-Vana.
We need details of the Jap build-up.
Air photos don't show much.
We thought your coastwatchers could give us a hand.
Why not have a submarine take me there? l know that island.
Just give me a week to creep up on them and l'll blueprint the Jap positions.
- We wouldn't want to lose you.
- l don't plan to get lost.
Watch for my signal nightly between midnight and 3 a.m.
OK. Good luck.
- Special reason for delivering mail?
- Sort of.
- OK. Don't let it keep you too long.
- Thanks.
Hello, marine.
- Been having any difficulty breathing?
- No.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Jere! We heard you'd been transferred back to the boats.
- Congratulations or commiserations?
- Congratulations.
- Looking for the mail room?
- ln a roundabout way.
- l'll show you where it is.
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you again, ma'am.
- Same to you.
Come on, get over here.
Sir, there's no telling when we might ship together again, and me and the boys took a vote.
We voted you best officer to be marooned on a desert island with.
- Thanks, Boats.
- We mean it, sir, all kiddin' aside.
Goodbye, Culpepper... Goodbye, Al.
Mac! Mac!
- They didn't tell me you were hurt.
- lt wasn't worth it.
- How'd you get here?
- They flew me from Pearl. l've been waiting 1 0 days for that slow boat of yours to come in!
God, you feel good to me. l never gave you up, Mac, not for one minute.
Here. A present for you from Bureau of Personnel.
Lieutenant Commander McConnel.
That's wonderful!
Wait, have you already been given an assignment...?
- Flag Secretary, Third Area.
- Back in that Gavabutu hellhole.
With Rock Torrey, not Broderick.
Torrey asked for me, Bev.
- Not right away! That wouldn't be fair.
- Not right away.
We've got 30 days survivors' leave.
- Any ideas what to do with them?
- Plenty of ideas! l thought you wouldn't see Eddington now you're back with Jere. lt's a picnic, there's a bunch going.
- But you'll be with Eddington?
- Probably.
- You're not wearing Jere's ring.
- lt's too big. l might lose it.
- l see.
- l'll tell Eddington l'm engaged to Jere.
OK.
Maggie, l just wanna have a little fun.
Don't play games with Eddington.
Why don't you like him?
He's Torrey's best friend. lnstinct. He's got something bottled up behind that dashing charm.
- What?
- l don't know.
But remember the smiling young lady from Niger.
- Who?
- ''The smiling young lady from Niger
''She rode on the back of a tiger
''And after the ride
She wound up inside
''With her smile on the face of the tiger.''
Maggie! l can take care of myself.
- Annie, are you ready?
- Just a sec!
- Who's the chaperone on this junket?
- l am.
- Oh, brother!
- l'll bring 'em back alive.
- Come on, they're at the pier!
- Bye, Maggie.
Have a good time.
Dorne!
Shouldn't we go back?
You'll be in trouble with your chaperone.
With Sabrina? That's funny.
You're not afraid, huh?
Out here all alone with me.
Scared to death.
- The water looks delicious.
- The tide's out. l'd love to go in for a dip.
- Go ahead.
- What would you think of me? l'm an officer and a gentleman. l wouldn't think.
Would you turn your back until l get in?
This is Tokyo Rose.
We dedicate the next record to all those poor marines on Gavabutu.
You're going to be sacrificed because Admiral Torrey doesn't have enough ships or planes to protect you.
But Torrey doesn't care whether you live...
- Why can't they jam that?
- They don't want to.
The boys like the music.
She doesn't scare anybody.
Though she's pretty close to being right sometimes.
- Like now?
- l said pretty close.
We're OK with what we have.
This is a backdoor operation.
The front's with General MacArthur.
That's where the Jap Navy is occupied, not with us.
At least, that's the theory we have to go on.
- No sugar!
- l'm sorry.
- Have you seen Jere?
- No. l thought maybe you had.
His boat's been running the mail.
He and Annalee are on again.
He asked her to marry him after the war.
- A Cunliffe marry a commoner?
- His name isn't Cunliffe. lt's Torrey.
- Yeah.
- lt is, Rock.
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
He's changed. He isn't just a smart college kid any longer.
Something's happened to him out here.
Well...l can't start acting like a father now. l threw that chance away 1 8 years ago when l gave Jere up to his mother. l wouldn't know how to talk to him or...
Paul!
Will you bring my clothes down?
- Put them down and turn your back.
- Not this time, baby.
- Paul, please!
- No, you'll have to come and get 'em.
OK, but you're gonna be surprised.
See? l might as well be in a Mother Hubbard.
- You're beautiful.
- My clothes, please.
Paul, l'm not gonna let you kiss me. l'm engaged. There's this boy...
Give me my clothes, please.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No! Let me go!
Let me go, Paul!
- Take her away.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take in your lines. Get underway.
Quarterdeck to signal bridge.
Admiral's party approaching.
Good old Swayback.
- She looks like a real lady.
- She is a real lady. lt's a nice sentimental gesture,
CinCPac sending your old cruiser.
- A battleship might be more comforting.
- l'm glad to see her.
You don't understand the love affairs between ships and sailors.
What happened to your face?
Bucking for a Purple Heart?
Just a friendly wound.
On deck. lntention to board.
Bosun's mate, man the side.
- Congratulations on your command.
- Welcome home.
- They did a good job.
- She's in fine shape.
- Hello.
- Good to see you.
- Congratulations.
- Tuthill, my Operations Officer.
Shall we adjourn to the ward-room?
Attention, gentlemen!
At ease. Sit down, gentlemen.
We'll dispense with all formalities.
- This is my flagship in the operation.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, l'll turn you over to Captain Eddington.
He'll lay out the plan of operation for you.
This is what it boils down to.
The Japs have Levu-Vana.
We want it. They know it.
We're going to take it, and they'll do their worst to keep us from taking it.
We can't expect any outside help.
We're it.
Mr Canfil. Excuse us, gentlemen.
- l hope you don't mind my interrupting.
- Sit down, we were worried about you. l had trouble getting back to the sub.
Nips are as thick as treacle pudding on that island.
Here it is, Admiral.
You're not going to like it.
They're preparing quite a welcome on Levu-Vana.
They're stringing barbed wire on the beaches and pouring concrete for pillboxes.
The airstrip's almost done.
They're building revetments for 200 planes.
Tanks bivouacked here and troops.
They're bringing in hundreds every night.
- About 5,000 landed while l was there.
- At that rate, we only have three weeks.
- That might not be the worst of it. l was scrounging around a Nip camp and listened in on a sake party.
From what l could catch from their gibberish, there's a gathering of ships at their Cape Titan base.
- That could mean a task force.
- lt could.
- You could get a look at Titan.
- Recon planes wouldn't make it back.
Could Halsey's carriers do a reconnaissance job for us?
Not soon. They're hitting the Solomons for General MacArthur.
Best send a sub for some offshore observation.
That's no good. lt'd take a sub 1 0 days to get there. lf they're laying in a fleet, we've got to know now.
They could be planning to hit us here before we kick off.
Can't you get long-range recon planes?
Captain, we're on Poverty Row.
Everything's going to MacArthur.
We get leftovers, not long-range recon planes.
- We've got to get one, somehow.
- We can try.
Get a message off to Pearl.
Make it strong. lmperative we get at least one long-range plane, and get it now.
Wet it with tears, bleed on it, Egan.
- Darling, is that you?
- Hi, honey.
Hey, where have you been?
- Mmm! You feel good!
- l said, ''Where have you been?''
- l dropped over to Treasure lsland.
- For what?
- Just to visit with the Navy.
- l bet that was fun.
- Hey! This looks nice.
- Like?
Put it on, l'll take a shower and we'll go out.
- Mac, is anything wrong?
- No, why?
You've got that kind of brainwashed look.
You've got bad news, Mac.
Tell me now. lf you tell me over dinner, l'll cry in my soup.
Yes, l have orders.
- When?
- They say proceed immediately.
Why? We haven't even used up half of your leave yet.
They don't tell you why.
Something's going to happen on Gavabutu soon.
Oh, hell! l'm gonna cry anyway!
Better?
- l might not get you back this time.
- Oh, honey...
Mac...
Leave me with a baby this time.
Please, Mac!
- 'Night, Maggie.
- Goodnight, girls.
See you tomorrow.
- Pat, get a doctor. Quick!
- What is it?
A doctor. Hurry!
Annalee...
CinCPac sends regrets.
They can't spare one long-range plane.
Do we commence Skyhook anyway?
We've got to know what the Japs are doing on Titan.
Why not send a one-way plane to radio the information back?
- And the pilot?
- He can ditch, a sub can pick him up...
Torrey, here... Maggie!
What? l'll be right over.
Egan, get me a jeep with a driver.
- What's wrong, Rock?
- A little nurse, friend of Maggie's...
- ...she's committed suicide.
- What?
She was engaged to my son.
- When's that staff conference?
We'll decide what to do then.
He raped her, Rock.
When she was afraid she might be pregnant, she went to him and...
He didn't believe her.
Here, read this.
You said she left Jere's ring with the envelope.
Shall l tell Jere about...?
No, l'll take him the ring. l won't see you again for a while. lt's...
- lt's starting?
- Very soon.
Captain Eddington.
- Trot me out a PBJ.
- Sir?
- Now.
- Yes, sir.
- Dig me out a flying suit.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Thanks.
What are you looking at?
Get back to your radio set.
Thanks. Carry on.
Sir, how shall l log this flight?
Joyride for the Chief of Staff.
The ejector mechanism is jammed.
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
- This is our skipper, Lt. Mason.
- How do you do?
- Mind if l borrow my son a moment?
- Of course not, sir. l want you to get a hold of yourself.
- That young nurse, Ensign Dorne...
- Yes?
She's dead.
Overdose of sleeping pills.
But why? Why?
Whatever the reason, she was thinking of you.
She left this ring for you. l'm very sorry about that girl, Jere.
Thank you for coming all the way here. lt's the least l can do for... one of my officers.
You know, this may not be the right time, but...
...somehow, it seems that between...
There ought to be some... l know what you mean, sir. l wouldn't know how to say it myself, but l know what you mean.
- Goodbye, Jere.
- Goodbye.
The isallobaric gradient is changing rapidly.
The pressure is described by this isobaric curve, which is forcing this low trough off to the east.
For the benefit of an ignorant planter, what does that mean?
Our crummy weather's blowing out.
We're due for five days of sunshine.
Good-oh!
- Where's Eddington?
- He hasn't come in yet.
- Find him.
- Something wrong?
- Just find him.
- Right away.
- Hello, Mac. When did you get in?
- About an hour ago.
- Welcome.
- Glad to see you.
Thank you. Where are we?
Rover, this is John Paul.
Do you read me? Come in, Rover.
Rover, this is John Paul.
Acknowledge, over.
You gave him a plane without checking with Operations?
Sir, Capt. Eddington is Chief of Staff.
He is Operations.
- Are you in contact?
- Been trying to raise him for hours. lt's for you, Admiral.
Torrey speaking. l'll be right over.
Mac.
Rover, this is John Paul.
Are you on this frequency?
Rover, this is John Paul. Come in.
OK, John Paul. This is Rover.
Do you read me? Over. l'm answering you, John Paul.
Do you read me?
Rover, this is John Paul.
Keep sending, l'm trying to pick you up.
Acknowledge, over.
We've got him but he must be far away.
Transmission's weak.
Rover, this is John Paul.
How do you hear me?
- What's your last bearing?
- 3-3-0, sir.
Plot that, will you, Mac?
This is John Paul. We've lost you.
Keep sending, over.
John Paul, this is Rover.
Do you have me now?
Repeat. Do you have me now? l can't keep him.
He's getting farther away.
He must be just south west of Cape Titan.
Rover, change to secondary frequency and l'll try to pick you up.
Rover to John Paul.
Have you got me now?
- Acknowledge.
- Roger, we're reading you, over. l'm flying at 1 0,000 feet. Coming up to Cape Titan from the south-west.
Do you read me?
Rover, this is John Paul.
We've got you, clear. l can't see anything except a couple of sampans and some gooney birds.
We'll be over Cape Titan in 40 minutes and...
Hold it, John Paul, hold it! l've got something down here. l'm dropping down to take a closer look.
Stay with me.
John Paul, this is Rover. lt's a fleet, do you hear me?
Warships moving to the south, away from Cape Titan. l count 1 6, no, 1 7 ships, do you hear me? l repeat, 1 7 ships.
Confirm, over.
This is John Paul.
Roger, 1 7 ships. Over. l seem to have some company.
Zeros from Titan, l guess. l'm going down to take a closer look at these ships. Stay with me.
Looks like a screen of 1 2 destroyers.
Repeat, 1 2 destroyers.
Four cruisers...
Can't tell if they're light or heavy.
The Zeros want to play now.
Here.
Hello, Rover, this is John Paul.
Get back into those clouds and stay there.
That PBJ is no match for Zeros.
Stay under cover.
Thanks, Rock. But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy.
This is the biggest boy l've ever seen. lt looks like a floating island. lt's four city blocks long and it's got...
1 2 big guns.
They look like 1 8-inchers.
What was that oversized tub the Japs built a while ago?
The Yamato?
- This could be it!
- The Yamato, 80,000 tonnes.
- Do you hear me? Over.
- We read you, Rover. lf this baby comes your way, look out!
Excuse me, John Paul, l'm gonna be a trifle busy.
Rover!
Come in, Rover.
Paul!
The Yamato, four cruisers and 1 2 tin-cans.
- A lot of firepower.
- We can't be sure it's aimed at us.
They could be escorting the Yamato to another base, Truk or Pelaki-Shima.
They could be, but they're not.
That task force is aimed for Levu-Vana.
That's right, Egan. lt ties up with their maximum effort to defend that island.
Finish the airfield, put bombers on it and they'll control the whole area.
Gavabutu will become untenable, eventually we'll have to move out of Toulebonne.
Skyhook in reverse.
That task force is headed this way.
Mac, Gottlieb gave us five days of good weather?
Yes, sir.
What do you estimate the steaming time from Titan to Levu-Vana?
They can't go very fast.
They have to go through the straits.
Better part of four days.
With a little push, we can launch our amphib assault in 48 hours. lf we're covering the landing, who takes care of the Jap fleet?
Our ships'll have to do double duty.
Establish the beachhead, then put back to sea and meet the new threat.
- You think we have a chance to stop it?
- We can try.
Tuthill, you're Chief of Staff.
Sir, how shall l list
Captain Eddington's flight?
- l have to account for the plane.
- An authorised mission.
Will you make a recommendation for Capt. Eddington?
What he did deserves a medal of honour.
Maybe, but Paul wasn't hunting medals.
No, no recommendation.
- Anything new on the Jap fleet?
- Nothing, a blank.
- Maybe they're not headed this way.
- Let's keep Reconnaissance busy.
They're not going round the islands.
They're headed for Pala Passage.
- They'll run it at night.
- ls that possible with a fleet of that size?
The Japanese Navy has a bad habit of doing the impossible.
- How wide is the narrowest part?
- 20 miles.
- 1 0 miles show a deep channel.
- l want those 1 0 miles mined.
Mines won't stop the Yamato.
She's armour-plated.
We might nail some of the escort vessels.
And Tut, send the PT boats with the mine-layer.
They're manoeuvrable in the shoals.
They can attack while the Japs are tangled in the mines.
Rock... ln the morning...
What's it like...?
...a surface battle?
Like any other battle, l guess.
Maybe a little noisier. l'm so scared my bones are clicking, like dice on a Reno crap table. l should be back in Hollywood, sitting in front of a typewriter, making all this up for a movie.
Not living it.
All battles are fought by scared men who'd rather be someplace else.
Does that include admirals?
Yes.
Admiral, another 30 minutes and they tangle with the minefield.
Jere.
Loosen up!
Skipper, if l let you down, will you please shoot me?
Sure!
Doin' real good out there on the minefield.
Here we go!
Skipper!
Take over the helm! Go on!
Stand by to torpedo!
Roll one!
Roll two!
We got 'em! We got 'em again!
Plot... Roger, give it to me.
First reports, Admiral.
Two destroyers hit by mines...
One destroyer torpedoed by boats.
What? Repeat.
- One cruiser dead in the water!
- That's cutting 'em down to size!
- Casualty report?
- Anything on casualties?
Not yet, sir.
Casualty report on the PT boats, Rock.
Signal all destroyers,
- ''Lay smokescreen and attack.''
- This is Plot...
Go, babies, go!
Stand by to commence firing.
All guns. Three rounds rapid-fire salvo...
Now!
Fire!
The Yamato came through.
Signal all ships to make flank speed.
Steer evasive course as planned.
You're wanted in Plot.
She's getting outta range!
Signal a 50-degree turn to starboard.
50-degree turn to port.
All guns to fire at the turn.
Bridge! Bridge!
Bridge... The captain's dead.
They're all dead.
- What do l do, sir?
- Stand by. l'm taking over the bridge.
- Mac!
- l'm with you, sir!
Sir... !
Get up, sir... ! The ship is breaking up!
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
Nurse...
Nurse...
Maggie, he spoke!
He said ''Nurse''!
Rock?
- Can you hear me?
- Maggie.
- Where...?
- A hospital ship bound for Pearl Harbor.
- We arrive there in the morning.
- What happened?
Better let me do the talking.
You've been asleep almost three weeks.
You were badly wounded.
Shell fragments.
But you're going to be all right.
What's that tent for?
That's the worst of it, Rock.
You've lost your left leg.
Egan?
Egan was killed.
- Tuthill?
- All of them. Except Mac McConnel.
He saved your life. Got you on a life-raft before the ship went down.
He's here. You can see him tomorrow.
- l've got to know...
- Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
- Your hands.
- Burns, sir, but they'll be OK.
Thanks for looking after me, Mac.
Some of the crew looked after both of us until a tin-can picked us up.
- Gregory...beachhead...wiped out?
- No, sir.
They had the Japs boxed up at the north of the island.
The Yamato turned and fled back up the passage.
Why? We were licked, weren't we?
- Good morning, sir.
- Stand easy.
- You're a hard man to kill, Admiral.
- Seems so, sir. l managed to get my command shot to hell with no trouble.
Feel you betrayed them by staying alive?
Something like that.
Seven ships sacrificed. lt'll make a fancy court martial.
- He's still doped up?
- A little, sir.
Let me straighten you out, Admiral.
The battle in Pala Passage was a decisive victory.
Skyhook's on its way and the Japs can't stop it. l'm having you flown to the States, but not for court martial.
They'll stick a peg leg on you and ship you back.
You'll stump to Tokyo with the rest of us.
You'll do it from the deck of a ship in command of a task force.
Clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Then go back to sleep.
Aye, aye, sir.
You've got your orders. Go to sleep.
Maggie? l'll be here, Rock.
Lt. Col. Frederick, good morning, sir.
We're a bit late, sir.
Could you hurry, please, sir?
The Allies were in trouble...
... and so was I, that summer of 1942, when I arrived in England...
... on what I was sure was a fool's errand.
I'd come from Washington to explain the US Army's strong opposition...
... to one of Lord Mountbatten's favorite projects.
I'd written the army's critical report in what I thought was plain English.
I was puzzled and annoyed at being sent 4,000 miles to say it all over again...
... particularly to Lord Mountbatten himself.
You've never held a field command, have you?
- No, sir.
- No combat experience?
No, sir.
By virtue of what special knowledge...
...do you so dogmatically damn our plan of action?
You propose, in a period of four months...
...to recruit a unit, half-Canadian, half-American...
...and drop them in Norway in the middle of winter.
You have a new snow machine.
What kind of officers and men will you recruit?
How will they be trained, organized and equipped?
Your plan doesn't say.
The most important thing is, once you get them there...
...how are you going to get them out?
There's been no provision made for that.
We're not unaware of the problems, Colonel.
Nevertheless, we're going ahead with the project.
If you've already made your decision, what am I doing here?
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Let's go, Bob.
Gentlemen, I think we've found our commanding officer.
If he'll take it.
He's more likely to throw it right back in your face.
Care to bet?
So you left Washington for this, Colonel?
Don't move, Colonel.
Why in the hell did you have to shoot him?
You see, sir, we didn't feel like waiting around till it starved to death.
Now, look, Captain.
That kind of smart-ass talk don't go good with me at all.
You just be careful of that kind of talk.
Col. Frederick. Maj. Cliff Bricker, sir.
I started to collect snakes, caught one yesterday.
I've got 'em in my footlocker in my room.
You're interested in herpetology.
You like snakes.
I hate 'em. Scared to death of them.
That's the reason I joined the paratroops.
See, I hated to fly.
Scared to death of jumping.
But after 50 jumps, I just loved it.
Danger, Colonel, that's the best tonic there is.
That's the reason
I put in for Special Forces.
Major, when you address me, take the cigar out of your mouth.
This is my office, Major.
The name of this outfit is the First Special Service Force.
- Where were you when I arrived?
- There was nothing to do here, sir.
We decided to go in town and look around.
A blind man could see a thousand things to do.
Sir, you being in Washington, you haven't been around like me.
You see, I've been in nine different camps.
I've got to tell you this, sir.
Never have I seen anything so out-of-the-question hopeless...
...as this joint is.
There's absolutely nothing it doesn't need.
"Hopeless."
That's why we've got it, Major.
And that's why I've got you.
You've been in and out of camps...
...because you're the biggest hustler and scrounger in the US Army.
In exactly 10 days, our first recruits and volunteers arrive.
Whatever they and this camp need, you're going to supply.
How you do it, I don't care.
Just start hustling. Cardwell?
Move it! Come on!
Line them up on the double! Move!
Come on! This is no Sunday school picnic!
Move it! Come on!
You think maybe somebody somewhere has it in for our peerless leader here?
The summer I worked in a fish cannery, we threw away better material than this.
Come on, you men, move!
Hate to break up the game, fellas, but when my country calls...
Cut it out!
- Trouble, grease ball?
- I told you, don't call me that.
What would you like me to call you?
"Hotshot hustler," "Senor sharpshooter"...
...or just plain "punk"?
Watch it. Here he comes.
- You heard him. Line up!
- What's going on here?
Not a thing, buddy boy.
Not a blessed thing.
Pick up that hat and put it on, soldier!
And I warn you, don't you give me any trouble.
Break it up!
Get that man!
Break it up!
We're going to try to make some kind of a company formation out of this.
What are we doing up there?
I got stomach gas real bad.
I think I can cure that.
Ten hut!
Thanks for waiting, fellas. Sorry I'm late.
Don't you know how to fall in, soldier?
Fill up this spot.
Ten hut!
Detail all present and accounted for, sir.
I regret their behavior, but that's the nature of the beast.
"Beast."
That's why they were transported like cattle?
Sir, some them are so fouled up, they must have emptied...
...every stockade in the country.
If I were you, I'd ship them right back.
What the hell's the army doing?
Just about what I expected.
Since you're not me...
...would you see that they get to camp, please?
Yes, sir. Captain.
A-ten hut!
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
We're told that men evolved from lower animals.
Apparently, you think it should be the other way around. That's all.
Right face!
Forward! March!
Hut, two, three, four!
Your left.
Soldier, get those dark glasses off.
- Where's your gear, fly boy?
- Seems I neglected to bring it with me.
Listen to the sugar plum.
He neglected to bring it with him.
You look a mite neglected yourself.
How come I didn't see you on the train?
I'm the inconspicuous type.
- Listen to him. Ain't he cute?
- Leave him alone, lard ass.
- You're asking for it, dago, you really are.
- Knock off the chatter, and get in step!
How about it?
Got a cure for that, Sergeant?
Yes, sir. Double time! March!
- That's the name of the game.
- What's your name, Luckhouse Louie?
Listen, we're not sharks in the game.
Luck's got nothing to do with it.
- Talkin' about luck, know how I got here?
- Who cares?
A sweet young thing in San Jose says I raped her...
...takes all my money, every cent, and blows the whistle on me.
They give me five years in Leavenworth, or join this fearless fighting outfit.
- How's that for luck?
- Yeah, it's a great country.
Every slob can get clipped, whipped, and double dipped at the same time.
Beat your gums, dago.
Beat 'em till they bleed.
I'm out $6.
Now, come on, deal the cards, damn it.
The only way out of here is over.
By balloon or P-38?
Did you ever hear of Bernheimer's world-renowned circus?
What about the Flying Greco Brothers?
Hold still, right?
- I'll be damned.
- Omar Greco.
- They call me Bronc.
- All right, Bronc.
My real name's Bronco Billy Guthrie.
- How many times you made it out?
- About five.
Bronc, I got a system, but I need a partner.
Let's hear about your system...
...partner.
All right. Come on.
If I'm gonna make it...
- Anybody question the requisitions?
- No, sir. It was a breeze.
We even got a wave-on from the guard.
Beautiful.
That's just fine. Great.
You guys get them around back fast.
Next trip, the toilet bowls.
All right, big mouth, that did it.
- Wait a minute. It was all my fault.
- Butt out!
Get him!
On your feet, dago. You got more comin'.
Change direction right!
Right wheel.
Mark time in front.
Canadian company...
...halt.
Left turn.
Maj. Crown, sir. Canadian army.
Reporting for duty.
Glad to have you with us, Crown.
Ready, company...
Capt. Cardwell, get these men into formation on the double.
Sergeant, company formation on the double.
Company formation over here and on the double, let's go!
Come on, move it. On the double.
God save the King.
God save us all.
Parade rest!
Welcome to the First Special Service Force.
There's only one really important thing to know and remember about the force.
It's the easiest combat unit in the army...
...to get out of.
All you have to do is fail to measure up.
You'll be returned immediately to your former unit...
...or predicament.
It's entirely up to you.
You Canadians, I'm told...
...are the handpicked best of the best-trained army in the world.
We'll soon find out about that.
You Americans, for the most part...
...have an entirely different reputation.
I've been supplied with full details on your military and moral delinquencies...
...prison records, how many times you've been drunk...
...AWOL or both.
I know all about you...
...and I couldn't care less.
I want men that are tough...
...love to fight, fight to win, and would rather die than quit.
Now, that's asking a lot...
...but no more than you're capable of if you'll accept the challenge.
We'll soon find out about that, too.
Good luck to you all. Dismiss your men.
Company, ten hut!
- Fall out!
- Cpl. Peacock!
- Fall out the Canadians.
- Yes, sir!
Canadian company dismissed!
- Can you believe that?
- Lend me your hat. I may vomit.
- Sir...
- You, soldier.
- Where are you going?
- Sir, I've got to see the Colonel.
If you ever hope to see the outside world again...
...get back where you belong.
I don't belong anywhere.
I'm AWOL from Camp Gillam.
I escaped from the stockade.
I didn't arrive on the train, I walked.
- I want to transfer to this outfit.
- Get!
Soldier!
- In my office.
- Thank you, sir.
Phone his camp. Find out all about him.
I'll be in Communications. Let me know.
- Excuse me, haven't we met before?
- Get the hell outta here!
It's just that you remind me of a sweet young thing I used to know.
I won't tell you again, mate.
Even sound like her.
Corporal, sir, you've got a beautiful group of handpicked men here.
- You really do.
- Bugger off.
Where I come from, the only thing we pick by hand...
...is little yellow daffodils.
Where we come from, we pick the rotten apples from the barrel...
...and feed them to the hogs.
Listen. One of them's a frog!
Go ahead. Say something, froggy!
Merde.
Just exactly what does that mean?
To most people, it's an insult.
But to you, I'd say it was a compliment.
- Peacock!
- Sir!
- Yes, sir.
- Peacock!
- At ease.
- Thank you, sir.
Long walk from Camp Gillam.
You must be more than ordinarily eager to join the First Special Service Force.
Any job that's open, sir.
Or get out of any trouble that you happen to be in.
You know, the one thing
I have excess of here is the troublemaker.
Yes, sir.
But if I heard your speech correctly, sir,
I think you've got the answer.
Incite border warfare, so to speak...
...between the Americans and Canadians.
I only assume that was your intention, sir.
- What kind of trouble do you make?
- I play the piano, sir.
When I washed out as a flier,
I was assigned to Capt. Quill.
He runs the Officers' Club.
I was to clean up during the day and play piano at night.
I didn't much fancy sitting out the war playing I'll Never Smile Again...
...so I asked to be transferred to Intelligence.
That should be a perfect spot for you.
You're obviously intelligent, perceptive, adroit.
Thank you, sir.
...and calculating.
How did Capt. Quill fancy your playing around with his girlfriend?
The girl he thought was his girlfriend, sir.
I thought otherwise.
He won the argument.
- So he beat you up.
- Not all by himself...
Don't lie to me!
I have all the facts.
You're charged with striking an officer.
Capt. Quill asked you to stay away from his girl, you attacked him...
...and his men had to use clubs to subdue you.
I'm not crazy enough to strike an officer.
Sir, if you send me back, Quill could keep me in prison for the rest of my life.
Yes, I know.
Don't calculate that you can con your way in here.
- You read me correctly?
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry to have bothered you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Ransom, did I give you permission to leave?
No, sir.
What's this?
When you beat somebody up, that's a good way to play safe, isn't it?
Tie his hands behind his back.
Bricker!
- Yes, sir?
- Get this man a uniform.
You've got to be kidding!
The uniforms have been ordered, sir.
But nobody knows...
Get him something decent to wear.
He smells.
Yes, sir.
That's all.
Sir.
I promise you, you won't be sorry.
If I am, I promise you, you'll be a lot more sorry.
Yes, sir.
Those bastards!
- Something on your mind, Major?
- Yes, sir, there sure is.
We're making a big mistake going soft on the kind of gorillas we got here.
- Did you say "gorillas"?
- Not the Canucks, the Americans.
"Canucks," Major, is a term we consider disparaging.
Do you have a specific complaint, Major?
Yes, sir, I sure as hell do.
One of those stupid jerks out there broke into my room...
...and stole my rattlesnake.
- Your what?
- Rattlesnake.
Maybe they don't allow them in Canada.
We destroy them, we don't sleep with them.
Nobody likes a promiscuous rattlesnake, Captain.
I can assure you, none of my men would steal a rattlesnake...
...or anything else.
My men are under strict orders.
Anyone discrediting the Canadian uniform is subject to immediate court-martial.
Among other restrictions, they're specifically forbidden to fight.
I suggest, sir, you consider a similar order.
- Do you have a complaint, Major?
- I don't mean to belittle the Americans.
What do you mean?
There have been numerous attempts by your men to provoke my men.
And unless they're ordered to stop, there could be serious trouble.
- You really think so?
- I know so, sir.
- We'll have to watch that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
How did a friendly little fellow like you get the name of "Ornery"?
Henri. It's French for Henry.
You got yourself a nice little piece here, Ornery.
They say them French girls know all kinds of tricks.
Give me that, you espece de salaud!
Ain't that a purty language?
Sure is marvelous sharing quarters with you Canucks.
- Yeah, what's so marvelous about it?
- Now, let me think...
Bronc, this man is one of the handpicked best, right, Corporal?
Thank God they're our friends.
Imagine what would happen if we fought against them.
We could take Canada in two weeks, if we wanted it.
- Right, Manella?
- More like two days.
Is that a fact?
- Just you try it, mate!
- Back!
Good thing your wife wasn't under there.
Now, you listen to me, you dirty-mouthed buggers!
I'm not one to pull rank, but if there's any more of your filthy talk...
...or your foul, rotten tricks, you'll pay for it.
Now, is that clear?
Right. This man is right. Let's cut it out.
- Very sorry, Corporal.
- It won't happen again, Corporal.
Very well, then.
Sweet dreams, Corporal.
Fall in.
We have very little time to determine...
...who is and who is not qualified...
...for the difficult job assigned to this unit.
The training continues today with a 30-mile hike.
Normally, you would carry a full pack and a rifle.
I regret to say that our weapons and much of our equipment...
...have not yet arrived.
We shall therefore have to do without them.
However, we do have rucksacks...
...which are loaded with 50 pounds of rocks.
Each man, each officer, and each unit...
- He's got to be kidding.
- Don't you wish?
Corporal.
"Yankee doodle went to town, riding on a pony
"Stuck a feather in his hat, and he called it macaroni"
- Peacock?
- Yes, sir.
Your stripes are not a license to behave like an ass.
No more derogatory behavior or insulting remarks to the Yanks.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
There will be no more derogatory insults about the Yanks!
Is that clear?
Would ordinary insults be acceptable, sir?
Sir, what am I going to do about my men?
They're a bunch of eight balls.
Half of them, if they don't belong in jail, should be put in a loony bin.
- How many of them keep pet rattlesnakes?
- Sir?
How many of them have been in and out of nine different camps?
Would you like to try for 10, Major?
It's very easy.
All right, now, look alive.
I know this is in route-step, but shape up.
I see you circling up there, and I know who you're following, too.
Fifteen miles back.
"The contents of this can are not fit for human consumption."
- Maj. Crown?
- Sir?
The Canadians seem to be in better condition than I expected.
That's very good of you to say so, sir.
"Very good of you to say so, sir.
Thank you, sir."
Bunch of gung-ho volunteers, they give me the galloping trots.
I can't make it.
- I just can't make it.
- The hell you can't.
Anybody quits gets his head broke.
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing, sir.
Double hernia, slight heart attack, otherwise he's fine.
Don't be smart, pretty boy.
- Everybody's fine, sir.
- Just don't drop out.
Canadian company, double time!
American company, attention!
Double time! Hard!
Come on, faster.
Keep up with them. Don't let them win.
Come on, get that bugger!
Run, boy, run!
Go get him, Omar.
- Well done, lad. Good try.
- You all right?
You! Runt!
That was great work, soldier.
That was a silly-ass thing to do.
I was just trying to return your favor, sir.
Now?
- You mean about getting out?
- Yeah.
Look, Bronc,
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
You said it yourself, remember, that they always get you?
This time, they could put me away for the duration.
It's just not worth it.
You've got your knife,
I'll give you half of this.
You won it. You keep it.
When you get it lighted,
I'll tell you what to do with it.
Bronc, listen, what if I help you get out?
What good'll that do?
Bronc, will you take this?
I don't even smoke.
It's very bad for the wind.
- Who is it?
- Maj. Crown, sir.
Come in.
Our chemists came up with this, sir.
It's the best thing I know of for sore feet.
Thank you. I don't need it.
Is that all?
You paid our men a compliment today, sir.
I'd like to reciprocate.
Your men performed better than I expected.
- My men?
- The Yanks, sir.
Major, please understand,
I command the entire brigade...
...Canadians and Americans.
Yes, sir.
What I don't understand is, sir...
...why are you pitting them against each other?
I have less than four months left to convert this misbegotten outfit...
...into the Army's finest combat unit.
I haven't time to explain or justify every move I make.
Yes, sir.
But I might point out, sir, that many of my men fought...
Many of the Canadian unit fought at Dunkirk.
So?
So, it's just possible, sir, you might want to learn a lesson...
...from their combat experience.
Yes, I might...
...if you'd won at Dunkirk. You lost.
I'm training this outfit to win.
Good night, Major.
We lost, yes.
In a most bloody awful fashion, we lost.
But from that loss, I learned a lesson...
...the danger of assuming the role of almighty God.
When the day of reckoning arrives, as mine arrived at Dunkirk...
...I can assure you, Colonel, it can be a most sorry day, indeed.
That's it, boys.
Come on, move it. Let's go.
Keep it moving.
Faster than that. That's it.
That's it, Canadians. Keep it moving.
Don't get your feet wet, soldiers.
Get going, Americans.
Bronco, you got a sharp knife?
Sharp enough.
What do you say, Peacock? You ready?
Nobody can see your stripes now.
- I know you're yellow.
- Cpl. Peacock.
Sir?
You never looked better, Peacock.
- All right, next man on the line.
- All right, soldier.
Heard enough out of you, let's go. Move it.
Keep it going. Come on, move out.
Capt. Cardwell tells me you spoke to him about a man named O'Neill.
- Is he capable?
- He's capable enough to recommend, sir.
However, if you question my judgment, you could try him.
I'm a new man here.
You'll not object if I join you?
You don't need all that space...
...even with that enormous fat behind of yours.
God in heaven, you're not going to eat that entire nauseating mess?
Small wonder you're such a monstrous tub of lard.
Is it true that all you Yanks are thieves and murderers?
There's one of you that's worse than all the rest...
...a villainous clod who never ceases...
...derogatory remarks about the Canadians.
Mind the elbow, lad.
Would one of you be kind enough to point out...
...the contemptible swine named Rocky Rockman?
You have just two seconds to make a public apology.
- What?
- Time's up.
You can't. We're under orders.
If you disgrace your uniform, you'll be court-martialed.
Lad, it's his uniform I propose to disgrace.
Now, sit down.
The human body has numerous vulnerable points:
The elbow, the ribs, the neck...
...including...
...the solar plexus and many other points.
It's true, you're a great, powerful beast.
But you'll note how his own size and weight...
...can be used against him.
Name: Sgt. Patrick O'Neill.
Title: Hand-to-hand combat instructor.
Further instruction will commence tomorrow...
...07:00, on the parade ground.
Could you pass the salt, please?
Thank you.
You're right, he's capable.
I hope, Major, that you won't punish him for disobeying orders.
It was my impression he was following your orders, sir.
More coffee?
I don't mind if I do. Thank you.
And twist.
Try it.
All right, let's have a go at it.
In a situation like that, you do this, you see?
The collarbones are very easy to break.
Now watch.
See? Try that.
Good.
Your stance is more like this.
Look, Major, this is what I understand.
- Whatever you understand.
- You really want me to stick you?
Whatever you want to do.
- I wasn't quite ready.
- I already did it once.
- Try that again, Major.
- You gotta be...
As you can see,
Maj. Crown's an expert, sir.
Put your hands up like this.
Move your feet a little bit the other way.
That's the way. All right, now.
- Good work, Greco, keep it up.
- Keep it up? Keep what up?
No!
You clumsy moose!
Listen, you smart dago, you ran into me.
- Great, man. Just great.
- Show them the way, Canadians.
Well done, Crown.
I can't say the same for your men, Major.
What are you gonna do about it?
- The men are tired, sir. They need a rest.
- They can rest after the war is over.
Keep going until they're as good as the Canadians.
You want a weekend pass, you'll work for it.
Let's go back up the hill one more time.
Now, let's see if we can do it right.
I've never seen anything so lousy in my entire life.
Competition has its use, sir, but doesn't it concern you?
The men may hate each other more than they do the enemy.
Major, your concern and mine is to get them ready to meet the enemy.
Yes, sir.
Proud beauty, why don't you sit down and have a drink...
...with some nice, clean-cut American boys?
Where are they? I don't see them.
Fraternizing with the Canucks comes under the heading of treason.
All right.
- You can't fight nature.
- Just what's that supposed to mean?
Miss Kleinschmidt's a lady.
Ladies associate with gentlemen, not baboons.
Take it easy, man-mountain.
You've got all night, my friend.
I'm in a hurry.
When this bottle is empty...
...l'm gonna break it over his head, and then I'm gonna wipe him out.
How come a big man like you thinks so small?
Let's wipe out the whole mother-loving bunch.
Now you're talking.
- All right!
- Come on, let's do it!
I got dibs on Peacock.
That pretty Peacock is mine.
Wunderbar.
Somebody put a nickel in the jukebox, and turn off that dame.
I love you.
Now you owe me a drink.
Fellas. We better beat it.
- What do you speak? Eskimo?
- I said, "You owe me a drink."
You'll get that drink, Eskimo, the minute hell freezes.
Who do you think you are?
All right, Henri, let it pass.
Come on, move down the bar.
Give them some room now.
Get over here.
Look who we got here.
- Millie, baby!
- Here, your petticoat's showing.
Millie, who's your girlfriend?
Who does what to who?
- It's optional, mate.
- Shut your big, ugly face.
- Come on!
- Look, now you put me down!
- Don't be so particular.
- Can't you take a hint, mate?
I can eat a dozen chickens like you alive.
Look, we're here for a good time, the same as you.
Let's not spoil it. What're you gonna have to drink? Bartender!
We'll buy our own drinks.
You've got a hell of a nerve barging in here, takin' our broads.
- Any of you guys invite 'em?
- No!
- I can't stand Canucks.
- So you weren't invited.
So what do we do about that?
Give me another drink.
You clear out, or we throw you out.
Now what's it gonna be?
Don't waste your time with him.
All right, we'll find another bar.
Finish your drinks.
We'll finish your drink.
- Let's go.
- You made a wise decision.
Now, wait just a minute.
Excuse me, but I'd like to clear up a little misunderstanding.
You see, the Canadians would be happy to accommodate you...
...but they can't because they're under orders, and they're not allowed to fight.
Am I getting through?
Where are you going to now, frog face?
You said nobody invited the Canucks.
But what burns me, big mouth, is just who the hell invited you?
Splendid, Rocky!
All right, Canadians, don't disgrace your uniforms!
Join the Yanks!
One for Millie!
Are you all right, Rocky?
Ten hut!
Break it up!
Good! Good! That was good!
Break it up!
All right! Break it up!
- How are you?
- Doing fine.
What are you going to do about them?
I tried to warn you.
I'll take care of it.
- Cardwell, Rose.
- Sir?
Line 'em up.
Heads up in there! Come on!
Let's go! Come on!
Fall in!
The Lieutenant informs me...
...that 35 lumberjacks...
...and 17 MPs were injured...
...and six hospitalized...
...and that property damage was in excess of $3,000.
Now, every man, regardless of uniform...
...is equally guilty, and will be equally punished.
Until the damage is settled...
...every man will have deducted
$1 a month from his pay.
From this point on, the entire brigade is restricted to barracks...
...for a period of eight hours.
Any additional singing...
...drinking, or celebrating...
...will be conducted with proper restraint.
That's all.
Dismissed!
"For he's a jolly good fellow
"For he's a jolly good fellow
"Which nobody can deny
"Which nobody can deny
"Which nobody can deny
"For he's a jolly good..."
Come in.
Sir.
May I presume to offer you a drink?
Sit down.
Come on, lads.
I'll take a snap of you.
Send a copy of this to the Krauts.
They'll bloody surrender.
Come on, big smiles. There you are.
Hugh, just one more.
My father always wanted me to graduate from something.
Right you are. That's beautiful.
Gorgeous, Rocky. Just gorgeous.
You're still a big baboon.
First Special Service Force pass in review.
Number 1 company, right turn!
- Number 2 company, right face!
- Number 3 company, fall in.
First platoon, forward march.
Second platoon, forward...
...march!
First platoon, forward march.
Eyes right!
Maj. Bricker, Maj. Crown, take over.
But I can't believe it, sir.
I just don't believe it.
Bob, it's no satisfaction to me, but I knew it.
I smelled it. I warned you.
I'm very sorry.
That's comforting. Good-bye.
Come in.
- Project's been canceled.
- Canceled?
God, why?
The commando raid on Norway is an entirely English project.
We're out of it.
Well, we'll be getting orders soon.
What kind of orders, sir?
Disbanding the brigade.
The men will be assigned to other units.
Son of a bitch.
Don't tell me I'm nuts.
I tell you, I just heard.
They're bustin' up the force.
What did we break our asses for? Why?
"Ours is not to reason why."
Damn the reasons.
I want more than reasons.
I'm going to Washington.
Tell the men it's just a routine trip.
Give everybody a 10-day Christmas leave.
Is there a chance, sir?
Have you got friends up there?
No.
But at this point, I don't care about making any more enemies.
We don't need your unit.
What we desperately need are replacements for other units.
Anyhow, orders have been issued.
It's out of my hands. Gentlemen.
Sir, may I have permission to see Gen. Cullen?
Why, George, he doesn't mean to imply he's going over your head.
He's not implying anything. He's saying it.
- You've got time to waste, go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you, George.
Look, Bob, I understand, I sympathize.
But you keep on this way, you're gonna retire a Lieutenant Colonel.
General...
...I have men who care more about the one stripe they've earned...
...than I'd care if you buried me in brass.
Why do I help you?
Why do I even bother talking to you?
- It's your funeral, Bob. Enjoy it.
- Walter?
I want to thank you for your help...
...and your friendship.
Col. Frederick to see Gen. Cullen.
I don't believe you have an appointment, Colonel.
May I ask the nature of your business?
Would you tell the General that it's very urgent?
Gen. Cullen's in a staff meeting.
I don't expect him back before 7:00 at the earliest.
Where can we reach you?
Right here.
You're a lucky dago.
- Joy to the world.
- Lf it ain't old handsome Ransom.
What brings you back so soon?
Sir, I found the old homestead intolerably oppressive.
Not the heat, the humility.
- Pull up a bayonet, and you sit down.
- Home is where the heart is...
...also the liver, spleen, and the lower intestine.
- What you need is a drink.
- True.
Come on, ante up.
- Who dealt this one?
- Come on, get your money in.
This horse should have his kidneys checked.
And why aren't you all partaking of the blessings of home and family?
- What's to go home to?
- I went home. Stupid sister's.
That draft dodger she married...
...you know what he called me?
"Sucker." I didn't say nothin'.
I just broke his jaw and walked out.
Deal the cards, Hopalong.
- Any word from Washington?
- Nothing. Not even a peep.
High muckety-muck Generals.
Jesus Christ was satisfied with just one star.
Some of those brass hats gotta have four.
You know how they get 'em?
By screwin' things up.
All right, cowboy, we gonna play cards or not?
All right, I'm in.
- Ante up.
- Come in, boys.
Thank you.
My sister's children.
Their father's off somewhere in the Pacific.
Hasn't been home in over a year.
I guess the least I can do is make their packages look nice.
Do you have a family, Colonel?
Yes.
Not much of a Christmas for you either, is it?
Gen. Cullen's office. Gen. Cullen.
Sir, there's a Col. Frederick here.
Been waiting since 3:30.
Says it's very urgent.
I see.
And a very merry Christmas to you, General.
Gen. Cullen won't be back to the office.
He says he's fully aware of your situation, but there's absolutely nothing he can do.
I'm sorry.
Colonel.
From Gen. Walter Naylor.
He just phoned. Can you read it?
Merry Christmas.
Gen. Mark Clark,
Gen. Hunter, Col. Frederick.
- Colonel.
- General.
Thank you.
- Gen. Naylor informs me you need men.
- That's right.
In Italy, we're facing a solid wall of mountain...
...defended by the best troops in the German army.
As you've doubtless heard, we're getting nowhere.
Have your boys had any mountain training?
I promise you, sir, whatever the job is, we can handle it.
That's quite a promise coming from a man with no combat experience...
...commanding an outfit that nobody wants.
Gen. Hunter's been making some inquiries.
He's a little dubious.
One misfit can foul up a whole company...
...and one fouled-up company can ruin a whole attack.
A lot of your men are chronic misfits, that's the word I get.
I don't know where the General got his information, sir...
...but I can guess.
Probably from the people who sent us the misfits.
As of now, man for man, they're the best combat unit in the world.
And that's a fact, sir, not a promise.
If you doubt it, let us prove it.
Unfortunately, there's no luxury in war.
Gen. Hunter won't agree with me, but this is no time to be conservative.
I do need your men, Colonel.
- When can they be ready?
- Right now, sir.
Attention!
As you were.
Sorry to interrupt your religious services, but good news requires a drink...
...and I detest drinking alone.
Yes!
You've heard from the Colonel.
We're still alive!
Very much alive.
I knew it.
A merry Christmas to him, to us...
...and to the brigade.
We're alive, I knew it!
Follow that stream up ahead.
Lower! Get lower.
Sir, we're gonna get our ass shot off.
- All right, let's head back.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel, my first impression of you was a whole lot less than favorable.
This daredevil flight of yours...
I don't want any officer around me...
...who takes unnecessary or unauthorized risks.
- Is that understood?
- Not entirely, sir.
- Depends on how you define unnecessary.
- Never mind the definitions.
Your outfit is being sent on an ordinary, routine patrol.
You were given maps and reconnaissance photos, right?
All of which fail to indicate that the entire route is under enemy fire.
Sure, enemy fire.
Would you like to be relieved?
No, sir. But I think I've found a safer route.
Show me.
Sir, if we could enter the stream two miles above or below the bridge...
...around Hill 418, and then enter Santa Elia from the south...
Take your men two miles through ice-cold water...
...arriving, if they arrive, behind the town...
...in a position to be cut off, captured, wiped out.
- Very good.
- Not if they perform as expected, sir.
What do you think Santa Elia is, a Boy Scout camp?
It's a key German supply line to the mountains and heavily fortified.
- Here it is.
- Yes, sir, you're right.
Now, listen to me.
You've got to take Santa Elia sooner or later...
...but I've gotta know what we're up against.
Now, frankly, I don't know what to expect from your men.
I'm hoping they'll scout the area and bring back a few prisoners.
That's what I want from you. Is that clear?
Do I gather, sir, you're trying to test us?
You can stop worrying right now, sir.
Let me tell you...
No, sir, we understand.
You're quite clear, sir.
I'm glad of it.
When your outfit comes back from the patrol...
...you report to me immediately.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Yeah, all right.
I must say, sir, you accepted his insults graciously.
You get a great idea, he doesn't like it.
So you just forget about it, right?
Do it by the book.
That's what he thinks. What do you think?
He wants prisoners, we give him prisoners.
Damn, why does this guy love water so much?
Why? He's nuts.
Who ever heard of a Colonel on a patrol?
A daddy wants to take care of his little kiddies.
- Right, pretty boy?
- Right.
- There goes my chance to be a daddy.
- Don't worry about it, frog.
Keep quiet.
Pass it on to the other morons.
Quiet up there!
It's only a mailman.
Peacock. You, McDonald, Bronc...
You know what to do. Kill if you have to.
But the most important thing is prisoners.
We've got to get 'em.
In an hour, the whole town'll be awake, so we have to move fast.
In Deutsch.
"Silence, or you're dead."
No mistakes.
One mistake, we're all dead.
You stay here.
Drag these bodies. Hide 'em someplace.
But you stay here. Let's go.
- Move.
- Keep it quiet. Don't let up.
- Come on.
- Come on. Keep going.
Keep it quiet. Get a move on.
Move!
- Get a move on.
- Let's go.
Move!
Once more! How many men?
What is your objective?
Rockwell W. Rockman, Corporal.
Serial number: 15359...
Once more! How many men?
What is your objective?
Rockwell W. Rockman, Corporal.
Serial number...
You bastard.
Another one? Maybe he can be persuaded.
At least he is looking more intelligent than this one.
Rocky, lad.
What have they done to you?
Peacock!
Gunter!
We took it, sir.
- Now what the hell do we do with it?
- We keep it.
Does this answer your question?
At ease.
Absolutely everything you did, from beginning to end...
...was directly contrary to my orders.
Sir, I recall a lecture, some advice...
...some criticism of our ability, but I don't recall any orders.
How's your recollection concerning unnecessary risks?
Why did you lead that patrol?
If you will recall, sir,
I hadn't had any combat experience.
I wanted to see what it was like.
You've never been killed, either.
Do you want to find out what that's like?
- How many men did you lose?
- None, sir. Six wounded, not bad.
There's no doubt, sir, that we were lucky that it worked out as well as it did.
Yeah. As well as can be expected, sir.
Come over here.
What'll you have?
Sir, I'd like about a dozen cases for the men if you can spare it.
- You're an insolent bastard, aren't you?
- You're right, sir.
Two hundred German prisoners will tell you that.
- You want a drink or not?
- No thank you, sir.
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, you must come now.
It's very important.
- You won't believe what we just found out.
- It's an emergency, sir.
Emergency?
What kind of an emergency? Make sense.
The clerk was going over personnel records. There's no denying it.
No doubt about it. We got proof.
Proof of what?
What are you talking about?
It's your birthday. Happy birthday, sir.
Happy birthday, sir!
Give me a drink!
"For he's a jolly good fellow
"For he's a jolly good fellow
"For he's a jolly good fellow
"Which nobody can deny
"Which nobody can deny"
Okay, knock it off! All right. Pipe down.
Listen. If you guys can hold off gettin' drunk for a couple of seconds...
...you're gonna hear a few well-chosen pearls of wisdom...
...from that distinguished Irishman and eminent scholar...
...Maj. Crown.
Today I had the pleasure...
...of interrogating some German prisoners.
They said some flatterin' things about us...
Gangsters, murderers, savages...
But the most memorable compliment...
...came from their commanding officer.
And he referred to us as...
...members of the Devil's brigade.
Long life...
...to the devil!
- Give me a drink.
- You organize this?
No, sir. It was a popular uprising.
Cast your bread on the waters, it comes back a testimonial dinner.
But where it comes from,
I wouldn't be askin'.
It's done my heart a world of good the way you guys have shaped up.
I couldn't have done a better job myself.
Attention!
- General.
- General.
- Frederick.
- What is going on here?
Little celebration, sir.
- May I offer you a drink?
- Certainly.
No, later. Is there someplace we can talk, Colonel?
This way, sir.
Mount la Difensa.
It's on the road to Rome, flanked all around by mountains.
Mount la Difensa's the key point to this entire sector.
We've been trying for weeks to take it from them.
We've had total failure.
And we've had heavy casualties.
But we've got to get it.
For good behavior in prison, you're rewarded with time off.
In the army, double time, and a swift kick in the rear.
Your reward, Colonel, is la Difensa.
Study the maps, send out scouting patrols, give me a plan of attack.
General, this fellow doesn't send out patrols.
- He leads 'em.
- Full Colonels are not expendable.
Sir, how low in rank does a man have to be before he's expendable?
Good night, Colonel.
Enjoy your celebration.
Night, Colonel.
"Around her leg she wore a purple garter
"She wore it in the springtime and in the month of May
"And when you asked her why the hell she wore it
"She wore it for her parents who were far, far, away
"Far away, far away
"Far away, far away
"She wore it for her parents, who were far, far away..."
Our reconnaissance has shown...
...that the German guns are facing west and south.
That's why I propose that we attack from the east.
What I need from you, sir, is an artillery barrage, all you've got...
...on the forward slopes.
That'll give 'em the idea that we're attacking from here.
In the meantime, at 06:00, I can be here...
...at 09:00, here.
By reaching this point, we'll be above them, holding the high ground.
For us, it'll be a downhill fight all the way.
If we can drive them beyond these big rocks, they'll have no cover.
They'll have to surrender or die.
It sounds good, Colonel, but your attack force up that cliff in three hours...
...with weapons, ammunition, food?
You must have remarkable faith in your men.
Yes, sir, I have.
Faith moves mountains, it doesn't take them.
How would you know until we try?
Overlooking your disrespect, there's no sense trying what can't be done.
I hope the Germans have the same sensible attitude.
Lf, in their opinion, it can't be done, they won't be expecting us.
That'll give us a chance to get from here to here without being discovered.
I tell you, that's the only way it can be done...
...with all respect.
Any further comments?
You'll get your artillery support, Colonel.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir. General.
They're giving us artillery until 09:00.
By that time, we have to be on top.
Our one and only chance is surprise.
- How much of a chance is that?
- Ask me tomorrow.
Ask me now.
This'll be their Dunkirk.
We'll whip 'em this time.
There'll be nothing stopping us but a white flag.
I'd settle to be alive tomorrow night.
- Wonder how many...
- 20 minutes.
Pass the word, 20 minutes.
That's quite a load, soldier.
Good luck, son.
Double-check all weapons, Captain.
Ornery...
...send my love to your wife.
If you don't make it out of here,
I'll give it to her myself, in person.
I didn't mean it, you know me better than that.
- I know you.
- You all packed up?
How is everybody? In good shape?
- Fine, thanks, sir.
- Great.
- Leave something for the mules.
- I will, sir.
Be sure everyone has a sweater on.
It's gonna be cold.
Sweater, yes, sir. I'll check 'em out.
You okay?
- As well as could be expected, sir.
- Need anything?
Yes, sir, an honorable discharge.
Stick around.
You'll get one if you deserve it.
- Sgt. Peacock?
- Sir.
- How are your men?
- The best, sir.
- Take care.
- Will do, sir.
How about that?
What's eating him?
Have you never heard a man say good-bye?
Holy cow. It's straight up.
What's the beef? It's only a mile high.
Greco, Guthrie, Gatling, Smith.
Three hours of artillery.
Three hours only. Let's go.
Batteries ready.
Batteries fire!
This is as far as we can go.
- Overhang?
- Yeah.
Give me your grappling hook.
No, Bronc.
This is my part of the act, right?
We're okay.
There was only one guard on this side.
Move. Get the ropes over fast.
Secure the ropes. Let's get moving fast.
Keep your head down.
- Keep down.
- They're over the ridge, sir.
Stay low. Fix your gear.
Spread out. Keep down.
Keep down.
- Give 'em hell!
- Cover fire!
Come on, you don't live forever.
Bastards!
- Move out.
- Come on! Let's go!
Look out, Bronc!
- We made it. By God, we made it.
- Not yet. Keep the fire up.
Damn right. We'll keep it up.
Medic!
- Help me.
- Don't worry.
I fix you good. Don't worry, bad boy.
Give my love to your wife.
Cover me, Colonel!
Damn it to hell. Medic!
- Keep moving.
- Shove it!
- Keep moving!
- Medic!
Come on.
I can't...
All right! Come on!
Keep down over there.
Fan out and keep moving.
Medic!
There you are, my friend.
The pain will be gone in one minute.
Be right back.
- How 'bout the bullet?
- We have no doctor here.
We'll get him down the hill as soon as we can.
How soon?
When we have men to carry him, if he's still alive.
Tony, I need a big crowd to help carry a wounded man.
- Take your pick.
- You. Get up.
You speak English?
Never mind. It don't matter. Come on.
Pick him up. Up!
Easy.
What?
- Put me down.
- Okay. Over there.
Water.
Don't be stupid. You got a belly wound.
You get no water, so just go to sleep.
Rocky!
Peacock!
No!
Come on. Let's go.
- Keep 'em covered.
- Let's do it. Let's go.
Get going.
Hold the mortars!
Cease fire.
Keep 'em covered.
Major, this is your white flag.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, indeed.
I'm ready to discuss surrender under the following conditions...
You'll discuss nothing.
You'll keep your mouth shut and listen while I tell you the conditions.
Keep me covered. Watch them.
Come on out of there. Come out!
Come on! Move it!
He's dead, sir. Come on.
There may be a counterattack.
We've got to be ready.
See that we are.
How about reporting to Gen. Hunter?
Shall I do that?
No, I will. Take care of him.
Come on out of there. Come out!
- Keep 'em covered.
- Hands over your head!
Keep moving.
Keep going.
Come on. Close it up.
Hands over your head!
Keep your hands up.
We didn't surprise them as completely as I had hoped.
Our losses were more than I...
...made allowance for...
...including my top-ranking Canadian.
A fine officer. I'll miss him.
We're getting some artillery fire.
If there's a counterattack, we'll be ready.
We're prepared to hold until relieved.
That's all from here, sir. Over.
That's not all from here.
We tried for three weeks to take what you took in three hours.
I want to tell you, it's absolutely fantastic, and it's magnificent.
I'm going to recommend the entire unit for a citation.
I want to say to you, Colonel,
I couldn't be more delighted...
... that I was absolutely wrong, and you were 100% right.
I'm pretty happy.
I want you to give my congratulations to every officer and man in the brigade.
They've unlocked the whole front and got us moving again.
They say you find out what something is worth when you pay for it.
Well, la Difensa was ours now.
Not much of a mountain, really.
But I never knew that a mountain could be so tall...
... or plain rock cost so much.
We'd won a battle, but the war went on.
Beyond la Difensa lay more peaks, more Germans, more bloody fights.
Mount Remetanea, Sammucro,
Radicosa, Anzio...
... and finally Rome.
As the men fought, their legend grew.
In all its history, the force never retreated...
... never surrendered an inch of ground.
But the price was high.
The American misfits and the proud Canadians...
... lay dead in a hundred fields and crossroads.
Together they had built a myth.
Too many died to keep it true.
NARRATOR: In the 11th century,
Europe was a patchwork of feudal states, extending from the
Mediterranean to the North Sea.
Powerful dukes exerted life-and-death control... over their primitive subjects.
One such, Duke William of Ghent, held a coastal area in Normandy.
To protect the marshes of a troubled corner of his domain, the Duke sent warriors led by his most trusted knight,
Chrysagon de la Cruex.
This Norman warlord was charged to impose the Duke's will... on his vassals and to protect their settlements... from Frisian raiders, who crossed the waters... to plunder and pillage.
MAN: Hey-oh!
United tower.
From here to the sea and beyond, it's yours.
Mine.
SECOND MAN:
From here to the sea.
We're pilgrims to nowhere, and we have arrived.
What's the matter, Draco?
Your belly hurt?
- L, Milord?
- What is it, Brother?
What did you expect?
Whatever you want.
Your wish is mine.
For myself, I expect nothing.
[Birds squawking]
Queer, moody place.
Still, it's mine.
Given by the Duke himself.
A holding no man in all Christendom wanted.
I want it.
You have it, and you'll keep it, Brother, as the Lord kept Israel.
This place has the dimensions of heresy.
[Horn sounds]
[Birds screeching]
[Horn sounds]
An alarm.
Raiders from the sea.
Frisian raiders!
They've sacked the village, taking women to the boats now!
RAIDER: Peasant pigs!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Charge!
Norman! Norman!
Father!
- De la Cruex!
- You.
CHRYSAGON: Frisian butcher!
I warn you...
Aah!
You are bloodied, Chrysagon.
I had him, Draco.
I had him in my fist, and I lost him.,
There's no one else worth ransom?
There's only one prince of the Frisians.
So, they bring their heathen brats along to show them murder.
Here's your lesson, boy.
Hold your hand, Bors.
Let me have him.
Why?
I'll make a page of him, and being a page, he'll make a lord of me.
He will sting you with this.
Where would such a scurvy ship's boy steal such a blade?
You the village elder?
My name Odins, and this is my son Marc.
You took that from a Frisian?
Aye, Lord. I fought.
Where are the men of the garrison?
- Gone, Lord.
- What do you mean, gone? Killed?
- I mean gone.
- And the warden? Dead?
Last night I saw him very much alive.
Methinks we've got a seigneur instead of a warden in a tower.
What difference?
- This'n saved thee.
- This'n can also hang thee.
- So could Tava.
- This'n has the right.
But he's a great knight.
20 years in the wars, the priest said.
Our lord he is.
Our lord, perhaps, but not our master.
Nor master of the stone, nor the tree.
- Milord?
- Good father.
Sir Chrysagon de la Cruex?
Hugo de Bouillion, Milord.
Servant of God.
My, uh, my flock, Sire.
Your vassals.
A simple people, but pious in their fashion.
They were druids here before Caesar's day.
Mere children who revered, in all innocence, the customs of their fathers before them.
Customs of the devil, sir priest.
Not so, good sire.
Not so? To think such faceless brutes could sway a priest.
Oh, they have faces.
The all look much alike to me.
CHRYSAGON: That doorway has no protection.
No protection at all.
It stinks.
CHRYSAGON:
You could find it blindfolded.
PRIEST: The raiders...
CHRYSAGON: It stank before the raiders came.
My men marched 20 miles today.
Now they must sleep in this.
PRIEST: Milord, when the Duke's messenger told our warden of... his removal, he grew somewhat lax.
CHRYSAGON: I knew him in court.
He was somewhat lax then.
A little... disordered, I fear.
CHRYSAGON: Where is he now, your lax warden?
It is to be hoped in Heaven, but I doubt it.
Your quarters, Milord.
[Bird squawks]
He was always chasing some goose girl up a hayrick.
He was bewitched.
Carried off by devils, he was.
These people here have ancient customs... in which he may unthinkingly have joined.
The tree and the stone?
Worshipping the devil?
PRIEST: No. He damned the devil's flesh, but women's flesh he loved, and devils dearly love to masquerade.
Priest... are you saying she was a witch?
Witch?
White flowers.
What is this?
PRIEST: Her bridal wreath.
Come, Sir Priest.
Was she a witch or a bride?
A virgin bride.
The warden's?
A villager's.
God's grace.
Bee among the flowers.
The mark of death.
[Screech]
There must be willing girls in this place enough for any man.
Why took he a virgin?
"Keep their good will," the Duke told me.
Him before me, this rapacious bastard.
Small loss when the Frisians killed him.
Milord, it was not rape.
They liked the warden well.
- Who liked him?
- These people here.
In olden times, they sanctified a marriage... by giving the bride on her wedding night...
Bors, burn that bed.
Devils... devils.
PRIEST: Yes, yes.
Our fens and marshes attract them in great quantity. l, with these eyes, have seen them.
I speak of different devils.
The Frisians.
Oh, yes, yes, Lord.
Might I offer you some meager food and drink?
- They'll be back.
- I daresay, Lord.
Their land lies North across the sea but two days distance.
- I cannot...
- I know where their land lies.
PRIEST: And they do raid our coast this time of year.
I have a green cheese...
Next time I'll hold him fast...
Two fishes, a garlic soup... as he held my father.
Father?
Taken in battle by Frisians,
I've been told.
And stripped bare.
Most extortionate ransom.
They are a harsh people.
He came home broken, and died so. A pauper knight.
It must be hard to lose your lands, I'm sure.
We lost all.
It was a long time ago.
A lifetime.
What were you saying?
- I said...
- Tell me at table.
We'll gnaw bone tonight and hunt tomorrow.
Thank you, Milord.
You'll enjoy our forest.
There's deer, wild fowl, and tusky boar.
[Woman screams]
Down, dogs! Down!
Down dogs! Get off! Get off!
Be still, woman.
They won't hurt you. Get off!
She's all right.
Counts as a kill, though.
Come on, pig girl.
It's never as bad as all that.
Pig girl? No eyes in your head, man?
WOMAN: Aah!
Here's the pelt, and there's the otter!
I told you I want no trouble with these people.
Handle them softly, I said.
Just what I was going to do, Milord.
You are out to hunt, dog.
Get on with it!
All of you!
[Dogs barking]
Are you hurt?
Ah, nothing much.
Say your name.
Bronwyn, Milord.
From the village?
I own the village.
I know, Milord.
What house?
Odins, Milord. The elder.
- His foster child.
- Speak up, girl!
May I dress myself, Milord?
Yes.
Are you going to watch me?
Yes.
- Are you cold?
- No.
- You afraid?
- Yes.
Why? I'm gentle with horses, hawks.
Come here.
Come here.
[Bee buzzes]
- What is this?
- A wedding garland.
And you're a virgin?
MAN: Bronwyn.
What happened to you?
He did nothing.
A bee stung him.
He?
I fell in the water.
And he did nothing?
- They were hunting.
- Who?
Lord Chrysagon.
And he did not touch you?
Am I hurting you by asking these questions?
Then why do you weep?
Marc, I love you.
I have since your father took me in.
Stay away from him.
Yes, Marc.
Stay away from him!
[Bird chirping]
[Laughter]
God's great fist, I can see him.
Milord and brother.
Planting himself in front of her and staring her down.
Giving her battle orders.
You go, wheel around.
Keep your flanks covered, pull up your breastplate.
Your rear echelon's exposed!
[Laughter stops]
BORS:
You haven't removed your shirt.
That's why the wound frets you.
CHRYSAGON: Frets me?
You fret me like an old woman.
Told you it's a scratch, nothing more.
Fester, then, in flame.
DRACO: You have a fever, Brother?
Can't sleep.
Maybe you took it from that girl at the pond.
DRACO: What's she like?
Oh, I don't know.
A woman, tan hair, breasts, belly, legs.
A woman.
She has a calm face.
So has a cow.
How was she?
I let her go.
You let her go?
Small wonder you can't sleep. Why?
There's a strangeness in this place.
I felt it since first we came here.
Nonetheless,
I thought, mine.
Poor place.
Marsh, naked tower, the world's end, almost.
But to have it, to hold it...
If only...
What do you think of this land?
Dung heap.
You deserve better... much better.
What say you, Bors?
You are my lord.
This land serves you,
I serve you.
But if it should be a land unholy?
Here.
Do you feel nothing, hear nothing, see nothing?
I feel bored.
I hear the wind.
I see fever burning holes in your head.
Silence.
That speaks of spells.
BOORS: Ah...
DRACO: Bors?
Sire, all men have heard how when the Lord Christ came, the old Gods, demons, and spirits with snaky hair... were cast down into hell.
Good riddance!
But some say they still linger, prowling the dark corners and unblessed places of the earth, changed to beggar men and goose girls.
Bors, you surprise me.
You've produced a thought.
BORS: God help the man who meets one.
The blood in his heart changes.
And what of that devil's dish he met today?
She's the cause of his fever, and that's the truth.
- How so?
- Because you let her go.
DRACO: Bors... you know who she is?
Find out from Rainault, put her to work in the kitchen.
[Grumbles]
Why waste her charm on pigs when there's use for it here?
Oink! Ha ha!
[Man groans]
[Horse neighs]
BORS: Come here!
[Door squeaks shut]
BORS: Now, girl... you will take his arms and hold him firm while I...
Lie flat, Milord.
Here!
You will hold him here and here.
He will plunge like a gelded colt.
I did.
Take him.
BORS: A trick I learned from a heathen Moor.
If a wench holds him, he doesn't kick.
Pride of manhood, I suppose.
Take 10 men to hold Milord... or one woman.
Sire, I shall count to five.
[Sizzling]
One... two... three... four... five.
[Door shuts]
[Bird squawking]
[Falcon chirps]
[Bird squawks]
DRACO: Volc, call him down here.
Damned falcon never knows what he wants.
VOLC: They're human that way.
DRACO: You know less about falcons than a flea.
To train a falcon, you need a larger brain than a falcon.
VOLC: Come down here or I'll wring your neck.
Damn me, but just look at Sir Flea bristle.
[Horse neighs]
[Volc laughing]
I'll kill him.
I'll kill them both!
I'll twist your nose with the slack in your belly.
I'm sorry.
CHRYSAGON: Draco, Draco...
Draco! Draco!
[Horse neighs]
Ya!
[Horse neighs]
[Horse grunts]
Don't run from me.
- Is that poppy?
- Yes.
What do you want with this?
We call it hawk's eye.
We get chamomile from it for seasoning.
It also has the power to rob men's minds.
Like magic.
- And it can kill.
- Oh, no magic.
My foster father heals with these herbs.
- Purple foxglove.
- For lovesickness.
Three leaves or four can stop the heart.
- Witchery.
- No, Milord.
Not witchery.
They all kill.
What's that?
Mistletoe, the golden bow that twines around the sacred oak.
Why is the oak sacred?
It's connected to the gods.
- You believe that?
- Yes.
Before I came, they told me that... marsh people had spotted bellies and webbed toes.
- You believe that?
- Not since I saw you... in the lake.
CHRYSAGON:
We'll lie under that tree.
- No.
- I feel good about you.
I've been fighting all year.
I haven't had time to lie under trees.
- Let me go.
- I fought last year, too.
I haven't even seen a girl with tan hair.
I'm tired of fighting.
- Milord, l...
- Shh. Don't talk, Witch.
Have pity.
[Birds squawk]
[Wings flapping]
This is not lawful.
DRACO: You want to serve in this troop? Ha! Ha!
I want to be Milord's man.
People of your tribe cannot bear arms.
Besides, you have no skill with weapons.
RAINAULT: I found poachers in the glen, sire.
PRIEST: They are not poachers, Milord.
DRACO:
With a pair of stags, Rainault.
DRACO: You said two.
RAINAULT: Yes, sire.
These stags were dead already, Milord,
Iocked together by the horns.
They needed the meat, surely.
The Frisians slaughtered most of the livestock.
That be truth.
Frisians killed our pigs.
DRACO: And so they poach.
Woodlands belong to the lord.
They should carry the stump of the right hand in the left.
The woodland belongs to the duke.
We keep it for him.
We keep the peace here, too.
CHRYSAGON: We share
Lord Draco's outrage.
To kill the duke's deer is a great crime.
- But there is no proof.
- Proof?
- It is my opinion...
- L, too, hold opinions!
- I am a knight!
- I can write letters!
- The devil's tools!
- Enough!
Beware, Milord.
Another time, your compassion might be mistaken for weakness.
There will not be another time.
You, Volc!
What are you doing with that boy?
Why, training him, sire.
It's the only way.
Keep to the tower now, boy.
BORS: Lord!
BORS: Milord has spent the morning on you.
Don't waste his time.
MAN: I speak for my son, Marc, who humbly beseeches our lord's grace... and consent to wed.
To this girl?
The foster daughter of my house, called Bronwyn.
When?
- Tomorrow, Milord.
- So soon?
They've been promised since childhood.
It's time, Lord.
I give leave to your son to wed.
MAN: We thank thee.
Work on the moat goes well, but the drawbridge...
Blacksmith here says to tell you...
No more now!
Get him out!
Ah!
[Thunder]
[Dogs whine and bark]
Bones of the saints!
What's wrong with you?
- Is it the wench?
- Draco, enough!
I'm only saying, if you want her, take her.
- I told you...
- It's not my business.
You don't eye a woman every day.
CHRYSAGON: She marries tomorrow.
Why not tonight?
She's not a she-goat, Draco.
I won't take a woman the night before her wedding.
You're right.
It's wrong tonight.
I could bite my tongue.
What about tomorrow?
Get... what's his name, the priest.
DRACO: Sir pri-iest!
You have the right.
The wedding's tomorrow...
The right of the first night.
Ask the priest.
Of the seven golden virtues, I swear, the most peculiar is chastity.
Look, you're the lord of this place.
She belongs to this place.
Therefore, she's yours.
Ask him.
DRACO: Dear learned priest, we need your counsel.
PRIEST: Such as I have to give.
DRACO: Are you well-versed in church law, father?
Middling well, though my order runs not to law.
It seeks rather to make amends... for the evils wrought by men through the absence of love.
Splendid. It is of love that I would ask you.
DRACO: Now... this noble knight has need of innocent pleasure.
There is no such thing as innocent pleasure.
Priest, scholar, certainly you have heard... of the right of the seigneur... to take a virgin bride on her wedding night.
The church does not admit it.
- It is pagan law.
- These are pagan lands.
Not of a Sunday morning,
I assure you.
These are evening matters.
We found the warden with a bride in his arms.
Was she not freely given by her people?
The warden...
DRACO: What do they say in Rome?
Juste primi noctes.
That being the Roman for it.
You hear that?
It's known in Rome.
And damned as heresy.
And yet...
- And yet...
- Speak on, good father.
Well, now, fertility.
Some say it's pagan.
But who's not pagan in some matters?
True, true!
I love the speech of scholars.
Young folks think only of frolicking.
Desist, I tell them.
But they will go a-wantoning.
So, lest the devil take them,
I preach them a text from Holy Writ.
"Increase and multiply,"
I say,
"replenish the Earth."
And oh, how they obey me.
But how this touches on your problem...
Oh, clearly, clearly!
The pagan part may honor pagan law.
We ask no more.
What hour's the wedding?
The wedding in church or t'other?
What other?
We'll be at the church.
To claim that right?
War lords, forebear!
In this weak hand lie lightnings, and I use them.
- Ah, no, no sacrilege.
- Not in God's church.
I dare say, there's another wedding... their tribal way.
That wedding's theirs.
Feasting, drinking, clowning, dancing...
Oh, Lords, how they do caper.
Aar!
[Speaking foreign language]
[Revelry stops]
Hold the boy.
ODINS: You come to do us honor, Milord.
To claim my right.
[People mumbling]
- He has the right.
- No!
BORS: Silence!
- No!
- Let it be, my own son.
ODINS: He has the right.
Not by his law, but by ours.
Ours.
Long before the Norman came, with his church and his tower, we worshipped at the stone and tree.
And in the fields, we plant holy seeds.
Then, as now, a virgin sacrifice... was made for the fertility of our earth... and the enrichment of our tribe.
To take her your way is rape.
It should be done our way... the old way.
You accept this?
With a ring of fire.
The sacred way of the Druids.
You accept this?
I do.
Prepare then a high place.
I have a high place.
Make it ready... and your men wearing iron.
Wearing iron, Norman lord, and standing.
As the moon rises, the virgin bride... shall be brought to you.
ODINS: But hold!
At the rising of the sun,
I will reclaim her.
So be it.
[Whispers a prayer]
ODINS: I go to wait the rising of the sun.
You weep?
- No, be still.
- Yes, Milord.
Milord. Milord speaks and all obey.
Is that not what you want?
I want you to be free to go or stay as you will.
But I fear you'd go, so...
Look at me!
I have the right to take you.
I have the right.
You want me to go?
Go... back to your pigs, your strange, damn people, your death-sucking bees, yes!
Go, and let me go.
Go!
Wait.
I want...
I need you as I need breath... sunshine, fire in winter.
Bother...
That's what festers.
I want my life in you.
It's truth.
It goes beyond the blood, fever, and the flesh.
It's sacred for a highborn man to begin your life.
BRONWYN: Are you afraid of me?
I cast no spells.
CHRYSAGON: Better if you did.
Spells can be broken.
Milord, l, too, am bewitched.
You. You had them hold me!
ODINS: Or see you cut to pieces.
MARC: Better that!
MAN: And all the rest of us?
He's got my wife.
He's touching her.
My God, he's touching my wife!
Bear it, my son.
Slaves have no sons!
Who took my mother from you, coward?
Who's my father?
Toughen up your heart.
If she'd been gored by an ox, you'd tend her.
Try and forget the pain.
Who knows her better than you?
She's yours.
Since she was little, it was always Marc.
I couldn't sleep.
It's cold out there.
I feel rheumaticky.
DRACO: Good Father... you have pointy ears... you have sneaky eyes... eyes that lie in your stomach.
I couldn't sleep either.
We are all of us, good Father, made of the coarsest clay.
You, me, my stern and glorious brother up there in bed... though I'm sure he isn't sleeping.
I wonder whether the louse wasn't created... on the sixth day with man.
You, too, are a party to it.
And undeserving of the frock I wear.
But you see, Milord, l, too, am a man... and a louse.
Stand to attention!
You are a guard of honor!
The sun... like every other day.
You cried out last night.
I put my fingers to your lips, and you slept again.
I dreamt of my father.
He died when he came home and found his lands sold for ransom.
And I took up arms for the Duke.
He died in two halves.
First his right side, then his left.
He had me set my hands between his... dead hand and his live one and swear to keep his faith with the Duke.
I swore to protect my brother, to recover our lands...
But he was already dead.
From under his right hand,
I took that sword.
I've lived 20 years with that cold wife.
And off his dead finger,
I took this ring.
What are you doing?
Milord, it's dawn.
CHRYSAGON: They won't take you.
Not the Duke, nor the devil, nor all...
It could never, never be.
[Thud]
[Thud]
It's daylight in the swamps... or did you notice?
You look as though your fever's gone.
The elder... what's his name,
Odins... waits for her below.
Don't you hear me, Chrysagon?
It's over now.
I'll talk to him.
That old clown? Let him howl.
But there was an understanding with the Duke.
You've forgotten?
"Keep their good will," he said.
I'll not give her up.
I can't.
First, you run stallion-mad and trample our lives to pieces...
My life is my own.
Dear lord and brother, you are the Duke's most favorite jewel, his cosset.
Through you, comes everything.
All we have, and we must have something!
You've had the grain out of my horse's mouth, new armor that should have clothed my men.
Their blood paid for your fineries!
CHRYSAGON: My blood, too.
Bounty from the wars, each favor of the Duke,
I gave to you, all to you, wantoning at court, while I sweated inside that damn, dirty armor 20 years!
I've had nothing.
Nothing! Nothing!
You are our lord!
You cannot be a slave of a slave!
It sets the whole world turvy!
[Kicks door]
And look at her, this flower face, the sister of pigs!
This blazing whore.
That naked strumpet wears our father's ring!
Then honor it... and her!
She is mine.
You are bewitched.
You've had her... now keep her.
And may your soul be damned for it.
ODINS: Where is she?
He speaks of love, the sort of thing that songs are made of.
ODINS: Well?
He's not yet tired of his toy.
I must see Lord Chrysagon.
Don't ever touch me1
BORS: What are you waiting for?
Can't you see it's over?
Where is she?
Father... what I said last night... I'm sorry.
He had the right.
But now I have her back, l...
He keeps her!
No! Don't tell me of his rights!
He has none. Not now.
What can you do?
Do you want to be cut down?
They are warriors, boy.
You won't get by the door!
MARC: I have a sickle.
I killed a boar in the marsh.
I can kill a horse and a man.
ODINS; You'll never kill him, boy.
Killing's his trade; he was born to it.
MARC: I'll sink my sickle in his chest like a hook in beef.
I liked him.
You know that I liked him?
Norman or no, he seemed a man.
I'd have served him.
I raged last night.
I thought, "Well, he's higher than I am, better."
And she...
I'll strangle him in his own stinking guts.
But not alone.
Hark to what I told you.
Go over the water to the Frisians.
Take the boat in the fen, bring them back with you.
Why should they help us?
Because this half-sized Norman says they will?
No, you ditch dog... for the boy I told you of, the boy I took.
He's a prince of those people.
If they know he's in that tower, they'll take it down stone by stone to have him back.
A Frisian prince?
He told you that?
These did.
Take that to them.
I'll keep this to be a lord in.
ODINS: Go then, my son.
It can't be mended without blood.
I'll be back within the week.
She'll escape him somehow, no matter how close he keeps her.
Old woman, take it in.
[Thunder]
Where are the men from the village to work in the moat?
None came today, Lord.
Yesterday, only two.
The village elder,
I haven't seen him...
[Thunder]
[Falcon cries]
[Falcon cries]
CHRYSAGON: It's cold.
My love, you're shivering.
Do you know the stars?
CHRYSAGON: My father taught me to find my way by them.
I know only this village.
An now, only this tower.
CHRYSAGON:
Do you want to go back?
I can't leave you.
CHRYSAGON: I know.
Worlds wider than this tower,
I do know that road.
There's a place, a far place where I can carry you.
When?
Please? When?
CHRYSAGON: When all's done here.
I must hold this place awhile yet... for the Duke.
[Dogs barking]
The Frisians. They're back.
[Ring]
[Dogs bark]
[Horses whinny]
CHRYSAGON:
Tybald, get water to the roof.
Break some stones from the parapet.
BORS: Away!
MAN: War lord!
War lord!
The boy... or we cut your Norman throats!
Has the whole village joined them?
Nearly all, I fear, Milord,
God save their souls.
Isn't that your falconer, the little man?
Volc, too.
DRACO: So, Sir Flea has deserted us.
Oh, well.
Small loss, eh, Brother?
MAN: War lord!
The boy! My son!
DRACO: Your son, is he?
You gave my father back for a bucketful of gold pieces.
The same for your son, then, or take him without his head!
Can you put enough edge on that to cut your way out of this?
Oh, I know we're all safe in your strong hand... and do but trust in you and all will yet be well, huh?
Lie here with your wench, then,
Sir Chrysagon de la Cruex... until those pirates pull the Duke's tower into the swamp.
Draco, what would you do if you break the Duke's faith...
I break his faith?
You're the lord of this place.
"Hold it well," he told you.
And where are the dogs you hold it for?
Waiting outside your door with pitchforks.
- But you...
- What, Brother?
DRACO: Will you chop me with this great sword?
Well, it might be.
You're a tall, strong man.
Or I might chop you.
Neither way would make you right.
Now! Open it!
My brother's ridden for help... to the Duke.
It's ready!
Bow the tower doors.
Now!
We need a grappling hook.
BORS: There is none.
Milord!
BORS: The boat!
It could have an anchor.
Get me a rope!
Take a turn around that post.
- Not you, Bors.
- Why not?
I would as soon die a wet death as a dry one.
[Banging on door]
Steady.
Pull!
BORS: Hold! Hold!
BORS: Pull!
Pull, your heathen guts!
PRIEST: Will help soon come from Ghent?
Help?
Aye, if the Duke wills it'll come, soon or late.
But... but will it be in time?
Ha! Look, ye priest... if they rise early, move fast, and find us alive, then it will be in time.
Hmm!
CHRYSAGON: Up now.
Come on. Up!
Get ready.
Water!
CHRYSAGON:
It's no use. We'll go below.
Barricade the stairs!
If they overrun us down here...
[Pounding on door]
The horses!
Hah! Hah!
- Pour the oil!
- Oil!
CHRYSAGON: Block that doorway.
They haven't finished.
[Caw Caw]
CHRYSAGON: Tybald... sound the bell.
[Ring]
Now!
Go!
BORS: It's Draco with thunder!
PRIEST: Milord!
Ha Ha Ha!
Lord Draco.
DRACO: Hmm.
CHRYSAGON: Draco!
Our savior.
Oh, not yet. Those wild men are still in the woods.
They won't leave while we hold the boy.
DRACO: The can't take him now... so they must buy him.
Our dearest Duke gave me more than the men I saved you with.
He promised me half the gold our captive princeling brings.
Ransom?
Ho ho ho!
So the world turns, Brother.
As his father held ours, so we hold him.
We could sell him a pound at a time.
Mmm. Pity he's so small.
Well, any ear should do to show we are honest traders.
CHRYSAGON: Draco, let be.
I've had a bellyful of blood over this.
"Let be," is it?
Oh, no, Brother.
My glorious brother, no more.
The Duke's had a bellyful, too.
When I told him of the devil's brew you stirred up, he gave me your holding here.
Did I say it was a turning world?
You are lord here?
I am.
That little insect is mine to kill, maim, ransom as I see fit.
This village is mine.
As for the clods in it... they'll find what rebellion brings.
I'll give them empty sleeves and wooden legs...
- For what I did?
- Lf you like, Brother.
Carry it all on your broad back, your sins and mine.
Carry them to a monkery and pray your way to God's grace.
Or go to hell.
I've been there.
Then go on a quest for the Holy
Grail, and take that with you.
But first, my father's ring.
- The ring, I say!
- Draco!
Shall I take her finger with it?
I can't fight you, Draco.
Then I'll fight you.
Ahh!
Why?
While I ate the bread you earned in the wars... and rode the horse you gave me... and lived in the shadow of your sickening righteousness... because the Duke smiled on you...
Well, he's not smiling now.
Now I hold this place!
And you'll all swear your fealty to me.
Not while Milord lives.
Then your lord shall die.
This thing must be settled.
Draco.
I swear to you, Draco.
I swear by my father's...
Ring!
If you prefer butchery to combat, then butchery it shall be.
Draco!
My glorious brother...
Draco.
[Crash]
Come, boy.
Keep her with you... here.
Milady.
[Sounds horn]
[Frisians whooping and hollering]
Wait! Hold!
[Cheering]
For this gift of my son,
I'll give you all I can... rank, riches, land.
Cross the water with us.
No.
Why "no"?
Go with him.
You and she get clear of this mess.
I can't give up this place.
This place is no longer yours to give up.
It was Draco's for a moment.
The Duke will send another lord... to do what Draco promised, and what will you do to save her then?
Kill him... and then the next?
And then the Duke himself?
If you'd give mi... milady sanctuary...
FRISIAN: My roof is hers.
CHRYSAGON: I'll bring her.
BORS: You send her to the Frisians.
Such fierce nobility, hmm?
And then what?
CHRYSAGON: I go to the Duke.
BORS: The Duke?
Why, to make ghosts of us?
CHRYSAGON: To put what right all I've set wrong here.
BORS:
You talk like a ballad singer.
Do penance?
Plead for these marsh rabbits?
The Duke will have your head on a pole and mine along with it.
CHRYSAGON: Don't go, then, Bors.
You get free of this.
Your father sent me to ride at your back... when you were too small to reach the saddle.
God help me, I've ridden too many miles there to leave now.
Bronwyn!
[Horse whinnies]
Bronwyn!
Listen to me.
I can't take you to that... that far place.
Not for a while.
I'll be with you... always, wherever you go.
So you go now to the North.
No! I want to stay with you.
CHRYSAGON: No, you can't.
I have to stay here.
If you go, I go, too.
You stand up... now... and go, and we both go.
Oh, Bors. I'm tired.
I hurt.
Rainault!
Hold this place till... till I come back.
You hold it well.
No, it's not a sense of betrayal, sir. l don't feel that.
But l was told l would have command of our next blockade-runner. l've seen myself on the bridge, taking this ship... from Japan into Bordeaux.
Do you know where l see myself? ln Bremen, at home in bed with my wife.
-You have a wife, Kruse?
-No, sir.
Well, perhaps here in Tokyo it's just as well.
Mr. Kruse, this cargo....
God Almighty, how we need this cargo.
And Capt. Mueller is a man of such experience.
Look here.
Tomorrow my experience puts me here, on a fine new Japanese submarine. l am to show our friends the wolf-pack tactics we use... to erase so much
Allied shipping in the Atlantic.
An assignment l do not cherish, you see. l'm grateful for the way you put it, Adm. Wendel.
The way l put it is that,
First Officer or Admiral, we do as ordered. lncidentally, if everything goes according to plan... our paths may cross.
Sir, Capt. Mueller's here to see you.
And he's impatient. lt's a bad morning. Nobody's satisfied.
Ask Capt. Mueller to come in.
Adm. Wendel, in the Merchant Navy, the captain chooses his own crew.
What are you doing here? l'll be damned if l'll ship with these.
Two murderers.
Two more, ''assault with deadly weapons.''
This one, ''theft of government property.''
Another, an outright political enemy. lt's also a good way to return these bastards... to Germany for the punishment they deserve. l'm sorry, l cannot accept them.
But they're only a handful, Captain-- l don't want a handful of maggots in my soup!
Now, we've given you every reliable man we could find.
And must l remind you, Capt. Mueller, that you can't afford to protest?
Mr. Kruse, would you leave the two of us alone?
Stand right there, Mr. Kruse.
Adm. Wendel is about to say that my last ship... was torpedoed in the lndian Ocean.
-Well, that's common knowledge--
-But at the time of the attack... l had a skinful of rum.
Capt. Mueller reports that he stood on the bridge for three days... with a festering jaw. lt was lanced.
Drugs were administered. No avail.
Therefore, Capt. Mueller tried liquor. lt is said to have afforded him some relief.
The torpedo didn't know l had been drinking.
We cannot interview that torpedo!
Be satisfied that the Admiralty retains confidence in you.
Believe me, Mueller, take the ship.
You'll save yourself a lot of consequences. l can take any of your consequences. l wasn't referring to you.
But you see at home, they are inclined to believe... that certain behavior runs in the family.
My son?
He's on duty in the North Sea area, isn't he?
My son is a splendid officer.
One of the finest.
-They wouldn't.
-Yes, Mueller, they would.
They have.
The cargo, Mr. Crain, is perhaps the single most important... item in the world today.
-Col. Statter, would you like some tea?
-No, thank you.
-The cargo, Mr. Crain, is rubber.
-Rubber?
A ship called the Ingo will leave Tokyo... carrying 7,000 tons of raw rubber.
7,000 tons of rubber, Mr. Crain... will keep the entire
German army on wheels... for at least three months.
-ls this music disturbing you?
-No.
Would you like to hear the second movement?
No. l'm glad you admire my painting. l bought this Kirschner in Zurich.
Yeah, l paid too much for it, but l couldn't resist it.
You come from Zurich, Mr. Crain?
Yes, my family lives there.
Mr. Crain... you have no family.
You're a German, Herr Schroeder.
You've been living in a British dominion here in lndia... on a forged Swiss passport for the last three years.
You were a reserve officer in an engineer demolition battalion.
The day you received orders to report for duty... you turned your back on your country... and managed to leave Germany with most of your funds. l'm not surprised, sir, that you found me.
-l'm only surprised that it took so long.
-Oh, but it didn't.
We've not had any need for you, until now.
What we're astonished at is that you never gave your services to the Allies.
-But buried yourself out here.
-Buried myself? l think l have here all that l could possibly want. l have my books and my music and a modest art collection.
And a visit from a beautiful lady from time to time.
And what l value most is my privacy.
Now let me save you some valuable time.
Col. Statter, l have no intention of blowing up the ship.
We don't want you to blow up that ship. lt's precisely what we don't want.
We want you to save that ship.
-To save it?
-Herr Schroeder... as you know, the Allies are desperately short of rubber.
As much as the Germans want their cargo... we want it more, and we mean to capture it.
Yes. Well, why do you come to me?
German blockade-runners have orders to scuttle at the approach of an enemy.
But if an engineer, a demolitions expert, boards that ship... and disarms all the scuttling charges... when the captain goes to scuttle, he's gonna be a very surprised captain.
And also surprised will be the engineer, if he lives to a ripe, old age.
Obviously, there are ways in which this adventure might not succeed.
Yeah, perhaps a 1,000, huh?
But if it does, the Allied governments are gonna be very grateful indeed.
And if it fails?
The Germans would shoot him.
We would've preferred a professional, of course.
But there wasn't a qualified man anywhere near Tokyo to get him there in time.
Schroeder... if we capture 7,000 tons of rubber... it's gonna save thousands of lives and shorten the war against Hitler.
Col. Statter... besides from the obvious suicidal aspects of your scheme... l personally don't believe that war is ever a solution to political conflict.
What do wars ever prove?
Men, women, and children are slaughtered... and a generation later... friends are enemies, and enemies are friends... and the whole stupid cycle starts over again.
Certainly, l have great appreciation for your noble effort... and your interest to save thousands of lives.
But excuse me if l seem to be concerned for my own life. lt's unfortunate you're rated so highly by the Gestapo, Herr Schroeder.
Because l'm told their penalties for deserters... are somewhat more theatrical than ours.
No, they hold you under house arrest until after the war is over and then... they give you a fair trial, as they do in England, l'm sure.
You realize you're my prisoner? l can have you transported back to England... and parachute you out of an RAF plane over Germany.
At the same time, a valuable English officer... held by the Germans, will be dropped over England.
Exchange of hostages is as old as war itself.
Perhaps blackmail is a little older, huh? l thought the Holy British Empire indulged in more modern ethics.
Some arrangements are being made for you to board that ship in Tokyo.
But even if l am put aboard that ship, it still might reach Germany.
That's right.
Or you may not be able to disarm all the charges... and the ship might be scuttled. ln which case, you're likely to drown.
Or be rescued by the Germans or by the Allies. ln that event, we'll still be able to make use of you.
Col. Statter, you are morally degenerate. ln your case, l can't say that l'm bothered by any moral nausea.
No, l'm afraid the success of the mission is your only hope.
Couldn't you have found a more obvious place in Calcutta?
-Like a public comfort station?
-What did you expect? l'd hoped for something a little more subtle.
Perhaps you'd prefer one of our local brothels. lt would've at least given me some compensation for the inconvenience.
On the return trip, my dear fellow. lf you return.
-Statter, you're a cold bastard.
-l was born on a chilly island.
Here are your personal effects: a picture of your wife and family... some German money... a wedding ring... book matches from your favorite bar in Berlin... more background, further instructions, bits and pieces... your dachshund.
Don't you have some sauerkraut and knackwurst in there for me?
Your insignia.
Display it at all times.
You are a standard leader.
A top rank member of the SS.
You're arrogant, rude, brutal, conceited... which should not be difficult for you.
Perhaps you would like to hear me sing the Horst WesseI song?
No, that won't be necessary.
This is a chart used by German merchant ships... the first 3,000 miles outside Tokyo.
We've learned the course of yours. lf you place this pin... at latitude 14 degrees North, longitude 175 East... as you see, it makes a circle.
Now, depending on winds and currents, your ship will enter this area...
12 to 14 days out of Japan.
And within it, waiting for you... will be units of the American Navy.
-What if my ship is delayed?
-Now that's a fair question.
Our friends will be able to wait until the sixteenth day.
So you see, you have a full 48 hours leeway.
How nice.
The code name for that area is the ''Keil Circle.''
And for this operation, you will be known as Keil.
Keil.
How many scuttling charges are there on the ship, and where are they located?
That's your riddle.
We can't be expected to know everything.
The crew believes this to be a routine passage... down the China Sea.
Yes, for a while, sir, only the captain, you, and l... are to be aware of our destination.
There are some of the reasons.
-You're whistling, sailor.
-Yes, sir, l like to whistle.
There's a superstition about whistling on a ship.
-Beat it.
-l'm not on a ship yet.
Stay in character, Mr. Keil. l am sorry but--
-Yeah. Best to enlighten them at the start.
-Correct, Standard Leader.
Good-bye and good luck.
HeiI Hitler.
Mr. Keil... good luck.
Hold your fire.
We'll jump ship in Hong Kong.
Dr. Ambach...
-injured man coming aboard.
-Yes, sir.
-Now, when do you leave us?
-At point seven.
-Mr. Milkereit.
-Sir?
-After point seven, plot course 76.
-76, yes, sir.
All right.
Captain... l have the honor to present Mr. Hans Keil... of the Reich Security Agency,
Division 4E5, Far East Zone.
Oh, yes. l was told a few hours ago there'd be such a passenger.
-You've assigned Mr. Keil a cabin?
-Yes, sir.
Hope you'll be comfortable.
Check with Dr. Ambach... and let me know when that man is ready to report for duty.
-He wasn't that badly hurt, sir.
-Just take care of it.
Capt. Mueller... l was wondering if you had a few moments, if perhaps l could--
After we clear the harbor, there'll be plenty of time to get acquainted, Mr. Keil.
-Good. l was looking forward to it.
-Well, l'm not.
After all, l know your purpose aboard my ship.
Mr. Branner... starboard engine, half speed.
Starboard! Half speed! lt's my belief that political soldiers are the lifeblood of a nation.
Even more than the military.
Wonderful observation.
You are a member of the party, Mr. Kruse?
Of course, l am.
Well, Captain, l hope that everything is in order now.
-lt is.
-Good. l see you're starting your assignment early.
You're wasting your time. l don't plan to have an infected jaw this trip.
Frankly, l'm quite surprised. l thought your department had better use for its men.
You don't have to be discreet.
Mr. Kruse knows all about it.
About what?
Well, l can see why the Security Office felt it wise to take precautions.
Though, l'm certain that the captain's drinking... and the loss of his last ship had no connection. l don't know about this... but l assure you this is not the reason why l'm on the ship.
Not at all.
Which still means you'll be looking over my shoulder. l don't know why you persist in this. lt's a long voyage, and l hope that we could find some common interest.
-Do you play the chess, sir?
-l do.
Well, then, we perhaps could have a game.
Mr. Keil, l have neither the time, nor the desire to play chess with you.
Capt. Mueller... l'm not accustomed to unfriendliness.
And.... l quite frankly.... l was really not prepared for it.
Do you have some particular quarrel with SS, Captain? l'm sure that you SS gentlemen are very valuable on dry land... but on this ship l have a job to do.
But how does my being on board this ship affect your job?
My crew. Word's gotten around that you're aboard, and they're scared to death.
This is ridiculous.
Ridiculous or not, l shall have to ask you to confine yourself to your cabin... the deck, and the salon. l don't want you to interfere with their work or mine.
Do you mean....
Am l to understand that l will not be free to walk around the ship?
Yes, just that.
The Admiralty described you as a passenger.
So you will have all the privileges and the restrictions of a passenger.
They failed to describe the captain as not only foolish but ill-mannered.
-Well, that's their blunder.
-Capt. Mueller... l don't have to put up with this sort of rudeness... and l would like to suggest that you show a little more respect for me... for my authority, and for the organization that l represent. l am the master of this ship.
You're under my authority here.
Mr. Kruse... you will attest that the captain is not only insulting but uncooperative. l will make a full report of this when we reach Bordeaux.
Bordeaux?
The only report l care about, if we reach Bordeaux... is that Capt. Mueller brought the Ingo... on a 15,000 mile journey through enemy waters... with a precious cargo, successfully.
Even if he didn't play chess on the way. l hoped that our relations would be pleasant... but l see that they won't. Good night. lf you will allow me also, Captain? l'm due on the bridge.
Mr. Keil?
-That was outrageous.
-Yeah, perhaps.
-Allow me to apologize for him.
-No, no. You're very kind... but this is not your concern.
But, anyway, l don't intend to comply.
Unfortunately, Standard Leader, l must urge you to do as he says.
He is in command until Bordeaux.
Until Bordeaux? Yeah.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Your watch is on at eight bells.
-All right, sir.
Revolution's 1,200. Steady.
Must have been a rat chewing on a wire.
Not much else to eat on this ship anyhow.
Hello, sir.
What? l'm looking for my bird.
Are you blind?
-You work in the engine room?
-l'm the Donkeyman, sir.
-Your name is Donkeyman?
-No.
That is what they call the stoker.
Yeah. l hope my bird isn't disturbing you, sir?
Not at all.
You are one of the men who was brought on the ship under guard.
Yes, sir.
What is the charge against you?
-l am a political prisoner, sir.
-Political prisoner?
Falsely accused?
No, sir, not falsely accused.
Boat drill! Boat drill! To your stations!
Everybody, to your stations. lt's time the men knew the truth.
You'll address them after the drill then? l wouldn't make a speech at the Föhrer's wedding.
Address them yourself.
Have you seen our passenger?
He's supposed to be at number two.
No, but l'm sure he can take care of himself.
Oh, l'm sure he can, but he's supposed to be at his position.
Perhaps he's waiting for a personal invitation.
-Better get to your station, Dr. Ambach.
-Oh, yeah.
Mr. Keil?
Hold the boats!
Re-stow them !
Officers and crew, assemble on foredeck!
Officers and men, assemble on the foredeck.
Where have you been?
Attending your boat drill.
Are you telling me you've been here all along?
Certainly not.
There was no life jacket in my cabin, so l was obliged to find one for myself. l managed to locate one in this... machine shop of yours which, incidentally, is a filthy hole.
That cabin wasn't supposed to be occupied.
Well, we're not being torpedoed, are we, Captain? lt's just a boat drill.
For security purposes, you had been told that our destination was the China coast.
That is not the fact.
This voyage, therefore, will not end in a few days. lt will require another 80 days.
Journey's end will be a port in France... occupied gloriously by our countrymen.
From now on, our watches will be armed.
Not the slightest misconduct will be tolerated!
Thank you, Mr. Kruse. That's fine.
The watches will not be armed.
The First Officer mistook one of my orders.
As to those of you with bad records... you will toe the line, as we all will.
Dismissed.
But, sir.... l have never captained a prison ship before... and don't intend to now.
-How is your insane friend today?
-Fine, sir.
Well... this is my first voyage on a freighter. l find it interesting.
Very interesting.
What is this machine here?
-The winch.
-Winch?
The winch for lifting the cargo.
-Oh, yes, this is the cargo hold?
-Yes, sir.
-How do you get in?
-Right from the deck, sir.
Once you get the hatch cover off.
You mean there are no connecting doorways down below...
-from one cargo hold to the other?
-No, sir.
Not on a freighter, sir.
Better be careful.
One day, this bird of yours might fly away with a seagull. l promise you... before this ship reaches port... there's going to be one dead
SS bastard on it.
Come in.
Oh, Standard Leader.
-Come in.
-l hope l'm not disturbing.
Certainly not, Standard Leader.
-Take a seat.
-Thank you very much.
Care for a cigarette?
No, l think l won't have a cigarette.
My coming here is a gamble... but l think l have not made a mistake about you.
-May l speak directly?
-By all means. l think that neither you or l are pleased... with.... l hope you won't be offended if l ask to see your party card.
-My party card?
-Yeah.
-This is my party card.
-Thank you.
Well, l see you've kept up your yearly contributions.
Yes.
You know... what constantly confounds me, is the irony of careers in the merchant service.
We have a man like Mueller at the top, and... while a man like yourself, a genuine German... in the best sense of the phrase... is First Officer.
But l did not knock on your door to flatter you.
Now... what is your opinion... of Capt. Mueller's approach to discipline?
Discipline?
He approaches it as if we were carrying a cargo of kimonos.
Exactly. Now... you must realize by now that l'm not just a passenger.
Certainly.
And l'm not here to count the bottles of wine that Mueller drinks. lt is necessary for me to inspect this ship, all of it.
And l prefer that Capt. Mueller is not made aware of this or anyone else.
Yes.
And you will be kind enough to arrange this for me.
Now, l must ask to look at your party card, Standard Leader.
Please drop the title when we're alone. lt's....
May l see it?
Here.
You know, l'm... l'm happy that you asked me this because if you didn't, l would know... that you were not being as alert as you might be.
May l ask... the purpose of your request? l am sorry, but... under the circumstances, l cannot afford to take anyone into my confidence.
But thank you. l can tell you this, which is something that you are already aware of... and that is that there are political prisoners on board.
And if l were a political prisoner... l would not be completely disappointed if this ship did not reach Bordeaux. l feel l should oblige you, Mr. Keil... but to act contrary to the orders of my superior....
Certainly, l understand, but if you should feel the need for my support at any time-- l appreciate that very much, but... l must think it over.
Naturally. This is logical.
But while you think it over, l would like to remind you... of our first allegiance.
-HeiI Hitler.
-HeiI Hitler.
-Thank you so much.
-Good night.
Good night.
Mr. Keil? Mr. Keil? l'm sorry to interrupt you, sir, but this is impossible for me. l'm not prepared for a lengthy voyage.
Would you use your influence, sir? l don't believe l understand.
Well, l have to be returned to Tokyo.
We must put about.
You have a rather original sense of comedy, Dr. Ambach. l know l sound absurd, and l'm sorry to bother you with this... but l have problems, certain problems.
Dr. Ambach, we all have problems.
But, Mr. Keil, these are extremely serious problems.
So... in this case, l suggest that you swim back... because it only takes three weeks... and the water is not cold this time of year.
This is Radio Norddeich, in the heart of the fatherIand... bringing music and personaI messages... to our gaIIant fighters far away on IoneIy seas.
-Touching, isn't it?
-Get used to it, Branner. lt'll follow us all the way.
Good to be back with you after all these years, Doc.
Look at him.
Ten pounds of trousers for two pounds of rump.
You weren't so funny back in Cape Town, were you?
When you came crying to me with a very far gone venereal disease... which l found almost impossible to cure.
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a buIIetin of speciaI interest.
United States aircraft today attempted their first raid on German territory.
No damage was sustained.
Our fighter pIanes shot down
1 1 of the enemy bombers.
-Good!
-That's wonderful.
-That'll show them, huh?
-Of course.
But what are 1 1 planes to the Americans... when they claim they are going to build 50,000 in a year?
Milkereit was always a pessimist... senior grade.
''lf Adolf Hitler is steering towards war, he's a lunatic.''
Letter to a lady friend, 1935.
The lady liked to save letters... and the Gestapo likes to collect all kinds of odd documents. l have that report in your service file, Milkereit.
But l was much younger. l don't feel that way any longer.
Yeah, just make sure that your change of heart is permanent, Milkereit.
And in the future, make sure to take up with less sentimental ladies. l once knew a girl who sang that song.
A girl back home.
Home. lt's been almost two years.
Sir?
A message from Tokyo.
Turn that damn radio off.
''Enemy ships reported your vicinity.
''Camouflage your vessel as British freighter immediately.''
Raise the starboard waist!
Get going.
Kruse?
Come with me. lt's urgent.
What's urgent?
This is an emergency. Come.
-Cornelson! Take over for me here.
-Yes, sir.
Kruse... l've decided to take you completely into my confidence.
Sabotage.
Very clever work.
Now l think you'll know why l am on this ship.
My instructions were to handle this by myself, but now there is no time.
You say there are 12 of these...
-scuttling charges?
-Yes.
That's sufficient.
Two or three could probably sink the ship, so we will have to cover them all.
Now... how many are there in this hold?
Two.
Where are they located?
One is over there, at the end of this opening.
Run a cable from the aftermast... to this deck.
Yes, Captain.
The last one's down here.
What is in the barrels here?
-Barrels?
-Yeah.
Lard.
-Lard?
-Yeah.
A few hundred tons from Okinawa... for making margarine and candles.
We even have a small shipment of oolong tea.
Thank you.
Now tell me, Kruse, where is the master switch for these charges located? ln the wheelhouse.
-ln the wheelhouse?
-Yeah.
Well, then l'm sure, the Captain has the only key, huh?
Of course. l think this one has not been tampered with. lt's all right.
Twelve charges and the only two damaged are in the engine room.
The Donkeyman.
-l'll make short work of him.
-No. Wait, wait, wait.
Whoever it is, we watch them play out their hand.
But the captain ought to be notified.
Certainly not.
Under these circumstances, everyone is suspect... even you.
Look here. There's help.
Very fortunate circumstance to find an alone American ship.
Very.
We have made radio contact with the Ingo again, Admiral.
She is on course and all is well.
-Where were your ship going?
-Australia.
-What is your occupation?
-l am a surgical aide.
Why were you going to Australia? l was a member of a medical team.
You were born in Berlin?
Yes.
And your parents, also born in Germany?
Yes.
So a German girl on an enemy vessel.
Whatever gave you the absurd idea l was German? lf you're not a German, what then? l am anti-German.
Captain, luck's still with us.
The fog is coming in a lot thicker.
You know the chantey of blockade-runners out of Tokyo, Bosun?
Nine days out, all will be fair.
Ten days out, sailor, beware.
Yes, sir.
Captain, the steward has just made a strudel.
Good. l'd love it with a cup of coffee. l've had the men go over the engines again.
Cylinder head pressure's normal, rev's increasing.
You must be getting very bored, Mr. Keil. l'm sorry we don't have shuffleboard or a band.
Well, l've been able to occupy myself, Captain. l've been studying the animal life in my bunk... and the wind and waves.
Well, the wind and the waves have been very good to us.
They certainly have.
We're nearly a full day ahead of schedule.
Yeah, and the old tub is still glued together.
So help me, l'm beginning to get fond of her.
Sir?
A number of ships.
Two different codes, very strong.
Signals are much stronger, sir.
They might be a city block away in this porridge.
-Kruse.
-Captain.
-Shadow!
-There! Pinned her, too, Captain.
Englishmen. lmproved D class of Lambert and Holt.
Englishmen... like ourselves.
Three ships off port bow!
Convoy!
Convoy... and we're in the middle of it.
What do we do now, sir?
Mr. Kruse...
20 degrees to starboard.
-Keep parallel to the convoy.
-Yes, sir...
20 degrees to starboard.
We bluff, young man.
And we believe in miracles.
Captain?
Captain, there's a destroyer... heading straight for us.
American, Benz-class.
Four guns, 10 torpedo tubes.
Makes 36 knots.
Good. Send them a citation.
Captain, it's a matter of minutes.
Mr. Kruse, sound the general alarm.
Don't sound the horn.
He may be on routine sub patrol and bear off.
All men to stations except radio, engine room, and bridge.
Sir, radio message received.
Destroyer wants identification.
Tell Mr. Nissen to send,
"British Stonehenge in convoy.''
-And send it slowly and garbled.
-Garbled, sir?
Mr. Nissen knows the meaning of the word.
-Now move!
-Yes, sir.
And somebody bring me a cigar.
General alarm !
General alarm ! Don't use the horn!
They are bound to see we are a fake pretty soon.
We'll be sent to a prisoners-of-war camp, maybe in Hawaii in the sun.
Come on, darling, take us.
Come, take us, darling. Come on.
Donkeyman, what are you waiting for?
Let's go.
First, l've got a piece of business to take care of.
Eight hundred yards.
Seven hundred.
Six hundred.
Five hundred yards.
Three hundred fifty.
He's changing course.
He's bearing off.
We are getting away with it.
They think we are real. l don't know what they think, but it's time somebody lit my cigar.
You there! Hoffman!
Get off the deck and kill the whistle!
Captain, the destroyer has ordered us to stop immediately for boarding.
Here, sir.
-Mr. Kruse, halt engines.
-Halt engines, sir.
-Halt engines.
-Halt engines.
Engines halting.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship! lnto the boats!
-Are we scuttling, sir?
-Get on. l'll take care of it.
Get in the boats, men!
And hurry up there! Hurry up!
Hold the line!
Capt. Mueller, wait!
Why aren't you in the lifeboat?
Don't throw your life away needlessly.
You're insane. l'll be over the side as soon as l finish this.
Mr. Kruse, hold the lifeboats.
Everybody, back to stations!
Sir! Sir!
Mr. Branner reports engine room ready.
Full ahead.
Give me everything you can deliver.
-Hard to starboard.
-Hard to starboard.
We'll make for that fog bank.
Maybe we can sneak out of here.
Helmsman, what's your reading?
One, one, zero, sir.
Port two points.
-Port two points, sir.
-Mr. Milkereit? Mr. Kruse?
-Sir.
-Radical change of course.
-Which alternative, sir?
-Put us on course beta.
Yes, sir.
-Mr. Cornelson?
-Yes, sir.
They'll send our description to every skiff between here and Midway.
Call Bosun to my quarters.
We change camouflage again.
Yes, sir.
-Mr. Keil?
-Yes. l have misjudged you, Mr. Keil. l never for one moment thought that... you might try to save my life.
You gentlemen of the SS don't usually display the humanity of a sand crab.
Well, to be honest with you, l couldn't help myself.
Well, gentlemen, was it God or the Föhrer that brought the fog?
Thank both, and the captain as well.
-l must say, he used his wits.
-Yeah, he was brilliant.
Yeah.
Milkereit, in which direction are we headed?
Sorry, our course is classified.
Don't you think that perhaps by now l am an exception to the general rules?
-As navigation officer, l can't allow that--
-Just for once, use a little common sense. lt's your responsibility, sir.
Mr. Keil...
-this is our present position.
-Yeah.
This was the old course, almost due east.
Now this will be our new course. See?
Yeah.
-ls that coffee over there?
-Yeah.
-Can l have a cup please?
-Of course.
Thank you.
-Do you take sugar?
-One teaspoon full.
-Here's your coffee.
-Oh. Thank you, very kind.
-Yeah, now, this is the new course.
-This is the new course. Yeah.
-But we lose a lot of time this way--
-Oh, yeah, several days.
-You must have dropped your pin.
-No, no. l never can measure distance on the map. l was trying to find out how far it is from here to here.
That's very easy.
Just a moment, from here to here. lt's 220 miles.
You know, it's strange. lt's only about two inches, and yet it's...
-further than Leipzig to Dösseldorf?
-Yeah, you're right.
This island, it's not....
-lt's not dangerous to go so close?
-No, it's uninhabited. lt's no tactical value for us or the Americans. lt has such a strange shape. lt's like a starfish.
-What are you laughing for?
-That's its name. Starfish lsland.
Yeah, l guess.
This is certainly interesting. l've never... seen it before.
Kruse, would you excuse me, please?
-l'll see you a bit later.
-Sure, sure. Thank you.
Standard Leader?
Standard Leader.
All right.
Shall we go to my room?
Mine's right here.
Your swindle is over.
What swindle? lt's damn plain that you don't want this ship to reach Bordeaux.
What do you want of me?
We want to hear what you've got to offer.
And if we don't like it... we turn this over to Kruse or the captain.
Milkereit.
-How many are there of you?
-We have four others.
-Four. And there are no officers?
-No.
How long have you been together with these men?
We started to talk during the camouflage.
And then l saw you jam the whistle... and realized you also were in the fight against Hitler. l see l am surrounded by patriots.
Not these others. lf they reach Germany, they will be finished.
Yeah, l think you will be finished also.
Yes, l know. l keep wondering if that's why l was assigned here on this ship.
We all have the same goal, to keep our heads on our shoulders.
Every time we bump into each other, it's near a scuttling charge. Am l right?
Yeah, l was trying to disarm them.
-What's your plan?
-Now there's no plan.
Before we changed course, we were headed straight for an Allied ambush.
An ambush?
Yeah, there were American warships waiting for us, but now it's finished.
-What is your plan?
-We haven't any plan.
There's only one chance then.
This island, Star something.
-Starfish lsland?
-Starfish lsland. How far is it?
About 3,000 miles.
How many days?
Roughly 15 days.
Fifteen.
How close do we come to it when we pass?
About 70 or 80 miles.
Milkereit!
-Milkereit!
-Just a second, sir.
Excuse me, sir, l was just lying down.
That's all right.
Milkereit, what l need is a report of all the winds and currents... of the new course beta.
-As soon as possible.
-Yes, l will do it.
-Okay?
-Yes.
Would it be possible... when we pass this island... to take one of those rubber boats and put it over the side?
-lf it's night.
-And nobody sees us.
The chances of making the island would still be 15-to-1 .
We must take whatever chance we have.
Now, there are three scuttling charges that l have not yet disarmed. l will continue to disarm the charges... in the events that we are intercepted by an Allied warship.
Now, are we all agreed?
Yes, we do.
Stop engines. Slow us down.
Stop engines. Slow us down, sir.
-Lower the gangplank.
-Lower the gangplank, sir.
-Lower the gangplank!
-All you men here... lower the gangway.
Hurry up! Get it over with!
We'll continue to observe radio silence until after transfer of prisoners.
-What transfer of prisoners?
-Shall l send a reply, sir?
Yes. Tell them Capt. Mueller just jumped overboard.
-Did you disarm it?
-Yeah, there are only two left.
Welcome aboard the steam ship Christina.
Thank you, Captain. lt's always nice to meet an honest Swedish skipper.
You must enjoy being a neutral.
You're lit up like a Christmas tree.
Well, l'm glad l'm no longer English.
You came within 100 yards of putting a torpedo in my belly.
And your destroyers almost put a depth charge down my throat.
-Back to stations.
-Back to stations, sir.
Back to stations! Everybody! l can certainly see why you were so obstinate back in Japan. l now hand you custody of 15 prisoners. lnterrogation report on each.
As well as one on the girl.
Nothing is spared me.
You will find that one very interesting.
-Mr. Kruse?
-Captain.
Escort the prisoners to twin decks number five.
Yes, sir. Move!
Just a minute.
Mr. Cornelson, you certainly wouldn't put her up with them.
Mr. Cornelson, take her to my cabin for the time being.
Now, Adm. Wendel-- l know. l know.
This new cargo is a burden, Captain. l suppose that's why you radioed the request... but not the reason for this rendezvous.
Were you afraid l might get a bit too obstinate this time?
We thought of that Mueller, we thought of that.
Now that you're here, would you join me for a drink?
Fine. l wouldn't have missed this chance to congratulate you personally.
Slipping in and out of that convoy.
Remarkable seamanship.
Thank you.
Very gratifying for a captain who has to have a keeper on his tail.
Keeper? lnsist on playing games? Very well.
The passenger you gentlemen put aboard.
Someone we put aboard?
HeiI Hitler.
-HeiI Hitler.
-HeiI Hitler.
Adm. Wendel, Cmdr. Busch... this is my passenger, Mr. Hans Keil of the Security Office.
Adm. Wendel, it's a pleasure to meet you. l am delighted, Mr. Keil, to meet you here.
Thank you.
Glad to meet you.
Your department didn't notify me of your assignment.
Oh, that's strange. l presented my credentials to the embassy.
Naturally. Well, then, your venture was authorized after l left Tokyo.
Yeah, perhaps.
Anyway, this is not a venture. l'm just here as a passenger.
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.
Where were you before Tokyo? l'm not able to reveal this.
Secret information, no doubt.
Classified.
Gentlemen. l'll wager one thing.
When you left port... you didn't expect to run into two officers from the German Admiralty.
Never hoped for such luck.
Well, as my friend
Bernhard Weber used to say... if you can't imagine a situation it is....
You knew Brigade Leader Weber?
-Weber?
-From SS leadership school.
You went there, of course.
Yeah, sure, class of 1938.
General Ordenlichter was the commandant then.
Are you acquainted with him?
-Yes.
-He was a wonderful man.
Class of '38.
Well, then you must know
Brigade Leader Weber.
The Chief of Political Evaluation.
Weber. Weber.
Yeah, l remember him. l see you smoke an English briar.
An amazing observation.
You should be in counter-intelligence. l am.
-Really?
-And frankly... what we would like to determine is... what you're doing onboard this ship.
Nothing more important than... being a passenger.
But l'm so flattered with your interest.
Well, l never did finish my remark about Brigade Leader Weber.
-The Political Evaluation Chief.
-Right.
An astonishing fact is that he doesn't exist. l invented the man.
Of course, he doesn't exist.
Gentlemen, l don't wish to embarrass you... but really this kind of interrogation technique is childish.
We learned this in the first two weeks of leadership school.
But l am fascinated by your curiosity.
You would be less fascinated if l told you that perhaps you, too, are an invention...
-Standard Leader Keil.
-Now, gentlemen... if it wasn't for Mr. Keil, we wouldn't be aboard this ship.
He stopped me from scuttling her. l had my hand on the switch... and Mr. Keil thought that l was going to stay with her... and did his best to stop me.
And while he was doing that, your wolf-pack... blasted the convoy.
So, you see, if he hadn't delayed me for a few seconds...
7,000 tons of precious rubber would have been at the bottom of the sea.
So Mr. Keil is capable of a nice, sentimental gesture.
-That doesn't clear up my doubts.
-l see no reasons... to discuss matters that concern only my department.
And now, Adm. Wendel, let me notify you in very simple terms.
The Security Office will be informed in every exact detail... as to your interference, is that clear?
-Mr. Keil, l will not permit you--
-Now, gentlemen.
There is no real problem.
All you have to do is radio Berlin.
Yeah, excellent idea.
This is logical.
Capt. Mueller, are you willing to be answerable for Mr. Keil?
Yes. l'll accept that. l don't think we need trouble Berlin. l realize that we have offended you.
But you must understand our need for caution. lf l didn't, who would?
At any rate, my regrets.
Adm. Wendel.
And thank you for your excellent hospitality.
Good night, Mr. Keil.
Naturally, l'll radio Berlin.
By this time tomorrow, you should have a complete report.
Meantime, keep an eye on him.
Capt. Mueller, thank you for your gesture. lt was very kind.
You gentlemen wouldn't trust your own embalmer.
Enjoy your next 24 hours.
They may be your last ones.
They're checking with Berlin.
Did the officer who brought you here ask your name?
-No.
-Good.
You must promise to keep your mouth shut.
Keep my mouth shut about what?
About the fact that you're....
A Jewess? ls it so difficult to say the word? l have nothing against you because you are Jewish.
One can't choose one's parents.
-ls that what you mean?
-No, that is not what l mean.
Sit down.
Sit down!
That's my son.
He'd like you.
On the other hand, he might prefer to lop off my head.
Why do you resent being treated with respect?
Let's see. Your name: ''Esther Levy.''
Levy won't do. What shall we call you?
Cohen? Shapiro?
Look, there's a long trip ahead.
Put a lid on your pride. lt's worth it to make yourself comfortable.
And let you feel decent. lf you wish.
Then lend me a needle and thread. l'd like to make this outfit a little more attractive... for the concentration camp.
When we reach Bordeaux... this report will be lost.
And with luck... perhaps you may find a way to lose yourself there, too. l'm sorry. lt's the most l can do.
Do you want to sleep with me?
Or you're just doing this because you're kindhearted?
Young lady, even this kind of impudence will not stop me... from treating you simply as another member of the human race.
All right. ln America, l lived with a family named Goddard.
Milkereit, since you are on the bridge, you can take the captain by surprise.
-Alone?
-No, Boeck will be with you.
Donkeyman, you and Hoffman will overpower the guard on the rear deck.
But how do we get those prisoners with us?
Well, l will have to find a way to speak with them as soon as possible. l would first like to consider all the risks before making--
There is nothing to consider.
Consider how your face will look with a piano wire around your neck... when Kruse sends his report into the Gestapo.
But without those prisoners, we have no chance.
Not even with them. lf we take over the ship, we are only two days away from the American navy.
You know what looks very good to me now?
Starfish lsland.
Donkeyman... you said the odds against this island were... what, 15-to-1?
What are they against this plan?
14-to-1 .
We must make a decision.
Yes.
Let's go.
Miss Goddard, this is...
Standard Leader Keil.
How do you do?
Miss Goddard is an American girl.
She studied in Germany.
Well, we are delighted to have you with us. ls it my insignia that disturbs her?
-Captain, where is my room?
-Right here. lt's obvious that you share the captain's sentiments about the SS.
As l told Capt. Mueller, it was a long voyage.
Yes.
Chess partners are very difficult to come by Mr. Keil.
Evidently.
Miss Goddard?
-Miss Goddard?
-Who is it? lt's Mr. Keil.
Could l speak with you one moment?
There is a crack under the door. lt should be easy for you to crawl through it.
At 7:00 every morning, an officer and two crew members... will supervise the prisoners exercise.
After this duty, the weapons will be locked in the ordinance room.
Now l understand the hatch covers over the prisoners hold were closed last night.
You must like steam baths.
From now on, the hatch covers will remain partially open... and therefore, the regular watch in the area will be armed. l acted for our well-being, sir, not towards the enemy's.
Well, l won't let it spoil my appetite for breakfast. l'm glad of that, sir.
There's international rules!
We got a right to be heard.
Shall we arrange it for them? l would like to be there... when you try to convince these birds to join the Gestapo.
Some day it will be a pleasure to pay a visit to America.
-This will be wonderful.
-Meanwhile, let's eat. Thank you.
Keep moving. Let's go.
Keep moving! Call Dr. Ambach.
Take him over to the hospital right away.
You, follow them.
Captain, emergency! A prisoner's hurt.
We can't rouse Dr. Ambach.
Get me the morphine. lt's bad, but not as bad as the racket you're making.
-What's the matter?
-There's no morphine here. l'll get it.
You can be of use. Go up there and help.
You, up here. Us, sweating in a dungeon.
-Your kind always wind up living rich.
-Shut up.
Shut up, you crackpot.
We're sick of hearing that garbage.
What's this? What do you mean?
He means l'm a Jew.
Where do you hide the ship's morphine?
-This damn fever gets me now.
-Where is the morphine, Mr. Ambach?
Morphine? There is no morphine.
No, no, no. lt's mine. l brought it aboard the ship myself. lt's mine. This stuff's mine. lt's private property. No!
You can't have that. Captain! l'll die without it. l'll die.
You'll live, Mr. Ambach.
They told me voyage to China coast... only a few days.
They lied to me. l had to take it. l had to take it. l had to.
Do you want me to clean it now?
When a Jewish bitch takes over the sick ward then....
Miss Levy is perfectly able to attend to this.
Miss Levy?
You knew.
Have you thought of the effect on the officers and men? l didn't know it was contagious.
Now, what do you have to say about this? l think you're out of your mind... but, after all, you are the master of the ship.
That l am.
Now, take care of it. l'm sure you can do it better than l can.
You're saying that she will continue to have a stage room?
That you will go on feeding her in the salon?
The lady's privileges will remain.
Now the steward will be glad to serve your meals in your cabin... if it's all too much for you.
-l must remind you of the consequences.
-l recognize that word. lf all Germans had conducted themselves like this...
-where do you suppose we'd be today?
-Certainly not where we are now.
-You are speaking to a party member.
-This is not a party office.
You had better remember there's nothing chalked up against me.
-Now don't you carry me--
-Not even an ounce of Jamaican rum.
Now you listen to me! l've been at sea too long for this. l know all your talk. l'll take the responsibility for what l do.
You young men... who keep the world breathless. lt's your time, l know.
But to realize your dreams... you'll need something more than brutality.
You'll need, if you can manage it, a little mercy.
Now, what could you know of our dreams? l'm all right now. Thanks. l'm not going to hurt you. l'm not going to hurt you. Listen.
Just listen and be quiet. lf you scream, you will only place your life in danger.
Now, understand that l'm not an SS man. l am a German, working for the British lntelligence... and l am planning to take over this ship.
Now, l am going to take my hands away from your mouth... and l don't want you to scream.
Don't scream. l'm not an SS man. l'm working for British lntelligence. l'm planning to take over this ship. l don't believe you.
You have no choice.
You are a Jew on your way to Germany.
And if you value your life, you will need my help... and l will need yours.
How can l be of help to you?
Well, l cannot take over this ship without the American prisoners... and l may need your help to contact them.
Why don't you contact them yourself? l am going to try.
But the message exposing me is on its way from Berlin.
And if it comes by 8:00 tonight, when the watch changes... then you will have to slip into the hold and persuade them.
They will not believe any of the men with me.
And if our plan succeeds, we'll be finished with this idiotic war in a few days.
You think this war is idiotic?
All wars are idiotic.
One is not different from the other.
Then why are you here?
Certainly not by choice. l was blackmailed by a Britisher to the strains of Mozart. l am not concerned about this war. l don't care who wins or loses.
But l am concerned about the Gestapo.
You have no idea what these people are capable of.
Like....
Like maybe force me to have sex with my brother?
Or something like that?
And maybe kill Bernie if he's not able to have sex with me?
And, then, maybe make me sleep with all of them... all 17 of them, hour after hour.
Quiet. Quiet.
Be still.
While you were listening to your Mozart... my mother and my father were marched... to the gas chamber where they were killed.
You want to tell me about the Gestapo?
Get out! Get out!
Be quiet.
-Get out!
-Quiet!
HeIIo, Midshipman EmiI Brinkmann... your father, GeneraI Franz Brinkmann, awarded the Knight's Cross with swords.
Engineer Mark Leicht, we hope you are Iistening.
Your brother, Major Martin Leicht awarded the Knight's Cross... after a daring bombing mission over Rostov on the Russian front.
HeIIo, Capt. RoIf MueIIer, on duty in the Far East... your son, Lt. KarI MueIIer... commanding a motor torpedo boat off the French coast... having sunk his fifth ship in the Iast three months... the Iatest, a soIo dayIight attack which sank the British vesseI Carapace... awarded the Knight's Cross.
-Wonderful.
-Congratulations, sir.
This is a great moment. lt's only fitting to say, sir, that everyone in your command feels honored.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Kruse.
Thank you.
The Carapace.
Let's see what's her tonnage. lt must be in the Talbot.
Congratulations, Captain. lt must be a proud moment.
Thank you, Mr. Keil.
Come in, gentlemen.
Congratulations, Captain.
-Congratulations.
-lt's wonderful.
-Carapace on Page 131, sir.
-To your health, sir.
-Good luck, Captain.
-And to your son.
To your health, sir.
He must be quite a seaman.
HeiI Hitler!
HeiI! HeiI!
Hail the Knight's Cross.
He's a crazy drunk.
HeiI!
-Half the ship can hear you.
-Can they?
Tell me about the consequences.
Tell me the consequences.
Read me the sentence.
What is the worst?
To fight war alongside you!
Milkereit... you poor fool.
Raised your voice against them.
You don't know about the consequences.
Wouldn't it be wonderful... if it turned out you're not an SS man at all?
Oh, they will turn you into one of them... into a cannibal.
The most wonderful, gentle boy....
HeiI cannibals!
HeiI!
HeiI!
Take your stations. Everybody.
Come with me.
Tell all the officers to assemble in the salon at once.
Yes, sir.
The point we spoke about. lt's here, and l need you as a witness.
Now, go on.
Things are falling apart.
Keil can't do it. l will.
Sure, he is on a spree, but he'll work it off. l've made this entry in the ship's diary.
''Capt. Mueller is mentally and physically irresponsible...
''due to alcoholic over-indulgence.''
Dr. Ambach will confirm this. l wouldn't take coke-head's diagnosis of a cockroach.
Mr. Branner, Mueller's illness is chronic.
He was drunk when his last ship was torpedoed. lt's hard to believe.
Mr. Keil?
Yeah. lt's unfortunate, but he is correct.
And under the circumstances, l think we must follow Mr. Kruse.
For the protection of the ship, l am now taking command. lnform your men. Dismissed.
Capt. Kruse?
Captain, it's for my health.
Mueller didn't understand this. l can't live without it. l'll see you get what you need, but it won't be morphine.
This one here was caught trying to sneak into the prisoners' hatch.
Really?
Well, perhaps that's where she prefers to be.
Take her down in the hold with the others.
Go ahead. l don't mean to interfere, but this is disgusting.
Thank you very much for your help, Mr. Keil.
Yeah.
-Steward?
-Yes, sir.
-l have been told that you are now--
-Correct. Here.
Sew the fourth stripe on the sleeve.
-lt's regulations.
-Yes, sir. lf this works out... l want a front row seat when we nail Kruse to the mast.
-Are the men ready?
-Yes.
They will be.
But suppose the girl can't persuade those prisoners?
Then l'll have to try to get down there when the watch changes... and persuade them myself.
All right, but that will be a while.
Suppose we believe this guy Keil.
What's his plan?
You start a fire down here.
Then you scream your lungs out.
You climb up the ladder, and when you get to the top... you yell, run, and scatter.
Are you kidding, lady?
They'll be waiting up there to shoot us full of holes.
No. The fire will confuse the guards, and Keil's men will overcome them.
Honey, you can't win a battle just by yelling. You need guns.
We'll get guns.
Guns, guns.
Where are they gonna get guns?
One of the officers is with us.
He'll attack the captain and take the keys to the ordnance room.
The whole stunt's cockeyed.
Let them try it alone.
They're outnumbered. lt's nine against 40.
So?
So we join them, huh?
And then it's only 2-to-1 against us.
That's enough.
Let's suppose we make this Keil circle.
We get a cup of coffee and a first class ticket to the Golden Gate.
-Then what?
-Then we get good and drunk.
Sleep for a month, huh?
Get a bath tub of beer.
We'll see if the girls are still at Shany's bar.
That's for me. l say aye.
Well, don't be such a hero.
You'll get a kiss and a drink and two weeks shore leave.
And after that, you'll be back on the frontlines again.
Swimming in burning oil and boiling like a mackerel. l say, let's vote on it. And l'm for it.
-l'm with you.
-Good man. What do you say? l'll go along, fellas.
-Okay.
-That's it. Come on, huh?
-All right, l'm in.
-Ten, huh?
-Against five.
-Majority rules.
-Yeah.
-The hell it does.
This ain't the Congress.
-Okay, man. Then we'll try it without you.
-The hell you will.
You blow this, and they'll kill us all.
That's not true.
Come on. Do you think those bastards will string you up... and serve us ice cream just because we laid off?
-Listen--
-Start a fire here... and they'll be damn sure every one of us is in on it.
He's right.
Look, l'm sorry.
We'd take the chance, you see... but it'd have to be all of us. l'd rather take my chances in a prison camp.
Hell, l'd like to take mine right here.
-You and me both.
-Sure.
Don't look so worried, baby.
We're all nice guys.
Sure.
You kept too much to yourself on the old BIue DoIphin. lf you'd spent a little time with us, you might have had some fun.
And, baby, we've got nothing but time from now on.
Are you kidding? Get your hands back.
There's one thing you're good for.
Stop it. Break it up.
You can have it if you want it.
And you.
Or you. Join the others.
Make them keep their word.
Make them keep it.
-Mr. Kruse?
-Yeah?
Sir, a radio message from Adm. Wendel.
Wendel?
Thank you. l'll handle the so-called Mr. Keil.
Milkereit! Milkereit!
Now you will kindly tell me what this is all about. l can start a new one now.
You see? lt's very nice.
Yes. Branner.
Fire! Fire!
Brandt, come with me.
Lutz, you cover them.
Donkeyman, the ordnance room.
Surrender!
All right! All right!
We give up here. Don't shoot.
We are finished.
Come up.
Up. Get in line.
All right.
Let's find the other two. Branner?
Mr. Branner, take the engine room.
Cornelson, the foredeck.
There is a rubber boat.
Midships.
We can heave it over the side and jump after it.
We'll disappear in two minutes.
Come on.
We can make it.
Why not?
Now l blow up the ship.
Do it.
Anybody seen my bird? l can't find him.
My baby hates the sound of guns.
Scares the feathers off him.
Where's Keil?
Where's Keil?
Keil?
Where's Keil?
Where's Keil?
He is hiding in the propeller shaft.
Move!
-Take the prisoners below.
-Yes, sir.
Search the lifeboats.
Capt. Mueller?
-So Adm. Wendel was right.
-Yeah.
But there is no time for this.
Why not?
-Your mutiny has failed.
-Not yet.
You once said that... the worst consequence would be to have to fight... alongside men like Kruse.
There is another way.
There is a rendezvous point where
American warships are waiting for us... at 14 degrees North, 175 degrees East.
You have a choice.
Whatever else l am, l'm not a traitor.
Neither was your son.
Get out. Get out.
Yeah, l will.
There! On the bridge!
Out! Get out!
Move!
No.
Mr. Keil, please, don't.
The engine room is torn to pieces.
She's flooding.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Here.
Over here.
But, sir, please--
Now l am where l belong. l intend to stay here.
Now over the side, all of you.
-Captain.
-Do as l say.
Mr. Kruse!
Over here!
Over here!
Here.
Come on, Mr. Kruse.
Over here.
Capt. Mueller.
Mr. Keil?
You won't need that raft for a while.
But what is it?
What's happened?
Well... the lard. lt solidified.
Plugged up the hole.
How much longer will we remain afloat?
Well, it's lasted two hours.
Maybe another two, maybe 10... unless we break up first.
Ten hours. ln what direction are we drifting?
We couldn't drift that far in days. lt would take a warship going full ahead a good six or seven hours.
Capt. Mueller... l don't suppose you would consider sending a radio message for me?
You're not very subtle, Mr. Keil.
But l must admire your courage.
You're the one with courage, Mueller. lt takes real courage... to see your son turn into a merciless fanatic... and still believe in your mildewed concepts of the fatherland. l envy you. l wish l had so much to believe in. lf you have nothing to believe in, why did you blow up the ship?
That doesn't matter now.

ENRICHED NUCLEAR FUEL
FUJI ASTRONAUTICAL FLIGHT CENTER
Don't jostle it.
Dr. Kato, everything's proceeding smoothly.
Glad to hear it.
That concludes point nine.
Our calculations show we'll land on Mars on schedule.
Telemetry information confirms that conclusion.
Captain Sano.
Our ultimate objective is to land on Mars.
All previous Mars missions have failed for unknown reasons.
The cause may have been UFOs - unidentified flying objects - that they encountered.
If that is so, where are they from?
Mars? Venus?
I'll put it simply:
Your job is to determine what's stopping us from reaching Mars.
Sadly, many of our best people died on those missions.
They'll be drifting through space forever.
Our finest scientific minds have designed a nuclear-powered spaceship.
But even this ship, the AAB-Gamma, may be no shield from dangers and difficulties.
Please be careful, and exercise good judgment.
Yes, sir.
Lisa.
As space biologist, your duty is to collect any unknown substances, but only with Captain Sano's express permission.
Dr. Shioda, you are to send daily reports on the crew's blood tests.
Signal Officer Miyamoto.
- Yes, sir?
As a precaution, transmit your call sign within two minutes after the capsule leaves the booster.
The enriched XTU249 nuclear fuel brought by Dr. Behrman has been successfully loaded onto your ship, which we have nicknamed the Astro-Boat.
Our geiger counters register no radiation on board, so have no fear as you carry out your mission.
Dr. Behrman, anything to add?
Astro-Boat crew,
the launch pad is ready.
One final word:
We have the utmost faith in our new rocket, but no matter what happens, human lives come first.
As scientists, this is our cardinal rule.
I pray for your success.
- Be careful.
- Thank you.
Astro-Boat crew,
board your vessel.
Lisa, your pulse meter shows your heart is racing.
I can almost hear it pounding.
Don't worry.
Yours is pounding even louder.
Miyamoto.
Worry about yourself, not the others.
Goodness! Why?
On our last mission, a certain someone talked up a storm without first remembering to turn the mic on.
Did you have to bring that up in front of the lady?
Some people!
- Initiate final check.
- All hands, commence final check.
- Nuclear fuel gauge.
- Check.
Oxygen pressure gauge.
Check.
Attitude stabilizer.
Check.
Escape velocity gauge.
Check.
Prepare for launch!
All crew in position!
T minus 10 seconds.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Blast off!
Five seconds to capsule separation.
Release!
Cabin oxygen pressure normal.
Hey!
Lisa!
Sorry about that.
You may now move about the cabin.
There's no better view of the earth.
It's beautiful.
That big green marble is our home.
Behrman, care for a smoke?
No, thanks.
I'll just have some coffee.
Previous missions couldn't have failed due to equipment malfunction alone.
Indeed. The cause must have been the UFOs.
First of all, radio signals died out immediately after the objects appeared, radio signals died out immediately after the objects appeared, suggesting a magnetic storm of some kind that would disable the ships' guidance systems.
Secondly, the instrument malfunctions were consistent with exposure to cosmic rays.
Are you saying the UFO unleashed magnetic storms and radioactive dust?
That's right.
Given current scientific knowledge, that's the best explanation available.
If the object appeared on a periodic basis, we could assume it was orbiting our solar system, but it appears irregularly, and only when our spaceships approach.
We must assume something is controlling it.
Yes... but is it being controlled from Mars, or is it perhaps a decoy satellite being controlled from somewhere on earth?
Sano, I've detected increased radioactivity.
The cosmic ray belt is especially wide this time.
Doctor, how are radioactivity levels on board?
I don't think we need to worry.
AAB-Gamma, come in, please.
What's that?
It's a UFO:
An unidentified flying object.
A flying saucer, huh?
So that's what's jamming our transmissions!
Looks like a half-cooked omelet!
It seems to be observing us.
It's matching our speed.
Doctor.
Dr. Shioda!
Doctor!
What's the matter?
Miyamoto, still no luck with mission control?
Hear for yourself.
I can't make out a word.
All right, speed up!
Everyone buckle up!
Lisa, we're moving in closer.
Sano, we should treat
Dr. Shioda first.
I'm the one who decides around here.
I'm pleading with you.
The doctor is ill.
Human life comes first.
He knows that!
Lisa, the doctor is a veteran astronaut.
Doctor...
Lisa, I'm a physician.
I know my own body better than anyone.
Lisa, back in your seat.
AAB-Gamma, this is FAFC.
AAB-Gamma, this is FAFC.
Come in, over.
FAFC, this is AAB-Gamma.
Come in, over.
The flying saucer has disappeared from our radar.
Do not pursue.
See to Dr. Shioda.
Make an emergency landing
on our moon base.
When you pick up
the lunar beacon,
Switch to guided approach mode.
- Roger.
This is Moon Base MSC.
Come in, AAB-Gamma.
This is Miyamoto
of AAB-Gamma. Go ahead.
Guided approach beacon is on.
You are cleared to land.
Lock on to the beacon signal.
Bearing is moon sector N53.
Roger.
Captain, Lisa.
Look, it's Michiko.
Hello there, Michiko.
How are you?
Please advise when you lock on
to the guidance control signal.
This is Moon Base MSC.
- You're on our radar, over.
- Roger.
Michiko, by the way - she seemed pretty ticked off.
Sano, did something happen between you two?
AAB-Gamma is coming in too fast, even for an emergency landing.
They should slow down or they'll overshoot the target.
Be a dear and tell them for me.
But that's your -
Fine! I'll call Earth.
They can tell them.
Doctor, here you go.
Wait your turn.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Here.
Thanks!
Prepare for landing.
Close the oxygen valve.
Depressurize the cabin.
Cabin pressure is zero, equalized with the exterior.
Fasten your seatbelts.
That was a close call.
- Long time no see.
- Thanks for coming.
You haven't changed.
- This is Michiko.
- How do you do?
Delighted to meet you.
Well, then, let's go!
The moon's a nice place.
Yes, much more charming than I imagined.
- Blood pressure?
- Normal.
My blood pressure and heart rate were abnormally high, and I was dying of thirst.
It's space sickness.
Your body couldn't adjust to the changes in pressure.
You'll be flne with a little rest in this controlled environment.
But we're leaving for Mars soon.
That's not my decision to make.
Wow, that's big!
So now you're raising apples on the moon?
Yes.
There's no atmosphere to block the sunlight, so they grow huge.
But they're bland compared to earth apples.
Beggars can't be choosers!
Michiko, I have something for you.
Earrings from germany.
They're gorgeous!
Thank you.
I checked everyone's belongings.
You snuck those past me.
- I'm sorry.
But I thought Michiko would like them.
It's okay, isn't it?
But I thought Michiko would like them.
It's okay, isn't it?
Isn't it?
At least here we get a chance to bathe.
I didn't know there was so much water on the moon.
There's no water on the moon.
It's artificial.
- Same thing.
- No, it's not.
It's synthesized from the oxygen and hydrogen in moon rocks.
It's not natural.
It's synthetic.
Therefore it's completely pure.
Not polluted, like some people.
That's a cheap shot.
You jerk! That's hot!
How was your trip?
It was such fun.
Mr. Sano was so nice.
He was?
Then there's nothing to worry about on the trip to Mars.
That's right.
I'd follow Sano anywhere, no matter how long or hard the journey.
This is groovy!
I can't believe we're on the moon.
But this is no place to settle down.
Man's place is on earth.
You complain wherever you are, don't you, Dr. Stein?
Of course.
If humanity grows complacent, it's finished.
Please sit down.
What'll it be?
- Cognac.
- Me too.
- All right.
Earth needs to send a replacement for Dr. Shioda.
That's for FAFC to decide.
Orders from FAFC:
Dr. Shioda will be replaced by Dr. Stein.
It's not my job to go all the way to Mars!
But you're the one who declared me physically unfit for space travel.
- That has nothing to do with this.
- Dr. Stein.
Our job is to follow
FAFC's orders.
May I have this dance?
Lisa, good night.
How about dancing with me?
Okay.
I don't care if it's an order.
Mars?
Are they kidding?
I should be back on earth with my wife.
Come on, cheer up.
- Take care of yourself.
- I should say the same.
- Look after him.
- Bye.
Our data suggest there are many aliens and asteroids between here and Mars, so be careful.
Understood.
- Take care of yourselves.
- Thanks.
Bye, Michiko.
- Good-bye.
Hey, Miyamoto!
Leaving already?
See you guys later!
Keep your spirits up!
Finally.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Again?
The same space rations every day.
Dr. Stein, you can't be picky on a spaceship.
You could at least vary the menu a bit.
I'm a scientist, not a cook.
Excuse me!
If Dr. Shioda hadn't suddenly fallen ill,
I'd be on earth now, eating tasty food with my beloved wife.
Am I right?
Why did this have to happen to me?
What did I do to deserve this?
Muzzle it!
- At least let me talk.
- Quiet!
You hear that?
Asteroids!
Small asteroids are hitting the ship.
Keep calm!
Full speed ahead in the same direction as the asteroids.
Tell mission control we're changing course.
Helmets on!
- Lisa, close your helmet!
- I can't!
Lisa, are you okay?
Stein, close the oxygen valve!
Miyamoto, I can't do it, help!
- Doctor!
- Miyamoto!
Something's definitely wrong.
Sir, a call from the moon base.
We've lost contact with AAB-Gamma.
What about you?
Still no reply.
Radar shows them far off course.
There's also heavy radio interference.
Keep tracking them.
Advise if you make contact.
Roger.
They'll soon enter the region where past missions met their untimely ends.
I hope nothing happens.
If it does, we can only assume some unknown power is blocking our entry into martian airspace.
Repairs are complete.
Miyamoto, main lights on.
Sano.
It's back!
Quick, let's get away!
All right.
I'm speeding up!
We're being pulled in.
Why'd you cut the engine?
They'll pull us in even faster.
It's a waste of fuel.
We won't have enough to get back.
Don't stop the engine.
We have to get away!
It's hopeless.
Their tractor beam is too strong.
Better to watch and wait than waste our fuel.
That's suicide! That's how previous ships were destroyed!
I'm gonna throttle it!
- Stein, don't!
Stein, don't!
Stein, stop it!
- I'm getting us out of here!
- Stop it!
Something's definitely wrong.
Please send a rescue rocket.
I'll go.
But what if we send a rescue rocket and it winds up like the Astro-Boat?
I won't let any more lives be sacrificed.
Sacrificed?
Captain Sano, sacrificed?
Doctor stein, please read the nuclear fuel gauge.
Yes, sir.
- Lisa, check the main thrusters,
- yes, sir.
Sano, energy output has dropped more than half.
How can that be?
Miyamoto, still no luck wlth the radio?
- Give me a bit longer.
Sano, come here!
What's that?
Sano, please don't!
It's dangerous out there.
Sano, she's right.
Wait until we know what's going on.
- I'm going too.
- You fix the radio and contact base.
- I'm going with you.
- No.
I'm going.
Lisa, are you sure?
I can at least try.
FAFC, this is AAB-Gamma.
Come in!
- Good work.
- What was it?
FAFC, this is AAB-Gamma.
AAB-Gamma, come in please.
The flying saucer emitted
clouds of vapor in our direction
and then flew towards Mars.
The reactor is only at half power
for some reason we can't accelerate,
even at full thrust.
We're in possession
of a mysterlous luminous object.
Our navigatinal instruments
are disabled.
We can't determine
our present position.
How's the crew?
Lisa, Miyamot, Stein, and Sano
are all unharmed.
The UFO's powerful
magnetlc field and radiation
seem responsible
for your ship's condition.
Remain as you are
and wait for the rescue rocket.
Keep the luminous object
in a sealed vacuum container.
Roger.
Moon Base MSC, come in.
This is Moon Base MSC.
It's Michiko!
Launch a rescue rocket
with replacement XTU fuel immediately.
Follow our designated flight path.
Roger.
Now I'll finally see my wife.
- And I'll get to eat earth food.
- Let's wait for that rocket.
Doctor... that luminous object they found - what could it be?
Any ideas?
None whatsoever.
I've never seen accounts of such a thing.
Surely it came from the UFO.
That's very possible.
Michiko!
Lisa! Thank goodness!
Thanks for coming.
Now let's replace that fuel.
Since it was collected in a vacuum, it must be observed in one.
That's probably best.
After all, we know nothing about it.
But our observations won't be complete unless we expose it to our atmosphere.
Hey, research is fun and all, but you gotta rest sometime.
He's right.
Let's call it a day.
Let's have a party at my house to celebrate your safe return.
Good idea.
I expected a cold reception after we failed to land on Mars.
Not at all.
This object in itself is a gift to science.
Let's go.
You were in a lot of danger.
I'm glad I fell ill.
Dr. Shioda,
I'll follow your example and come down with space sickness too!
Dr. Kato!
The center's research laboratory is calling.
Kato speaking.
What?
The lab was ransacked?
And the alien object?
The container and table were wrecked, and there's a hole in the floor.
I'll be right there.
Doctor, what happened?
I'm going too.
It burned its way through.
It takes a lot of heat to burn through such material.
Laser rays.
Quite possibly.
At least we still have the rock's insulating material.
Who knows when we'd find another such specimen.
That's right.
Give me the tongs.
Put it in here.
Sir.
That's a strange indentation.
Looks just like a chicken's claw print.
That means the luminous rock burned through the iron table, then through the floor, and entered the earth.
An extraterrestrial may have been hiding inside.
Assuming that's the case, where did it go after going into that hole?
Voltage is plummeting.
Any problems with the generators?
None at all?
That's odd.
That just can't be.
How about a nightcap?
Sounds good.
What do you all say?
- What's going on?
- That's strange.
What's up?
I'm sorry. We've been having blackouts the past few days.
We'll check on it right away.
What's wrong?
Captain Sano, what's that?
See? Beyond that hill.
Let's get out of here!
Look! What's that?
It's just like the claw print in the lab.
You're right.
Let's get back.
Come on.
On the right is the print left in our laboratory.
On the left is the print left by the monster on Hakone.
Our analysis suggests these two are one and the same.
The monster is now on a rampage, headed for Tokyo.
It must not enter Tokyo!
We doubt whether our present arsenal can actually stop this monster.
Dr. Kato, isn't there a scientific solution?
Not at the moment, unfortunately.
This is the material cast off by the alien.
And this is the substance that clung to our rocket engine.
Our analysis clearly shows the two are identical in chemical composition.
This substance may therefore contain the secret to combating this "Guilala."
"Guilala" is what we've decided to name the monster.
Space monster Guilala.
200 feet tall and weighing 15,000 tons can the cosmic substance subdue Guilala?
World anxiously awaits analysis of spores.
Lisa, how does it look?
Discover anything yet?
The function of the substance is still a mystery.
It seems to have been formed within a supernova.
The vacuum of space made it condense rapidly and take on a complex organic molecular structure, forming Guilala and his luminous shell.
If the substance can reflect and contain enormous amounts of energy, then Guilala's shell must be able to do the same.
If we want to synthesize the substance, we have to do it in a complete vacuum - the surface of the moon, for example.
I see.
Lisa, you must go to the moon.
We have to hurry.
Guilala's wreaking havoc across japan.
This substance just may stop him.
Captain.
If you're going, so am I.
Me too.
Alert! Defense personnel
assemble immediately.
- How's it look up there?
- Ginza and Shinjuku were wiped out.
Report from sector one.
Good.
What's the latest?
- Tatebayashi's been destroyed.
- And the monster's condition?
Guilala's dorsal fin is glowing less brightly.
He must be losing energy.
- He's used most of it up.
- Looks that way.
This is our chance to kill him.
But if he's hungry, he might become even more destructive.
This is FAFC.
Lisa, how are the experiments with the Guilalanium?
We were able to synthesize it here on the moon.
We've also discovered ample Guilalanium in the lunar ore.
What are its attributes?
It can reflect all types of cosmic rays, including intense heat energy.
Roger. Bring us a large quantity, and fast.
Roger.
If we smother Guilala with Guilalanium, he will cease absorbing energy and probably weaken.
Would you agree?
Indeed.
Some suggest we use the bomb, but our allies have cold feet.
Some suggest we use the bomb, but our allies have cold feet.
America in particular doesn't want to drop another A-bomb on japan.
I share that sentiment.
FAFC, this is AAB-Gamma.
Come in, please.
We're returning with the Guilalanium on board.
Still no contact?
The radio's working, but something's jamming the signal.
It's that darn flying saucer again!
No, it's not.
This is odd.
They're out of the flying saucer's range.
It's impossible to know when they'll arrive.
We must stop Guilala as soon as possible.
Must be an electronic malfunction.
Lisa, check the computer.
Yes, sir.
Sano! I've got it.
This is the cause right here.
Bring me that.
Roger.
Northwest Tochigi Prefecture.
Command center here.
Commander, phone call.
Commanding officer speaking.
So you don't know when the Guilalanium will arrive?
We're unable to track
AAB-Gamma's current position.
The monster's growing more violent.
He's heading north to northern Kanto, near Lake Inawashiro.
The damage continues to mount.
We can only have faith in Captain Sano and pray they return quickly.
What do we do now?
I don't know.
We may wind up orbiting the sun forever.
Or the earth may pull us into its orbit.
Wouldn't that help our chances?
It'd take years for earth to pull us in that close.
Can't we lessen the Guilalanium's reflectivity?
We'd have to find some kind of shield and place it inside that.
But how?
What about the nuclear reactor?
It has thick walls built to seal in radioactivity.
Good idea.
But a dangerous one.
The Guilalanium could cause the reactor to overheat:
It could explode in an instant.
Are you prepared to take that chance?
What if it's the only way?
Let's do it!
All right.
After destroying
Inawashiro Dam,
Guilala is now heading for the Pacific coast.
Commander, it's from FAFC.
What?
It destroyed the atomic research center and power plant?
It absorbed all the atomic energy and is stronger than ever?
It's turned into a ball of energy, bouncing from place to place.
It bounced from Matsudo to Tokyo and is now headed west.
What?
Guilala's headed this way?
Isn't the Astro-Boat back yet?
We could really use that Guilalanium right now.
I'm sure Sano and his crew are doing their best.
Guilala's surely looking for more energy.
Then there's a good chance he's coming this way.
You're right.
We just completed the storage unit for your XTU nuclear fuel.
Sir, we've made contact with AAB-Gamma.
AAB-Gamma, we're defenseless against Guilala.
We eagerly await your return.
Please deliver the Guilalanium as soon as possible.
Roger.
We're headlng dlrectly...
AAB-Gamma, come in.
This is FAFC.
It's back!
Damn it!
Persistent creeps!
What a nuisance!
They're never satisfied.
We have to deliver this Guilalanium fast.
Full power ahead.
Everyone buckle up.
Hurry!
Damn it!
It's coming back!
Dr. Kato,
Guilala is approaching FAFC.
You're in danger.
We can't wait for the Astro-Boat.
Prepare to evacuate.
Very well.
But I can't leave until the Astro-Boat returns.
I understand.
But Guilala will surely destroy FAFC before then.
Attention:
All personnel except Astro-Boat landing crew, evacuate immediately.
Guilala is coming this way.
Dr. Kato, it's from the Astro-Boat.
This is AAB-Gamma.
Come in, FAFC.
This is FAFC, over.
We've evaded the UFO and are now commencing reentry.
The Astro-Boat's returned?
Yes, all planes are ready to scramble.
Get the Guilalanium here pronto!
Let's evacuate.
Guilala is coming for the XTU.
But if he consumes it, he can do even more damage.
Let's get it out of here.
- Can you do it?
- We can try.
All right.
Hurry up!
Captain Sano!
What is it?
- It's Lisa!
- What happened?
The lab exploded.
She's stuck under debris.
What?
What was she doing there?
She went back for some research data.
Let's go! Take this.
Help me!
What happened?
My legs!
I can't pull my legs out!
- Use that beam!
- Where?
She's pinned!
Are you all right?
Other side.
Add another beam.
Find another one!
Damn it!
It's coming this way! he's always drawn to energy.
Dr. Behrman, let's use the fuel as bait to lure Guilala away from the lab.
That's a risky gambit.
Miyamoto, let's go!
Left. Stop.
Man, it's really gotten huge!
Hurry!
Go!
Miyamoto, you okay?
Floor it!
Faster!
Faster!
Okay, we can get out.
We have to hurry.
Careful.
Are you all right?
Everyone in?
Captain Sano and Signal Officer Miyamoto risked their lives to lead Guilala away from FAFC.
But the monster has absorbed the enriched nuclear fuel and is returning to FAFC in search of more energy.
Our last hope for stopping Guilala rests in your courage and unexcelled airmanship.
You must quickly spray the monster with Guilalanium, thus blocking its ability to absorb energy.
Eighth fighter squadron, loaded with Guilalanium!
Very good.
Launch your attack!
Yes, sir.
Present arms!
Ground chief.
Load the remaining squadrons with Guilalanium.
Yes, sir.
- Are you okay?
- Damn! I think I sprained my ankle.
We're coming!
It's too dangerous for you here!
Try to hold on.
See what you can do for him.
Are you all right?
Give me a handkerchief.
Hasn't the air force launched yet?
Not yet.
There they are!
No effect yet.
Be patient, Doctor.
Sir!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
In the car, quick.
Look!
Guilala's dying.
He's shrinking.
Lisa, please step away.
- May I have the container?
- Give it here.
Guilala can't be destroyed here on earth.
If he manages to slough off the Guilalanium, he could reemerge as strong as before.
We have to get rid of him somehow.
Let's send him back into space.
Back where he came from.
Three... two... one...
Blast off!
Have you told Sano how you really feel?
Love takes courage.
Yes.
You're right.
Guilala taught me an important lesson.
Thanks to him,
I now realize... that there's somebody else who loves Sano with all her heart.
You know...
I wonder where Guilala is going.
Someplace many biilions of light-years away.
He'll wander through space forever.
Captain Sano?
Never mind.
Beyond the moon and stars
to the far ends of the sky
with no final destination
in this infinite world
how small, how small
two people can be
how small, how small
two people can be
The End
A wedding in Germany
Fallingbostel, May 1969
Dear children, even though your stomachs are full, you can stand a little speech.
Thirty years ago, when your mother and I married, the sky was blue, but dark clouds were already looming on the horizon:
The clouds of World War Two.
All of us gathered here today hope with all our hearts that you be spared such suffering.
Clermont-Ferrand: 134,000 residents in the Puy-de-Dôme region.
The capital of Auvergne is 240 miles from Paris and 37 miles from Vichy, which was the capital of France from 1940 to 1944.
Gergovie, a nearby Gallic town, used to be the fortified town of Vercingétorix, conquered by Julius Caesar.
A father tells his children about a more recent defeat.
In 1939, I was 27 years old.
I was the father of a large family, so I hadn't been sent to the front.
The front was the Maginot Line.
I'd been sent to Montferrand, near Clermont, and my wife's dairywoman, Mrs. Michel, had criticized me for not going to the front.
So after the rout,
I told her that there was no point in me going to the front, since the front came to me.
Was there anything other than courage in the Resistance?
Of course. But the two emotions
I experienced the most frequently were sorrow and pity.
The Colonel was a French Action man, the Major was a moderate.
The Captain was all for the diocese, the Lieutenant couldn't stand the church.
THE SORROW AND THE PITY
Chronicle of a French city under the Occupation
All these men made excellent Frenchmen.
Excellent soldiers who march in time.
Thinking that the Republic is still the best thing going.
Now most of these strapping lads don't share the same political views.
But they all agree, no matter what their view...
Part 1: THE COLLAPSE
Two brothers, both local farmers, live a few miles from Clermont.
They have many memories of German occupation.
Is that your village?
That's where I was born.
I was born near that church there, and later I lived on the farm facing the school.
You can't help but love your country.
Did you think about it in Buchenwald?
Not much.
– You didn't?
– No.
– What did you think about?
– Surviving. That's it.
That's mainly what I thought about.
But I'm talking about me, about how I saw things.
I'm not talking about those who...
There were some people who cried.
When I saw them cry,
I knew that they would never make it.
No way.
You had to think about yourself first.
And think about others after.
This politician also has reasons to remember.
For me, it was an experience that I will never forget.
This experience may have had a few secondary effects, but I don't believe it has affected my attitude or behavior.
Has it not made you feel bitter towards certain French people?
No, I wouldn't say that.
It showed me that there are certain tendencies and habits, which, when they are fired, fed, or stimulated, crop up like weeds, and so we must always be on the defense.
We have to protect our youth from this type of propaganda.
We have to talk to them about it more than we talked about it a generation or two ago.
The manager of the Philips company also has reasons to remember.
As I was saying, his friends would ask me why I joined the Resistance.
Why? Because going into a restaurant and seeing Germans at a table, and being told there's only four steaks left for the Germans and none for us was a little frustrating, seeing as that steak came from our cows in Auvergne.
So it was our right to eat it before giving it away.
That's my first reason.
My second reason was that the Germans were forever imposing curfews.
It was, after all, a Nazi regime, a totalitarian regime, no matter how you look at it.
It was worth fighting for, it was even worth dying for, rather than to live as slaves. Hence, the Resistance.
Lasting peace is what we need.
There's nothing dumber than fighting.
That's what I think.
– Depends on what you're fighting for.
– Do you think they really knew?
– They didn't know?
– I doubt it.
There are a few fanatics who know why.
– Did you know why?
– Yes, I did.
– But you weren't a fanatic?
– No, but...
But when I went off to war in 1940...
I left in 1939, on September 2, and I was sent to Modane.
What could I have done?
I knew nothing. I was going to kill guys I'd never seen before, who had never harmed me.
Later, they did harm us when they arrived in France. They messed us up.
Even in moments of calm, the soldiers are ready to fight.
Faced with the enemy, they have the winning qualities of patience, courage, vigilance, determination, and confidence.
In right-thinking circles, in high society in Paris, they sympathized with our soldiers, whose troubles were unfortunately nothing compared to what came later.
And consequently, during this period, people sought to distract them, to entertain them, to relieve them from the boredom of the Maginot Line, where time passed at a snail's pace.
It must've been painfully boring.
So the right-thinking women of the Parisian bourgeoisie decided to form a committee to entertain our valiant soldiers, to provide them with a more pleasant view.
The idea was to plant rosebushes on the Maginot Line, to make it look prettier, to create a nicer atmosphere.
And there were people who donated money towards these rosebushes, so that our soldiers didn't have to look at the horrid, concrete walls, and to give them a flowery environment in which to live.
It's pathetic when you think about the awful things that came later.
The infantry is advancing at great intervals.
In Oisemont, the enemy has set fire to the tanks of an oil factory.
It took two weeks in Poland.
We felt it would be just as quick in France, as we were anxious to go home.
And, indeed, we took France in just one month.
And onwards it goes. Next stop: Paris.
Naturally, we attacked on several occasions, but the hardest time was in Oing, on the Belgian border.
The Belgian blockhaus weren't ready, but we had to take position in them.
The Germans arrived equipped with tanks.
All that we had were machine guns.
They proceeded to kill everyone inside, because it made such an easy target.
There were no battlements.
They hadn't even put up reinforced doors.
I'm telling you, we walked...
We withdrew, and we must have walked at least 20 miles, without running across any troops.
Not one single troop.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
First of all, I'd like to emphasize the fact that the German staff was not expecting to achieve such a quick, resounding success.
We soldiers, unlike Hitler, were convinced that we were facing the same adversary as in 1914-1918, a determined, brave adversary, prepared to fight to the bitter end.
Unfortunately, I must admit that Hitler was right in this case.
He was always saying how the French were incapable of repeating their performance in World War I, and he never missed an opportunity to add to this statement a few disagreeable and derisory remarks or comments on the general emotional and moral state of France.
GERMAN NEWS
Near Noyon, General Stummel, taking the vanguard with his troops, with his adjutant, took several prisoners.
It began with two.
Later, many others surrendered.
The prisoners come from every nation and every walk of life.
So-called defenders of the great nation.
In fact, a shame for the white race.
These are the Black brothers of the French.
In the words of Chamberlain,
“We, together with our allies, are the guardians of civilization.”
“Together we fight medieval barbarism.”
These are the guardians of civilization.
These are the barbarians.
This is the war of the Franco-English plutocrats.
They began this war rashly without taking any heed of the consequences, to fight for the English lords, not only until the last Frenchman, but until the last French house.
Mrs. Tausend, you stayed in Germany.
Did you read the papers?
Did you watch the German news?
Yes, we followed the events closely.
Naturally, we were a bit frightened.
But the news of victory made us happy.
These cars are stopped for a lack of gas.
The Jewish warmongers and Parisian plutocrats, with their suitcases full of gold and precious stones, have fled.
This shortage of gas put a crimp in their plans.
The streets were hopelessly blocked.
Yet these English-loving traitors and deserters continued their journey on foot.
These are the French people who have been mercilessly evacuated and dragged along in the flood of the routed French army.
Soon, these people will be able to go home.
The German people were spared such a trial, thanks to the Führer and his German soldiers.
During that time, there was an enormous upsurge of the people, who were completely panicked, terrified.
Fate willed that I should be given leave in the last few days of the month April.
Consequently, I was in Paris in early May when the Germans invaded.
On the roads, people were going mad, terrified by the bombings.
With them, they brought what they could:
Children, pets, precious objects...
Some rode on wagons, others on bicycles.
It was a mish-mash of everything and everyone. It was awful to see.
It was all the more awful in that the Germans, in an effort to block and ruin the roads for the soldiers didn't hesitate in bombing these columns of refugees.
As a result, and I can attest to this fact, that there were bodies strewn all over the place: Men, women, horses.
Car wrecks sprinkled the roads.
It was a scene from hell.
And yet this wave, this flood of people, continued to move south.
Our impressions?
We saw destroyed villages, burned lands...
It did have a certain effect on us.
– And the people on the roads?
– They were fleeing the bad guys.
What do you mean?
Weren't you the bad guys?
At first, we were seen as the enemy who was set to destroy the country.
Then they began to see that we just wanted to help.
And that reassured them.
The officers or the staff were clearly out of their depth.
Having the trains, the roads, and all telecommunications cut off led to a situation in which any plans the soldiers had made were suddenly completely ruined.
In addition, certain military circles shared the attitude of many civilians, and tackled the war unenthusiastically.
After all, they were living in...
I'm not saying they were traitors.
In any case, there were very few traitors.
But this attitude of preferring Hitler to Léon Blum was an attitude that had become very popular in bourgeois circles.
And this was a circle to which many of the soldiers belonged.
THE GREAT BATTLE OF FRANCE
On June 14, 1940, the Germans occupied Paris.
In Clermont, the papers went mad.
Le Moniteur took a stand, asking the people to stand up and fight, to resist, to remain free.
The owner of this anti-defeatist paper,
Pierre Laval, a deputy for Auvergne, was, at the same time, preparing for surrender.
The last government of the Third Republic slowly moved southwards.
Paul Reynaud wanted to keep fighting, but Philippe Pétain was already taking charge.
In Briare,
Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden met with their allies for the last time.
I've always felt that Reynaud wanted to continue, that he remained calm and firm.
Everyone was in a very difficult position then.
I also believe, and this is something he told both Churchill and me, that he wasn't very happy having Pétain as a part of his government.
– He'd foreseen the difficulties?
– Yes, already in Briare.
Now, I was a young soldier in World War I, and for me, Pétain was the hero of Verdun.
But his character had changed.
That's to be expected with age.
I'm sure he was opposed to the idea of your cities being destroyed, because he spoke of it at dinner, saying, “It's awful seeing our lovely cities destroyed.”
And I had to answer, “Yes, I understand.
“It's hard for an Englishman to say this, but there are worse things
“than the destruction of cities.”
But I don't think he was convinced.
We flew over France at a very low altitude.
– Hedgehopping?
– Yes.
In June, there's nothing quite like the Norman and Breton countryside.
And I remember, as if it only happened yesterday,
I remember thinking it was lovely, but would I ever see it again?
And it seemed rather unlikely that I would.
Then the political climate changed and became unbearable in Bordeaux.
Suddenly, treason was everywhere.
There was a will to surrender, and a desire to get along with the victors at any price.
Anglophobia, ever-present in France, resurfaced with new vigor.
And all this went hand in hand with a horrible kind of cynicism.
The military leaders, the ones who had messed up, weren't even mentioned.
Instead, people blamed absolutely everything on Léon Blum, the Front Populaire and so forth.
And so we consoled ourselves for the downfall of our nation by getting petty revenge in matters of internal affairs, a trend which, as you know, continued long afterwards.
On June 16, the government met in Bordeaux.
Paul Reynaud was defeated by the deputies who refused to leave France and Pétain became the head of government.
Adolf Hitler's elite S.S. Troops have invaded Vichy.
I felt terribly humiliated, as I had been sent on a mission on an English motorcycle and was heading to Paris, when I saw the Germans going the other way.
Now, being rather absent-minded,
I saw there were some people following these German troops, and assumed it was the English.
So they were going one way, and I was going the other.
I saw the swastikas on their helmets, and I thought I should go no further.
But no one asked me to stop.
Everyone was too busy going their own way.
If I didn't like it, tough.
The Resistance in Clermont was quickly crushed.
But the struggle, albeit subdued, continued.
Hitler's S.S. Division conquered Clermont-Ferrand.
German troops occupied the city for three days.
Zepp Dietrich, division commander, declared victory on Jaude Square, as his troops polished their boots in front of the locals, before heading off to new victories.
The Germans didn't return to Clermont until November 1942.
Our aim now is to take the arms depot in Etienne.
An entire infantry regiment has simply surrendered.
At first, I did the same as everyone.
I hadn't understood.
On the morning of June 24, the lieutenant declared that
Marshal Pétain had requested an armistice.
I knew what he meant by armistice, but I wasn't sure about “Marshal.”
I was never particularly in favor of Pétain's regime.
Nonetheless, like the other 40,000,000 Frenchmen who experienced that same moment, when I saw the rout, when I saw that the Germans were in Biarritz, and that France had been completely invaded,
I thought, like everyone else,
“Will anyone be able to end this massacre?”
People of France, as requested by the President of the Republic,
I shall henceforth be the leader of the French government.
Convinced of the affection of our admirable army,
whose heroism stands as testimony to our long military tradition
as they fight an enemy which outnumbers them,
convinced that our army's resistance
has fulfilled our duty towards our allies,
convinced of the support pledged by the former soldiers I led,
convinced of the French people's faith in me,
I give France the gift of myself,
to ease its troubles.
In these difficult times,
I think of the poor refugees,
who, in the depths of despair, trudge across our roads.
I extend my compassion and concern for them.
My heart is heavy as I tell you today that the fight must end.
Last night, I spoke with our adversary
and asked if they were prepared to help me, between soldiers,
after the fight, with honor intact,
to find a way to end the hostilities.
From the Führer headquarters a historical piece of news:
The prime minister of the new French government, Pétain has declared, in a broadcast to the French people, that France should lay down its arms.
Of course, I was happy to hear we'd won.
The defeat gave me the same feeling
I would get when I played rugby.
I don't like losing, especially when it's 60 to 0.
I hate drawn-out defeats.
This stone is a reminder of the humiliation of Germany on November 11, 1918.
Is it true that France had given England its word of honor that it wouldn't agree to a separate truce?
I think we... That was before
I was a member of government.
I think we had reached an agreement whereby neither party would cease fighting.
– Without the other party's consent.
– Right.
But we didn't discuss that at all when Churchill and I were there, because we accepted the position France had taken.
– In Briare, he said...
– That he'd accept an armistice?
No, he said we accepted the fact that you may not be able to go on.
Nothing was said about an armistice.
It's clear that between a ceasefire and an armistice, there's a big difference.
Exactly.
He simply said, “We understand that you cannot go on any longer.”
That was clear.
The question was quite simply,
“What are you going to do?”
I even sent Churchill a short letter after we returned from Briare, which has since been published, saying that we must make a clear distinction.
If the French can no longer fight, that's one thing.
But if they make it easy for the enemy, that's another.
La Madeleine. Early today in Paris, the Führer made an unexpected visit.
During his tour of Paris, he also visited this building.
Place de la Concorde.
The Arc de Triomphe.
Trocadéro.
A look at the Eiffel Tower.
On the Führer's left, Professor Speer.
One thing we should remember is that when France agreed to an armistice, even though we didn't want to lose, how many Frenchmen said,
“All's well that ends well.
So much the better.”
As for Marshal Pétain, he knew what he was doing in Vichy.
In every canton and every town, he formed what was called the French Legion.
– The Legion of Companions.
– It was meant for us veterans who'd fought in World War I.
Everyone, except me, went on Sundays.
I'm the only one who never set foot in there.
It's true.
They would attend the raising of the colors on the market place every Sunday, wearing their hammer and sickle. No, not hammer.
I don't mean the hammer and sickle.
What was it called again?
– The sword.
– Whatever.
They'd all been given a beret.
Can you imagine?
Of course, I never set foot there.
Not on your life.
But when I saw what happened,
I understood.
So suddenly, this old marshal suggests an armistice with French honor intact and so forth.
As a young Frenchman, do you feel the defeat was justified?
Does it not disgust you?
No, defeat was the inevitable consequence of French politics.
In fact, this was the theme propagated by the Vichy government.
If we were defeated, they claimed, it was because for so many years, we had to put up with party politics, which is the reason
France is in this situation today.
How did that phrase go?
“The parties which have harmed us so much...”
It was... No, that's not it.
– Something about lies.
– The lies that harmed us.
Right. “I hate the lies that have harmed us so much.”
At the same time, there was another appeal launched by de Gaulle, an appeal which apparently very few people in France heard.
I certainly didn't hear it.
But as a pilot, weren't you slightly tempted to...
I imagine that a certain number of people in the same unit as you chose to “continue the struggle,” as they said.
There weren't many who did.
Let's get it straight.
It's true that some people attempted to flee to North Africa.
Later, the situation stabilized.
Not so many fled.
Did it ever cross your mind to flee?
Of course.
But I didn't think about it for long.
My father quickly made me understand that Marshal Pétain guaranteed a new order, renewed honor, etc.
The victor of Verdun guaranteed
France's honor and the establishment of a new order.
This seemed not only desirable, but necessary, to many Frenchmen.
They respected and had faith in the Marshal.
In Clermont, the spirit of renewal filled
Pierre Laval's Le Moniteur.
Editorials sought those responsible for defeat and found them.
“Let's be French.
“Too much foreign influence has led to many problems.”
On June 26, 1940, in the magistrate's court,
René Mons was sentenced to three months in jail for defeatism.
Editorial.
We demand that those responsible be tried and an analysis of our problems ensue.
This quickly led to xenophobia,
Anglophobia and anti-Semitism.
Gaining French nationality became harder.
Vichy came out with the decree:
“The French elite must be restored.”
On that day, July 29, 1940,
Clermont butcher Antoine Labronne was tried and given a large fine for having sold rotting ham.
Did you ever speak about what the papers said back then?
– Never.
– Never?
We were totally cut off from the world, because there was one value that we all shared, and that was caution.
We didn't know what the butcher thought, or the milkman, or the engineer or the intellectual.
We had no idea.
Like everyone else, we stayed on our guard.
What do you think people's main concern was back then?
Food.
That took up most of your time?
Definitely.
Animals were illicitly butchered.
One needed a bit of meat to survive.
As you know, the French are very good at cheating.
One had to have a bit more bread than the usual ration, or a bit more tobacco by smiling nicely at the tobacconist.
A bit more of everything.
So every weekend, a regular parade of cyclists would go for supplies.
They had devised a system based on tickets, on ration cards.
Personally, I was a smoker, and it was awful not having cigarettes.
It was a horrible situation.
People would do anything, even steal.
I got so desperate that I even rolled artichoke leaves and smoked them.
The children who were born during that time, between 1942 and 1944, should have suffered from rickets, and I say this as a doctor.
In our family, it was ironic.
These young ladies have a brother, who is 27 years old, and was born in 1942.
He's six foot one!
We fed him so much to avoid rickets that he turned into a giant.
He's a great tennis player, an architect, and a giant to boot.
Are you what they call “a bourgeois” in a large provincial town?
If being bourgeois means eating properly, hunting in Sologne, having a hunting ground in Sanscoin and in Sérye, and a son-in-law who owns Lake Montciniére, then I'm a bourgeois.
When did you first begin to experience the consequences of the times, in other words, persecution?
How did you feel about that?
Did anything happen?
Not before 1942.
The only extraordinary event that occurred is that before the children were born, once again, in September 1942, the hunting season was re-opened.
What an event.
It was important to the hunters.
Game had been untouched for two years so there was an abundance of it.
It was a very satisfying experience for those who owned a gun.
In their little nests in the backyard, my little rabbits are so sweet.
Until recently, I hated hutches, and I despised and insulted our gentle little friends, now the center of our attention.
Just think, a rabbit!
Firstly, it will delight the cook.
And as its skin dries in the wind, the whole family rejoices.
Follow my example and give rabbit breeding a try.
As you can see, I love, you love, we all love rabbits in every form!
In reality, the French aren't normally very involved in politics.
Once in a blue moon, they decide to take action and storm the Bastille, or to fight religious wars for 50 years, or to initiate the French Revolution, or to set off to conquer Europe.
But, normally speaking, they're just as peaceable as anyone else.
One thing is for sure:
The French, in general, like a peaceful regime, a regime which has authority, but is preferably humane.
In any case, they feel the need to be protected.
They're quite paternalistic.
Does this explains Pétain's popularity?
Definitely. I might add that, as a sergeant in the French army,
I've seen a routed army.
And it's not a pretty sight.
There's no denying that, for some time,
Pétain was extremely popular.
He was viewed as one of the good old guys, perhaps a bit senile, but after all, he had given himself to France.
That was a clever way of putting it.
He gave the gift of himself.
So everyone thought that an old guy like him couldn't do any harm.
He could only help France.
At his age, what harm could he do?
These arguments, albeit feeble, were how people justified Pétain.
THE MARSHAL'S VISIT
I missed Mers-el-Kébir.
I only heard about what happened two weeks later.
I never understood Mers-el-Kébir.
Even now, having read many books on the subject of Mers-el-Kébir,
I still don't understand.
It was always a mystery to me.
Mers-el-Kébir was a mystery indeed.
Do you mean you don't understand why the English did what they did?
No, I never really understood the English.
After leaving Churchill,
I was a member in the House of Commons,
I went to the House of Commons, got my car, and drove myself through Hyde Park.
In the middle of the park,
I saw a group of French sailors, with their little red pompons on their kepis.
They were running and playing with an equal number of girls, or “young ladies” rather.
They were running and playing and screaming.
They couldn't understand a word of what the other was saying.
Then a horrible feeling swept over me.
It was sheer luck that I didn't crash the car, because suddenly I remembered
Churchill's ultimatum I'd just read, and I thought of those French boats in Mers-el-Kébir, where there were other sailors, also wearing kepis with little red pompons, and I wondered what was going to happen to them tomorrow.
These are the victims of the most base and loathsome attack ever.
Clearly, France's former ally only attacks those who cannot fight back.
On the morning of the attack,
Admiral Gensoul received the English ultimatum.
Admiral Somerville proceeded to send several delegations, in order to explain to Gensoul the options proposed by Churchill:
They could join the Free French, allow themselves to be disarmed, or head to a neutral port which was out of German reach.
Admiral Gensoul refused all three options, as he considered them dishonorable solutions.
What we didn't dare to risk happening was letting the boats fall into enemy hands.
We simply couldn't take the risk.
But wasn't there also a psychological risk?
Yes, a considerable risk.
It allowed the Germans to spread propaganda.
And Vichy, too.
Lord knows they used the opportunity.
I think we understood that, but at the time, we had very little choice in the matter.
There were 1,600 sailors killed by the British Navy.
The British Navy attempted to take over the French Navy.
That was clear to us at the time.
We thought that...
We believed the armistice would be respected by the Germans.
In France, we thought, as the Vichy government had told us, that the French Navy would never be given over to the Germans.
For us, that was a fact.
I was brought up to believe that promises were kept, and I just couldn't imagine that there could be political dealings that would eventually lead to the French Navy being given away.
There was no way.
So we viewed it as a brutal attack.
There was also an additional moral problem, in that, according to many testimonies, the sailors whose boats were shelled by the British believed at that moment they were going to cast off in order to join the British fleet.
That's terrible.
Had we felt there was any hope of that, we would never have attacked.
But there was no hope.
Everything we said about the Germans was proved in Bizerta, where the Germans proceeded to give the French admiral twenty minutes to surrender, to surrender boats and all, on pain of an immediate bombing attack, or of being taken prisoner.
Our predictions all came true.
We knew who we were dealing with.
It was then, shortly after these events, that the French, whose faith in the English had been greatly shaken, made contact with us for the first time, through General Huntziger at the Armistice Commission in Wiesbaden, to discuss the possibility of changing the armistice clauses to allow military collaboration.
And it was the discussion of such options, for which each side undoubtedly had its own personal motivations, that initiated the negotiations, which are now known as “collaboration.”
While the talks were beginning,
Hitler and Pétain agreed to meet in Montoire.
In our first meeting,
Laval told me he was a Germanophile.
And as he had known me for years, he asked me to put in a good word for him with Hitler. And I did.
I think Hitler felt Laval was sincere, at least in one aspect:
When he spoke of collaboration.
And that was the main issue at the second meeting.
In such cases, the defeated want to know what will become of them.
What will the peace treaty be like?
Whereas the victors I've often seen generally don't know what's next and cannot answer such questions.
That's how it went in Montoire.
Hitler didn't know how to answer Pétain's questions about boundaries or the fate of prisoners.
So it ended with everything up in the air.
Ah, Montoire... Now that was quite a story.
Where was this Montoire, anyhow?
Everyone was looking it up in the atlas to see where it was.
When we heard what had transpired, it was depressing.
Some even cried the next day.
– People were crying?
– Yes.
Soon afterwards, a new slogan became popular,
“Collaboration is:”
“Give me your watch,
I'll give you the time.”
That was the slogan.
That was collaboration.
He often said, also in my presence, that he hadn't yet decided whether England or France should pay for the war.
On the basis of his “race ideology,” or whatever you can call this point of view, many felt much more related to the English than to the French.
I am convinced that France, as Hitler saw it, could only play a minor role in a National Socialist Europe.
He had never been in France or anywhere else in Europe.
Whatever knowledge he had was derived from books, which had first been adapted to his point of view.
In his mind, he felt that a decline of the French people was unavoidable. And this idea was confirmed by the French defeat.
During his travels, Hitler sometimes shared his thoughts with others.
April 5, 1942. Suppertime.
The Führer says that if one plans on ignoring the terms of a contract, no use quibbling over details.
Hence, we must assure ourselves that the French are sincere.
No point in trying to pickpocket an experienced pickpocketer like the Führer himself.
In any case,
France's main task for the next 50 years is to repair the damage done at Versailles.
April 24, 1942. Suppertime.
The Führer says he is against marriages between the Wehrmacht and foreigners in occupied lands.
Such demands are generally based on sexual frustration, which is common in troops abroad.
He is struck by the contrast between the photos of the German men, and those of the women, who are very shabby looking.
The Führer feels that such marriages are doomed from the start, both in terms of individual happiness and racial purity.
He is more in favor of harmless passing fancies, which are inevitable in this type of situation.
The conditions created by
National Socialism within German structures at that time made it impossible for us to respect the clauses of the armistice.
We couldn't help what happened, any more than we could have helped all the other horrible things which continue to haunt any rational human being.
We couldn't stop Hitler and company from invading Alsace and Lorraine, making them a part of the Third Reich, and eventually incorporating their youth into the Wehrmacht.
This was all out of our hands.
We can reproach ourselves until kingdom come, but there was nothing we could do.
You say that after Russia, you were sent to Alsace, and then France.
Why? Was Alsace not France?
No. For us, it wasn't French territory.
The people were pro-German.
I even brought my whole family.
There were some people with bad intentions, some patriots who were ready to do anything.
But there weren't many.
So I felt like
I was in a country of German origin.
And now?
I've never gone back.
No, but what do you think of it now?
I think it's true.
I think it belongs to Germany.
Here a show is being put on for the S.S.
Bruno Fritz's amusing ice hockey report.
The German player is taken by surprise and falls down on... on the ice!
He stands up again. It feels too cold.
Thanks to Franco-German economic collaboration,
100,000 French workers now work in Germany.
Four trains leave the capital weekly and head for German industrial regions.
Today, at North Station, the war councilor Michel has come to shake the hand of worker number 110,000: Edouard Lefébvre.
Tell us, Mr. Lefébvre, were you unemployed?
– That's right.
– For how long?
It's been two years now.
– Are you married?
– With children.
This vast organization has already had good results:
Lower unemployment rates, and understanding between workers.
I'd worked for the Finance Minister and the State Secretary since 1923.
In 1940, Mr. Lansfried requested that I go to Paris, as head of the military-controlled finance division in occupied France.
He didn't want a National Socialist party member in this position.
Were you not a member of the party?
Yes, shortly before, I had joined the party, again at the request of Mr. Lansfried.
We tried to be as reasonable as possible, and as fair as possible, not only in our own interests, but in those of France as well.
This famous democracy, in the past 20 years, has proved itself incapable of eliminating such poverty.
The Third Reich, however, aims to provide its workers everywhere in Germany with healthy and beautiful hometowns.
This is a new settlement in a small industrial town, which naturally has a daycare center, a clinic, a center for mothers and children and an X-ray lab.
One gets the impression from such reports that German propaganda was quite open in its racial prejudice, and often implied that German discipline and structure were necessary qualities to clean up what was considered to be “the French mess.”
Yes, there is some truth in what you say.
In our offices in Paris, we also had a propaganda department.
But it received orders directly from Berlin.
And I would like to point out that, from the outset of my job...
It was the first ministerial-level visit from the French government, the Minister of Transport visited in September 1940.
He was accompanied by the owner of a racing stable, who wanted permission to begin horse racing again, as it was a very popular national pastime.
The races are ever-popular.
One thing is clear,
Paris has become Paris once again.
I listened to my collaborators and said, “Why not?”
And so the races started up again, and continued until 1944.
Thanks to us, the theaters were able to open their doors again.
We often went to the theater, alone or with friends.
The Germans also attended the races, which is how the different parties made contact quite spontaneously.
Personal relationships developed between the different sides, probably for various reasons.
I'm sure you're aware there has been a tendency in France since the war to deny that such contact ever existed.
Yes, but it did exist.
Germany was triumphant, and there wasn't a single front from which it failed to come home victorious.
There's no denying that the German army made quite an impression on the youth in France.
Seeing that army of young men, stripped to the waist...
After all, I'm the son of a soldier and I was a soldier myself.
A sense of responsibility, hierarchy and discipline mean a lot.
A well-disciplined army was important to people like us.
This was the first time we had seen such an ideal army.
The French army was nothing compared to this army who could put the fear of God into an entire people.
It sounds awful to say, but it's the truth of the matter.
We solemnly swear to unite and to place our forces, our faith, our ardor, at the service of the Marshal, at the service of France.
This campfire draws a three-day meeting to an end, during which the discipline and dedication of these young men were proved once again.
The French believe servicemen should be tough as nails, and at the end of the day, they always turn to servicemen, whether it be to restore order, to prevent a coup-d'état, or to organize a coup-d'état.
But the serviceman is omnipresent, with his cap, his pompon, his saber, no matter what his rank may be.
The French love their army.
Poem by Officer C. Languillon, published on the front page of
Le Moniteur on November 24, 1940.
“His name rings as a gunshot.
“Pétain ready for the challenge?
The soul is willing.
“But goodness is ever aloof.
“The great victor, even greater in defeat.
“Schemers, foreigners, buffoons and fools,
“have brought you to your knees, O France.
“The hero of Verdun, cleaning the slate,
“Is setting our house in order from top to bottom.
“A Herculean labor, a difficult recovery.
“From the ruins come muffled groans.
“Former profiteers writhe in the rubble.”
Pétain, in a series of speeches, drew conclusions from this defeat.
And he did so with skill.
He could woo his audience.
If one was to read the texts now,
I haven't read them in years, but I bet if you read them now, you would be quite surprised.
Yes, the texts relied heavily on the people's collective unconscious.
Absolutely right.
– He blamed the parliament.
– Yes, the parliamentary system...
Certain employers were suspect... foreign... cosmopolitan, not to mention dark-skinned.
And of course, he blamed the Communist Party.
The Communist Party was the cause of all evils.
All hotels were requisitioned, and the Park Hotel was occupied by Marshal Pétain and his staff.
This is where I met up with my friend,
Colonel Gorosse-Tardou, who lived with Pétain.
He was the chief of staff for his aviation department.
Consequently,
I was often at the Park Hotel.
It was always busy, with lots of people milling around.
Everyone kept their voices down and spied on their neighbors.
Personally, I wasn't used to their system, but when I spoke,
I followed everyone's example.
They were forever shushing one another.
– Everyone was very suspicious.
– Of the enemy or of one another?
A bit of both.
Are you a Republican?
Not really.
– Not really?
– No.
You're more of a Monarchist?
Yes, that's right.
French news. Late 1940.
Pilot-sergeant Gonthier de Basse, veteran of WWI, volunteer in '39, hurt in Dunkirk, has, of his own free will, agreed to make the following declaration.
Ever since my return from England aboard The Sphinx on October 5,
I've been surprised by the number of my compatriots who still believe the wounded in Narvik and Dunkirk were all well-treated by our ex-ally and this is why I've decided to share my memories with you.
When we arrived in England, we harbored no grudge against our English comrades.
But after the tragedy in June, when we were invited to come serve under a new flag, when they offered to pay us our dues in pounds sterling, we could only reply with disdain and indignation.
We French soldiers can only serve under our own colors.
Anything else would be treason.
Fellow Frenchmen, comrades, our duty is to stand side by side behind our leader, Marshal Pétain, to guarantee France a place of honor in a new Europe, and to allow the prisoners to return home immediately.
It is a difficult task.
Those who try to divide us are enemies.
United we stand, divided we fall.
The idea was to get out of the war, come what may, as quickly as possible.
There were 15,000 French sailors in Liverpool.
I went and spoke to them.
I tried to persuade them to continue the war.
But there was no way.
We were so low on people that we needed them to dig the trenches, and we offered them wages to do so.
They said no.
They said, “France is no longer in the war.
“We no longer have the right to dig trenches.”
You see... the kind of attitude they had.
Their desire to get out was almost spiteful.
As for what would become of England, they didn't give a care.
That's the kind of attitude they had.
They felt that it was inconceivable that the English succeed where the French army had been beaten.
On June 17, 1940, the steam liner Le Massilia headed from Bordeaux to Morocco.
Several parliamentarians were aboard.
This event caused much ink to flow.
I boarded Le Massilia without suspecting that it was a big trap.
Those who stayed behind in Bordeaux quickly understood that they could exploit the circumstances, and influence the public to think that the departure of the boat and the fact that a number of politicians were aboard, was a sign we were panicking, running away, abandoning them.
In other words, deserting.
The people aboard Le Massilia who actually wanted to fight were quickly judged to be cowards who were fleeing the fight.
It was paradoxical that some of us, including Viénot, Jean Zay, Wiltzer and I, were tried for desertion, when in fact their original plan had been to go fight.
And as far as I was concerned,
I was almost obliged to go, seeing as my unit had gone, and it was my duty to follow them.
Everyone wound up in Rabat.
There were tons of people.
Once there, I went to lunch at “Balima,” Rabat's best restaurant, where everyone met.
One of my cousins,
Du Jonchay, a pilot, was there, and naturally we discussed what had happened.
He showed me Pierre Mendès-France, who was sitting at a table with a lovely woman, who was his wife.
My cousin turned to me and said,
“Our State Secretary there is responsible for our defeat.”
There he sat, our little lieutenant, drinking champagne.
That champagne completely infuriated me.
I walked up to him, and told him this was no attitude to have, after being defeated, drinking champagne in public as if he was delighted about what had happened.
Then what?
I told him if I saw him again, I would kick him out.
And I gave him my card.
– It caused quite a stir.
– You were picking a fight.
No, I simply gave him my card to let him know who I was.
Not to hide my identity.
How did he react?
He got up, stood to attention, and said nothing.
I was a captain, he was a lieutenant.
I see.
There was surrender and treason.
But anti-Semitism had also begun to rear its ugly head.
Many who used to hide their feelings openly declared their anti-Semitism to the point that France began adopting certain German values, and sought to get closer to Hitler, in the hope of creating a Europe where
France and Germany would collaborate and obviously anti-Semitism became a common element between many Germans and Frenchmen.
And, of course, Jean Zay and I had the misfortune of being Jewish.
Actually, I was Jewish.
Jean Zay was only partly Jewish.
He had converted, as had his father, but he was of Jewish origin.
This didn't detract from the atrocious campaign against him, which, as you know, ended in his being killed.
Jean Zay was arrested.
His pregnant wife was in Casablanca.
She had a very tough time to find a hospital bed, or even someone willing to help her give birth.
There was such hatred.
When clinics or hospitals heard that she was Jean Zay's wife, they didn't have the courage to admit her.
You can't imagine how rampant sectarianism had become.
In any case, Mrs. Zay's pregnancy was certainly a very trying time.
She lived with my wife and they spent many long hours together during which they were abused and insulted.
My wife also had a very rough time of it.
Anyhow,
Madeleine Zay eventually gave birth to this baby, whom I had the opportunity to meet, as I was arrested shortly after the baby's birth.
And when I was transferred to Clermont-Ferrand, where I met up with Jean Zay,
I'd seen his daughter and he hadn't.
JEAN ZAY
To Appear In Court Tomorrow
The committing magistrate was
Colonel Leprêtre.
I don't want to name names, but this man's reputation lives on today.
The man was very intelligent, very bright, clever and cunning, but he had a very perverse side to him, in that he harbored great hate for the accused, especially if the accused was left-wing.
He got a certain morbid pleasure from seeing an important man accused.
Even outside of cross-examination, he would sometimes visit the prison, just to sit and chat with the prisoners.
He would go in their cells, and sit on their beds, pretending to speak with them simply.
He clearly got a great deal of pleasure out of holding the fates of such formerly important men in his hands.
There was something very sick, very odd about it.
A strange man.
So he would confess to certain things in moments of relaxation?
One day, he said to me,
“I know what you think of me.”
The man was bright enough to understand.
Very intelligent.
He said to me,
“I know what you think of me,
“but in an organized society, there are certain tasks,
“tasks which must be done, and which require people to do them.”
“Every society needs garbage men.”
He chose that word.
Were you able to emphasize the racial and political background and motives to the trial?
No, our main concern was to obtain satisfying results, and we knew that these judges wouldn't appreciate such arguments.
Even if we had said that his being Jewish should have nothing to do with the trial, we knew perfectly well that it would be a major issue.
The hearing was extremely tense.
It began at 9.00 a.m. With an introduction by Pierre Mendès-France, which the Colonel received with obvious contempt.
He had been given a table and a jug of water.
He began with the following introductory statement:
“Colonel and gentlemen,
I am Jewish, I am a Freemason,
“but I am not a deserter.
May the trial begin.”
The court was presided over by a rather frenzied man, called Colonel Perret, a colonel in charge of tanks, who harbored a particular hatred for General de Gaulle, because they had served in Saint Cyr together and were both competitive.
He hated anything to do with de Gaulle,
Gaullism or Gaullists.
Furthermore, he was a very frenzied character, who ran the hearings in an atrocious manner.
My sentence was nothing compared to the death sentences he gave out.
He was responsible for executions, which is considerably worse than the sentence he gave me.
I must say that those present at the hearing were extremely hostile.
The audience had been rigged, no two ways about it.
Women whose faces were filled with hate.
I won't name any names, but they were hateful people, people who were hoping for the cruelest of sentences, who were hoping I'd be killed immediately, who didn't think I should even be allowed to defend myself.
Some 300 or 400 entry cards had been delivered, but only six were for the defense.
The cards were quite a story.
As only a limited number existed, and they were in high demand, a new black market developed.
There were bistros in Clermont that hawked the cards.
Flatteringly enough, they were very expensive, twenty francs for the show.
It cost more than the movies.
There's no denying that public opinion was strongly influenced by the papers at that time, which felt that the politicians who were accused should automatically be declared guilty.
My colonel, my lieutenant-colonel and my general all took the stand and said, “He didn't desert.”
When the commissioner, whose name I won't give either, stood up and announced in a choked voice that he was sentenced to six years for desertion,
Mendès told him,
“Sir, I'm sure you'll be rewarded.
“You've served the master well.”
Former State Secretary
Sentenced to six Years in Jail for Desertion
I don't know if Rochat told you that a man came to see him the next day.
And this man told him,
“I'm a Pétain supporter,
“and I am appalled by what happened yesterday. It's scandalous.
“The Marshal must not be aware that such things are happening.
“The Marshal must be informed of such goings-on.
“I saw you stenograph the hearing.”
Which indeed he had.
“Could you get a copy for me to bring to the Marshal himself?”
Rochat gave him a copy which he took to the Marshal.
Naturally, nothing ever came of it.
And the man who took the copy was a certain Mr. Giscard d'Estaing.
It is these children, the pupils of French schools, in whom the Marshal sees hope for our country.
He has come to speak simply, as only he can, in a modest school in the town of Périgny.
You may sit down now.
You don't have to stand to listen.
Young pupils of our French schools, the reason I wanted to speak to you today on this day as you begin a new school year, is that it's important for you to know that I am counting on you to help me rebuild our country, France.
So work hard, stand firm, and do your best.
All rise.
I had to pass through Vichy to reach my posting in Billancourt in the first two weeks of August 1940.
Many people told me that Marshal Pétain was very tired, and was only lucid for two hours a day.
Imagine my surprise when I met this man, who, although elderly, stood bolt upright, with his look of steel, which many people have commented on, and with the greatest of ease, politely asked me to sit down and make myself comfortable, then said, “Mr. Lamirand, there's been much talk about you here.”
The secretary general of youth,
Mr. Georges Lamirand recently visited Lavalette camp, the main goal of which is to train the men of tomorrow.
He visited these young men who are united by a common ideal, and live life in continual contact with nature, work and simplicity, these values upon which we must rebuild our country.
We talked and I thought to myself,
“What bad luck.
“They say he's only lucid two hours a day, and I chance upon those two hours.”
The problems of youth are fascinating, but I had absolutely no idea that, in the position
Marshal Pétain wanted to grant me, there were so many fascinating subjects and problems to solve.
Repeat after me: Long live France!
Long live the Marshal!
Louis Renault finally agreed to give me leave, saying to Pétain,
“I'll lend him to you for a month.”
And Marshal Pétain, in his infinite cleverness,
“Fine, one month.
“But if you don't mind, let's make the job renewable.”
And he renewed it 30 months.
Mr. Lamirand is inaugurating an exhibition of drawings sent to Pétain by French schoolchildren.
The little ones wanted to answer the Marshal's call, they wanted to show the Marshal their towns, villages and homes, hence sharing a piece of their daily lives with him.
A school girl, perhaps the youngest in France, had the luck of being allowed to give Pétain her lovingly written letter in person.
It was about adding a new element to the famous triptych of the time:
Work, Family, Nation.
Honor your work, your family, and your nation.
A national revolution?
You said it.
Marshal Pétain has already told you several times what he meant by social revolution.
He feels that our social system is unfair.
There is too much poverty, too much injustice.
And that is what he wants to change.
He is bound and determined to bring happiness to France, and asks us all to join in a communal effort.
Dear friends, this is his social revolution.
That was when he started planning his escape.
He grew his beard, shaved it off, grew it out again, and one fine day, he left.
I must admit I'm not very athletic, but I prepared myself by working out for several months beforehand.
I was high up, so I had to jump off a high wall.
But I had to run the risk.
And once I had jumped,
I would be a free man again.
Just as I was about to jump...
There were trees planted along the avenue.
I heard the unexpected sound of voices.
I tried to see in the semi-darkness.
There was a couple sitting under a tree.
You can imagine what they were discussing.
He knew what he wanted, but she hadn't decided yet.
It seemed to last an eternity to me.
She ended up saying yes, but I had the impression she had put up a great deal of resistance.
Finally, they left. And so I jumped.
And let me assure you that I was even happier than he was.
I'd really like to meet him someday and let him know how much I experienced with the two of them that night.
How you admired his audacity.
Yes, and how her lack of audacity struck me as being so untimely.
Anyway, love, fate and escape eventually won the day.
Did you disguise yourself?
I was disguised, but not very well.
You see, many people back then who wanted to disguise themselves would let their beards grow.
So, bearded men automatically arose suspicion!
I let my moustache grow,
I gave myself a new hairstyle, parted straight down the middle.
I got a pair of glasses.
And of course,
I changed the way I dressed and so forth.
The next day,
I went for my daily visit with him, to see if he had escaped or not.
I arrived and saw all these people with decameters in hand, taking all sorts of measurements.
They were hysterical.
They asked me what I wanted.
I said I was there to see my client.
They asked if I knew
Pierre Mendès-France had left. I said no.
I burst out laughing, which made them angry.
They carried out a huge security check of all the roads and trains.
But my plan was to not contact anyone, to not count on anyone, to be cut off from everything and everyone.
I must say that life in France at that time is very difficult to imagine, and even more so to describe.
You had an old pair of shoes you hoped would last.
If they got a hole, there was no leather to fix them.
There were no plates, there were no matches, there was nothing.
It is very difficult, in hindsight, to describe what it was like living in a country where everyone was always searching for everything.
The new rage in Paris is silk stockings without the silk.
All you have to do, ladies, is dye your legs.
It's easy and practical. A great idea.
The ladies are trading in their garters for paintbrushes.
Worried about what will happen when you bathe?
No problem.
Paint-on stockings are waterproof.
On top of that,
Elizabeth Arden guarantees they won't run!
That's a Parisian habit which will disappear.
Where is France headed?
Where is Europe headed?
Some 3,000 people in Chaillot will hear
Mr. Alphonse de Chateaubriant discuss The French Drama.
At this very moment, a huge continental unit is slowly taking shape.
It will be one gigantic geographical piece in the puzzle, with one single political and economical doctrine, stretching to the very tip of Europe, the very tip of which is France.
Therein the importance of France becomes clear, as France becomes, in this new division, the outer edge, the last bastion on the Atlantic of this immense continent, faced with another large continent,
America, which is ready to take over the ancient order of things, the ancient riches and capitalist creeds, the ancient gold and the ancient man, in order to make it their last refuge, their last fortress, and their last army.
I sincerely hope that everything I have said tonight will give the word “collaboration” new meaning in your eyes.
It's not surprising that, at first, such poison won over many new converts.
Little by little, people began to realize it was propaganda, and to see that the government was practicing a policy, which they themselves called collaboration with the enemy.
Slowly but surely, people began to open their eyes, and change their minds.
But this propaganda still won over many new converts.
You know as well as I do that anti-Semitism and Anglophobia are never hard to stir up in France.
Even if reactions to such things are dormant or stifled, all it takes is one event, one incident, one international crisis or one Dreyfus affair, for feelings we thought long gone to suddenly re-emerge in full force, for beliefs we thought dead to be simply dormant.
Edouard Drumont was the first in France to examine the Jewish question.
The Institute of Jewish Questions celebrates his memory today.
Mr. Laville has agreed to say a few words.
Out of 100 Frenchmen of old stock, at least 90 are pure white, free of any other racial mixture.
This isn't true of the Jews.
The Jews are born of a mixture which dates back thousands of years, between Aryans, Mongols and Negroes.
Therefore, Jews have unique faces, bodies, attitudes and gestures.
It is reassuring to see that the public is interested in studying the characteristics presented in the morphological section of “Jews and France.”
In October '40, when I came home on leave,
I heard that a good friend of mine, a teacher, wasn't allowed to keep teaching that fall, because his mother was Jewish, making him half-Jewish.
I'd met Jews before, but I treated them the same as Catholics, Protestants, or people with no religion in particular.
It wasn't a revolution yet, but it did give me food for thought.
– Did you have any Jewish teachers?
– Let me see...
We did have one.
Yes, he was fired.
The same old story.
No one ever told us anything.
Listen, I think we should make a little nuance here.
I think that when you take cases like this teacher we mentioned,
I think that we tried, to the best of our ability, to get these people some work tutoring and so forth.
We did that for another colleague, too.
Like you say, it wasn't much, but we did have sympathy for them.
Did you really try?
Did every single teacher in Clermont give in their resignation?
No way. You've no idea what the mentality was like back then.
A collective resignation? Come on!
In 1940, Vichy came out with the Jewish decrees.
In the small ads of Le Moniteur, a local merchant announced that he was 100% pure French.
Sir, are you Marius?
Yes, I'm Marius.
You're weighed down with medals.
I fought in World War I.
– They're all medals from WW I?
– That's right.
You must be a very brave man.
I followed the others. I did my duty.
When France was demobilized, when France was defeated in the 2nd war, how did you react?
We certainly weren't very happy.
As veterans of World War I, the defeat affected us deeply.
Were there many Jewish stores?
Yes, there were.
So you must have seen a lot?
You could say that.
They all packed up their bags and left.
They went into exile.
And there weren't any arrests?
There were arrests everywhere.
And you saw them?
Yes, unfortunately.
Tell me, when what were called
“the Jewish decrees” came out, apparently you took out an ad.
That's correct.
It was an ad in Le Moniteur.
You're certainly well-informed.
You see, sir, we were four brothers.
It was the solution I found, as people thought we were Jews.
My name, Klein, sounds quite Jewish.
But I'm a Catholic.
And this was a real source of concern.
I had some problems because of that.
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
It was important that I tell people that I am really French.
In other words, you wanted your clients to know you weren't Jewish.
That is correct.
Why?
Because some said I was Jewish.
Jews were being arrested, and they said we were Jewish.
Do you see?
I couldn't very well allow myself to be labeled as a Jew since I'm a Catholic.
So that's why, as you said,
I took out an ad.
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
One was killed.
– The other three were imprisoned.
– But Jews fought in World War I, too.
That's true. I realize that.
I've never been a racist.
Jewish or Mahometan, all that mattered to me was that the man did his duty, in which case, he was as French as the rest of us.
You understand?
You weren't high on the priority list of those persecuted by Hitler's regime.
But did you know any Jews,
Communists, or Freemasons who were?
I met more Jews than I'll ever meet again.
I had two girls working at the pharmacy, who were considered to be evil just because they were Jewish.
One was the daughter of an amazing man, a Parisian polytechnician.
She was a pretty amazing girl herself.
The other was the daughter of Hirsch, a colleague in Strasbourg.
Nobody wanted anything to do with these girls.
He had warned every pharmacy in Clermont not to hire these girls.
– Who is “he?”
– The pharmacy inspector.
The movie industry gave them a chance to steal billions of francs.
Tannenzaft, better known as Nathan, who in the eyes of the world, was the ultimate symbol of French cinema, has cost the public nearly 700,000,000 francs.
Mr. Pierre Mendès-France, did you enjoy going to the movies back then?
I went to the movies because I enjoyed it, but I had yet another reason, as I had quickly discovered that movie houses provided a refuge which was both fun and comfortable, you could sit down in a movie theater at 3:00 in the afternoon, and stay there in the darkness for hours on end, without anyone ever seeing you.
It was a great hiding place.
In many pre-war French movies, there were Jewish actors or Jewish directors.
And in the credits of these movies, the Jewish names had been erased.
Today World News was able to film a part of the trial of the Jew Tannenzaft, Bernard Nathan.
Our presence clearly disturbed the accused who wanted his privacy.
He raises an objection, but is overruled by the court.
Go away. Leave me alone.
This is a tragedy, not a comedy!
The Germans were discreet about it, but they wanted to see their movies.
There were operettas.
There were the first movies in color.
Some, like La Ville Dorée, weren't propaganda, others were.
Films like Le Juif Suss were pure propaganda.
And the thing that I found most revolting was that they weren't only German productions, which would have been understandable since they had occupied us, but that they were made with the blessing of the French authorities, on behalf of French organizations, dubbed by French actors.
The events in this film are based on historical fact.
At first, movie-goers probably thought these movies were just like any other German movie.
But people very quickly began to realize that it was just typical propaganda, in the worst sense of the word.
This led to a kind of strike among viewers.
Even those who weren't especially interested in the Free French, who had gotten into the habit of seeing normal German movies, were extremely revolted and refused to have any part in it.
Gentlemen, this Jew's criminal record shows nothing of the suffering of our people during his tyranny.
This is why I give the floor to the person who has suffered most.
I ask for nothing.
You are the judges, not me.
Please, Sturm, you are the one with the most right to judge him.
It is not my decision to take.
Suffering is too subjective.
It would be unfair.
However, I see an ancient article of criminal law which applies:
“If ever a Jew commits a sin...
“If ever a Jew commits a sin of the flesh with a Christian woman,
“he shall be publicly hung without further ado.”
“If ever a Jew commits a sin of the flesh with a Christian,
“he shall be publicly hung without further ado,
“as punishment, and as an example for all others.”
Have mercy! I've done nothing wrong!
I've always acted in the name of my savior!
It's not my fault that your duke wanted to betray you!
I can fix everything, I swear. Everything!
Take all that I own. Take all my money.
But don't take my life!
I am innocent!
I'm just a poor Jew. Let me live.
I want to live!
I want to live! Live!
The State Council and I speak for all Wurtemburgers in decreeing that all Jews must leave Wurtemberg in the next three days.
This is valid across the entire country.
This decree has been taken in Stuttgart on February 4, 1738.
May our descendants remember this, for in doing so, they will spare themselves much pain and suffering, and will keep their blood pure of the influence of this accursed race.
THE END
There were only certain people who actually enjoyed Le Juif Suss, the anti-Semites who saw their beliefs confirmed in the movie.
The collaborators would also see it.
Then there were those who were taken by surprise.
I'd say that 80% of the people who came to see Le Juif Suss assumed it would be just like any other light-hearted movie.
The German films weren't particularly good.
However, they featured many French film stars, as Continental had made many French films before the war.
Tino Rossi and the like filmed at Continental.
As an artistic endeavor, several actors are off to Germany.
At East Station, we've spotted Albert Préjean.
Danielle Darrieux.
Suzy Delair.
Junie Astor.
Viviane Romance.
Dr. Karl Fröhlich, president of the German Cinema Corporation, has invited them on a 12-day studio tour of Vienna, Munich and Berlin.
Today Mr. Heydrich, general of the S.S. And head of security, was sent to Paris by Mr. Himmler, chief of the S.S. And the police, to officially install Mr. Oberg in his new post in occupied territory.
Mr. Heydrich is president of the International Criminal Police, a commission to which
France has always belonged.
Mr. Heydrich visited Mr. Bousquet, secretary general of the police, and Mr. Hiller, secretary general of administration.
He also had a chance to see Mr. Dartier de Pellepoix, in charge of Jewish Questions, as well as Mr. De Brinon.
What was Paris like back then?
There were two sides to Paris.
There were those struggling to survive, and there was high-society.
All we were missing was Régine.
There's no doubt about it.
Everyone's ashamed to say it today, but for some, life in Paris was great.
Maxim's and Le Boeuf sur le Toit did a booming business.
The movie industry was in full swing.
From what I've heard, actually, or so they say,
French films were so good then because a certain category of producers had fled to the States.
Many directors have gone on to do very well in their careers, but they forget what they said then.
Paris was a fun and crazy place.
Let me assure you that there were some wild and crazy times back then.
All right, boys. This way.
We'll go straight to the source to whet our whistles.
What happened to you in 1937?
You can't even begin to imagine.
– It's a long story.
– Be careful...
First give us a drink, then we'll see what's up.
I think we're going to earn our drink today.
– Is that red wine?
– Yes, it's as Red as I am.
So what happened in here?
This cellar has seen everything.
The Resistance in Auvergne began here.
The night the first weapons arrived, we met in this very cellar.
And we sang the Internationale.
We weren't Communists, but as Pétain sang the Marseillaise, we had to sing the Internationale.
You see, people attended the raising of the colors reluctantly.
– Yet they still came?
– They had no choice.
It is in times like those when you begin to realize what people are really like.
– How do you mean?
– They were scared stiff.
With only a few exceptions.
– Was it really a risk not to come?
– Risk or no risk, they still came.
– So they thought there was a risk?
– They thought so.
I was under the impression that there were quite a few students here who ardently supported General de Gaulle.
For example, there was the son of a colleague whose name escapes me, among others.
What about among the teachers?
I really can't say how many teachers supported him.
We were sympathetic to the young people's cause, but there wasn't the same enthusiasm... the same enthusiasm which was gaining momentum among the young people.
Why do you think that is?
It often seems to be the case in life.
Young people are, in general, more sincere and more dynamic.
They don't think things through.
I think it would be fair to say that they are less cautious.
They are more open and friendly.
What do you think?
– They're not as scared.
– True.
Some of my students got caught.
I can't really say who.
Not so many, just a few of them.
In fact, many of them now have streets named after them here.
There was Bacaud.
The street going to Fontviége is named after him.
– I taught this charming boy.
– He was in the Resistance?
These people, as Dionnet was saying earlier, had created a network.
We only found out about it later.
They continued to pretend they were just your average students.
But we only found out about this later.
Perhaps Dionnet, who was in the Resistance, knew.
What was it like for the others?
How did the others react when someone's desk was empty?
I don't know. I can't remember.
When a student's parents were arrested, and the son showed up at school the next day, how did they react?
– I can't remember.
– How can you forget?
Can you remember?
No, I can't.
No specific examples.
I see some examples on the wall.
Those are our former students...
Aren't those the students who died in World War I?
It says World War II.
I'm trying to remember, but I can't.
Clermont-Ferrand is giving
Marshal Pétain a warm welcome.
He has come to approve the constitution of the Peasants' Union, and the end of the winter crusade for National Aid.
The head of state will then receive the donations to National Aid brought by peasants from all over the region.
It is a symbolic ceremony for the French mutual aid campaign.
A great day for France as our hearts beat together in collective hope.
This is Spain...
one thousand and eighty years after the coming of Christ.
It is a war-torn, unhappy land...
half Christian, half Moor.
This is the time and the story of Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar...
known to history and to legend as El Cid, "The Lord."
He was a simple man who became
Spain's greatest hero.
He rose above religious hatreds...
and called upon all Spaniards, whether Christian or Moor...
to face a common enemy who threatened to destroy their land of Spain.
This enemy was gathering his savage forces...
across the Mediterranean Sea on the north shores of Africa.
He was the African emir, Ben Yusuf.
The Prophet has commanded us to rule the world.
Where in all your land of Spain is the glory of Allah?
When men speak of you, they speak of poets... music makers, doctors, scientists.
Where are your warriors?
You dare call yourselves sons of the Prophet?
You have become women!
Burn your books.
Make warriors of your poets.
Let your doctors invent new poisons for our arrows.
Let your scientists invent new war machines.
And then, kill!
Burn.
Infidels live on your frontiers.
Encourage them to kill each other.
And when they are weak and torn...
I will sweep up from Africa... and thus the empire of the one God, the true God Allah...
- Allah is the one God.
- Will spread.
First, across Spain.
Then, across Europe.
Then, the whole world!
Heavenly Father, we are lost and in darkness.
Once again they destroy our towns... take our people in bondage.
Please help us, Father.
Send us someone... who will take us to the light.
Father. Here. Come.
The Cross.
The Cross.
We couldn't save your village...
but we captured their leaders.
Who are you?
Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar.
Vivar?
You're a long way from home.
Sir, you are not dressed for battle.
This was to have been my wedding day, Father.
How is it you came here, my son?
I thought this would be the shortest road to my bride.
We are ready, my lord.
Do we hang them now?
No, Fanez.
They come to Vivar with us.
No! Stop!
Fernando, put down those stones!
Welcome home, my son.
Here are some Moorish prisoners for you.
We didn't expect such wedding guests.
Are you holding them for tribute?
They're your prisoners, sir.
They're yours.
You captured them.
You must decide what is to be done with them.
Hang them! Now!
We are emir... kings.
There will be a great ransom for you if you let us live.
You were ready enough to kill.
It would seem you're less ready to die.
I am ready, my Lord Rodrigo.
I have no great desire to live to see what is coming for all of us.
What is coming for all of us?
Wars, death and destruction.
Blood and fire more terrible than has ever been seen by living man.
Don Diego, I will take your prisoners back to the King at Burgos.
They are not my prisoners.
They are my son's.
Oh, forgive me, Don Rodrigo.
Then it will be your prisoners we will hang in the palace square at Burgos.
We will hang their bodies high as an example to other Moors!
Don Ordonez, these prisoners will not go to Burgos.
The King will be just as pleased if you hang them here.
We've been killing them for years.
What has it brought us? Peace?
Hang me, and my sons will not rest... while a single Christian remains alive in Vivar.
What other way is there to treat the Moors?
Hang them now!
Do you want these people to live in fear the rest of their lives?
Antonio, do you want to see your church burned too?
Your villages destroyed?
Then kill them.
Don Diego, tell your son that it is treason... to refuse to turn over prisoners to an officer of the King.
Rodrigo knows what he must do.
Do you solemnly pledge never again to attack King Ferdinand's country?
I do.
Among our people, we have a word for a warrior... with the vision to be just and the courage to be merciful.
We call such a man, "El Cid."
I, Moutamin, Emir of Saragossa... pledge eternal friendship to the Cid of Vivar... and allegiance to his sovereign lord,
King Ferdinand of Castile.
May Allah strike the eyes from my head... and the flesh from my bones if I break this pledge.
In the name of Allah.
In the name of Allah.
In the name of Ferdinand...
King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias...
I charge you with treason.
Within seven days, you will appear before the King at Burgos... to answer these charges.
You did take the shortest road, my son.
Not to your bride, but to your destiny.
God sent you to us, my son.
God has sent you.
Rodrigo!
But I did hear a sound.
He should have been here by now.
Why is he so late?
He is not late, my lady.
He was to be here at sundown.
It's barely noon.
Yes.
You don't really understand how love keeps time.
Later means sooner; sundown means noon.
Still, a man on a horse can move only so fast... no matter how much the man is in love.
Yes, my lady.
All night long I kept thinking:
"Oh, the Moors have ambushed him!
"Oh, yes, he's been attacked by a madman.
Oh, he's fallen ill."
They say all women in love... are tormented that way.
Because they don't dare believe that such happiness... can really be theirs.
Help me, please.
The gown is... very beautiful.
Your Highness is... very gracious.
It is not often we are so honored.
No. It is not an ordinary day.
Then you have not heard?
There has been news.
News of... of Rodrigo, Your Highness?
Of Rodrigo.
The gown is so beautiful.
Your Highness.
Your Highness.
Can you tell me what has happened to Rodrigo?
Yes, I can tell you.
- You knew that Rodrigo was on his way here?
- Yes.
That there was a battle?
You knew that there was a battle with the Moors?
Chimene.
My father, tell me.
- Rodrigo's been hurt.
- No, Rodrigo's alive and well.
You love him so much.
Two names.
My father... and Rodrigo.
Chimene... you are my only child.
I have no wife.
You alone can carry my blood.
I should have had a son.
But Rodrigo will be your son.
No.
You're young.
You can learn to love again.
Could I learn to love another father?
It is not the same.
There are others.
Chimene!
Chimene!
Don Garcia Ordonez, tell me what has happened.
You have always been a good friend.
I would be more to you, Chimene... if you would let me.
You know that can never be.
It can now.
- Why now?
- Could you love a traitor, Chimene?
Since I love Rodrigo, the question can never have meaning.
It has meaning now.
Rodrigo is a traitor.
I do not believe you.
- There were others who were there.
- I do not believe them.
I am the one who brought the charges against him.
He is to be tried for treason against the King.
You would do anything to hurt Rodrigo.
No. I would do anything to win you.
Chimene!
What if these charges are true?
- They are not true.
- But there are many who saw it.
They did not know what they saw!
You will see for yourself, Chimene.
His Majesty, Don Ferdinand... the King, our Lord!
King of Castile, Leon and Asturias.
And the Infantes, Prince Sancho...
Prince Alfonso... and the Princess Dona Urraca.
You have been gathered here at this court... to give your solemn advice in a matter of great import to the Crown.
Garcia Ordonez has invoked the charge of treason... against Rodrigo of Vivar.
He cannot bring such charges against my son!
I repeat the charge! It is treason!
He's the man who's fighting Moors!
It is treason to the King!
You shouldn't have come.
Then I'll go.
No. Another moment.
Oh, forever.
Besides, there is no danger.
No danger?
Listen to them.
It doesn't matter.
Because I know you're not guilty.
- You don't even know what I've done.
- No.
But I know it was not treason.
What did you do?
I let a man live.
No. Five men.
But how can they call it treason?
Death to the Moors!
Who are these five men?
Emirs.
Moors? You let Moors live? Why?
I'm not sure it was right.
I don't know.
I think it was...
It happened strangely.
I was on my way to you.
I can't even remember where I was.
There must have been roads... trees and people.
All I remember is your face.
There was a battle.
I fought too.
My heart wasn't in my sword.
I kept seeing your face.
Suddenly, I thought,
"Why are we killing each other?"
True, they're Moors, we're Christians...
Chimene... do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yes, but... there always have been wars between us.
I know.
Always.
You don't think, then... we could live in peace?
Silence!
Will you keep quiet, the both of you!
This is not a charge
I would bring lightly against any man... especially a man who in a short time was to be my son.
But a man who frees the enemies of the King... son or no son...
I must call such a man "traitor."
Sire, he slurs the honor of our family.
This cannot be.
I, too, was once the King's champion.
That was many years ago, Don Diego.
Perhaps it will be better to leave the matter in our hands.
No, Sire. There were things said here which cannot be forgotten... even in this royal assembly.
Count Gormaz of Oviedo... when you call my son a traitor...
I say you lie.
I am the King's champion.
I would not want to shame my sword with an old man's blood.
Yet no man can call me a liar.
Liar!
I don't really understand, Rodrigo.
I only know if it grew out of our love... it must be right.
What do you want?
You shamed my father.
I want his name back.
But not the way you left it.
I want it clean so he can once more wear it proudly.
I cannot apologize.
It is not that I do not want to.
I do not know how to.
People will only esteem you the more for it.
Everyone will understand.
I have told you no.
Go home, Rodrigo.
I ask nothing for myself.
I humble myself before you.
Have pity on a proud old man.
I have no pity for those who have outlived the usefulness of their lives.
Count.
I beg you.
See? Two words are all I ask.
Can you not say, "Forgive me"?
I cannot.
I will not.
Now go.
Don't make me stain my life... and Chimene's with your blood.
Go home, Rodrigo.
No one will think the less of you for not having stood up against the King's own champion.
Count Gormaz!
I will ask you... only this last time.
I see that courage and honor are not dead in Castile.
And now I remember why I once thought you were worthy of my Chimene.
Go home, Rodrigo.
What glory is there for the King's champion in killing someone like you?
Can a man live... without honor?
No.
Now, Count, now I am satisfied.
Chimene!
Chimene!
Chimene.
Father!
- Chimene.
- Oh, Father!
Avenge me... as my son would.
Don't let me die... unavenged.
Unavenged.
Oh, Father.
I didn't seek your father's life, Chimene.
No, but you knew he could only answer the way he did... and you were prepared to kill him.
You bought your honor with my sorrow.
There was no other way for me.
The man you chose to love could do only what I did.
Why did you come, Rodrigo?
Did you think the woman you chose to love could do less than you?
I tried not to come.
I tried.
I told my love it had no right to live.
But my love won't die.
- Kill it!
- You kill it!
Tell me you don't love me.
I cannot.
Not yet.
But I will make myself worthy of you, Rodrigo.
I will learn to hate you.
Dona Chimene, daughter of the late Count Gormaz of Oviedo... the King's lamented champion.
Dona Chimene, never was there a moment when we needed your father more.
His death is a great loss to us.
And never did I regret more deeply... that I am his daughter and not his son.
I will not stand on ceremony, Ferdinand.
Three times I have written you on the matter of the city of Calahorra... and have received no answer.
The city of Calahorra belongs to Aragon, and I've come to claim it.
Calahorra has always been a part of Castile.
His Majesty, King Ferdinand, of Castile, Leon and Asturias... denies these claims.
Ramiro, King of Aragon by the grace of God... does this day challenge Ferdinand,
King of Castile, Leon and Asturias... to meet him in battle on the plains of Calahorra... with all the forces he can command.
To the victor in this battle and to his heirs... the city of Calahorra shall belong forever!
No!
All Spain is threatened by the Moors.
What could give greater comfort to the enemy... than to see two Christian kings and their
Christian armies tear each other to bits.
Why not then let the fate of Calahorra be determined... by the outcome of a single combat... between your champion and mine?
We know why you have chosen this moment to press your claim.
Our champion is dead.
The gauntlet lies there.
Let one man come forward now, or give up Calahorra.
Lord King!
Let me take up this gauntlet, Sire.
Why should we entrust the fate of a city... to your inexperienced hands?
It was I who killed your champion, Sire.
What man has a better claim to his place?
Don Martin has killed
27 men in single combat.
You know that?
Yes.
Yes, Sire, I know that.
Why, then, would you risk your life in this way?
I stand accused of treason, Sire.
And of other things.
I've not been permitted to answer these charges. You've not judged me.
Let me now offer myself before the highest judge.
If I'm guilty...
God will direct Don Martin's lance to my heart.
If I'm innocent, let him be my shield.
- He's never fought before.
- He is strong, Father.
A city, a whole city is at stake.
- He defeated our champion.
- How do we know it wasn't from behind and in the dark?
- There were no witnesses.
- That is not Rodrigo's way.
Let him fight, Father.
He has much to fight for.
Rodrigo of Vivar, take up the gauntlet.
And may God give you strength.
May God give me strength.
Why have you come to this place at this hour?
We have come to do battle for the city of Calahorra!
Will you fight to the death, giving no quarter and receiving none?
- We will.
- We will.
Go, then, and fight for Calahorra.
Don Martin.
Don Martin.
You have always been my father's enemy.
Will you be his avenger?
Will you wear my colors?
My lady, who would not be proud to wear your colors?
I promise you that he who has offended you shall die.
Until your triumph, my color will be black.
Rodrigo, the champion of Castile cannot go into combat... without a lady's colors.
My lady.
Almighty God, now the hour of my ordeal has come.
Judge me and let all men know my guilt or innocence.
Do you think Don Martin will kill Rodrigo?
I hope he does, Your Highness.
I'm sure you will understand why I do not join you in that hope.
After all, we would lose a city.
He's held the first charge!
Rodrigo's held!
Kill him!
To whom does Calahorra belong?
Calahorra belongs to Ferdinand... and to Castile.
God saw fit to give me strength, Sire.
Never have I seen a man fight with greater courage.
Our Lord was surely with you.
Who can now deny that the charges brought against you were false?
We are deeply in your debt, Rodrigo.
You will be my champion.
Your colors are no longer black.
Until my father is avenged... my colors will be deepest black.
Someone will avenge me.
Someone will yet come forward.
No. Believe me, Chimene.
Not one knight in all Castile will risk his life against Rodrigo.
He has become too dangerous.
Then why have you come to me,
Don Garcia?
This is not just a momentary anger?
You really want Rodrigo's death?
- You would fight Rodrigo?
- Not fight. Kill him.
I could fight him.
It's not a question of courage.
Before I first saw you,
I was ready to throw my life away... but... not now, Chimene.
To kill him?
How?
I want your love, Chimene.
More than I want honor, glory, wealth.
You understand a love like that.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Then I will kill him.
Oh, Father.
Why did you leave me such a burden?
Rodrigo of Vivar, you are hereby our own champion... and the first Knight of the Realm.
With this sword, may you vanquish all our enemies.
My lieges... for the first time in generations... our Moorish vassals have refused to pay us tribute.
They have been stirred into unrest by the Moors of Africa.
An expedition, therefore, must be sent to collect that tribute.
This expedition will be your first task.
May I prove worthy, Sire.
Our son, Sancho, will go with you.
May I too prove worthy, Father.
Sire, this will be the first expedition of our Prince.
Could I, too, accompany him?
You have our permission,
Count Ordonez.
Spare our son Sancho no hardship or danger... but teach him also that peace, not war, is the real task of a king.
Lord King, by ancient custom... when a lord deprives a lady of her support... he is himself required to give her shelter.
I killed that lady's father.
Therefore, if, by God's will...
I return alive from this mission... will you give me Dona Chimene of Gormaz as my lawful wife... to provide for and protect as her father would have done?
Yes, Rodrigo.
Let there be an end to this hatred.
The marriage will take place on your return.
Dona Chimene will hold herself in readiness.
In nomine Patrius et Filius et Spiritu Sancti, amen.
This is the man you hoped
Don Martin would kill.
This is the man whose death you sought.
Yes, Your Highness?
Would you then still accept this marriage?
If it is the King's order,
I must obey.
My Cid, beware!
Stop him!
My Lord Moutamin.
My Lord Cid.
You came in good time this day.
Praise be to Allah.
You were betrayed by one of your own, my Lord Cid.
Betrayed by a Christian, saved by a Moor.
You've earned the enmity of your people.
It was no more than my Cid did for me.
If ever you have need of me.
If ever you have need of me.
Ordonez.
Before I die, I want you to know that the woman you love... offered herself to me if I would kill you.
Kill him!
Kill him!
He betrayed us!
No. Let him go.
- They will say I was too soft.
- You will soon be a king!
You must learn to think like one.
Any man can kill.
Only a king can give life.
I want no more blood on my marriage.
Volo.
Why doesn't she speak?
Volo.
Will my lady take a little wine?
It is a very good wine, especially brought from Vivar.
I thank you, Fanez. No.
All night long you've been telling my lady how good everything is...
- because it comes from Vivar.
- Well, it is good.
You will see for yourself, my lady, when you come to Vivar.
It is such... such a happy place.
- Is it, Fanez?
- Oh, yes, my lady.
It's impossible to be there without... feeling it.
I... I think my lord and lady must be tired.
Yes!
Good night, my lord, my lady.
Good night, and may this night be the most, uh...
I mean, may you have, uh...
Good night, my lord and lady.
Good night.
Since I've taken the vows of wife... and since there must be nothing hidden between man and wife... there is something
I wish to tell you.
Sometimes it's best to leave a little something hidden... even between man and wife.
They say each unspoken thought... becomes a small ghost.
We have room for a few small ghosts.
I knew Ordonez would betray you.
We planned your death... together.
Chimene, I knew you'd planned to kill me.
Ordonez told me.
I never hoped... our marriage would bring your love back quickly.
I did hope it would end your hate... and that... then somehow...
Chimene.
Do you know why
I married you, Rodrigo?
It was the only way left for me to avenge my father.
It is true that if you want me... it is your right as my husband to take me.
But you will never get a woman's love from me.
Perhaps we have... wounded each other too deeply.
Chimene.
Is it our Chimene?
Yes, Reverend Mother.
It's Chimene.
Why have you come back to us?
I've come to find peace, Mother.
After all that has happened to you... the peace you seek is not within these walls.
You were made for the world, Chimene.
One day you will want to go back to it.
But you may remain with us... until you feel you must leave.
Why do they not hail me king?
Because you are not the king.
The kingdom has been divided.
- Liar.
- Father proclaimed before he died that Castile is yours...
- but Asturias and Leon go to me!
- Liar!
- And to our sister Urraca the walled city of Calahorra.
- No! I am the eldest.
'Tis my birthright.
The kingdom will not be divided!
You can't stop it now.
I am King of Asturias and Leon.
- I won't let you stand in my way.
- I am the eldest son!
I'll have the Triple Crown or none at all!
Then let it be none at all.
It was you and Urraca against me.
Father was old.
She worked on him!
You're no better than we are, just because you're the firstborn.
You and our sister.
It was always you and our sister.
You... held her too close!
You covet her!
You lie!
Sancho, no!
He thought he could be king.
Accompany His Highness to his new kingdom... the dungeon of Zamora.
Will you give me your prisoner, or must I take him?
There are 13 of us and you are alone.
What you do is against God's law.
Were you 13 times 13
I would not be alone.
What kind of a man are you?
Come.
We'll go to your sister at Calahorra.
Open the gates of Valencia... in the name of Allah!
And the time came when Ben Yusuf rode to Valencia...
to secure the aid of the frightened
Moorish king Al Kadir.
He had to make certain that he could land his mighty armada...
on the shores of Spain.
Clear out, all of you!
My lord Ben Yusuf, what an honor.
What an honor.
Allah be praised.
Our moment has come.
King Ferdinand has died... and the two young kings have quarreled.
Allah, in his wisdom, has willed it so.
And now Allah will ordain it so that one Christian brother... will kill another Christian brother.
How will this happen?
He... will do the killing.
The word will spread that brother has killed brother.
There will be confusion, revolution.
The kingdom will be torn in two... and then, when they are most weak,
I will bring my legions from Africa.
A master strategy.
When I land, they may attack you here at Valencia.
If they do, you will hold Valencia.
Do you understand me?
Yes, my lord, I understand.
I will leave my guards with you to make certain you understand.
Don't let him take me, Urraca.
Go.
Go.
Urraca!
Urraca!
Urraca!
Urraca!
You have given refuge to my brother!
I demand you release him at once!
This is my city!
You do not demand!
Release the prisoner at once or my army will attack!
Alfonso stays here... with me!
I give you until dawn to decide.
My lady.
What would it be worth to you... if Sancho were kept from your gates?
Who is there who could do such a thing?
I could.
Only... Only I would ask a great deal.
Thank heaven you answered our call.
Why did you send it, sir?
Unless I surrender to Sancho...
- he threatens to lay siege to us by morning.
Help us, Rodrigo.
When brother fights against brother... what can any man do?
If you joined us, many knights would come.
I swore allegiance to Sancho.
And to Alfonso.
And to me!
I can only help one brother by breaking faith with the other.
- I can help no one.
- But Sancho would kill Alfonso.
Whatever happens... must happen without me.
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
What do you want here, Dolfos?
I have words for your ears only, my King.
Well?
There is a way Calahorra could be taken without a blow.
I will help you.
Why should you do this for me?
I will not stand by and see our land torn by civil war.
Tell me.
I know where there is an unguarded gate.
I will take you there.
With a few men, you...
Even though my father trusted you, Dolfos... one false move...
But I am unarmed, Sire.
Show me this gate.
From here it will be better to go on foot.
I see no gate.
There.
Around the corner.
Open!
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
Open the...
Confess me.
Confess me.
Confess me!
Sancho.
- Rodrigo.
- My poor Sancho.
I was almost a king.
Wasn't I?
You are a king, my lord.
I have not come here as a queen.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
You still love Rodrigo.
And I know Rodrigo still loves you.
You have made a long and hard journey to come here.
Rodrigo must be stopped!
We will not permit this,
Alfonso and I!
Rodrigo will listen to you.
What is it I must tell Rodrigo,
Your Highness?
He has threatened to force
Alfonso to swear publicly... that he is innocent of our brother Sancho's death.
Is he not innocent of your brother's death?
You must tell him not to do this.
He must not. We will not permit it!
We will stop him!
You... had better speak to him.
Do you understand me, Chimene?
I understand, Your Highness.
No one can ask a king to swear.
No one!
Before God and this assembly...
I do freely forgive those who have warred against me.
I promise to defend them and to show them favor... even as I defend and show favor to those that were ever loyal to me.
This, my written oath...
I entrust to this Holy Church.
Castilians...
God has called upon me to become your king.
I now call upon you to kneel in sign of fealty.
Rodrigo of Vivar... called the Cid... why do you alone refuse me fealty?
Sire... all those you see here... though none dares say so... harbor the suspicion that you may have counseled your own brother's death.
Unless you can prove your innocence... you will have no loyal subjects.
Your kingdom will be torn by doubt.
Thus I cannot give you fealty... nor own you as my liege.
What will satisfy you of my innocence?
Your oath upon the holy book.
You would ask me to swear?
Sire, I do ask it.
Very well.
Will you swear that you had no part... in the ordering of King Sancho's death?
I so swear.
Do you swear that you had no part by way of counsel... in King Sancho's death?
I so swear.
Do you swear that you had no part by way of design... in King Sancho's death?
I swear it!
If you are forsworn... may you die such a death as your brother did... struck from behind by the hand of a traitor.
Say amen.
You press me too far, Rodrigo.
Say amen.
Amen.
"By edict of our most illustrious
Sovereign Alfonso...
"King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias...
"be it known that Rodrigo of Vivar...
"has outraged the Royal Personage and is hereby exiled for life.
"He has been accorded nine days from this day...
"in which to depart from the realm, alone and without men at arms.
"All his property, his goods, his lands and his privileges...
"are hereby forfeit to the Crown.
"All vessels of the King...
"are forbidden to provide him with food, lodging or any means of sustenance...
"or to speak with him.
Let no man give him aid."
I thirst.
I thirst.
I thirst.
Lord Knight, I thirst.
There is no spring nearby from which a leper is allowed to drink.
I'm thirsty.
Here.
It's for you.
For you.
- Thank you, my Cid.
- How do you know my name?
There is only one man in Spain who could humble a king...
and would give a leper to drink from his own pouch.
Who are you?
I am called Lazarus.
May helping hands be extended to you... everywhere you go, my Cid.
Can you forgive me, Rodrigo?
Chimene.
Would you take me with you?
But... now I... have nowhere to take you.
If we are together... it will not be nowhere.
I love you, Rodrigo.
I love you.
You know what you risk... if you come with me, my love?
Since my love is not a man like other men... my life will not be like other lives.
It's only now... only now that I know... how hard the road would've been without you.
Are you the one they call the Cid?
Yes.
Then you must be the beautiful Chimene.
Do you not hate him anymore?
No, I do not.
My father says they'll cut our hands off if we help you.
My father says they have eyes everywhere.
But my father said if you walk very slowly it will soon be dark... and no one will be able to see you if you go into our barn.
I suppose we must leave soon... before it gets too light.
No, one more moment... to remember all of this.
Have you ever slept in a more beautiful bedchamber?
Never.
- Have you ever eaten better food?
- No.
Nor drunk better wine, nor...
I love you.
Dona Chimene, my wife.
I'm so glad, Rodrigo.
So glad.
Must we go?
Of what are you glad?
That you are no longer the King's champion... that you no longer have your knights and your armies... and that you have only me.
We will find some hidden place where you are not known.
Yes, a place like this.
And we will make our lives there.
If all men knew that banishment could be like this... we'd have a world of exiles.
Come.
We'll look for your hidden place... before the others find it.
We'll have a new life now.
Lord God... protect this woman I love... and who is now, finally, my wife.
El Cid!
I am in exile!
Without you, we are all in exile.
I can't take you with me!
You'd lose your homes, your families!
Every man here has already made the choice.
We want you to lead us!
You have no right to ask him!
He has done enough!
- El Cid!
- El Cid!
But why him?
Why?
For Spain!
Spain!
Urraca!
I haven't slept all night.
Every time I close my eyes to sleep...
I dream the same dream over and over.
I'm fighting an enemy whose face I can never see.
I cut him down with my broadsword, he falls.
But when I look down... it isn't my enemy lying at my feet.
It's...
It's my own right arm.
It was only a dream.
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
- Our dream was short.
- I know.
There is no hidden place for a man like you.
There must be thousands who would gladly part.
Why you?
Why me?
Please, let me carry away an image of you smiling.
It would be a lie.
I will beseech God with my prayers.
I will tell Him He must bring you back to me.
I must tell God how much I need you.
Then we will see each other again.
Don Rodrigo.
We have not forgotten or forgiven the wrong you did our Royal person.
But when danger threatens, it is a king's duty... to put the welfare of his subjects above all else.
That is why we summoned you here.
Sire, I have all these years lived... in the hope Your Majesty would call me.
Especially now, since Ben Yusuf has landed on our shores.
Ben Yusuf has challenged us to meet him on the plains of Sagrajas.
Sire, you must not fight at Sagrajas.
- Valencia must first be...
- We have already accepted the challenge.
My liege, you must first take Valencia.
While the Moors hold Valencia...
Ben Yusuf can strike out from there, overrun all Spain.
Your Majesty must not let this happen.
Look, I have brought friends to help you in this fight.
How dare they not kneel to us?
Sire.
These are kings.
They come here as allies.
- We need no such allies.
- We are a Christian kingdom!
We treat only with Christians.
They're ready to fight at your side for Valencia.
They fear Ben Yusuf as we do.
They are your friends.
We do not consider them friends.
Sire!
You risk having no Spain at all!
Don Rodrigo, you will join us at Sagrajas... and we shall annul your banishment and return your lands.
But if you are not at Sagrajas... we shall consider you and yours our enemies!
Don Rodrigo.
I know why you have come.
Your twin daughters are playing in the garden here.
This is your father.
You're Elvira?
Then you must be Sol.
You're Elvira.
You're exactly alike.
I'm tired.
Tired of exile.
Now I can take you home to Vivar... with honors.
I might be wrong to defy the King.
He commanded me to meet him at Sagrajas.
I could be wrong.
If you did not have us, Rodrigo... would you even wonder?
I used to see so many of your hidden places... where I could've lived with you.
And no one would have known.
Have you also found a place... where we could hide from ourselves?
I can't leave you... leave them here unprotected.
But if you do what must be done for all Spain... that will be our best protection.
Our Moorish silks suit well your Christian armor.
You'll make a Moslem of me yet, my lord.
How can anyone say this is wrong?
They will say so, on both sides.
We have so much to give to each other and to Spain.
If we are not destroyed first.
Once we take Valencia, then let Ben Yusuf try.
Valencia is surrounded.
No one here can leave the city or enter it.
Then our weapon is starvation.
May Allah make the siege a short one.
May God help our King Alfonso at Sagrajas.
We could have beaten Ben Yusuf!
With a few more men we could have won!
A handful of knights and victory would have been ours.
Dona Chimene, did you think we would permit your husband to go unpunished?
Would you punish the man who is now Spain's only hope?
What if we were to place Dona Chimene and her children in our deepest dungeons?
Might not the Cid then deliver himself into our hands?
Sire, this is a sanctuary.
There are no sanctuaries for the enemies of Christ!
If you crush him, who then would stand against the invaders of Spain?
It was his fault! If he had come, we would have won.
Sire?
It was not for lack of courage that we lost.
You shall see.
You saw!
I made no sound!
It was not through lack of courage that we lost!
It takes more than courage to make a king.
Tell me his exact words!
The King said he would not release
Chimene and the children.
What does the King expect I'd do?
That I would let my wife and children die in his dungeons?
No! He hopes you will march on Burgos to rescue her.
Burgos! Well, then, shall we disappoint our King?
What do we wait here for?
To Burgos!
My Lord Cid, wait!
My lord, the city is ready to fall.
More and more people are coming over to our side.
After all these months, we cannot leave!
Don't speak to me of Valencia, my Lord Moutamin.
Not now!
Am I not a man, too, like you?
May I not sometimes think of my wife? My children?
Well, then, what must I do?
What must I do?
Everything was taken from you.
How did you bribe the jailer to bring me your message?
With two words: The Cid.
Even all these months in the dungeon... have not marred your beauty.
There are terrible rumors.
They are not rumors.
The Cid has sent an ultimatum to the King.
Unless you and the children are released at once... your husband will march against us here.
Abandon Valencia?
Leave all Spain unprotected?
Yes, Chimene, for you.
Why not?
Help me and the children to escape.
Come with us.
Join Rodrigo.
If I thought it would stop him from coming here...
I would kill myself... and the children.
Then your love is as desperate as mine.
Rodrigo, let me fight at your side.
We have need of such men.
Count Ordonez, we must attack tonight.
Soldiers!
Citizens of Valencia!
We have starved you!
Now you are weak!
But we do not wish to attack you!
We are not your enemies!
Ben Yusuf is your enemy.
He will bring you death and destruction!
People of Valencia... rid yourselves of your leaders!
Join with us!
We bring you peace!
Soldiers and citizens!
We bring you freedom!
We bring you life!
We bring you... bread!
We bring you bread! Bread!
Bread! Bread!
Bread! Bread!
My lord!
El Cid is throwing them food!
Your starving soldiers have deserted the walls and joined the people!
Kill them!
Call out the Black Guard.
Stop them!
Run them down! Kill them!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
The city is yours! Take the crown.
Proclaim yourself king!
All our battles we have fought for you.
We want you to rule us.
My Lord Cid!
We have given up everything for you.
We implore you to take the crown.
I take Valencia... in the name of my Sovereign Lord Alfonso...
King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias... of Sagunto and Almenara... of Castrejon and Alcantara...
King of Christians and Moors.
Valencia for Alfonso... by the grace of God, King of Spain!
King! King! King!
What a noble subject.
If he had only a noble king.
King! King! King!
The crown of Valencia!
The crown of Valencia?
The Cid sends this to me?
What are his conditions?
There are no conditions.
But Chimene... He knew about the dungeon, his children.
He knew.
And yet he sends me the crown.
What kind of man is this?
He wants something.
What is it he wants?
My lord, the Cid has asked for nothing.
But I ask! My lord, the Cid needs your help... to defend Valencia against Ben Yusuf.
No!
Tell your lord, the Cid, that we seek neither his favor nor his help.
Nor can he expect anything from us.
Now go.
Who has done more for you and Spain?
Go!
Look. Now you are also
King of Valencia.
I am king of nothing.
No king at all!
- I will make myself a king!
- Alfonso.
- I will!
- Alfonso!
All men must die.
Why not for a good cause?
What cause of yours could be worth such torture?
The Cid.
The Cid? He is a man like other men.
He will die.
I will kill him.
He'll never die. Never.
You dare think of him as we think of our Prophet?
We do!
Then this will be more than a battle.
It will be our God... against yours!
Where's Ordonez?
I sent him to see if
Ben Yusuf was on the march.
- Hasn't he returned?
- Not yet, my Cid.
Ben Yusuf's armada.
We should attack at dawn before they can all land.
We'll drive a wedge along the shore... and keep his forces split.
Come.
I know, I know.
This is always the hardest time.
When the enemy has no face.
You have been through this a hundred times.
I need to know.
Where do you find your courage?
I wish I knew.
Each warrior each time must find it for himself.
Come.
This is the battle we've waited for so long.
The last battle.
When we've won it, we'll have peace.
Open the gates.
For God, Alfonso and for Spain!
For God, Alfonso and Spain!
The Cid is wounded.
He goes back to Valencia.
The Cid is wounded.
The Cid is wounded.
The Cid is wounded.
The Cid...
No, Fanez.
We attack again tomorrow.
You will need time to recover your strength.
Must be tomorrow.
The enemy will only grow stronger... while we grow weaker.
- But, my lord!
- Tomorrow, Fanez.
Make the preparations.
Go. Cover their retreat. Go!
Close the gates!
Close the gates!
There will be a great loss of blood... but the arrow must be withdrawn immediately.
Will he live?
If the arrow is drawn, he has a chance.
If not, he will be dead within a few days.
Chimene.
I must lead the attack tomorrow.
If the arrow is not withdrawn... it is certain you will die.
Not before tomorrow.
- That's all I need.
- But it's not all I need.
What will there be for you if this battle is lost?
Someone else will lead them.
They have made me their heart.
But their heart is wounded.
It needs to rest.
We could take you to Vivar.
We could cure you.
My love would not let you die.
We have not spent much time together.
Yet it seems to me...
I will not let you.
You will live.
Yet it seems to me that those who have spent a lifetime together... have not had more than we.
I want more!
I want forever!
Oh, the children.
The children.
Chimene... you can't save my life.
You must help me give it up.
Now.
Lord Moutamin.
It is the wish of my husband... that the arrow shall not be removed.
Allah be praised!
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!
Let it be known everywhere the Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
They dare not come out and fight!
Let it be known everywhere the Cid is dead!
I tell you!
The Cid is alive!
He is well!
I have seen him!
He will fight tomorrow!
He will be with us, leading the attack.
I promise! You must...
You must believe me!
The Cid is alive!
- Fanez?
- Yes, my lord.
What are they saying?
All is well, my lord.
Very well.
The people are hopeful.
The army is eager to fight.
You always were a bad liar, Fanez.
Now tell me the truth.
I could not convince them... that you are alive.
El Cid! El Cid!
Cid! Cid!
Cid! Cid!
Soldiers!
People of Valencia!
You must not be frightened... by the sound of a few drums.
In a few hours, they will be silenced forever!
I promise you!
Tomorrow morning...
I will ride with you!
Cid! Cid!
Cid! Cid!
Cid! Cid! Cid!
Cid! Cid! Cid!
- Chimene.
- I am here, Rodrigo. I am here.
Listen to me.
Even if my strength fails me...
- I must lead the attack tomorrow.
- Yes.
I must!
You understand?
I must.
Alive or dead...
I must be on my horse at the head of my soldiers.
You promise... you will do whatever needs to be done?
Yes.
- Promise me.
- I promise, Rodrigo.
I promise.
I promise.
Yes.
I promise.
I promise.
Open the gates!
It's the King!
My lord, the King!
Forgive me, my Cid.
- Forgive me!
- No!
My King kneels to no man!
To no man!
It's not easy for a man to conquer himself.
You have done that.
If only I could live to see Spain at peace.
You will.
You will!
No one can stand against us now.
We'll drive Ben Yusuf back into the sea!
I have not failed.
Spain... has a king.
Tomorrow we will fight side by side.
My King and I.
We will ride out together.
Together.
No!
I will be at your side.
Chimene!
Ah, Chimene.
Chimene.
I promise.
I have not forgotten.
I want you and my children... to remember me riding with my King.
Tomorrow.
For God, the Cid and Spain!
For God, the Cid and Spain!
For God, the Cid and Spain!
And thus the Cid rode out of the gates of history into legend.
Back! Back!
Go back!
Go back!
Heavenly Father, open Your arms to receive the soul... of one who lived and died the purest knight of all.
Achtung!
It was in the Clouvet collection, wasn't it?
It was.
- Do you like it?
- Need you ask?
This is degenerate art, you know.
As a loyal officer of the Third Reich,
I should detest it.
I've often wondered at the curious conceit that would attempt to determine tastes and ideas by decree.
Many times over the past four years
I have wanted to thank you.
For not being what you'd expected?
For saving all this. Protecting it.
Do you feel free to thank me now because the liberation of Paris is so close?
Perhaps.
- It's not necessary.
- I could have been sent away.
Someone else brought in to be in charge of the museum.
Perhaps I should thank you.
I was foolish.
I knew of books being burned.
Other things.
I was terrified that these would be lost.
A book is worth a few francs.
We Germans can afford to destroy those.
We all may not appreciate artistic merit, but cash value is another matter.
You won't convince me that you're cynical.
I know what these paintings mean to you.
You are a perceptive woman.
We're removing the paintings.
- Pack them carefully.
- Where are you taking them?
- To a safe place.
- But no place is as safe as Paris.
The city has been declared open.
It won't be bombed or shelled.
Captain.
I want these at the station tomorrow, crated and ready to be put on the train.
- What about my train?
- It has been canceled, sir.
- Who canceled it?
- I did.
- Who are you?
- Labiche, Colonel. Area Inspector.
Under my supervision, of course.
Since when does a Frenchman have the authority to cancel a German train?
We're making up a special armament train, Colonel.
Highest priority.
- Whose orders?
- Von Rundstedt.
Military Commander, Western Front.
How soon can my train be cleared to leave?
As soon as I get another order.
It's your army, Colonel, not mine.
You'll get the order.
Have the train ready this afternoon at 3.30.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
I'm calling for General Von Lubitz.
I want the line for the
Field Command Headquarters.
Yes, immediately!
Field Command Headquarters?
General Von Lubitz's office calling.
Colonel Müller, please.
I tried to reach you, Colonel Von Waldheim.
The general canceled all appointments not dealing with the evacuation of Paris.
- Is he in? Alone?
- Yes, Colonel, but I have orders not to let anyone in...
- What is it, Colonel?
- A train I ordered was canceled.
I've been advised your personal authorization is now required.
Signal from General Von Rundstedt, sir.
The highway between Avranches and Mortain has been cut by the Americans.
You can make application through normal channels.
You once said normal channels were a trap, in which to snare officers who lacked initiative.
What's your cargo?
I don't share your enthusiasm for art.
Even if I did, it would not be centered on this degenerate trash.
Nor would I expect priority over vitally needed war transport.
Good morning, Colonel.
The second SS armored division has fallen back towards Falaise.
Report on their remaining effective strength.
Might it not be unwise to leave a billion gold reichsmarks in the Bank of France?
Enough money to equip ten panzer divisions?
Make your point, Colonel.
Money is a weapon.
The contents of that train are as negotiable as gold, and more valuable.
I feel Berlin would prefer it in the hands of the Third Reich.
I must warn you, Colonel.
If conditions at the front become more critical,
I will rescind this authorization.
When will you be ready?
Train will be ready to leave tomorrow morning at 9:15, Major.
Come in. Come in.
This is Mademoiselle Villard from the Jeu de Paume, the museum.
I brought her with me.
Mademoiselle Villard has a problem.
- I thought your group might help her.
- It's not to help me.
You understand?
The paintings belong to France.
- Paintings?
- The train you are preparing for the Colonel.
He's stealing a load of pictures.
You should hear what they're worth!
- It's not just the money.
- What does she want us to do?
- She wants us to blow up the train.
- Oh, no! No, you misunderstand.
They must not even be damaged.
They could never be replaced.
They're not just...
Here, I have the list.
Renoirs, Cézannes, 64 Picassos, 29 Braques.
Degas, Matisse.
He chose very carefully.
Only the best. The national heritage.
- What do you want us to do, madame?
- Mademoiselle.
Well, I thought, perhaps, if you could just stop the train.
Stopping the train is not simple, mademoiselle.
- You can get killed stopping a train.
- Especially if you are French, and the train is German.
I know. I realize.
But soon Paris will be free, isn't that true?
But if the paintings are not here...
Our latest report is that the Allies will be in Paris within a week.
Maybe three or four days.
Von Waldheim has to get the train out before that.
Can we slow it down? Delay it?
What do you think?
We can blow it up. Maybe.
Put some plastique under the cars and blow it up.
They'd shoot a few hostages, but that's the price you pay.
- Are your paintings that important?
- She doesn't want it blown up.
London agrees the art is important.
Anything we can do to save it.
But they leave it up to us.
Why not? What can they lose?
This morning we had four men left in this group.
Now we are three. One, two, three.
- Bernard?
- We started with 18.
Like your paintings, mademoiselle, we couldn't replace them.
For certain things, we take the risk.
But I won't waste lives on paintings.
But they wouldn't be wasted.
Excuse me.
I know that's a terrible thing to say.
But those paintings are part of France.
The Germans want to take them away.
They've taken our land, our food.
They live in our houses.
And now they're trying to take our art.
This beauty, this vision of life born out of France.
Our special vision. Our trust.
We hold it in trust. Don't you see?
For everyone. This is our pride.
What we create and hold for the world.
There are worse things to risk your life for than that.
I'm sorry, mademoiselle. We can't help you.
The train goes through his section.
It's up to him.
Don't you have copies of 'em?
Excuse me for taking your time.
I respect you for what you are doing.
I hope none of you will be harmed.
- She's a nice lady.
- What happened to Bernard?
I had a cup of coffee with him early this morning.
They came into the yards and picked him up, with some refugees.
I saw the whole thing.
They just came into the yards and picked him up.
I thought we came here to talk about the armament train.
It's a big one, huh, Labiche?
When does it leave?
9:15 tomorrow morning, on the dot.
They must be desperate to risk a daylight run.
Tell me the schedule.
It'll arrive at the yards at Vaires by 9:45.
Five minutes to switch on the armored engine and pick up the antiaircraft crews.
It should be on its way by ten minutes of ten, no later.
It would be nice if it were delayed for ten minutes.
British planes will hit the yard at Vaires tomorrow morning at 10:00.
Saturation bombing.
If the train was in the yard at that time...
Ten minutes? It won't be easy.
Can you do it?
- At the moment, I'm not sure how.
- That's up to you.
The planes will bomb at exactly 10:00.
Will the train be there or not?
We'll have it waiting.
I wonder where he'll be at 10:00.
Where I'd like to be. In his office.
- I don't like it.
- Who does?
I mean the art train.
If the Germans want it so much, maybe we should do something.
Forget the art train.
We'll have enough to do tomorrow.
Which reminds me, I'll need another engineer for the art train.
- I'll have to give it to Papa Boule.
- Papa Boule?
- Not Papa Boule!
- I have no choice. Who else is there?
It's an easy run.
The train doesn't leave till dark.
It'll be in Germany by morning.
See you later.
Don't just slap the oil on anywhere, damn it!
Look where the hell you're putting it.
This machine was running before you were born.
She's like a woman. If you don't treat her just right, she'll make your life miserable.
Take this. Do it right, for God's sake.
Because I'll be back to check after I've had my coffee.
Now remember. A grease job is not a bath.
Papa.
A cup.
I see Labiche is finally giving you a train.
- And all the way to Germany.
- Some train.
You see any artillery?
A load that a man can feel is important?
That might change the war, huh?
Any important shipment goes to the front.
Boule.
Have you read what's in those crates?
I don't believe anything they write.
Paintings! Open a case.
You'll find champagne, perfume and everything else they stole from us.
I've talked to one of the truck drivers.
These are paintings.
- So what?
- Great art. Picasso. Gauguin. Renoir.
Renoir. I used to know a girl who modeled for Renoir.
She smelled of paint.
Boule, you are a good engineer, you have told me so.
But in matters of culture, you are sadly deficient.
Champagne and perfume can be replaced.
Not art.
- These paintings are important.
- Really?
The glory of France.
Glory of France?
And to think, two days, three at the most, the Allies should be here.
The Nazis wouldn't have the train.
Maybe even one day...
- Are you the engineer?
- Does he look like an engineer?
You will not leave the station tonight.
Stand by your engine, ready to leave at a moment's notice.
- Pig!
- Be careful how you talk to them.
I'm too old to be careful.
- The glory of France.
- Huh? Oh, yes.
The glory of France.
Give me the change in franc pieces.
Engineer!
Start the engine!
Heil Hitler.
Loaded and ready, sir.
Very good, Schmidt.
- What time do you leave?
- As soon as it's dark, sir.
Colonel Von Waldheim!
Telephone call, sir.
General Von Lubitz's headquarters!
The officer says it's urgent.
Colonel Von Waldheim speaking.
Yes, Major.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Let's hope the reverses at the front are temporary.
Yes, of course I understand.
The general explained it might be necessary to rescind the authorization for my train.
Unfortunately, I can't help you.
The train left over half an hour ago, and is now on its way to Germany.
Please express my regrets to the general.
In view of the fact that you've already left, Schmidt,
I think perhaps you'd better get aboard and order the train out immediately, huh?
- Yes, sir!
- Have a good trip, Schmidt.
Start the train! Start the train!
Move the train!
Boule! Start the train.
Start the train!
Uncouple that engine! Get it out of here!
Is the armored engine ready?
Yes, sir.
The antiaircraft crews are all aboard.
Move your engine. Get it out of here!
Hey, you! You pig!
- What?
- Who did that?
The steam is released or the engine blows up.
- Which do you want?
- You did it on purpose.
What is this?
Take your assigned position.
Back of the cab.
- Everything all right?
- Move your engines...
- It's okay.
- Go back. I want this train out of here!
Okay.
- What's going on down there, Labiche?
- Sabotage.
Throw five.
Throw eight.
Throw ten.
- Throw ten.
- It's stuck!
Don't force it.
- Stop!
- Hey! Hey!
Hey! Stop!
Stop! You're on the wrong track!
Don't play games with me, Labiche.
I know sabotage when I...
What is it?
But I...
Give me the switch tower.
Dietrich! What the hell is going on up there?
You idiot! You get those switches working!
We have got to get this train out of here!
I'm tired of your inefficiency, Dietrich!
You can't ride through an air raid!
Watch me! Fire up that engine!
You old goat!
Get out of there and get under cover!
- Get off my train!
- You fool! It'll rain bombs any second!
Get off my train!
- You can't go! The switch is closed!
- Open it!
What is it?
What is it?
Engineer!
- What is it?
- The oil line.
Can you fix it?
- Can we run it back to Vaires?
- Maybe, but just the engine.
Where's the phone?
Start the pump.
The repair of my train is to take top priority, Major.
This whole yard needs repair, Colonel.
I'll see to your engine as soon as I can.
- You'll see to it at once.
- I have my orders. I'll do what I can.
I've given you an order.
I take full responsibility.
- What happened?
- Fault in the oil line.
I'll take care of it.
Hand me the spanner.
Take over the crane engine.
Boule!
Boule!
Come here.
Come here!
- Take off the oil caps.
- I'll do it.
He will do it. Go on.
- You can settle the blame for this later.
- One moment, please, sir.
Turn out your pants pockets.
Slick with oil.
Sabotage, Colonel.
It's an old trick around here.
They slip in franc pieces and cut off the oil supply.
- You should have thrown them away.
- Four francs are four francs.
Major, please. It's not important.
I'll have the engine fixed overnight.
I'll work on it myself.
Take him away.
Colonel! Stop them.
Wait.
Colonel. He slowed up your train for a few hours but he saved it.
He took it through the bombs at the risk of his own life.
He's an old man.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
I'll get your train through for you.
He's just a foolish old man.
His train! His!
It's my train.
I know what I'm doing.
Do you? Huh? You'll help them.
I practically raised you, but you're no better than they are.
Swine!
Colonel! What can you gain by the death of one old man?
- What he did can make no difference.
- Achtung! Feuer!
You can stop...
You will deliver that engine to me personally.
I'm holding you responsible.
Simon!
Turn on the forced-draft.
Hurry it up! We're working on a locomotive, not a pocket watch!
Hubert! Take down the grate.
Didont... What are you doing here?
- Where's Hubert?
- I decided to go along as fireman.
You damn fools.
You lookin' to be shot too?
- Papa Boule wanted it stopped.
- Papa Boule! Papa Boule is dead!
- Stop acting like children.
- Don't be mad, Paul. We want to do this.
Listen, you idiots.
The war'll be over in a few days.
Now leave it alone.
You get caught up in something...
You can't leave it alone.
- You know how it is.
- We'll get away with it, Paul.
All contacts have been made except at Metz, and you have to call Metz.
Maurice won't go along with us until he talks to you.
Oh, you know Maurice. He's stubborn.
To hell with you. To hell with both of you.
You wanna be killed, I can't stop you.
We will be killed if you don't call Maurice.
Labiche! Are you taking the night off?
It'll be ready in a couple of hours, by morning.
I'll take it through after dark.
When it's ready get it out of here.
Deliver it.
- In broad daylight?
- Deliver it.
That engine has blocked work on four trains for the front.
The Colonel gave orders for it to be given top priority. He's got it.
For all I care, it could be shot full of holes, and his precious train with it.
Move it!
Spitfire.
- No! No, Didont!
- Not us! Not us!
Not us! Not us!
This is the last job. The last one.
When we get to Rive-Reine,
I'll make that call to Maurice.
- What happened?
- Allied aircraft, ten miles back.
Any serious damage?
Any serious damage?
Not enough to stop you from getting to Germany.
Camouflage the engine. Schwartz!
Your engine and your crew.
Was it your clever idea to risk this engine in a daylight run?
Major Herren was following your orders to the letter.
I admire your efficiency, Labiche, and your sense of survival.
I don't suppose you have much trouble with saboteurs, do you?
Tell me, Labiche.
Do you think there will be sabotage attempts on this train?
I'm a railroad man, not a prophet.
Prophecy is not required, only determination.
This train will get through to Germany.
You agree, don't you, Labiche?
What do you want me to do, Colonel?
Give you a guarantee?
I'll settle for a partial guarantee.
You, Labiche.
You'll drive the engine.
The engineer's been assigned.
My orders are to return to Vaires.
Stay with the engine. Keep steam up.
You can go now. You're not needed.
I've worked all night on this engine.
I haven't slept for two days.
I'll fall asleep at the control.
You'll leave at 7:00.
I think you should rest until then.
Take him to the hotel.
He is to stay there until he returns here at seven.
Sleep well.
My bicycle.
Your transportation to Paris.
Danke.
- A room for this man.
- Identity card, please.
- 60 francs.
- Pay her.
You pay her.
I'm a guest of the German army.
- He is a railroad man.
- 60 francs.
- Isn't there a discount for railroad men?
- 60 francs.
Top of the stairs, first door on the right.
The sheets are clean.
Thank you.
Labiche!
You heard the Colonel. Seven o'clock.
Get some rest.
Would like to tuck me in?
Call me at 6:45.
Pesquet.
One German in the office with Jacques.
Give me about two minutes.
Where are you going?
Back in the engine. Use your coal pile.
- What started this?
- We don't know, sir.
You aren't all needed.
Get back to the train.
- Where's Labiche?
- I put him in the hotel, sir.
A few minutes ago.
- Sergeant!
- You two, come!
Labiche!
Labiche!
Break it down.
Look in the cellar!
- Why are you breaking down my door?
- Labiche, where is he?
Who's your commanding officer?
Captain!
Mademoiselle, come here!
How long has he been here?
Since soup, cabbage and potatoes.
Thank you.
I don't want your thanks.
If they'd caught me helping you,
I would have been shot.
I know. I'm sorry.
You think you can run in here and make trouble?
I run a hotel, not a madhouse.
Who's going to pay for the door and the lock?
Do you think money grows on trees?
- There's a war.
- You talk about the war.
I'll talk about what it costs.
I'll be leaving in a few hours.
You can go back to your good customers.
They pay. That's what I'm in business for.
You should be paid.
- How much for the damage?
- 100 francs.
How much for saving my life?
Who did it?
I'm not sure. I can't remember.
I was struck!
You're lying!
Enough, Pilzer.
If you tell the truth, you'll live.
Now, what does he look like?
Colonel, I can't remember!
A big man.
A gray suit.
A hat, I think.
Sir, Labiche never left the hotel.
Let him go.
Do you want some coffee?
It goes with the room.
No extra charge.
What's your name?
Labiche, the Colonel is waiting.
Christine.
Did you get through?
- Jacques, is the track all clear up ahead?
- All the way to Germany.
Sleep well, Labiche?
Like a baby, Colonel.
I trust this time the bearings are well-oiled?
Why don't you check them yourself?
Sergeant!
Sergeant Schwartz will ride with you.
The last town before entering Germany will be St. Avold.
You will stop there for Captain Schmidt to telephone a report to me.
A pleasant trip, Captain.
Is that clear?
I will stop at St. Avold.
Have you ever been to Germany, Labiche?
No, Colonel.
You should find the experience interesting.
A chance to broaden your horizon.
All right, stationmaster.
Just keep out of my way.
Stop at St. Avold, we'll get our heads blown off.
Get me Commercy, please.
I don't have a direct line.
This is railroad business!
What's the matter?
Your army regulations.
Montmirail.
Châlons.
Hello, Metz? It's on time.
Hello, Metz? Rive-Reine.
Is that you, Maurice?
Where is he?
When will he be back?
Have him call Jacques at Rive-Reine as soon as possible.
Yes, it's important.
Thank you.
- What time will you be home, Uncle?
- When I get home, I'll be home!
I'm sitting enjoying myself!
Drinking, playing cards, having a good time.
You can see that, can't you?
Aunt Helene wanted to know.
Robert.
I'm a bad tempered old man.
Why are we slowing down?
Are you blind? There's been an air raid.
We slow down for switching.
What are you going to do?
I don't want to stop at St. Avold.
You wanna go to Germany?
Jacques will send word.
This is taking us south.
I said this is taking us south!
You saw the main tracks are blown up.
We have to go around the bend in the river.
What's the next town on your map?
Rémilly.
Keep your eyes open.
Your horizon's about to be broadened.
Rive-Reine.
Ah, Maurice.
You have a direct line to Commercy.
Right. Call them.
My wife's cousin has some cheese for me.
It could be put on the midnight train when it stops at Commercy.
Yes. Yes, Maurice.
The train will stop, to unload passengers.
Good.
I'll save a piece of cheese for you.
Railroad business, huh?
Next stop, St. Avold, sir.
Do we run?
Sergeant. Can we stretch our legs?
All right. Get down.
Corporal, watch them.
You! Where's the telephone?
Sergeant!
Nobody leaves the train.
We will stop here only for two minutes.
Ja, Captain.
Tell Jacques the cheese on the train.
And to save a piece for Pierre and Raoul.
Hello, Colonel.
Colonel, we are at St. Avold.
Yes, Colonel.
What's it like here in St. Avold?
Well?
I know what you mean.
I'll be glad to get back to Berlin.
- Schwartz!
- Yes, Captain?
- We go.
- Get up.
Auf Wiedersehen.
We are home, Tauber.
We are in Germany.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.
You're crazy! Why did you mean speeding into a curve like that?
- But you told me to go ahead, didn't you?
- Yes, but at full speed?
What do you mean?
Hey, you should have signaled to go slow!
How should I know?
You're just as big a fool as your brother, and he's the worst I ever saw!
Look at my rails!
How close?
Two minutes.
Good luck.
If anything happens, if we get separated,
I'll meet you at the old farmhouse above the river.
Take the stick.
Halt!
Pilzer! Get Labiche!
Yes, sir.
Get him! Kill him, kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
No. No, you can't stay here.
Fire!
Pilzer!
- How soon will the cranes be here?
- Major Herren is on his way now, sir.
Everything that can be done without heavy equipment will be completed by dark.
Put more men to work.
I want it done faster.
But, Colonel, till the crane can move the engines...
Yes, Colonel.
Sir! No sign of Labiche, sir.
We searched the woods for hours.
We can't find him anywhere.
- I've had two squads looking...
- I want him!
- He could have gone back to Paris.
- No.
He's around somewhere, I know.
He'll twist and turn.
He'll hide and make his plans.
But he won't leave the train.
I'm beginning to know him.
Keep looking for him! Search the town.
I've brought you some clothes.
- How's your leg?
- Much better, thank you.
- What's going on out there?
- You should know.
Engines and cars all over the tracks.
Rails torn.
Any reprisals?
Do you think they'd declare a holiday?
Jacques, the stationmaster, and an engineer shot.
Another engineer, the thin one, was shot trying to escape.
Pesquet.
There'll be others.
Labiche. Have you seen the man, Labiche?
- Labiche?
- Yes, Labiche!
He was in room five.
He left yesterday!
Yes, he left yesterday.
I know that. I know he left yesterday!
I want to know if you have seen him here today!
Labiche, Labiche. Yes, I've seen Labiche.
I see him every day.
And General de Gaulle too.
They're my best customers and I keep them cool in the wine cellar.
Please.
Why did you come back here?
Do you want everyone killed?
Maybe you think you're a hero.
Maybe you don't care if you live.
What right have you to do this?
Leave us alone.
I knew Jacques all my life.
He and his wife sat with me when my husband was killed, the first year of the war.
And now I sit with her.
Men are such fools.
Men want to be heroes and their widows mourn.
Perhaps men are fools.
There were over a hundred involved in stopping that train.
Switchmen, brakemen, yard gangs, stationmasters.
God knows how many will be shot, like Jacques.
You know what's on that train?
Paintings. That's right, paintings. Art.
The national heritage. The pride of France.
Crazy, isn't it?
It's quiet up there.
Where are you going?
Perhaps I can leave now.
You can't take two steps in daylight.
They're looking for you everywhere.
My friend who was with me on the train,
I have to meet him.
He may not even be alive.
It won't help him if you're killed.
Wait until it's dark.
Eat your food.
It's a sin to waste bread.
Ready? Take it up.
Put it on its side over there.
Major!
Can't you move any faster?
This is a hell of a mess you have got here, Colonel.
We're doing the best we can.
I asked for two cranes.
It took an order by staff headquarters to get this one.
With Von Rundstedt falling back, the army has other uses for railway equipment.
All Von Rundstedt can lose is men.
This train is more valuable.
It's all right.
At Commercy, they shot the stationmaster.
At Metz, they took hostages.
Ten of them. Shot them on the spot.
Kids, mostly.
You know Lefevre, the inspector there?
His kid, the one with asthma?
They cured it for him.
At Châlons, three dead.
That's all I know so far.
Pesquet was right.
This was his last job.
What about the train?
It'll be ready to move tomorrow.
Where the hell are the Allies?
What are they taking, the tourist route to Paris?
I'll believe them when I see them.
In case they don't come.
Labiche, it's me!
- Who's with you?
- Robert, Jacques' nephew.
Come in.
I'm glad to see you're still alive.
You're to be complimented.
That was quite a job you did.
Where are the Allies?
What shape is the train in?
It'll be repaired by morning.
Thank you.
- When does it leave Rive-Reine?
- It won't move in daylight.
Where are the Allies?
It has been arranged for a French division to reach Paris first. A gesture.
A gesture?
They can make gestures?
Let them make one for Pesquet or Jacques.
That kid of Lefevre's, he'd appreciate a gesture.
What do you intend to do?
This is what we intend to do, plastique.
What we should have done in the first place.
Tomorrow night, no Allies, we blow the train to hell.
London wants the train saved.
What do they want us to do?
Stop it with our bare hands?
Lay down across the tracks?
Right after dawn, all switching tracks and trains in the area will be bombed.
The art train is not to be destroyed.
Orders are to mark it so the planes will pass it up.
- Mark it?
- White paint, on the top of the first three cars.
London has decided the paintings must not be damaged.
Save it?
For Von Waldheim? Make him a present?
To hell with London.
We started this whole thing for one reason.
To stop the train because the Allies were going to be here.
Where are they?
Every day they've been due.
And every day, a man has been killed for thinking they were just over the hill.
I say to hell with it!
Now they want us to paint the train?
Let 'em blow it up!
Paul.
It'd be too bad if it got blown up.
That is, if it could be saved.
Papa Boule, Pesquet, the others, they wanted it saved.
And they're dead, and they'll never know.
But we will.
White paint. Just the first three cars.
I can find my way back.
You know what it's like down there?
There are Germans all over the place.
You haven't got a chance!
I'll figure something.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna walk up to the Germans and tell them you want to paint the train so it will look nice when it gets to Germany?
Don't you see? It's hopeless.
Those cars have been needing a coat of paint ever since the war started.
You crazy bastard.
Who are you gonna get to help you?
Have you thought of that?
Who are you gonna get to help you?
Me.
I can fight.
That's two of us. A small army.
- What do you shoot with this?
- Rabbits.
You're not fighting rabbits.
How well do you know the station in Rive-Reine?
- Have you got a plan?
- Shut up.
- I lived there all my life.
- Can you get some men to help?
Not in Rive-Reine.
They're all working on the tracks.
Even I serve food to the soldiers.
Other towns?
Montmirail.
Uncle Jacques had friends there, railroad men. I can get them.
- And paint?
- Yes. And brushes too.
See about the men and the paint.
Be back an hour before dawn.
With luck, no one will be hurt.
No one's ever hurt. Just dead.
Paul, have you ever seen any of those paintings on the train?
I haven't.
You know, when it's over,
I think maybe we should take a look.
Alarm!
Herren!
Lights!
Pilzer!
Didont, get off! Get off!
Didont! Didont, run, run!
Not thunder, Colonel. Artillery.
How close?
Ten miles, perhaps fifteen.
88s I think.
Our guns falling back, retreating.
When will you be finished?
Half an hour.
Does it matter?
You can't take the train out in daylight.
The Allies could be here before night.
Possibly. But a moving train has no chance.
Colonel, get down! Get down!
Why?
The paint, Herren. It's a signal.
They're not going to bomb the train.
Don't scrape it off. Leave it there.
It's my ticket to Germany.
After him! Search the woods!
Wait!
Colonel, while they search the woods,
Labiche can blow another section of the track.
And another and another.
Do you suggest he will stop if we let him run free?
He could have blown up the engine.
The hostages you put aboard prevented that.
I can have this repaired in less than an hour.
Keep Labiche away from the train for the next four or five miles, till we reach Montmirail, then we will leave him behind.
Labiche or the train.
Which do you want, Colonel?
Hier.
Stop!
Bring over the rails!
Now up! Good!
Come here.
I think I saw something.
Stop here!
I'll ride the front to Montmirail.
Ten miles an hour, no more.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Major!
Yes, Colonel?
Can we get this back on the rails?
The crane is in Paris by now.
Without a crane, impossible.
Nothing is impossible!
Get the men to work!
I want this engine back on the rails!
If we had ten times as many men it couldn't be done.
I tell you it will!
Do you hear me? I tell you it will!
It's hopeless, Colonel.
Unload those paintings!
All of you, start to unload them at once!
Go on, now, Schwartz.
Come on. Get to work!
Unload the crates!
Stop!
Come on, hurry up!
Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Get your men off the trucks, Lieutenant.
- Sir, we have orders...
- I want those trucks.
- But, sir...
I don't care about your orders.
Do as I say!
Off the trucks!
Off the trucks!
Come on!
Off the trucks!
Heil!
Move back! Back in your trucks!
Back! Move back!
Back in the trucks!
Back in the trucks!
- What the hell's going on here?
- Him.
I need your trucks, Major.
All of them.
I have a cargo to deliver to Germany.
It's of vital importance.
There's a French armored division just over that hill.
- What about my men?
- I don't care about your men!
I order you to unload those trucks!
Save your orders, Colonel.
In this sector the war is over.
- Back in the trucks!
- I'll have you shot!
Back in the trucks!
Herren! Shoot that man!
He is to be executed for gross insubordination!
Unload the trucks!
Herren! I gave you an order!
Move! Go! Schnell! Schnell! Schnell!
Out!
We have lost, Colonel.
It's hopeless.
Look at those men.
A defeated army.
Lost, Herren?
Lost?
Ja.
Come on!
- You want transport?
- Thank you.
- I have 50 men.
- Tell them to move fast.
Schwartz! Bring the men on the double!
We are moving out!
Grote, get the men in the trucks.
We are moving out.
All of you get in the trucks!
In the trucks!
Drop the paintings and get in the trucks!
Gunther!
Stop.
Colonel.
You go on, Herren.
There is nothing to stay for, Colonel.
You're a good officer, Herren.
I'll be along in a few minutes.
There'll be other trucks.
Labiche!
Here's your prize, Labiche.
Some of the greatest paintings in the world.
Does it please you, Labiche?
Do you feel a sense of excitement in just being near them?
A painting means as much to you as a string of pearls to an ape.
You won by sheer luck.
You stopped me without knowing what you were doing, or why.
You are nothing, Labiche.
A lump of flesh.
The paintings are mine.
They always will be.
Beauty belongs to the man who can appreciate it.
They will always belong to me or to a man like me.
Now, this minute, you couldn't tell me why you did what you did.
- Good morning, Excellency.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
- Alfeo.
- Stefano.
Everyone was shocked at my coming here.
They think I'm trying to steal your show.
You've helped make it.
I thought I wouldn't see you till the ceremony at St. Peter's.
I won't be there.
I'm going to Warsaw tonight to meet with the Cardinals of Vienna... and I won't be back till you've left for America.
So I thought I would take this chance to tell you... well, nothing really... just to have a look at you and our old school... and slip out of here as inconspicuously as I can.
I'm glad you decided to forget protocol.
I would have hated not seeing you at all.
- Especially the way things look.
- Yes.
Poland seems to be Hitler's next target.
Once again, we may have a war to separate us.
God bless you, Stefano.
Father Fermoyle.
Your Excellency.
It's a day of glory, Stefano... though I don't like to think how long it may be before we see each other again.
I don't know when
I'll ever be back in Rome... but perhaps you'll come to Boston some day, or New York.
It's possible, when this war is over.
I'm more likely to travel in my new post at the Vatican... than I was as a seminary lector.
But, you'll come back to Rome.
Most parish priests in America don't get the chance.
You will not be like most parish priests.
I've read your new chapters.
And as usual, I think they are splendid.
But as usual... that hasn't stopped me from writing... almost as many pages of notes as there are in the manuscript.
- You must finish this book, Stefano.
- I intend to.
I just hope wherever I'm sent, it isn't too far from a decent library.
You will manage, even in America.
Over the years...
I had very few students with your special talents.
Not only scholarship.
I've watched how you handle people.
I have even watched how you handle me.
If you noticed, then it wasn't very skillful.
I am an unusually observant man.
Seriously, Stefano, I expect a lot from you.
You have a fine mind, and a way of coming to grips with life... that is, well, Roman.
Your Excellency couldn't have chosen a word to flatter me more.
But you also have a drive that can be described only as American.
It makes a good mixture.
We need that drive over here.
We need it now, in this war... if the Kaiser and his partners are ever to be defeated.
Do you think it will happen that way,
America join the Allies?
As an Italian, I hope so, but... what a nation will do is hard to predict.
Even for a member of the Vatican Diplomatic Corps?
As of today, I'm still a teacher... and I make predictions only about my students.
You know the ring I wear?
This one also was designed by Dolcettiano... in the great days of Florence.
Three times in as many centuries... there have been two bishops at once in the Quarenghi family to wear them.
But when my brother died... that was the end of the tradition.
I want you to have his ring, Stefano.
I couldn't.
A bishop's ring?
Not for now.
For when the day comes.
Keep it for then.
There he is! Steve!
- Do you see him?
- Steve!
Okay, Father, go ahead.
Florrie.
Hello, Frank.
Monie!
Is that really my little sister?
Notice anything different?
As a priest, I guess I should say no... but I'm not supposed to tell lies, either.
Where's Dad?
I hear the clergy travels free of charge on Dennis Fermoyle's car.
Is that a fact, now?
The hell, you say!
Steve!
Hello, Dad.
Look at him now, will you?
Stiff as a board, he is, in that fine Italian suit.
But no matter, we'll soon wilt the
Roman starch from that collar of yours.
Dad's already talked to his old buddy,
Monsignor Monaghan.
"Don't make it too easy for my boy,"
Dad said...
"not good for his character."
I said no such thing.
He made him promise not to promote you to bishop the first day.
But you're going to be, aren't you?
He can't avoid it.
It's nearly impossible to make cardinal, unless you're a bishop first.
Now pay your fares, the lot of you.
This is no politician looking after his own.
You get no favors from your father on the Boston Municipal.
How well the new plaster and wood matches the old.
They all comment on it, Corny.
And what do you say to that?
The job was done by the Cornelius
J. Deegan Construction Company... without charge, as a donation to the parish.
That's telling 'em, Monsignor... but let me give you some of my cards for next time it comes up.
They remember the name better if they see it written.
Thank you.
I'll see they find their way to the right pockets.
You do that.
I was forgetting to mention our drive for a new heating system.
You mentioned it.
You'll be posting a list of the contributors, no doubt.
So I have to give what people expect from a Papal Knight.
I don't know if you knew, Stephen,
I was sent a decoration from the Pope.
Knights of Malta.
Yes, my father wrote me about it.
Did he, now?
And how's old Din coming along?
Bursting out of his britches, I daresay, with pride over you.
Give him my best, will you?
And tell him it's the old days
I'm missing yet... before I was rich enough to become the white-headed boy of this parish.
Look at the size of it, will you?
Raising money is a necessary part of running a parish, I guess.
If that fancy training of yours didn't cover the care in handling of millionaires... what is it they were teaching you, then?
I specialized in ecclesiastical history... the Reformation period, what led up to it... which meant learning German, as well as Italian, of course.
German, as well as Italian, huh?
Yes, in fact, I've been working on a book about the causes of the Reformation... and the Council of Trent and the Counter Reformation.
Council of Trent?
I feel that the churchmen at the time... were late in recognizing both the growth of nationalism... and the development of scientific thought, and that hastened the Reformation.
That's the thing that did it, was it?
Of course, nothing is ever quite that simple or straightforward, but...
I disagree, Father.
Let me give you an example.
The year is 1917, and this is the city of Boston.
Boston, not Rome.
You understand the difference.
That is the church of St. John's... and you are the new curate here.
All simple, straightforward facts, are they not?
Yes, Monsignor.
I don't suppose during the course of your elegant education... you ever drove a milk wagon.
- No.
- I did, as a lad... and I learned how to tell a good milk-wagon horse 10 blocks away.
You get my meaning, Father?
She's a milk-wagon horse I'll be wanting for a curate, Father.
We don't need any racehorses at St. John's.
The Monsignor... quite a man, isn't he?
Yes, he is quite a manager.
They don't call him
"Dollar Bill" Monaghan for nothing.
You'll not find the likes of him in Rome.
So, which is it that you want to be... a historian or a diplomat, like your Roman friend...
Bishop Quarenghi.
Or a good priest, like Bill Monaghan?
Both.
But if you had to make a choice between the two?
A good priest.
The very best priest in all the world?
The best priest in the world.
And how do you expect to be that... when already you are committing the sin of pride even to think it?
Frank, will you stop that noise?
Don't you get enough of that... playing in those Scully Square movie parlors... till the Lord knows what hour of the night?
Don't worry about me, Dad.
I get plenty of sleep during the day.
Steve, listen to this. It's a new one.
Dinner's ready.
Shouldn't we wait for Mona?
She's due back from the library any minute.
The library?
Is that where she told you she was going?
What you do mean by that, Florrie?
I mean, she is more likely out with lkie Rampbell.
His name's not lkie, it's Benny.
What's the difference?
There are enough Catholic boys in this parish... without you having to run around with a rag-picking Jew.
He's not a ragpicker.
He is studying to be a dentist
He's still a Jew.
I'm sick and tired of having to do all the work around here... while she is out with that sheeny boyfriend of hers.
You like it better not having any boyfriend at all?
Slut!
Will you go up to Mona, Steve?
You've always had a special way with her.
Yes, you talk to Mona, Steve.
I'll talk to Florrie.
Monie?
It's me, Steve.
Monie.
Put your arms around me.
Remember the bear hugs you used to give me... and I'd take you down Crescent Hill on my double runner?
Before we'd start, I'd show you how to put your arms around me... and I'd say:
"No matter what happens, just hang on to me."
And you'd say, "I'll hang on, Steve."
What am I gonna do?
I'm in love with Benny.
I want to marry him.
Has he asked you?
Yes.
I asked him to wait.
He won't wait forever.
The difference in faith. It doesn't matter?
Only if it matters to you, Steve.
Does it matter?
I'd like to meet Benny.
Would you bring him over to the rectory one of these days?
I'm so glad you're back.
You're gonna fix everything.
I'm so glad you're home.
- Father, I've got a bet.
- What about?
Chick, here, says that only Catholics can get into heaven.
Everyone knows Protestants can't go to heaven.
Why can't Protestants go to heaven?
Does anyone have an answer for that?
- Father!
- Father!
'Cause they ain't Catholics.
How does that strike the rest of you?
He's right!
You're all wrong.
The Catholic Church teaches that it's possible for anyone...
Protestant, Mohammedan, Jew... anyone who does God's will according to his conscience to go to heaven.
Then what's the use of going to all this trouble to be Catholic?
Yes, Father, what's the use?
We'll take that up next Sunday.
I think we've all had enough for today.
Steve.
This is Benny Rampbell.
- How do you do, Benny?
- How do you do, Father?
The kid had a point there, don't you think?
Have you ever thought about becoming Catholic?
You know... my parents aren't too keen on the idea of my marrying a Christian, either.
Couldn't we just get married, and then try to convert each other?
No, you couldn't.
For Mona to marry you at all, she'd need special dispensation... and you'd have to pledge not to interfere with the practice of her religion... and raise your children as Catholics.
That's not exactly treating the two things as equal, is it?
It would be hypocritical if we did.
We happen to believe our church is the only true one.
If you're right, then your rules make sense.
I'm glad you think so.
And, if you're right, then a guy'd be a fool not to join up.
Would you, Benny?
Steve, I'm in love with your sister.
I want to marry her.
So, if my becoming a Catholic will make that easier...
I'll give it a try.
Benny, I love you.
- Steve, you did it!
- Not yet.
You'll have to work pretty hard.
No Sunday school stuff for me.
I'm up to my neck in what you call perfidious darkness.
We'll do our best to turn on the light.
But hasn't Darwin put the skids to Genesis?
If he's done it for us, he's done it for the Jewish faith, too.
Listen, if I was a good Jew,
I wouldn't be here.
I don't see how anyone can square this
Adam-and-Eve business with evolution.
Why not?
Good afternoon, Monsignor.
- Father. Benny.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How're you getting along?
- All right, I guess.
Go ahead, don't let me bother you.
Father Fermoyle was asking you,
"Why not?"
Because they are mutually exclusive.
Not if you separate what is essential in the Bible.
What affects matters of faith from... the names and physical details that don't have to be taken literally.
Dogma is that there is one pair of first parents... from whom all mankind is descended.
That truth remains... whether or not evolution was the method by which God chose to create them.
I've been working on a similar question that came up when...
Copernicus and Galileo... made their discoveries about the mechanics of the universe.
What's that?
It's a book I've been writing... in my spare time.
I borrowed a quote on the subject from Bishop Quarenghi, my teacher.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
That makes everything clear.
The Bible teaches not how the heavens go... but how to go to heaven.
A pretty phrase, Father... but aren't you getting a bit away from the usual instruction?
- Benny's a tough nut to crack.
- There's nothing tough about it.
What it all amounts to in the long run, Benny... is faith.
You've got to have faith.
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be contagious.
What's going on out there?
What's happened, Father Lyons?
A miracle, it looks like.
There's blood dripping from the statue, from her heart.
That girl, Elena, one of the new Italian immigrants... her husband was stabbed yesterday.
He was dying when they took him to the hospital.
She prayed to the Blessed Mother to save him.
She lit a candle in front of the statue.
She went back to the hospital... and her husband was sitting up in bed, asking for pasta.
Get over there, quick.
Speak Italian to them, but for heaven's sake, get them out of the church.
Children of the miraculous Queen of the heavens... let us pray.
Let us cover the Blessed Virgin with flowers.
Let us cover her with the flowers... of her litanies.
Lord, have pity on us.
Lord, have pity on us.
Christ, hear our prayer.
Holy Trinity, one single God.
Son, God, Redeemer of the world.
Holy Spirit, thou art God.
He sure does have a way with them.
Holy Mother of God.
Pray for us.
The miracle of the leaking steam pipe... courtesy of the Cornelius J.
Deegan Construction Company.
And I thought this was a special effort for my conversion.
It'll be a jolt for those people when they find out the truth.
Maybe they won't have to.
You're not gonna tell them?
It's not up to me to tell them.
Come on.
I report what we found to Monsignor Monaghan.
He reports it to Cardinal Glennon's office.
In the end, the Cardinal himself will decide what to tell them.
What do you suppose that'll be?
He'll probably just fix the steam pipe, and let the commotion die down.
But if you didn't tell them the truth, you'd be committing a fraud.
What is the truth?
That the steam pipe leaks.
That's only a fact, Benny.
Like the sun being the center of the solar system.
Facts are only small parts of a much larger truth.
Faith?
Faith.
People see blood flowing from a statue's heart.
They believe God caused it to happen.
- But he didn't.
- But he did.
God is the first cause of everything.
He made that pipe leak.
Judging from all the rust, he must've been working on that stunt for quite a while.
From all eternity.
- Frank.
- Nice party.
How're you doing?
So far, I've met the Flynns, the Foleys, the Flahertys... the Deegans, the Doogans... the O'Connors, O'Neals, McMahons, and all the clan O'Toole.
You make it sound like one of Frank's songs.
After the Irish, the Germans will be a cinch.
You'll take the war in your stride.
Except for one little problem you can help me with.
Whose side is God on?
Is he an Englishman,
Frenchman, German... or is he an American?
He certainly could have his pick.
They all claim him.
- Happy?
- I've never been happier in my life.
How'd you like to meet the Rampbells?
I'd like to, very much.
Mom, Dad...
I'd like you to meet Mona's brother,
Father Steve.
- How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Rampbell?
- Hello.
I feel for you both. There's nothing quite as lonely as being in a crowd of strangers.
Not entirely strangers, Father.
There are several men here
I've done business with for years... including our host.
Of course, I've never been invited to their homes before.
Or invited them to yours.
Or invited them to ours, it's quite true.
All right, you micks, let's have a little quiet here.
I want to propose a toast... to Mona Fermoyle and her soldier boy.
There they are.
In case you haven't already met him... the lad's name is Benny Rampbell.
But don't let the name throw you.
I have it on reliable authority... that it's soon to become a good Catholic name.
As soon as that happens, and I have this on good authority, too... that same good Catholic name will become Mona's.
So what do you say?
Let's just tack an "O" in front of it... and make the whole clan of them honorary Irishmen.
Now we know the answer.
God is an Irishman.
Come on.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been one week since my last confession.
These are my sins.
Yes?
I slept with a man.
Are you engaged to this man?
Yes.
Couldn't you have waited until you were married?
Steve, you didn't persuade him.
Benny's not going to become a Catholic.
I thought... if we made love...
I thought I could make him change his mind.
Steve, I'm so miserable.
Please help me.
Would he agree to let your children be raised as Catholics?
No.
He says that isn't fair.
He won't marry me at all, unless I take him just the way he is.
Then you cannot be married.
He says, "Let's leave all religion out of it and...
"get married by a judge."
That wouldn't be a marriage.
You'd be living in mortal sin.
What else can I do?
Why do you think I came here?
I want you to tell me what to do.
Hard as it may be, you must give him up.
Is that all you can say?
You must stop these illicit relations immediately.
- Steve.
- Father.
This is me.
And I'm a priest.
What you've done is immoral and cheap.
It wasn't cheap.
I'm in love with him.
Is that a sin?
Unless it's subordinated to a higher love, the love of God, yes.
Steve, you told me to hang on.
I'm just trying to hang on.
Help me.
Please help me.
Benny'll be going overseas soon.
He may be gone for a long time.
There's a saying in Italian:
"Love makes time pass, time makes love pass."
For these and all other sins that I have committed, I ask forgiveness.
For your penance, say three rosaries.
Now make a good act of contrition.
My God, I am heartily sorry
I have offended thee.
And a firm resolution to sin no more.
I can't do that!
You must.
I shouldn't have come here.
Cardinal Glennon will see you now, Father.
Good afternoon, Father Fermoyle.
Your Eminence.
I take the ring off for Bach.
Everyday I practice for an hour.
My staff encouraged me.
It may be that they hate music and enjoy hearing what I do to it.
Or perhaps they've learned the more
I pound the piano the less I pound them.
They're probably right.
I'd hardly call it pounding, Your Eminence.
You play very well.
The Goldberg Variations are a great challenge to the amateur.
But wasn't Your Eminence playing the Chromatic Fantasy?
When you compliment me as a musician,
I must find out whether you know music.
Not that I'm trying to trap you.
That's not my purpose.
It isn't?
No, it's because of my infernal weakness for flattery.
You see, Fermoyle, I'm incorrigibly vain... not about my personal charms... but about certain accomplishments... that have nothing to do with my function as a priest.
Because of this flaw in my nature,
I must always be on my guard.
Not only for the sake of my soul, but for yours.
I've read your book.
I'm no historian, but it seems a comprehensive treatment of the subject.
Thank you.
Why did you send it to me?
Because Bishop Quarenghi liked it very much and he felt...
- Quarenghi, of the Vatican.
- Yes.
He felt the next step would be to get your imprimatur to publish it.
Quarenghi read your book?
Yes. In fact, he helped me with a great deal of it.
You were close friends with this Bishop Quarenghi?
He was my teacher.
I admire him very much.
He's in the office of the Secretary of State?
Yes, he is assistant to Cardinal Giacobbi.
Giacobbi, whose main passion in life is to guard the Holy Father... from contaminating contacts with non-ltalians.
Cardinal Giacobbi would have good reason to like your book.
I'm not sure I understand...
It deals with a time when the Western Hemisphere... had little or no ecclesiastical significance.
Tell me, why did you write it?
- Why?
- Yes, why? For what reason?
- What did you expect to gain?
- I didn't expect to gain...
Fame?
- No, it was just...
- Admiration in Rome?
The subject interested me...
A job in the Vatican, with the Secretary of State... close to your Italian friends?
It was a field that had been neglected and...
Come, now. Examine your motives.
You are an ambitious priest.
I recognize all the symptoms.
You feel you're too good for parish work.
I have never said that.
Don't you think you're wasted here?
Your gifts for language... for scholarship, diplomacy...
All these are wasted at St. John's.
Admit it.
No, Your Eminence.
- The truth.
- I will serve wherever I'm sent.
Father Fermoyle, do you think there's more in you... than being a mere parish priest?
The truth.
Of course I do.
You wanted the truth, Your Eminence.
Ambition is a disease in any man.
In a priest, it can be fatal.
But at your age, it may still be curable.
We shall begin your treatment at once.
Cold climate, simple diet.
Stonebury. Perfect.
Stonebury will be your spiritual sanitarium.
You are now curate at Stonebury.
The parish church is called St. Peter's, no irony intended.
You will assist Father Halley.
A truly remarkable man.
As a pastor, he's a total failure, but... as an individual, he is without vanity... ambition.
From him, you can learn humility.
Goodbye, Father Fermoyle.
Steve!
Where've you been?
Where's Dad and the rest?
I tried to get you before you left St. John's.
- What's wrong?
- Have you seen Mona?
- No.
- Any message from her?
- No.
- She's gone.
She didn't come home last night.
We don't know where she is.
With Benny?
No, his regiment went overseas yesterday.
Let me know the minute you hear anything.
Send me a wire at Stonebury.
Call me. Tell Mom and Dad not to worry.
- Father Fermoyle?
- Yes.
Bonjour, Father.
Jump on.
Father Halley sent me to pick you up.
Me, Hercule Menton.
I'm very glad to meet you, Hercule.
Father Halley.
Father Fermoyle.
Sorry I couldn't meet you myself.
I was glad to be met at all. Thank you.
- You make a good fire.
- I was going to make some tea.
Good, I'll just take this off.
- Here, let me help you off with that coat.
- Thank you.
I'm not used to company.
You should ask them to send you a curate.
I'm afraid I've had too many favors from His Eminence.
Besides, there's hardly enough revenue here to support one priest... let alone two.
Things will be looking up now that you're here.
And a remarkably good collection this Sunday.
Quite a haul for St. Peter's.
Tomorrow we'll buy some coffee to celebrate... your arrival with festivities.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You should be in bed.
This'll pass, it always does.
- Father, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.
Sit down.
Let's have some bread and tea.
I'll be all right.
- Have some fish.
- No, thank you, it's enough.
I always eat my principal meal at midday.
- Would you like the fish?
- No, thank you.
In the morning,
I'll show you around the parish.
Why don't you rest tomorrow?
I can manage alone.
Bless us... and these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty... through Christ, our Lord...
Amen.
Father, I insist you eat that fish.
You must be hungry after your long trip.
Father Fermoyle.
- Good morning, Hercule.
- Good morning, Father.
- How are you?
- Come in, come in.
My daughter, Lalage.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Lalage.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- How is Father Halley?
- Not too well, I'm afraid.
I'm glad they sent someone to help him.
And this is my wife, Adele.
Will you stay and eat with us, Father?
Don't worry, there's plenty.
No, thank you.
I'd better be getting back to Father Halley.
Wait...
Father Halley needs a hot meal.
This'll make you feel better.
How long have you had these spells?
A long time?
What does the doctor say?
Well, he...
- You've seen a doctor, haven't you?
- Yes, no.
He couldn't diagnose it.
He said I'd have to go to the hospital for a week for a series of tests.
And?
We can't afford it.
The diocesan can afford it.
No, you mustn't ask him.
But you're sick.
His Eminence mustn't know.
He mustn't know that I'm sick.
Cardinal Glennon? Why not?
Well, you see... he gave me my first parish...
St. Anselm's in Stowe.
It was a small church with a big mortgage.
I couldn't lift it.
He sent me to Needham.
It was a prosperous parish.
There was money in the bank.
And I ran Needham into debt.
His Eminence warned me.
Then he sent me to...
Malden, lpsfield... always some place lower in his favor.
There's no more favor left, now.
He's disappointed in me.
He mustn't know... that I've failed again.
Father Fermoyle, your brother phoned the store... to come to Boston as quickly as you can.
Mona.
What do you guys want?
We want to talk to our sister.
It sure don't look like she wants to talk to you.
Mona, please.
What do you want?
We want you to come home.
Why?
You're breaking their hearts, Mona.
Please come home.
All right, I'll come home.
You don't think Mom will mind if I bring Ramón home with me, do you?
He spends a lot of his time in jail and he hasn't really learned to read yet.
You can tell her he's a Catholic.
Mona, listen to me.
- Benny won't be gone...
- Shut up.
We'll start all over again.
We'll try to work out a way that you and Benny can be married.
I promise I'll do everything I can.
Why don't you leave me alone!
What do you want from me?
I just want you to be happy.
Is that all?
Don't you want to forgive me, too?
Isn't that what you priests usually like to do the most?
- He's not your enemy, Mona.
- God will forgive you.
Will you hear my confession, Father?
I'll be glad to hear your confession at the proper time...
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
- Don't do this.
- I'll do anything I damn well please!
I've had it.
I'm through. I'm through with you and I'm through with your... pious, mealy-mouthed, hypocritical religion.
And I'm through with your God, too.
The next time you talk to him, you tell him that for me.
Come on, lover, let's dance.
It's not your fault.
Yes, it is.
- Lalage.
- Hello, Father.
Did you do all this?
You said look after Father Halley while you were gone. So I did.
- The doctor's with him now.
- What doctor?
Dr. Carter.
I got him to come up from Lynchburgh.
I work in his office sometimes.
Now that you're back,
I better be going home.
It was very kind of you to do so much.
It's very little compared to what he's done.
Father Halley?
When I was a child, Grand-mere died.
She was very old, very frightened... very religious.
Father Halley was sick himself, but he stayed with her night and day... prayed with her, helped her die well.
I'll be back to fix supper.
Doctor?
Father Fermoyle?
I'm afraid your pastor's a very sick man.
What is it?
The name of the disease? I can tell you, but very little else about it.
It's called multiple sclerosis.
We don't know its cause, and there's no cure for it.
It's a breakdown of the entire nervous system.
It can develop quickly or slowly.
But always in the same direction.
How far has it gone with Father Halley?
Near the end.
Has he always had this lack of energy?
I think so. I'm not sure how long.
Chances are he's been slowly dying all his adult life.
It's amazing he was able to function at all.
- What can we do for him now?
- He'll need full-time care.
He ought to be in a hospital or a nursing home.
If he's going to die, he'll die as a pastor in his own bed, in his own parish.
That's liable to be harder on you than it is on him.
Thank you.
You give him this as directed.
- Is this medicine very expensive?
- Yes.
The longer he lasts, the more it will cost.
It's never agreeable to watch someone go.
Forgive me for the long time I take.
Doesn't any of this bother you?
No, it's only nature.
It's strange.
What is strange?
For a girl who's young, attractive... to spend her days, her nights like this.
But you are a priest.
You must understand what it is to want to be of use.
You see, I have my vocation, too.
I have been accepted by the Geraldines.
The Geraldines?
The nursing sisterhood.
Yes, I know.
They take care of the incurable.
The incurable and the dying.
And that's the life you want?
That is the life I was born for.
Did you ever see this ring before?
Yes, it used to be mine.
Where did you get it?
- It was given to me.
- By whom?
By a friend.
Where did you get the ring?
Your fence, I believe, as you say in the underworld, was pinched.
One of the items recovered was this ring.
The police thought it might have been stolen from a bishop.
But the Karaghousian twins... claimed they bought it from one Father Fermoyle.
We've never had a priest working with the Mafia before.
But I suppose during your stay in Rome, you made many interesting contacts.
I had no choice, Your Eminence.
I had to work my way through the seminary... selling opium in St. Peter's Square.
- You're not afraid of me, are you?
- No.
Why not? Most people are.
Maybe it's because you remind me of my father.
He's sometimes called
Din the Downshouter.
But his roar is the only fierce thing about him.
He's a lucky man to have a son... who's not afraid of him.
But about this ring... why did you sell it?
- I needed the money.
- What for?
For private reasons, Your Eminence.
There are no private reasons between a priest and his archbishop.
I needed the money to pay for Father Halley's medical expenses.
- Is he ill?
- He's dying, Your Eminence.
- Why wasn't I told?
- He didn't want you to know.
Father O'Brien, have the car brought around.
Ned?
Your Eminence.
- Larry.
- How are you, Larry?
Giving everybody a bad time, as usual.
You know me, Ned.
I've let you down again.
No, it's I who've let you down.
Who else would have put up so long with an old muddler like me?
You're no such thing.
Now, Larry... no more of that silver tongue of yours... that we always said would talk you to the top.
The top of a mountain of worldly vanity.
I do want to thank you for giving me this parish.
The poorest in the diocese.
It was rich to me.
And then you sent me Father Fermoyle.
Vain, ambitious Roman puppy.
He's rather like you were, Larry.
That's a mortal blow.
I mean in his goodness.
Would you let him take my place here?
He'll make a good pastor, I know.
People love him already.
Grand idea. Thank you, Ned.
Would you do me one last favor?
Anything.
Would you give me extreme unction?
I'd consider it a great honor, Ned.
It'll be over soon. I hope.
You'll have the job of shutting down the church.
Send all the records to the dean at Averill.
But, Your Eminence...
I've kept the church open only for his sake.
- But you told him you were going to...
- I thanked him for his idea.
I happen to have another one for you.
But these people need a church.
A priest will come Sundays for Mass.
All else will be done through Averill.
Once a week isn't enough.
You must learn that when I've made up my mind...
I don't like interminable discussion, otherwise you'll be no use to me... as my secretary.
- Are you sure it's the same guy?
- Absolutely.
And now, we proudly present...
Bobby and his Adora-Belles.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take great pleasure in presenting... that suave Tiger of the Tango:
Ramón Gongaro and his partner.
That isn't Mona.
Let's go.
- Where's Mona?
- I don't know.
Where is she?
- I haven't seen her for five months.
- Where did you see her last?
- In Albany. She left the act there.
- You mean you left her there.
- No, I told her...
- Told her what?
I told her I'd pay.
- Pay for what?
- For an abortion. But she didn't want...
Great, our only lead and you have to knock him cold.
What's going on there?
It's our friend, Officer.
He's a bit under the weather, I'm afraid.
What with the chilly night... and the need for a nip to keep one warm.
- Could I be getting your friend a cab?
- That would be most kind of you, Officer.
- Where is she?
- 5 Stanhope Lane, I think.
A noble and lonely task it is, preserving the law and order on a night like this.
Thank you, Officer.
I'm Ramón.
- What do you want?
- Where's Mona?
Second floor, in the back.
Who are your friends?
Second floor, in the back.
Mona, it's me.
Put your arms around me, just hang on.
I'm Dr. Parks.
- Are you the husband?
- No.
She has no husband.
She's our sister.
Your sister's been in labor for several days.
She's lost a great deal of blood.
Why has she received no medical attention?
Because we didn't know where she was.
Her pelvic structure is abnormally small.
The child's head is unusually large.
Normal delivery is impossible.
You can perform a cesarean, can't you?
It's much too late for that.
But we can save her.
I'll need your permission as next of kin to do a fetal craniotomy.
- A craniotomy?
- Yes.
We have to crush the child's head.
You want to kill the child?
You can't let Mona die.
I take it this is some sort of religious scruple?
It's a Commandment. "Thou shalt not kill."
But it's all right to kill Mona?
If Mona dies because we won't... commit a murder to save her, she dies a natural death.
But the baby...
We'd be taking a creature of God's... alive, with a soul.
And deliberately kill it.
I won't permit you to kill Mona.
Excuse me, there's not much time.
Are you a member of this family?
No.
Then which of you has the final say here?
He does.
I can't give you my permission to commit murder.
Can I see her?
You have to be quick about it, unless you want to lose both of them.
Monie, can you hear me?
Hear.
Say after me...
O, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee.
O... thee.
O, my God.
God...
O, my God...
All right, Father, you'll have to go now.
Steve!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Regina
Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday. What a big girl!
- Blow out the candles.
Give it a try.
Blow out the other one. Blow it out.
Two, one more.
Get in.
Father Callahan packed a bag for you.
Whatever he forgot, you can buy in Rome.
Rome?
Yes, the Pope died this morning.
What does the Captain say?
We've lost three days.
If it clears tomorrow, we can make up one.
He'll have to do better than that.
The only thing that's keeping me alive... is the thought of... being there in time to vote for a new pope.
To go through what I'm going through now... would be...
- Where's my trunk?
- They promised to send it right over.
- What's happening?
- Nothing.
There should be smoke soon, white or dark.
This ballot is taking a long time.
Maybe it'll be dark.
Maybe there's still no majority.
Would you prefer that?
What difference does one more ballot make if it's a deadlock?
The American Church has a right to participate.
It's white!
Yes, Your Eminence, right away.
It's all wound up.
Stephen, good of you to come down.
Sit yourself.
And how have you been occupied, this splendid Roman day?
Your private audience must have gone very well.
What's he like, the new pope?
Amazing, the way he takes it all in his stride.
The man was made cardinal only eight months ago.
I brought up a point of procedure for the next conclave.
A procedure for what happens when he dies?
- That must have been a bit delicate.
- He seemed quite detached about it.
I explained that no matter how much faster ships they build... ten days is still too short a time to get from the United States to Rome.
He agreed to make it 15 days.
Congratulations.
That's quite an accomplishment.
Not my only one today.
Before I forget, your... bishop's ring.
You'll be needing it one of these days.
The Holy Father, it seems, is genuinely interested in America.
I called his attention to the almost complete absence... of our countrymen from the ranks of the Secretariat of State.
From there it was only a step to persuading him... it'd be difficult for the Vatican to function in the future without your services.
You'll be a domestic prelate,
Monsignor Fermoyle.
Entitled to wear the violet cassock and manteletta.
Well, Stephen?
What's the matter?
It isn't an easy thing to explain.
What isn't?
Speak up, man.
I can't accept a post at the Vatican.
Can't accept?
- It's not a matter of choice.
- In this case, it is.
I have to leave the priesthood.
But that's impossible.
- You can't suddenly...
- It isn't sudden.
I've been working up to this for years.
I'm only telling you now because...
What a masterpiece of timing!
An hour ago, at the Pope's request I was listing your virtues to Cardinal Giacobbi.
What a story he'll make of this, with his anti-American prejudice.
You set the whole hemisphere back a decade.
I'm deeply sorry for any embarrassment this may cause you, but I hardly think...
I don't want to hear what you think.
Now or ever.
Go, do you hear me? Go!
Our conversation is over.
You're dismissed! Go.
Yes?
Your Eminence.
You didn't even explain to me why you want to leave the priesthood.
I should have.
I didn't get the right opportunity.
It's been in your mind for so long.
May I sit?
- Please do, Your Eminence.
- Why didn't you tell me before?
I don't know.
I wasn't clear enough about what I really thought.
I must know what's behind this extraordinary decision of yours.
I'm not sure I could separate one reason from the others and say:
"That's what did it."
I don't think I was meant to be a priest to begin with.
It wasn't my idea.
My parents decided it when I was a baby.
I can't remember a time when it wasn't an established thing.
Like Dad being the one to go out and earn a living...
Mom staying home to care for the house and kids. Nobody ever questioned it.
I never questioned it.
A dollar a week was put aside for my education.
A dollar a week out of a motorman's pay.
By the time I was in seventh grade my brother was calling me "the Cardinal."
This morning I'd have said he had the makings of a prophet.
The only doubt I had, I wasn't sure
I had the strength to be a good priest... to deny myself what had to be denied... to live without the softness of a woman.
On the other side, there was the scholastic part.
I liked my courses, I was good at them.
As long as it was all theory and no practice...
I felt I was where I belonged.
But then came the time when I was on my own... when I had to function as God's anointed... answering people's questions about what was right, what was wrong... making decisions for them.
And one day, it was my own sister who needed my help.
And I found I couldn't help her.
Because what she needed was a man, a friend, a brother.
And all I could be was a judge with a set of rules.
And finally the time came when my being a priest meant she had to die.
I did what I had to do, I know that.
What I had to do as a priest, as an agent of God's law...
I couldn't do what a layman would do in the same situation:
Pretend that he'd never heard of the law.
I don't challenge the rules.
I just don't want to be the one to enforce them.
Not for anybody's sister.
I don't want the power over other people's lives.
I can't face the responsibility.
That's what it really comes down to.
I sit in the confessional, listening to someone tell his sins... and I'm the one who's trembling in terror.
I don't know what will become of me.
I must find what else I can do.
But I think, I pray... that there may be another kind of life for me.
A life I was meant for... that will let me sleep nights.
Steve...
I'm going to ask you to do something for me... because I think you're wrong about yourself.
I think I see your problem more objectively than you can.
Regardless of how it came about, you were meant to be a priest.
I'm going to ask you to postpone your decision.
There's something
I can do as your bishop.
It's seldom done, but I can grant you a leave of absence from active priesthood.
I'll tell Giacobbi... it's for reasons of health. And it is.
The health of your soul.
Priesthood isn't something you can put on and take off... like the cassock you wear.
It's part of you.
Think about it, Steve.
Take a year, take two years.
If at the end of that time, you're still of the same mind...
I'll do all in my power to get you a dispensation from your vows.
But... should you wish to remain a priest...
I'm sure the Holy Father can be persuaded to keep the position open for you here.
Will you do this much, Steve... for me and for yourself?
Because of the holiday, we won't be meeting again for two weeks.
Before our next class, I would like you to prepare a conversation in English... about a trip in an automobile from Vienna to Salzburg.
Until then, auf Wiedersehen.
'Bye, sir.
I hope you have very fine holidays.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again in 14 days.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you, same to you.
Yes, Miss Lederbohl?
Nothing. Have a nice holiday.
Thank you.
Mr. Fermoyle, do you mind if I walk with you?
- No, not at all.
- We go the same way.
Tell me about America.
- In 25 words, or less?
- Or more.
I've got all afternoon and evening if you need it.
- I want to be prepared.
- Prepared for what?
My dream is to go to America someday... where people think about the future, instead of always the past.
Please invite me for a cup of coffee.
All right.
Where would you like to go in America?
First to New York, of course.
Then, I haven't made up my mind yet.
Where do you think I should go?
- Where are you from?
- Boston.
Boston. That's in Massakewsetts.
Massachusetts.
Tell me about Boston.
All of a sudden I don't know what to say.
I was born in Boston, grew up there, with my family.
When I was a boy, we used to swim in the river...
I guess that's hardly an inducement to visit Boston.
I will go to Boston.
Tell me, what do you do?
- I teach.
- I mean when you're not teaching.
Do you go out to the theater, to parties?
Who are your friends?
I tried to find out, but no one seems to know.
Sometimes I think all you do is sit alone in your room in the Stallburggasse.
How do you know where I live?
I followed you.
You're different than other men.
"From" other men.
- You know how to wait.
- How to wait for what?
For "whom."
What are you going to do over the holidays?
I guess I'll just sit all by myself in my room in the Stallburggasse.
- You want to know something?
- Yes.
I won't let you do that.
Before the war there was no choice for a girl, only to be married.
Now there are not enough men.
Families have lost their money.
Most of my friends have jobs, or try to find them.
So people think I'm lucky to have a rich young man who wants to marry me.
Do you? Think you're lucky?
I'm not sure.
For me to work at a job, that is not to be a woman.
I think there's one thing I could do well.
One thing I was born for.
To love a man.
To love him so much that my whole life is to make him happy.
If that's true, then I should think...
When it is my whole life, it is important I find the right man.
- All I do is talk about myself.
- And about Vienna.
And you talk about America.
But not about Stephen Fermoyle.
Not much to talk about.
I've been in Europe about a year and a half.
Teaching, mostly.
First in Milan, then Munich, now Vienna.
I just go wherever the
International Language School sends me.
But what did you do before?
I mean, in Boston. What did you do there?
Why did you come to Europe?
Aren't we supposed to get off here?
The abbey was founded in 1410... the church built in a rich Baroque style...
It has a tower. Possibly the finest
Baroque tower of Austria.
You sound like Baedeker.
I'm just trying to keep it impersonal.
The chief attractions of the interior are the stucco reliefs on the ceiling.
The altar paintings by Schmidt of Krems.
The pulpit richly carved by his father,
Johann Schmidt.
- And the choir stalls...
- Yes, I know all about them.
I've been here before.
- You have?
- Many times.
Why?
I come here to pray.
You're a strange man.
I'm a priest, Annemarie.
I'm on a leave of absence.
Once in a great while, when a priest is unsure of his vocation... he is granted time to think about it.
What happens when your time is over?
I must decide whether I want to go on being a priest... or ask for a dispensation from my vows, if I can get one.
In the meantime, those vows are still binding.
Will it be harder for you to be with me, now that you've told me?
No harder than before, I think.
Because if I thought...
I was having an influence, directly or not directly... on what you will decide...
Yes, if you did?
I would make it, how does one say?
A full-time career.
Annemarie.
There will be no arguments about tonight.
You have to see a Viennese ball, and this is the last one of the season.
I rented everything you need.
Look.
Tails... evening shirt, white tie...
- west.
- "Vest."
And a cape.
And Manschettenknöpfe.
How do you call that?
- Cufflinks.
- Cufflinks. And this?
Studs.
And chapeau claque.
- Good evening, Kurt.
- Good evening.
- You look wonderful tonight.
- Thank you.
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Fermoyle.
Stephen, this is Kurt von Hartman.
- Herr von Hartman.
- Mr. Fermoyle, how do you do?
- You're American, aren't you?
- Yes.
Then you are used to lending your treasures to impoverished Europe.
May I have this dance please? Annemarie?
Excuse me.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I heard you say you were from America.
Is it really true one is not allowed to drink... even beer and wine?
Are they insane to make this Prohibition?
The people who voted for it obviously think that any means is justified... to eliminate the evils of drunkenness.
Excuse me.
You know what that Prohibition is like?
It's like they want to eliminate the evils of rape... and so they pass a law against making love.
Can you imagine a life without making love?
Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, Stephen.
- For what?
For leaving you alone.
At a ball you should dance.
But you can't.
He seems like a very nice fellow.
Kurt? Yes, he is.
He's the one who wants to marry you?
Yes. Are you jealous?
I'm a priest, Annemarie.
But I'm also a man.
Men can show their feelings, but a priest has to learn how to hide them.
I can't hide them anymore.
I think I'm in love with you.
I know I'm in love with you.
I cannot ask you to kiss me while you're still married to the Church.
But in Vienna, even for a married man... it is a sin not to dance a waltz.
You answer this letter from Philadelphia.
Tell them there will be no private audiences for at least six weeks.
Welcome to Vatican City, Father Gillis.
Monsignor Fermoyle.
Your letter to the Holy Father was passed on to me... as a consultant on American affairs.
He'll see me?
The Holy Father will really see me?
I'm afraid I couldn't arrange that.
But I have arranged for you to tell your story to Cardinal Giacobbi.
That's the next best thing to a private audience with the Pope.
I didn't know if I'd hear back at all.
Since I mailed my letter the day I got to Rome...
I've been waiting to be called to the phone.
Shall we go along?
His Eminence is expecting us.
Fermoyle, come in, come in.
So, this is the American priest you told us about.
I'll come back when you're finished.
No, stay. It will not take long, will it?
Monsignor Fermoyle and Cardinal Quarenghi are old friends.
You find yourself in a nest of diplomats, Father.
That means that if anyone of us says exactly what he's thinking... it's a slip of the tongue.
Sit down.
Please, tell us what we can do for you.
Father Gillis's parish is in the state of Georgia, in a town called Lamar.
His congregation raised the money for him to come here.
That's very interesting.
St. Jude, Your Eminence.
It's called St. Jude, my church.
The saint of lost causes.
We should like not to lose this cause.
You see... there is only one Catholic school in that part of Georgia.
And, well... that school will not take the children of my parish because they're black.
- Well?
- Well, Your Eminence... is that a Christian thing to do?
It is against Christian principles for a Catholic school... to turn away a Catholic child because of race.
Of course it is.
But we have the most precise machinery... for the proper enforcement of these principles.
I did what was proper.
I went to the dean of the district,
Monsignor Whittle.
He said he would never ever let colored children in their school.
And your bishop?
I wrote him and didn't get an answer.
Then you decided that the only recourse left to you... was to come to Rome and tell your troubles to the Pope?
Your pardon, Eminence.
But one thing happened before Father Gillis decided to come.
His church was burned to the ground.
Quite a few of the folks in my parish... they feel it's time to make some changes.
So a bunch of them went and threw a picket line around that white school.
They threw what?
They marched in front of the school with signs, protesting the discrimination.
Then I got a lot of phone calls... and letters with no names signed.
And then one night, these men with white hoods... they burned my church.
Barbarians.
But still it's scarcely a tribute to your priestly discretion, is it... that your concern with these peculiar local politics... has left you without a church?
Politics, my dear Giacobbi?
The desecration, of course, is a moral issue.
I was speaking of Father Gillis's activities.
But discrimination is a moral issue, too.
It is not necessary to tell me... that race prejudice is contrary to the teachings of Christ and his church.
The question is, whether it is wise to use methods... that tend to be inflammatory.
I'm not sure that we can afford to use methods that tend to be glacial.
The truth of the matter is that to the non-white majority of the world... there is no more critical test of our democracy...
Democracy, my dear Fermoyle, is neither the ultimate... nor necessarily the best form of government.
It is simply the favorite doctrine of a country... discovered by an Italian, who thought he was going someplace else.
Your Eminence suggests a stimulating topic for discussion... but my point is that what happens to freedom in America... is important to the rest of the world.
But isn't your precious separation of church and state... a part of that freedom?
Aren't you always telling us we may not intrude... in the domestic affairs of your country in any way?
By your own logic, it is foolish... to challenge the deepest feelings and convictions... of the people of...
What is the name of the place?
- Georgia, Your Eminence.
- Georgia.
Father Gillis, may I suggest that your primary obligation is not... to political and social reform... but to the mortal souls of your flock.
Thank you, Monsignor, for bringing us Father Gillis.
We're always happy to meet a brother in Christ.
Let's get back to our work now.
I really don't remember where we left off.
Is that it?
I'd hoped we could dissuade him.
What will you do when you get back?
Thank you for your support.
I must go there, Alfeo.
I told him he could count on my help and then I failed him.
You went as far as you possibly could within the limits of your function.
There was another time somebody relied on me for help.
I did everything within my function for her, and it wasn't enough.
If you made a mistake with your sister... if you were too young to be both priest and brother to her... you've atoned for that a long time ago.
You don't have to find new ways to torture yourself.
I just don't want to realize again that it's too late to accomplish something.
What is there to accomplish by following Father Gillis?
I don't know, but I know I have to do it.
I don't think it will be a surprise if I say... the Pope has given some thought to naming you a bishop.
I've heard a certain amount of talk.
- You can't tell me it doesn't matter to you.
- It matters very much.
But it also matters to me what happens to Gillis.
I'll try not to compromise the Holy See.
I don't have to be an official emissary.
You still need the Holy Father's permission... which means Giacobbi's, unfortunately.
Do you suppose the thought might enter his mind... that I could make a fool of myself in Georgia?
It might.
What if you started him thinking along that line?
Why would I want to discredit you?
It might occur to him that this trip could lessen my chances to become a bishop.
Which could be just the incentive he needs to grant me permission to go.
Heaven forgive me for starting you off in diplomacy.
All right, Father.
Uncle Steve, it's so wonderful to see you.
Regina, I'd like you to meet a shipboard friend of mine, Father Eberling.
Father, I'm sorry. This is awful.
I don't imagine Father Eberling found it too painful.
Nicest welcome home I ever had.
Now.
Uncle Steve.
I'm so glad you're you, I mean, not him.
You're so much better looking, and younger.
With that blarney and your looks, you'll have your pick of husbands.
- Anything to declare?
- Nothing.
Thank you, Father.
Yeah, I'll get the bags.
Steve.
Boy, you look great.
How do you keep the old weight down?
Prayer, Frank. And a strict calorie count.
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.
No money, but I'm knocking 'em dead every night.
Singing in one of the best speakeasies in town.
I hope to be able to hear you before I go back.
What are your plans?
That's the trouble.
You shouldn't have come to New York.
Who said I shouldn't?
Am I some sort of an old lady...
I meant I have to catch a train this afternoon. We barely have time for lunch.
But it's worth it.
I don't like you spending the money.
Round-trip fares for you and Regina?
- Are you really sorry I brought her?
- She's an absolute delight, ravishing.
Having her around has made it easier for me to accept God's will.
Seeing her now has made it easier for me.
Excuse me?
Where does Father Gillis live?
- Right over there.
- Thank you.
- Monsignor.
- Father Fermoyle from Boston, for now.
Do come in.
Monsignor Whittle, this is Father Fermoyle.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
Sheriff Dubrow.
What brings you to Lamar, Father?
I'm a friend of Father Gillis.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
I've already said what I come to say.
There's a law against arson in this state.
So I had to do my job.
When Gillis here, Father Gillis... made out a complaint,
I brought the charges.
Tomorrow he can get up in the trial and testify.
That is, unless you can talk some sense into him.
He's your boy, not mine.
Know what I mean?
I don't. What do you mean?
That there's trouble for everybody, for him, for me, for the Church.
- What are you doing here, Father?
- I told you, I'm a friend of Father Gillis.
As a friend, I wish you'd tell this hard-headed boy...
He's not a boy, Monsignor, he's a priest.
Do you presume to correct my terminology, Father?
I simply meant to remind you that we are all brothers in Christ.
Then, my Yankee brother, will you tell this Father Gillis... that he must not testify?
'Cause people around here, they're in an awful ugly mood.
Do you want to testify?
- Yes, Father.
- Good.
Father Gillis will be at the trial tomorrow.
That does it.
That just about puts the lid on it.
Look, you know nothing of the conditions around here...
Monsignor, a church has been burned.
Charges have been brought, testimony must be given.
What is so unusual about due process of law?
I recognize a Yankee... sanctimonious self-righteousness.
You will not testify, Father.
You will withdraw your complaint.
You... you will give me the name of your superior to whom I will report you.
You were sent here from Rome?
I'm here unofficially.
My presence is a confidential matter between us.
But it's my strong opinion... that we must allow Father Gillis to act as he sees fit.
Just as you say, Monsignor.
I assume that he can count on you for your support in whatever he does.
- Yes, but...
- Then perhaps we can discuss the details... of that support on the way into town... if you can drive me.
I'd like to find a hotel.
Of course. I'd be delighted.
I'll get in touch with you later.
I can't believe you're here.
I didn't think anybody cared.
Have you so little faith?
The hotels are on the other side of the square.
Who told you that?
I don't need anybody to tell me, Father.
It's in the Bible.
Is it also God's law to burn churches?
We had nothing to do with that, Father.
I'm a good Catholic.
They must be members of your congregation.
You've got to see the problem, Monsignor.
We're in the minority here, too.
I'm sure you wouldn't have permitted this demonstration if you'd known of it.
I'll see that it's stopped immediately.
Good people, can I just talk to you for a minute?
What's going on there?
You want something, mister?
I need a room for a couple of nights.
It just so happens we don't have any rooms available.
I kind of get the impression you've been meddling, padre.
Looked to me like it was you who got that picket line called off.
For a Catholic priest to offer advice to members of his faith is not meddling.
Maybe you don't know what's going on in this town.
Some nigger is trying to make trouble for some white folks.
- Some nigger priest.
- Some nigger Catholic priest.
You can't really get much lower than that.
Perhaps you could recommend a good tourist home?
If you're a tourist, get touring before you've got something to be sorry for.
You ain't going to find a bed tonight.
Not in this town.
I don't know, Cecil.
Maybe he could find a bed in niggertown.
Yeah, that's right.
Maybe some licorice-stick bitch won't mind squeezing over for you.
What do you think, Cecil?
I think we got ourselves a little job this evening.
Give me the Sheriff's office.
All right.
What do you call this thing?
I mean, the fancy name?
A crucifix.
Yeah, that's what the nigger called it when we took it from him.
Only he was queer for it.
He kept wanting to kiss it while we was strengthening his character.
We ain't gonna stand for that kind of stuff.
You know what you're going to have to do with this little old statue, padre?
You're going to spit on it.
And what would that prove... except you've been able to scare one priest into defiling the image of Christ?
Maybe that's just plenty.
You'll tell them other nigger-lovers up north they ain't welcome here.
Now you spit on it.
I said for you to spit on it!
All right, keep going. Give it to him!
Maybe he needs a little music.
Got your harmonica?
Guaranteed to heal cuts, ringworm, harness sores and... foot welts.
Who are you?
Name's Lafe.
You live in Lamar?
All my life.
Are you Catholic?
No.
Then why are you doing this?
I ain't doing much.
Do you think you can walk?
I can try.
I'll take you to Owassa Junction.
You can get a train north there.
I'm going back to Lamar.
There's a trial starting there this morning.
In a quiet way, you're kind of a hard man, aren't you?
My car's just across the field.
You knew where to find me.
You were one of them last night.
When you start something you don't always know how you'll feel about it later.
- Last night...
- Don't try to talk. Play.
- Stefano!
- Alfeo.
Monsignor Fermoyle.
We had such a desire to talk to you, but you couldn't be reached.
I came back to Europe on a small ship, Your Eminence.
I needed time for meditation.
Your publicity traveled more quickly.
It served to remind us all of your flair for the theatrical.
If I'd chosen the theatricals,
I'd have staged them differently.
When Quarenghi and I discussed your trip to America...
I had the distinct impression it would be an unofficial one.
There were more than 30 witnesses to that display of violence.
Some talked. The reporters at the trial had the story soon enough.
What seems important is the result.
A group of racists convicted on the testimony of a Negro priest.
Convicted not of arson, but of some minor infraction.
Disorderly conduct. That doesn't matter.
It's the first conviction of a white man in that part of the country... on the word of a Negro.
What is the price of victory in this skirmish?
You plunge the Vatican into controversy, which many of your leading prelates... have advised us to avoid.
They're only fooling themselves.
They must face up to it eventually.
Eventually, by all means.
A slow process of education.
In the meantime, kids without decent education now will die of old age... before you do anything to help them.
I didn't mean to involve the Church.
Now that it's happened,
I'm not sure it isn't a desirable thing.
Desirable for whom, Monsignor?
For your private causes or for the Holy Church?
Does your concept of desirability... include splitting Catholic opinion in America right down the middle?
Some of us feel, dear brother... that it is precisely a clear Vatican policy in these matters... that might prevent such a split.
We all have our own opinions, dear brother.
We can only place them before the Holy Father... and so discover which of them is correct.
What do you think, Alfeo?
Will the Pope feel I was indiscreet?
Well, your job was supposed to be consulting on American affairs... not hurling yourself into the thick of them.
I wouldn't recommend it as the ideal way to become a bishop.
If there was so much commotion here, he's probably heard about it already.
If not, you can be sure he will now.
And it won't be long after that before you know the result.
March 13, 1938.
Hitler enters Vienna... at 5:30 p.m., welcomed by enthusiastic crowds.
Cardinal Innitzer, Archbishop of Vienna, reads a letter signed by him... and all the other Austrian bishops, welcoming Hitler to Austria.
We acknowledge happily that the National Socialist movement has... for the German Reich and people... and especially for the underprivileged classes... achieved outstanding progress.
The bishops are extending their blessings and best wishes... for the future of these efforts.
On the day of the plebiscite, it is for us bishops... a natural, national obligation... to declare ourselves as Germans and as part of the German Reich.
We expect of all faithful Catholics... that they will know what they owe to their people.
That's enough!
You are familiar with Vienna, aren't you, Bishop Fermoyle?
Yes, I am, Your Eminence.
I'm going to ask the Holy Father to send you there immediately.
Your official function will be to shut down the nunciature.
And my unofficial function?
It will be an educational one.
Instructing a prince of the Church in the realities of the modern world.
The first thing we noticed on the screen, Your Eminence... was that all the church bells rang as Hitler entered Vienna.
You think they asked me for permission?
It's a standard courtesy to distinguished visitors.
We are great bell-ringers here.
But this visitor...
Dr. Seyss-lnquart ordered it as a friendly gesture.
He was Interim Chancellor and is now Hitler's High Commissioner.
A very devout Catholic. A war hero.
- Some tea?
- Thank you.
You understand
I'm not speaking for myself...
- but for the Holy See.
- Naturally.
Drop of rum in it?
- I don't think I'd...
- Just a taste.
- Sugar?
- Nothing, thank you.
What disturbed the Vatican most... was the declaration urging people to vote "Yes" in the plebiscite.
I understand.
You mustn't leave here without tasting this strudel.
I ordered it for you because I know... that you Americans are mostly interested in strudel... when you come to Vienna.
My only concern, of course, was the Church.
I've nothing to do with politics.
- That statement was non-political?
- Quite so.
On a vote whether Austria should become part of Germany?
Austria is part of Germany.
Hitler announced it.
The plebiscite is a mere formality.
A formality that Hitler himself seems to consider very important.
Precisely. Hitler wants Austria.
A great many Austrians want Hitler.
If the Church presides at the marriage, we'll get better treatment than if it didn't.
But you're doing more than presiding.
You've come out in favor of the union.
Rome feels the Church will be stronger in the long run... if we take a more critical stand toward National Socialism... than you have taken so far.
Does Rome have any idea how Hitler responds to criticism?
Would you like to see Catholic men and women scrubbing the sidewalks... like so many Jews?
There are principles we cannot compromise.
The rights of the Church over family life, education of our youth.
Your Excellency, what do you think
I'm doing here?
Protecting those very rights.
I have been given personal assurances from the very highest sources.
We have to remember what happened in Germany.
Austria is a different matter.
Don't forget this is a Catholic country.
It's the country where he himself was born and baptized.
- Nevertheless, the Vatican feels...
- You see, Fermoyle...
I know the people who've taken over here.
You'll meet some at Dr. Seyss-lnquart's reception tonight.
We have a civilized tradition in Austria that the Germans don't have.
Then why are people here so anxious to be annexed by them?
Because our blood is German.
It's hard for a non-German to understand.
Hardest of all for an American.
Why do you say that?
You are used to so much mixture.
The joining together of all German people is... what we have been dreaming of for 1,000 years.
The Germans and we are different in many ways, yes.
But our blood is the same.
I agree with Your Eminence that it's a hard concept to understand.
Then why waste our time trying?
Why don't you tell me, in brief, what it is the Holy Father expects of me?
First, he would like you to make it clear... that your recommendation to vote "Yes" was purely personal... not binding on Catholics as a matter of conscience.
And once that is done, to issue no further statements on the plebiscite.
Very simple instructions to obey.
I have no desire to make election statements.
I'm not a politician.
Your Eminence, Theodor Cardinal Innitzer and your Excellency, Bishop Fermoyle.
General Albrecht Kraus. Bishop Fermoyle.
Frau Walter, may I introduce you to Bishop Fermoyle?
Frau Clara Walter. Dr. Seyss-lnquart.
Your Eminence.
This is His Excellency Bishop Fermoyle.
An American who works in the Vatican.
I am honored.
I do hope you tell His Holiness how we esteem His Eminence here.
I spoke today on the telephone with the Führer.
And he said:
"All Austria must be at your command, my dear Seyss-lnquart...
"except Cardinal Innitzer."
He said, "Remember, your authority you have from me...
"his is from God."
Herr Kurt von Hartman and Frau Annemarie von Hartman.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
I finally did make my trip to America.
Kurt went on business two years ago and took me along.
But we never saw Boston.
I'm afraid most people don't.
How did you like what you did see?
Very much. Most of it.
There were things our people should have here to bring them into modern times.
Now, I think we will begin to get them.
Because of Hitler?
Annemarie finds merits in Mr. Hitler... not apparent to more detached observers.
But you don't agree?
As a banker,
I have to know some economics...
You have to go up about 1,500 meters to get good snow this late.
The Zugspitze.
St. Christopher above Adelberg...
This is getting to be a persecution complex.
Not to speak in front of Reinhard, who's been with us 12 years.
I believe the best rule is to make no exceptions.
The great danger about the Nazis,
I believe... is they must keep expanding or collapse.
Sooner or later this means war.
He says peace is the great dream of his life.
While he builds tanks and planes and surrounds himself with gangsters.
Some of them are crude, I know.
But I think we need their strength.
Now we have become part of a great, powerful country.
- Who could it be?
- I don't know.
Excuse me.
Gestapo!
Excuse me.
Kurt!
Do you know why he did it?
His grandmother on his father's side was Jewish.
The Nazis knew.
Apparently, he was half out of his mind with fear.
He couldn't decide whether to get out of the country or what.
He discussed all this with his lawyer, but he never told me.
- How would you have reacted?
- I'm not sure.
Perhaps he wasn't either.
It wasn't fair of him not to tell me.
How could I help him if I didn't know?
He must have been desperate.
You don't think what he did was right, do you?
Nothing ever can justify suicide.
But some cases are easier to understand.
The mental condition of people who feel persecuted becomes distorted... and nothing they do is understandable to the normal mind.
Your Eminence.
Forgive me for breaking in on you like this, but I was at the opera... and it occurred to me you'd want to read this at the earliest opportunity.
The correction you asked for of our statement on the plebiscite.
You'll probably want to send it on to the Vatican.
I think you'll find it covers all the points we discussed.
- When will this be published?
- Is Your Excellency joking?
The Nazis aren't going to let anything be printed that will lose them votes.
I suggest you have it read in every church in the country, Sunday morning.
That's the day of the plebiscite.
Won't many people go to Mass before they vote?
- It might cause disturbances.
- Then you reject the idea?
Unless I get a direct order from the Vatican. That, I'd naturally obey... even if I thought it was imprudent.
Good night, Bishop Fermoyle.
Don't bother to show me out.
I can see how busy you are.
We're getting the papers from Archbishop
Cicognani's regime ready for shipment.
Reminding me that we'll soon have no direct voice of Rome at our side.
Good night.
While His Eminence was here, this lady came.
I wouldn't have come here, but I didn't know where else to turn.
What's happening?
They are following me, the Gestapo.
I think they followed me here.
I don't know what they're after, but... if they take me to prison, they can make me say anything they want to, can't they?
With drugs and torture.
I don't think I could stand much pain.
- I don't know what to do, where to go.
- You can stay here.
Father Neidermoser?
Is Sister Wilhelmina still up?
- I believe so.
- Please ask her to come here.
You'll be safe with us.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I'm glad I can be of help to you.
Thank you.
Come in.
- You sent for me, Your Excellency?
- Yes, Sister.
I want you to prepare a room for Frau von Hartman.
Certainly.
Sister Wilhelmina will see to it that you have everything you need.
Will you come with me,
Frau von Hartman?
Thank you again.
Your Eminence must have been among the first voters this morning.
The news was on the radio at 9:00.
I'm an earlier riser.
I like to say Mass at 6:00.
You advertised how you had voted.
I reported to you the Holy Father's concern for the...
My dear Bishop, you said I was to issue no more statements on the plebiscite.
Last night, at the end of Hitler's campaign speech, all the church bells rang again.
You just won't understand about the bells.
What would attract attention is not to ring them.
Radio reports say that priests all over the country are urging people to vote "Yes."
And the big news is that after you cast your vote...
My purely personal vote.
You gave the Nazi salute, Heil Hitler.
That is correct. The words have become a part of the German language.
They are used instead of "good morning" or "good evening"... even, I regret to say, instead of "God bless you."
Still, under the circumstances, that salute was a partisan political act.
I was not issuing a statement.
I have not disobeyed the Holy Father.
Literally, maybe not.
What I tried to convey to Your Eminence was a spirit, a general attitude.
To that you obviously paid no attention at all.
You deliberately decided that your way was better than the Holy Father's.
That's how I see it, and that's how I'll have to report it.
One moment, Bishop.
You must understand that I have no wish to pry into your personal life.
That was taken at Kurt von Hartman's funeral.
May I ask how Your Eminence happens to have come by this picture?
The police gave it to me.
I knew Frau von Hartman before she was married.
I was here at the time during a leave of absence from priesthood.
A leave of absence?
My vows naturally remained in force.
That was many years ago.
And right now, this very same woman is living with you at the nunciature?
She's staying with Sister Wilhelmina, the housekeeper.
I don't suggest there's anything improper about it.
But you must appreciate what the Nazis might make of it.
I granted Frau von Hartman sanctuary.
From the police, I know.
But does the fact that the police claim she has committed a crime... make the propaganda image any more favorable to the Church?
She has not committed a crime.
Nobody has charged her with anything.
I'd better bring you up to date on that.
There is clear evidence that Kurt von Hartman... for understandable reasons, was planning to leave Austria.
That may be true, but it hardly...
He wanted to take a large sum of money with him.
That's been against the law for years, long before the Nazis came.
This in no way involves his wife.
The fact that her personal jewelry was included.
Included in what?
Sewn, with the money, into the lining of a suitcase found in the apartment.
- I didn't know about that.
- She didn't tell you.
She told me that she knew nothing about her husband's plans.
And you accepted that.
I suppose it might even be true.
If it is, she should want the investigation to proceed so her name can be cleared.
Simply tell her to cooperate with the authorities.
- When the authorities are the Gestapo...
- I cannot have this scandal.
Not at a moment when I am completing... the most delicate negotiations for the future of the Church in Austria.
I have to think about it.
I have to talk to Frau von Hartman.
But you appreciate the importance of the problem and the urgency?
You'll find a way that won't embarrass me or my relations with the new government?
Yes, I will find a way.
They've just reported the totals of the plebiscite.
11,807 "No" votes.
4,443,208 "Yes" votes.
The percentage of "Yes" votes was 99.73.
Thank you, Father.
99 and 3/4 percent majority.
There's a soap in America that's advertised as 99.44 percent pure.
But Hitler has to be even purer.
- You'll close the nunciature.
- Austria doesn't exist anymore.
Our diplomatic relations are with Germany, with the nuncio in Berlin.
The Gestapo said they found a suitcase hidden in your apartment.
Jewelry of yours was sewn into the lining along with cash.
Kurt always kept my jewelry in his safe.
I'll find a way to get you out of the country.
You don't owe me anything, Stephen.
I owe you a great deal.
At a time when I'd forgotten how to love, you helped me to love again.
And you gave that love, not to me, but to God.
It was his to begin with, it was always his.
For me it was always you.
I never loved another man but you.
Excuse me, Your Excellency, telephone.
I want a Vatican witness along with me tonight.
Not only to keep the record straight, but it should be an educational experience.
I want you to report that a non-Roman can practice successful diplomacy.
- Where are we going?
- To see Adolf Hitler.
We've been waiting more than two hours.
Does the Führer know this?
- I'm sure he knows, Your Eminence.
- Thank you.
Two hours is a bit long, no matter how busy he is... but at least we should find him in a good mood.
Austria is his greatest triumph yet.
Cardinal Innitzer.
Not Bishop Fermoyle.
- The Führer wants to speak to you alone.
- But I specifically asked...
The Führer gave these orders.
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
You will tell people when you are home in America, about these days of glory... how you saw two German countries peacefully reunited.
I will tell people what I saw.
It will be the same when we free our German brothers... in the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia.
And also in your country.
- You're talking about the United States?
- Yes.
We have no wish to conquer your land or harm your people.
Our only purpose is to liberate the five million Germans there.
Your friend must have said something wrong.
He repudiated all his promises to me, every one of them.
There is going to be a war, he says.
The Church must be drafted into the service of the Fatherland... the same as the Army.
In Austria, there must be even more control than in Germany... because we have such a Catholic majority.
Our schools are to be abolished.
Our youth groups dissolved.
Catholic marriage will no longer have the force of law.
At the very end, he started yelling... and asked me if I didn't think
Almighty God... had chosen him to lead the German people to their destiny.
He didn't wait for an answer.
And I remembered myself at the plebiscite... raising my hand in a heathen salute... and saying not, "Praise to the Lord," but "Heil Hitler."
We could save the Blessed Sacrament.
It leads to the crypt under the cathedral.
Eminence!
Oh, no. It's only a scratch.
We must get you out of here.
With a Vatican passport, you are one of the few people who can leave the country.
At least for the moment. You must tell the truth about Hitler's promises.
You can't stay here, Your Eminence.
You're not safe.
Safety, I'm afraid, is among the illusions we can no longer depend on.
Pray for me.
Your Excellency, the most extraordinary thing...
Frau von Hartman.
The Gestapo came to question her. I told them they'd no right to enter the building.
- That it's the soil of a sovereign power.
- What happened?
Frau von Hartman went outside to meet them.
She didn't wish to claim the right of asylum here.
I begged her to wait till
Your Excellency returned, but...
She wouldn't?
Frau von Hartman said her character was barely strong enough... to do what she was doing right then.
It wouldn't hold up if she had to talk to you about it.
Open up!
I couldn't believe it, Your Excellency, when they told me who was here.
Why did you let them take you?
Because it suddenly seemed easier not to fight them.
It just didn't matter anymore.
It matters a lot.
We both know you're innocent.
Of one thing, to escape from Austria with money and jewels. I'm innocent of that.
And with the right help, you may prove it.
I have a lawyer coming to see you.
Is it worth so much effort? I wonder.
I've had time to think about myself since Kurt died.
When I was a spoiled girl,
I fell in love with a young man.
A priest.
I loved him. At least, I think I loved him.
But he was also a challenge to my vanity.
I wanted to take him away from his priesthood.
I wanted to take him away from God.
- You're not allowing us much time.
- No, let me speak please.
When I lost that campaign,
I was disappointed... and I turned to Kurt, which might have been all right... if I had been able to make myself, for him, the wife I used to dream about.
A woman who existed only for her man.
Poor Kurt.
He would have been satisfied with less, much less, but I gave him nothing.
- Annemarie...
- Let me finish.
Even when two people have very little to share... it is possible for them to make some sort of a life together.
Until one of them has a very strong need of the other.
When Kurt felt such a need, there was nowhere for him to turn.
He loved me too much to leave the country without me... and he couldn't be sure enough of me to tell me about his plan.
I can imagine what he felt... when he heard my foolish talk about the new Greater Germany.
Because of that alone, it serves me right that I'm here now.
Do you think Kurt would feel that way?
No.
He was too kind.
He would not want to see me hurt.
Then that's one reason to try to clear yourself, for his sake.
Also for mine, because I care what happens to you.
Thank you. I wish I did.
Let's wrap it up! Your time is up.
You have to. The most important reason of all is for your own sake.
Because of what you are.
Not an ant in a totalitarian anthill... but a human being, an individual... with a God-given soul of your own.
Come.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
And goodbye.
I have the honor to inform
Your Eminence... that the Holy Father will confer the cardinal's biretta... at the semipublic consistory in the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican...
Thursday morning, at 10:00.
Thank you.
My friends... dear brethren in Christ... my mother... and the other members of my family, who have traveled so far for this occasion.
I thank you all for being here.
And I know you share my gratitude to the Holy Father... for the honor he has done to me and to America.
When His Holiness informed me that he intended to name me... to the Sacred College of Cardinals... my first reaction was that
I could not live up to his confidence in me.
I haven't gotten over that fear yet.
I doubt that I ever will.
But the second thought I had about it gave me the strength to try.
What occurred to me was that there is a special significance... in the Holy Father's decision to send me back to my own country... as a cardinal and archbishop... at this moment of global crisis.
America's first bishop, John Carroll... was the brother of a signer of the Declaration of Independence... and a living example... of that loyalty to church and state... to religion and to democracy... that this moment in history demands from us all.
I have seen at close range... the hell on earth that awaits us all if totalitarianism prevails.
If the world forgets that all men alike are the children of God... endowed by their Creator... with the unalienable right... to life... liberty... and the pursuit of happiness.
That is America's creed.
That is the Gospel of the Church.
It is in danger, at this moment, from men... and doctrines that are the enemies of all freedoms... political, as well as religious.
The defense of freedom calls for strong voices... strong hearts... strong hands.
Pray for me, that I may not falter... and for the liberty and exaltation of our church... and our beloved country.
God bless you.
You were marvelous at dinner.
That guy trying to piss me off.
You salvaged the situation.
And your next film.
- At the same time, yes.
Thank you.
I love our complicity.
It's been very useful, hasn't it?
Indispensable.
It's very nice, to be "indispensable".
I'll put the car in the garage.
I'm not filming tomorrow.
We could have a drink.
That's what I was going to do.
You've changed?
I'm going to cause you some pain, Francois.
It upsets me because I adore you, but I have no choice.
I'm leaving.
You're leaving?
Where are you going?
Francois, I'm leaving you.
I beg you...
Stop acting.
- But I'm not acting.
- Stop it, will you?
It isn't serious?
Listen, you haven't stopped working, you're tired, your nerves are shot.
Go to bed.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
You don't understand:
I'm leaving now.
Immediately.
Someone's waiting for me.
Who's waiting for you?
Are you crazy?
I beg you.
Let's not make a scene.
We could at least not be ridiculous.
I've so much affection for you.
I want everything to go smoothly, to be worthy of us.
Who is it?
Thierry Damiot.
Francais' kid?
He's 10 years younger than you!
That's not important.
It's the truth.
You're famous, you're beautiful...
You could help him a lot.
- Yes.
I could be useful to him too.
He's a child.
He's lost, in this environment...
I beg you.
It's funny...
How in one minute, a life can be turned upside down.
You've got your career.
Make this film that they've offered you in America.
When you return, we'll see each other again.
I don't think I could live entirely without you.
You make mountains out of molehills, but between civilized people,
Divorce is simply a formality.
THREE ROOMS IN MANHATTAN
A chef salad with no celery but with a hard-boiled egg.
Say that again?
A chef salad with no celery but with a hard-boiled egg.
Thank you.
Eat things that are easier to pronounce.
I've already seen this.
At this hour, they show old films.
- Your eggs are going to be cold.
- They are already.
Parisian?
Yes.
Francois Combe.
Here, I'm called Kay.
That's enough.
It serves all purposes.
You live in Paris?
I do.
By la Muette.
- Oh? I live in Auteuil.
We're practically neighbors.
He's nice.
Have you been here a long time?
- Six months.
And you? - I don't know.
Yesterday, centuries...
It's a little nauseating, isn't it?
I always order things I don't like.
Will you look at that?
There's so much.
The cake is only a pretext.
A pretext to stay.
You eat, time passes...
All this whipped cream, it reminds me of Switzerland.
"You drink milk.
But you must eat whipped cream."
Have you ever been to Switzerland?
I was there "for my health".
- A long time?
- Several months.
Look, it isn't tragic.
And even when I remember it, it's good memories.
It's calm.
The people are nice, they spoil you.
They fuss over you, they're concerned about you.
And then there's the mountains.
Thank you.
The mountains are beautiful.
It's like television.
You sit there for hours... and then you're not even looking anymore, you're not thinking about anything.
- I think they're going to close.
- Already? You think so?
- Arrivederci.
- Arrivederci.
An Italian!
- Have you also been to Italy?
- To Rome, yes.
- Before or after Switzerland?
- Before.
- Have you traveled a lot?
- Yes.
Yes, a whole lot.
And now New York.
A stopover?
Do you know of a real stopover?
I hate the places that close.
In the beginning, I loved New York, but then...
All cities are the same.
You love them or you don't as a function of how you find them.
- You love them?
- Here or elsewhere.
Yes, but elsewhere, you can fool yourself.
- But here...
- Yes.
Here when you lose, you lose a lot.
- Are you tired?
- It's my shoe.
- We'll take a taxi.
- No, it's all right.
Let's walk.
What I love about New York at night, is this smoke.
It reminds me of The Arabian Nights.
There's always smoke rising in the form of a genie.
A good genie, mind you.
He asks what you want, he gives it to you, and everything changes.
Already?
Another.
- I can't.
- Just one, I promise.
Bartender...
He offered us free drinks.
To toast the birth of his son.
I understood.
A happy guy, that's good.
Until the moment it all cracks.
That day, he'll be like everyone else.
He'll still have memories and pretty photos.
Not everyone has even that.
I don't have any of my daughter.
How old is she?
No. 13 now.
She lives with her father.
In Mexico.
You don't...?
I mustn't talk about it.
I mustn't think about it.
I manage. I manage very well.
There. My glass is empty.
Where do you live?
As of this morning,
I don't live anywhere.
Come on.
Come on, Kay.
Come on, Kay.
- Where are we going?
- To tell the truth, I don't know.
- I thought we were going to your place. - No.
- Oh but of course.
- Oh no.
I live alone.
Absolutely alone.
That doesn't concern me.
When I lived at Jessy's,
I didn't think she was like that.
I thought she loved Pierre, an airline pilot.
But not at all, she didn't give a damn.
And then this guy from Texas showed up...
Women can't resist an oil well.
- What do they resist?
- I wanted to talk to her, tell her she was wrong, but Pierre...
She was frightful.
She told me some terrible things.
And this morning, she left with him, without a warning.
When I came back,
I couldn't get in.
The apartment's in Pierre's name.
He's been gone for three days.
I don't know when he'll be back.
And then I've got all my things in there.
I have only what I've got on me.
At the agency, maybe they could tell me when he returns.
Sure. Why not?
I can smell whisky.
They must have been drinking.
Kay?
You can come in.
- Good day.
- Good day.
Or sooner good evening.
- Do you know what time it is?
- No.
Almost 8:00.
Did I wake you up?
I'm sorry, but the door doesn't close.
This isn't the Waldorf.
This isn't the Waldorf.
- Could I use your comb?
- Yes.
I look ghastly.
I haven't shaved since yesterday...
I noticed.
Sorry.
You can't plan for everything.
The water's getting cold.
I'd like to get out of the tub.
I'll leave you then.
Oh no, that's not necessary.
But seeing this isn't the Waldorf, there's no bathrobe.
I'll get it for you.
What am I going to do?
I can't go out like this, with a two-day beard.
It's very simple:
You phone the porter, and he'll send someone out to buy a razor, some blades...
You want me to do it?
I could do that.
- You want me to run your bath?
- If you would.
Hello, this is Room 23.
Can you send someone to buy me a razor, please?
- A what?
- A razor.
A what?
- A razor! - Wait.
And a toothbrush?
There you go.
Good. I've got to hurry.
- I'm not in a hurry.
- Are you hungry?
You've got something to do?
No, nothing.
But we've got to eat.
We can't stay here.
No, of course not.
You're right.
Go take your bath.
I've got to buy some stockings.
- You haven't forgotten anything?
- I didn't have much with me.
Are you keeping the room for another night?
Yes, I'm keeping it.
Give me another 10 cents.
You like it?
- All the blues you desire.
Does it bring back memories?
No. Only a song I like.
What is it?
What do you want it to be?
You want me to go?
Are you leaving?
You've seen enough of me.
You're don't know what you're saying.
No. It's booze and not eating... plus waking up at night.
It's fatigue.
And then to have all these days and nights behind you...
You don't know where you are anymore.
You float.
No?
Yes, it's like that.
You float.
Look, there's a table free.
They've got marvelous steaks.
- You're a regular here?
- Yes, I told you.
I came with Jessy and Pierre, when they brought me here.
We lived around the corner.
We'll pass it later.
Maybe he's back in New York.
He's not there. It's the three windows on the third floor.
Were you happy?
I'd say you miss it.
I miss my things.
But happy? No.
But I had a place,
I had some piece of mind.
It's very small.
A bedroom, a living room...
Jessy was what she was.
All the same, it was better than being alone.
And when the pilot came?
I slept in the living room.
- Always?
- What do you mean?
- I mean...?
- You're getting ideas.
Not even.
And when you went out, where did you go?
Ah yes. To Number One.
I think you want to go there.
No.
It's all the same to me.
Is it all the same if we have a whisky?
Francois, I never slept with Pierre.
I know you don't care, but...
There was just one time... it was a little seedy.
A moment.
This past summer.
You know, August in New York, terrible heat, humidity, when everything sticks to you.
You're both dead with fatigue and at the end of your nerves.
It was the three of us.
Pierre had his shirt off.
He's very well built.
- And you?
- What about me?
What did you have on?
Just a flimsy robe, like Jessy.
It was so hot.
I wanted to take a shower, and Pierre blocked my way.
He said we were imbeciles, that we should take a shower together, all three of us.
We'd been drinking.
Jessy began to laugh.
Too hard.
Pierre watched us.
I passed him, and I locked myself in the shower.
And then, no one was talking.
You aren't jealous of
Pierre anymore?
Why would I be more jealous of
Pierre than of...
Paul.
Among others.
Every once in a while, I get the impression that you detest me.
No.
You must have charmed him.
It's for us that
I've been charming.
You see?
When I hear this song, it will take me back.
You also.
Whatever happens.
Tonight or tomorrow.
When you hear it, you'll think of me.
It's better when you shave.
Hold me close.
Thank you.
This memory will be truly perfect.
I've had enough of this place.
Pay the bill and let's go.
But not like that.
You've left too big a tip.
Here, half a dollar is enough.
Where do you want to go?
You don't want to go back to the hotel?
If you want.
Did you see?
The porter recognized us.
Yes, I noticed.
It's stupid, but that touched me.
Sit down.
- You don't think we've had enough?
- But of course.
This isn't like last night.
I feel good.
I've never felt so good.
Are you feeling all right?
Yes.
Francois, a cigarette.
It doesn't bore you, if I talk?
I need to talk.
And to smoke and to drink.
It's definitely your hour.
It comes from my Russian blood.
It's crazy, the number of women who have Russian blood.
But in my case, it's true.
My mother was Russian.
She was a pianist.
A very great pianist.
Her name was Vera.
You like the name Vera?
You're not listening.
But I am listening.
While you think about something else.
Always lucid or thinking you are.
That's okay, you're resigned.
Resigned to what?
Letting me talk.
I wanted to name my daughter Vera.
But my husband didn't.
He was Italian.
He wanted an Italian name.
She was born in Berlin.
We were at the Embassy.
He found that a Russian name was provocative.
It wasn't that.
To tell the truth, he was jealous...
Of everything I loved, of everything that touched me.
The ambassader was fond of me.
He was an old man.
He accused me of charming him.
We left for Rome, an immense palace.
The Larsi Palace.
I'm a Countess. It's funny.
His mother and his sisters...
The whole family lived there.
Everyone spied on me.
It was terrible.
Then I lost courage and I left.
For health reasons?
No. At first I lived on the Riviera.
No doubt alone.
I won't pretend.
You look angry. All the same
I'm telling you my life story.
Enough. Come.
- Won't you let me finish my drink?
- No. Get undressed.
Fine.
- Afterwards, on the Riviera...
- Enough. Stop talking.
You see? That's my life.
I adore squirrels and Central Park is full of them.
It's enough that I'm here.
I'll never see them again.
I must make them run away.
What?
I've never seen you in daylight.
Don't look at me.
I'm tired, my makeup's bad, you can see my wrinkles.
You men are lucky.
For you, age doesn't matter.
They're young as long as they're successful, but if it all falls to zero...
"Life at Zero", that doesn't mean anything. From any point of view.
I would have wanted for you to talk about yourself.
I would have wanted you to crack.
- Stop it.
I would have so wanted you to put your head against me, that you'd let yourself go, that you'd get rid of everything that hurts you...
You almost have a few times.
But you didn't want to.
Which is normal.
What can you expect from a woman you pick up in a bar?
Kay!
With whom you made love as if it were suicide.
- What is with you?
- You're fooling yourself.
There are so many things I'd want to tell you, to make your understand, even if you thought I was lying.
Maybe you can fix it.
For now, it doesn't matter.
Of course it doesn't matter.
After all these clubs, after all these bars, we can still get a little fresh air, a little sun, a little clarity, for our final walk.
What "final walk"?
You should have said goodbye in the street, in front of the hotel.
I know it's over.
I saw it happen.
But what have you seen?
The room, when you paid for it.
Yes, I paid the bill.
Come on. Come on.
Where?
First to walk, have a drink, two drinks, wait for the sun to go down.
Because the place I'm taking you, it's less ugly at night.
Having taken so much time to meet, and we live so close to one another...
It's here.
When I went out the other night,
I forgot to put out the light.
Here it is.
Well, walk in.
I suspected it, you know.
Are you looking for something?
They don't deliver milk here?
- I don't drink any.
- Oh really?
I can ask them to bring some up at any time.
Thank you.
I think for the morning, a Prince of Wales would be perfect.
Are you throwing me out?
- You've got something to do.
- I've got to meet a guy, that's all.
There's no fixed time.
Just some time today.
You'd be on my hands.
It's filthy.
I'll clean it up.
You're good at that?
I hate it.
You're not going to kiss me this morning?
- I'm happy.
- Me too.
We mustn't say it, though.
Get dressed.
It's strange.
I've never met a man with so many suits.
I'm an actor, I told you.
Half an actor's talent comes from his closet.
When you told me your name,
I didn't pay attention.
Yesterday, I didn't dare ask you.
- Francois Combe.
- Oh yes.
I've been very well known.
Even famous.
What's so funny?
I saw a film of yours.
In Rome, I think.
I thought you weren't my type.
That's what you think about at the movies? Bravo.
That's all women think about. What else does your success come from?
Oh, my coffee.
I don't know what you have in the morning.
We never had breakfast.
But you're French, so I made coffee.
Thank you.
There was nothing in the cupboard.
Not cookies, nor butter.
When I'm hungry, I go to the drugstore around the corner.
I should have got up earlier, there are so many things to get...
I never eat in the morning.
To watch my weight.
I should have bought some flowers.
No. It's better without.
It's as if we'd been together forever.
A cigarette?
What?
It's strange, your cigarette.
You're never without one.
It's automatic.
I didn't even want one.
Drink your coffee before it gets cold. - Yes.
Excuse me. Everything is broken and dirty.
- It didn't matter before.
- It doesn't matter to me.
When Hollywood didn't work out and I came back here,
First I lived at the Waldorf.
And then another...
- You told me all that last night.
We said a lot.
I said a lot.
You said a lot. At last.
Yes...I did nothing else.
- Are you angry?
- About what? No.
It even made me happy.
It was so much better.
Like an old couple.
Oh no. I hate old couples.
- Not all of them.
- Yes, all of them!
They both resent each other because no one has the courage to leave.
Do you still love her?
You don't understand.
It's all about that.
It's all about her.
Always this idiotic sentimentality.
That doesn't matter for me anymore.
It's me alone.
I found myself alone.
To die alone, to cry out alone.
If you don't understand that...
Come here, Francois.
Come here.
Come.
Don't you want to sit down?
You were alone, but not as alone as me.
Wait!
I have to tell you something.
I know this is going to hurt you, but you're jealous.
And I love you because you're jealous.
When you met me,
I was so completely alone that I decided to follow the first man that came along.
It didn't matter who.
I love you, Francois.
But now you must leave.
Have courage, Francois.
I'll give you two hours.
Make it three.
When you come back, you'll find a fantastic lunch waiting.
- It doesn't matter.
- No, go.
Go. I don't want to look at you.
Francois!
- I'll have to buy some things...
- Sorry.
I'll need some stockings.
Can I?
The key. I'll have to go shopping.
Go on, hurry.
Francois Combe, for the role of the Frenchman.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
I ashamed to offer it to you.
A ridiculous Frenchman with a moustache.
- It doesn't pay well.
- It doesn't matter.
Is it that bad?
- I could hold out for a few months.
- And then?
Don't try to understand.
I don't understand myself.
- If you could hire me...
- I could put you up for awhile.
A series of assignments... for 6, 8 months.
- But that would be nothing as well.
- A "flop", as you say.
Combe, with your talent, the name that you still have in Paris...
I don't want to go back to Paris.
I don't like it anymore.
You don't like Paris anymore?
There's no one more patriotic than an expatriate, and yet...
Paris...
There I was poor,
I went broke...
I had to leave the country.
It isn't true what they say, that I swept the floor of the Billancourt studios.
They wouldn't even let me do that much.
I know what's happened.
But if you had to leave a country every time a woman dumped you, the world wouldn't be big enough.
Handsome, a French accent...
You could make it here!
Hollywood showed me otherwise.
Here, luck comes your way several times.
But to be successful here, you have to really want it.
Think only about that.
Thanks for seeing me and thanks for the part.
I cost you 20,000 lires.
Don't you remember?
You were filming in Rome,
Via Veneto.
We met there.
I hadn't yet reached my peak.
I hit you up.
- I don't remember.
- No?
Come with me.
Afterwards, we'll have a drink.
All my life, throughout Europe,
I've done business on bar tables.
Offices, even when they're beautiful, every once in a while,
I escape them.
- Is someone expecting you?
- No, not at all.
Here I make rain and
I make the sun shine.
Could you find a job for a girl I know?
- What has she done?
- Nothing.
As a telephone girl?
A model? A secretary?
- I think so.
- How old is she?
In her thirties.
Does she have a husband? Money?
Enough to live on?
No.
Does she at least have some jewels?
- Not even that.
- Then she is done for!
I thought that luck comes your way several times.
Yes. But for girls in their thirties, it's done.
They must be set up, otherwise...
"Otherwise"?
There's nothing left but working in a movie house.
And not at the front, either.
Have I been too blunt?
- This isn't someone who...
- No.
- It's just a friend.
- Oh really? I prefer that.
Because in such a case, the girl would be playing her last card.
And that...
Hourvitch, how long did you live in Rome?
4 years.
- Did you know Countess Larsi?
- Yes.
I've even seen her in New York.
New York's funny.
You meet everyone here, high and low.
She looked low.
- It isn't for her that you...
- No, no.
- What does her husband do?
- He's a diplomat, I think.
He's been assigned to Mexico.
The poor man.
- She really opened his eyes.
- Oh really?
There was a pretty scandal.
She left him for a gigolo.
Excuse me. Just a word...
- Taking a rest?
- Will I see you before you leave?
No. It's out of the question.
He really organizes his life.
Left? But where?
But where?
How long ago?
But it isn't possible.
But I don't have the key.
I told her to refuse. I'm the one who pays the rent, aren't I?
Same again, please.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Francois, is that you?
Francois?
But where are you?
- I didn't know how to find you.
- How long have you been here?
What does it matter, if I come or I leave?
What does it matter?
- Come have a drink.
- No.
- We have to talk.
- Not now, Pierre.
Tomorrow.
Oh no! You aren't going to leave.
- No...
- Right now! Come on.
Two Scotches!
You've had enough to drink.
Are you going to lecture me too?
- That's our song.
- I know, Pierre.
I know.
"I know, Pierre. I know."
What else do you know?
Do you know I'm hurting?
All the same!
All of them!
All made the same.
And us, like idiots, we get strung along, we believe it.
But why? Why?
Kay, what have I done?
- Haven't I always been a good guy?
- Yes, Pierre, always.
Then why?
Answer.
You wouldn't understand.
Like when I was a child:
"You wouldn't understand."
"Later on, you'll see."
But I never understood.
Never!
Even after I grew up.
I've never fallen for your stories, your dirty schemes.
You've always had me, always.
The great, the good women...
I've got a present, something from Paris.
And I rang, I rang...
I was always happy, every time I arrived.
Not a word, a letter.
Nothing, no one.
No one left.
The presents, the pretty words...
In the trashcan!
Kay...
I'm drunk, it's true, but I swear, I will try to understand.
What's happened?
What's happened?
Kay, little Kay,
I've had too much trouble. Tell me.
What does he want?
- Kay, don't leave!
- Let me go!
I don't want to be alone.
- It's very important.
- And I'm not?
For me, it's my life.
Life!
That's something proper, life.
I don't give a damn about it.
I'm sick of it.
You're always alone, in life.
Don't look at me like that,
I'll explain.
- He hasn't kept you?
- That was Pierre.
I looked for you everywhere and found him.
Or maybe it's that you don't want me anymore?
He's what? 30 years old?
You too, you like them young.
- It's exciting.
- What are you talking about?
But the pretty young man,
I've already had that.
You're going to leave!
- Go on!
- Francois...
You don't know where to sleep tonight?
- Here.
- You don't have the right.
Where I picked you up, someone else will find you.
It's perfect, your little game.
Your tricks are always the same.
Or do you have others?
What are you waiting for?
- Francois...
- I don't want to hear it.
Get out! Get out!
Get going!
But hurry!
I'm going.
But first, I want you to listen.
Quick. There'll be no one left.
This isn't worthy of you.
Oh yes, I see.
The ambassader bit, the Countess bit.
Before, the gigolo.
Afterwards, whatever you can find.
Wait.
Come here.
It's stupid, after all.
For you, me or somebody else,
It's all the same.
You might as well make your bed here.
Take your clothes off!
You make love well.
Why deprive me of that?
It's true you've got experience.
How many men have you slept with?
Can you count them all?
Tell me!
- Answer!
- It matters so little.
Here in New York, how many have there been?
When I say "sleep"...
Here, taxis are the fashion.
Dirty business in the movie houses?
Do you take them to bars or do you take them home?
Do they walk too?
Do they let you have them?
- Do you tell them the same stories?
- No.
You're lying!
You lie, you all do.
Don't hate me.
Forgive me, forgive me.
No doubt it was necessary.
My darling...
My poor darling.
Oh, it's you.
Ringing the buzzer three times...
I wasn't thinking. Habit.
Come in.
- Francois Combe, a friend.
- You can come in too.
I came to get my things.
They're over there.
You can't fool yourself, there's more there than your own.
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.
I will.
- Pierre makes great coffee.
- Not at all in the American style.
That was you, at the bar?
My poor Kay, how I must have tested you.
- I wasn't very nice.
- Neither was he.
It's going better, this morning?
- Yes.
Much better.
You're lucky.
I got a hangover that changed nothing.
You think you're going to forget, you'll no longer think about it...
But when I came back, it was even worse.
Now it's me who sleeps on the couch.
I would never have slept on the couch.
It must be awful.
- Very.
I'll take down your bags.
Do you mind?
Well?
I won't yell at you, even if you knew.
I've only known him the last few days.
I told her what I thought, and she threw me out.
Poor Kay.
It was a hard blow.
No. More of a chance.
- Of course, there's a guy, isn't there? - Yes.
- You know him?
- I saw him.
- Handsome guy?
- Disgusting.
It's stupid, but I like that even better.
Lots of money?
Enormous.
Then of course,
I didn't carry the weight.
That will teach me, stupid dreams.
The return to France, the marriage, the whole business.
The fool wakes at last.
The good man who was taken in.
To dump me like that...
In this genre, I never saw better.
Kay,
You knew her.
At least in the beginning...
I'm sure she loved you.
That can't be true, but thanks anyway.
- Pierre... - My cigarettes are in the living room.
- What are you going to do?
- Smoke, I told you.
- And then?
- Let you finish packing your bags, leave, because I like you, but to see you here brings back too many memories.
- And after?
- After?
I'm going to ask to change airlines.
I've had enough of New York.
I'm going to try South America.
Brazilians will perhaps be more sensitive to my charms.
In fact, I'm leaving tonight.
The apartment is paid up for another month.
- If your heart tells you...
- Thank you.
We've got a room.
Give me the address.
If I return to New York...
I'll know where to write if Jessy gives any news.
Good.
Well, see you.
Maybe one of these days.
Thank you.
And again, forgive me for yesterday.
When you leave, you only have to pull the door closed.
Now do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
It's pretty, isn't it?
A leftover from my glory days.
5 years old.
Not even out of fashion.
- Do you want to put it on?
- Yes. How did you know?
You want me to?
What is it?
Nothing.
Another Kay.
It's the hair.
For the dress, it's better, isn't it?
And now?
Are you going to kiss me?
- What?
- Nothing.
A little bit like another Francois.
These broadcasts you talked about the other day...
- You still want to?
- Yes, I still want to.
Good. I'll give them to you.
After all, I win.
An actor like you for such junk...
- Thank you.
But don't thank me.
Or rather, do.
Thank me for the good advice
I give you with it.
Drop everything after tomorrow.
Go back to Paris.
Transform yourself!
Thanks for the advice.
- Won't you follow it?
- Absolutely not.
Oh, it's for the good woman.
The other day, I didn't insist.
I was very gentle.
She was drowning... and you pulled her out.
Those who are drowning pull you under.
Hourvitch, I was already "under".
Now I'll resurface.
It won't last.
She'll drag you back in and you'll fall further.
- You don't know her.
- You neither.
You don't know a woman until you realize she's robbed you.
Get out, there's still time.
Do like me.
I've spent my life running.
- From women?
No. Creditors, prosecutions...
You make another fortune, you move to another country, but when a woman has destroyed you, she's destroyed everything.
- Maybe another would rebuild it. 
- How you talk!
Perhaps it is true, after all, that actors are stupid.
Wait a minute, please.
- I thought you'd left.
- Tonight.
- News from Jessy?
- I thought so.
A telegram that I've opened.
It's for you.
- Do you have it?
- I brought it.
- What are you doing?
- What do you want me to do?
Are there flights to Mexico?
- I called to ask, but there are no seats left.
- It's impossible.
I know a girl at Pan Am.
We're going to try.
This isn't just a ruse to make you come?
You don't know him.
People have regrets, they can change.
Not him.
A decision is a decision.
You have to be firm.
"Michelle is gravely ill." He doesn't even say what's wrong with her.
When she was little, she was already fragile.
- When did you last see her?
- A long time ago.
Not since...
Not since I left.
It's my fault of course, but he did everything he had to.
He's very organized.
He thinks of everything.
Michelle is gravely ill, he did his duty.
He even wired the bank, in case...
He definitely should have suspected.
- Is it hard for you?
- What?
Your daughter...
It's like a kind of dull pain that awakens when I see a child, or for any reason at all.
I can't close it.
Can you help?
What if he asked you to stay for her sake?
Oh, that would surprise me.
Would it bother you if I left some things?
Not if you return.
You are going to come back, aren't you?
Of course, Francois.
You should put on a heavier dress.
Down there, it's very hot.
- You want to eat something?
- No. I'm not that hungry.
And on the plane, they always give you something...
Relax, lie down.
You've got time.
There are two hours to go.
Light me one.
Lie next to me.
You'll phone?
- If it's possible.
- It's always possible.
Then I'll phone.
It's for you that
I'm most concerned, because you're going to find yourself alone again.
You're going to come with me, aren't you?
I know it's selfish of me, but...
But of course,
I'll come with you.
And even if I have no more courage, you must make me go.
Because I must.
That's right...
I'll force you.
I'll tell His Excellency.
I had a lot of trouble finding you.
You change addresses a lot.
Combe, come here.
I'll introduce you,
You'll work together.
- Hello!
- You were very good.
And you weren't bad either.
I love Frenchmen!
Come on, we're going to have dinner and a drink.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Why not?
Come on!
I'm waiting for a phone call.
I always invite him and it's always the same story.
- He's in love.
- That's nice.
You mustn't laugh at him.
The intervention has done wonders.
In this little body there is such resistance...
She takes after you, Madam.
I admire the courage with which you've watched her.
Thank you.
Is she awake?
Not before tomorrow.
But she'll be very weak.
This will be your last bad night.
I'll come back this evening.
- My compliments.
- Goodbye.
Thank you.
You've been perfect.
You're exhausted.
I'll have them prepare you a room at the embassy.
Tomorrow, I'll send the chauffeur.
And when she wakes up?
You don't want her to see me...
Or talk to me.
You don't have the right!
To spare her all emotions in her condition? Yes.
Such that...
When will you return to New York?
When I'm certain she's okay.
Tomorrow, you'll be reassured.
Why did you call me?
I thought I was doing my duty.
Did she ask for me?
For a child that's suffering...
It's an automatic reflex.
- Your ticket is reserved for tomorrow. - Thank you.
You'll forgive me for not taking you to the airport, as you'll excuse me for leaving you alone tonight.
One of these embassy dinners that always bored you.
I'll see you before you leave.
I must ask a question.
What kind of question?
Financial.
For years I would have loved to be able to be with you.
And my daughter?
But you made a choice.
I didn't choose that.
And then, I don't know anymore.
What happened, was...
That was another woman in another life.
As for her?
How would she find her place next to this other woman in this other life?
Know that her life is perfect, well-organized, and calm.
She suffers no pain.
She is happy, vivacious.
Everyone underestimates the heartlessness and egotism of children.
It's their sole defense.
She knows?
I've told her the truth.
That you were...
That you'd left.
Mind you, I left out the details.
For later.
Even if you hadn't, I would have told her myself.
That way, if one day she suffers, and she will, she'll know that I understand, and she'll come to me.
Anything else?
Yes.
Could I telephone New York?
At the clinic, it would be difficult.
Are you happy?
Yes.
I'm happy.
There's a phone in your room.
Excuse me, I've got an appointment.
- Wait!
- No.
Stay, amuse yourself, have a drink.
I have a tab here.
You"ll accompany June.
I can go back alone.
- Of course, French etiquette...
Make him drink, dance, live.
- Do you want to dance?
- No.
- So I won't make you.
- Thank you.
Are you sad or happy when you drink?
Forgive me.
I'm not very...
My lighter's out.
So...
Tell me about her.
It's the only subject that interests you.
- It'll bore you.
- No.
I like love, even when it's not my own.
Well?
She smokes like you do.
What do you mean, she smokes like me? All the time?
Is she pretty?
Moving.
That's the most important thing.
And?
Tired, wounded, even blasee.
And then sometimes...
It's difficult.
It's good to be loved like that.
"Loved"...
I know that she annoys me.
I know that I resent her.
But I know that I need her too.
She makes me understand the importance of human contact.
Yes. I know.
You're a good listener.
Something must be keeping her.
She said she'd phone and she said she'd come back.
No, no.
I fooled myself.
I wanted to fool myself.
Hourvitch was right.
It's better this way.
That's all that was missing!
- Is that your song?
- Yes.
That isn't very original.
Love is never very original.
- Do you like this place?
- As well here as elsewhere...
Then why not elsewhere?
Of course. Why not?
Hello!
- Francois!
- Hello?
- I can't hear. Is that you?
- Hello, Kay!
I was waiting for your call.
I couldn't leave the clinic.
- Is your daughter better?
- Yes. She's saved.
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
And you, did you miss me?
A lot.
Did you go out much?
I stayed in every night.
My poor darling.
All the ideas you must have had.
Did you imagine terrible things?
I was concerned.
I didn't understand.
I get the feeling you're angry with me.
It isn't my fault.
Don't you believe me?
Why do you say that?
Your voice sounds funny.
- I swear it's not true.
What is it?
Nothing. I don't know...
The phone, the distance...
- I don't know.
- You seem strange.
It's that you woke me suddenly.
I called you several times last night.
I said I called you several times last night!
It was the night of the broadcast.
I came home and I went to bed.
Are you happy?
Did it go well?
Yes.
It went very well.
And afterwards, you went out with
Hourvitch and you drank.
Absolutely not.
What made you believe that?
Don't hang up. I'm still talking.
Hello! They're going to cut us off.
I'm coming home tomorrow.
Wait a minute.
American Airlines, Flight 302.
I don't know what time it gets there.
Francois?
Are you happy I'm coming home?
Do you doubt it?
Why?
I don't know, just a feeling.
I could be wrong.
Will you be there?
Of course.
- I'm so happy.
- I love you.
Yes.
Me too, I love you.
Sorry to have woken you.
Go back to sleep.
- Until tomorrow, Francois.
- Until tomorrow.
I'll get dressed and take you home.
I'm used to going home alone.
And then, she might call.
I would.
But I always have bad reactions.
Has she guessed?
I don't know.
- Will you tell her?
- Yes.
She's lucky.
My lighter wasn't empty after all.
Don't be sad.
Tomorrow she'll be here.
You're kind.
Don't regret it too much.
Because the whole time, you only thought of her.
Women notice these things.
Forgive me.
For what?
For that, for not driving you home, for this situation.
It's all my fault.
Good luck, June.
It doesn't matter.
You're already here?
I took an earlier flight.
I missed you so.
- How long have you been here?
- An hour.
I was afraid you'd gone to the airport.
And my key?
I don't have it.
Yes, that's right.
My poor darling!
I was going to straighten things up before you came.
- I couldn't know.
- I should have waited.
No, you were right.
I didn't see your return like this.
Francois!
You haven't even kissed me.
Hello, Kay.
I must look awful.
And your daughter?
I'll tell you later.
What is it?
Nothing.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
So I look at you.
You, your gestures...
Which annoy you.
Larsi however has made an important one.
Does that bother you?
No.
He's going to see his lawyer about creating a kind of pension for me.
So I won't be a burden to you.
How was he?
The same.
He understands nothing.
- Or he refuses to.
There are men like that.
It's our form of pride, or defense, perhaps.
Francois...
What's changed?
- Nothing.
Nothing and many things.
Good.
I hope you'll tell me about it.
No, don't unpack... to pack again tomorrow.
What is it?
It's true. Forgive me,
I'm already far away.
It's done, this room.
It's already in the past.
And what will be the future?
Who knows! Here, Paris...
Now it doesn't matter.
"It doesn't matter"...
In other words,
I was right to leave.
Yes.
It was necessary.
Last night when I phoned,
I had the feeiing there was someone with you.
There was.
Here, in our room?
And idiot that I am,
I was so happy to call.
Yes, I know.
I wanted to tell you.
She was...
It was all about you.
It's so difficult.
Kay!
Let me go! Let me go!
I know I've hurt you.
But don't go off to do the same thing.
Not you, Kay, not you!
You've gone past all that.
I've finally caught up with you.
"Caught up with me"?
I love you.
That's what I wanted to tell you at the airport.
No matter what happens, whether I'm happy or unhappy.
In advance, I accept it.
Since last night, I've wanted to cry it out to you.
Since yesterday, 
I've lived in fear.
Since last night,
I've lived with you, on a new plane.
I love you, no matter what happens, whatever I endure, whatever...
Kay!
It's a strange place to talk of these things.
You're right. Come on.
Not inside. I'd prefer to just leave it behind.
Get my cigarettes.
I didn't think I could be jealous.
- Believe me, it was...
- Don't say anything.
It was stupid of me.
Shall we go to the bar?
No. No more bars, no more records playing.
We'll never be alone again.
Translation by ironhills
December 2010
Why? How could it happen?
Another 100 metres and the Americans would have captured the Oberkassel Bridge.
It was the only escape route for our units in that sector.
Escape route?
No. A highway for the American Army into the heart of Germany.
In any case, the Führer is determined we shall not take such a risk again.
Not very likely.
There's only one bridge left.
And already it is threatened by the American forces.
One breakthrough, a few hours, and it too can be lost.
General von Brock, you must prepare to destroy the Remagen
Bridge at the earliest possible moment.
Destroy?
We have 75,000 men who would be trapped on the other side of the Rhine.
And if the bridge falls to the enemy, are you prepared for the consequences?
These men are all that's left of the 15th Army.
Their only hope of salvation is that bridge.
The 15th Army will stand or die.
The Führer has ordered that not one foot of our sacred soil will be yielded to the enemy.
Herr Feldmarschall, if orders won wars, we wouldn't now be fighting with our backs against the Rhine.
We'd be dancing at the London Savoy.
I suggest you speak more carefully,
Herr General.
You might be misunderstood.
These are your written orders.
In the present conditions
I must require your countersignature.
Quite clear, Herr Feldmarschall.
I'm to destroy Remagen Bridge at the earliest possible moment.
Good night, gentlemen.
I am sorry the war has disturbed your sleep.
What a brilliant plan to shorten the war.
Do just what the enemy wants.
Just got word from G2.
At least 50,000 Germans are still here, on this side of the Rhine, starting to move toward the bridge at Remagen, but we're gonna cut 'em off.
- Who's out front now, Colonel Dent?
- 27th Armoured Infantry, sir.
- You again, eh, Barnes?
- Somebody has to be up there, sir.
All right, now, listen to me.
I want those Germans.
I want an armoured recon outfit to make an all-out run for the river, see what kind of resistance we're gonna find.
That's Indian country out there.
Loose German units everywhere.
But I don't want any tippytoe tactics.
We've gotta move fast.
Sir, the men are dead on their feet.
So are the Germans, sir.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir.
- Do you think you can do it?
- I know we can, sir.
It's our only chance to grab the 15th Army before it reaches the Remagen Bridge and hightails it across the Rhine.
Be nice if that bridge'd be in one piece when we got there.
Forget bridges. If the Germans haven't blown them, our airforce will. Get going.
You're spearhead.
Strike for Stadt Meckenheim tonight.
If you hit trouble, holler. With luck, we may reach the Rhine tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
We're spearhead again, Johnny.
- Jesus.
- Well, it's orders.
Got a light, Major?
You don't want the Russkies to beat us to Berlin, do you?
Think I should care?
Our mission is to get to the river.
Next stop Stadt Meckenheim by tonight.
So, give 'em hell, do you hear?
Keep sharp. You're the cuttin' edge.
- Hey, Pattison, come here!
- Hold it.
- We're on the move. Where's Hartman?
- Still up ahead, sir. Riding point.
OK. Let's go.
You know something, Angel? You're a pig.
I love you too... sir.
Everybody makes a profit out of the war.
Why shouldn't I?
Know your trouble, Lieutenant?
You got no ambition.
I'm goin' out of this war rich.
Or dead, Angel.
You may be dead.
If I do get it, I got a present for you.
Might help you get into heaven.
Who'd you steal that off?
- My mother.
- You're a pig.
Why don't you get off my back?
- Hello, John.
- Any casualties, Phil?
We hit 'em too fast.
Look, we've got a new mission.
Stadt Meckenheim by nightfall.
Barnes volunteering us for action again?
Look, will you forget Barnes?
Brass gives the orders.
And Barnes jumps in and picks 'em up like some dog picks up a bone.
"Sir, there's nothin' my boys like better..."
Just knock it off, Phil.
OK, John.
- Angel!
- Yes, sir.
- Pack up. We're movin' out.
- Where to?
Toward the enemy.
We're movin' out!
John...
Look, you gonna ride point, or do you want me to take it?
I am.
Move it!
- There you go.
- 38 bucks.
27 jewels. Swiss movement.
Best German watch you can buy.
- Payday, Angel?
- Payday, hell. Now.
Christ, Angel, I'm gonna be here.
What are you askin' for the ten-dollar watch?
Hey, Lieutenant, I hear we're gettin' a three-day pass.
Not funny, Slavek.
- I thought I'd take up photog...
- Clean it.
You snafu like that again,
Bissell, your ass is mine.
Let's go, Grebs.
Mount up.
- Get that truck into line there.
- We're movin' out!
Major Kreuger. This way, please.
One moment, please.
Herr Major.
Paul, I'm glad you could come. Sit down.
- You're looking well.
- Feeling much better.
- I had no idea you were in the hospital.
- That is unimportant.
- No, thank you.
- I signed my own discharge.
Why such a hurry? No pretty nurses?
Oh, yes. Yes.
But there was too much bad news.
You've had your share.
It was a blow to learn
General von Kreuger was killed in action.
He was a great soldier, your father.
Have you been home?
Not yet.
At this time, I think it's better that one should be doing something.
- I hear the Russians are at the Elbe.
- Yes.
- And here?
- Worse. Utter confusion.
Every day I get orders to attack with divisions that no longer exist.
Hitler still thinks he's winning the war.
The army helped bring Hitler into power.
Are you saying we made a mistake?
I'll show you something.
Here, the 15th Army, or what's left of it.
75,000 men trapped.
Here, Remagen Bridge - the only way to get them out.
And what are my orders? Blow it up.
What in God's name can I do?
One can only do one's duty.
What's that?
Delay. Try and save the army.
Hold the bridge as long as possible.
Are you suggesting I disobey an order?
If I put you in command of that bridge, would you hold it open as long as possible?
What are the defences?
One regular company, a reserve company, 600 volunteers,
200 Hitler Youth, an anti-aircraft unit.
About 1600 men, all told, fully equipped.
That is good. Where are the Americans?
Around Bonn.
What if they threaten Remagen?
I managed to hold two panzer battalions in reserve.
When shall I take command?
Be at the bridge by morning.
You understand that in the circumstances
I cannot give you a written order.
But I do promise you my full support.
From you, sir, that's quite enough.
What's wrong? Why'd you stop?
It's too easy. No mines. No roadblocks.
They don't have time. They're pullin' out.
The whole German Army's on the run.
Maybe they're not pulling out here.
You're gonna stop at every lousy bend in the road?
I don't know.
I'll tell you when I come to them.
Why the hell don't you admit it?
You don't like riding point.
I don't like riding point.
All right, I'm gonna ride point.
Just you keep up tight behind me.
Depends how fast you're going.
Well, come on. Let's go.
Hold it, you guys. Stay in your trucks.
Grebs! Get that Kraut car up here!
Yes, sir.
- What do you think it was, a mine?
- Anti-tank shell.
Take your half-track.
Cut across that field to the farmhouse.
When you hear these go off, come in fast.
Load her up. We're movin' out.
The rest of you stay back.
- What have they got in that farmhouse?
- I don't know, Grebs, but it ain't candy.
Easy, Grebs, normal speed.
If they spot our uniforms now, it's goodbye, Nancy.
- I think they've seen us, sir.
- Give it everything you got. Go. Go!
Closer! Get in closer!
Flush 'em out!
- Jellicoe.
- Yeah?
- Think we oughta check the barn.
- I think you're right, Angel.
What's the matter, Glover?
Nothing, sir. I, uh...
Just for a minute there, I was awful tired.
Sometimes it hits you like that.
Yes, sir.
It's Captain Colt, sir.
I couldn't leave him in the road.
Well...
What was all that about, Lieutenant?
Target practice, sir.
Gotta keep sharp.
We're the cutting edge.
How'd Johnny get it?
Anti-tank shell.
He was tryin' too hard, or he was pushed too hard.
What the hell do you mean by that?
He was tired. He got careless.
We're all pushed too hard. We're all tired.
Not as tired as he was.
Well, I guess this makes you commandin' officer of company A.
You take over from Johnny.
- Why me?
- Because you're available, that's why.
- Why not Pattison?
- He's too green.
Look, Hartman...
I know it's been a hard blow.
It's always a shock to lose a buddy, a man you fought with. We're all human.
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is
I realise Captain Colt was your friend.
He was my friend too.
Bullshit.
Would you care to rephrase that, Lieutenant?
You don't have any friends out here, Major.
Neither do I.
We can't afford 'em, either one of us.
What in the name of God is goin' on?
What kind of outfit is this?
The men are tired, Major.
They're blowing off steam.
OK.
I'm company CO. What are my orders?
We're punching our way through to the Rhine at top speed.
German lines are fluid this side of the river.
I want you in
Stadt Meckenheim by tonight.
And you can tell your men I'll give them leave as soon as they hit the river.
How do you know Stadt Meckenheim isn't crawling with Germans?
- What if they unload on us?
- Then we'll know, won't we, Lieutenant?
Angel!
Angel, we're movin' out!
- Chicken dinner.
- Move it.
Just havin' a little recreation, sir.
Didn't you forget something, Sergeant?
Yeah, well, I checked them all out.
Nothing worth much. Except this.
Let's go, Grebs.
- Wilhelm, what's holding us up?
- It's a checkpoint ahead, Herr Major.
Stillgestanden. Zur Salve.
Legt an.
Gebt... feuer!
Your papers?
Where are you going?
Remagen. General von Brock's orders.
- What was the meaning of that?
- To set an example.
Maybe other officers will stay at their posts.
Better to die facing the enemy... than the firing squad.
You may go on. Heil Hitler.
Wilhelm, cigarette?
Thank you, Herr Major.
It's not good, Herr Major.
When we do such things, shoot our own officers by the road, then I think the war is lost.
- Is this Meckenheim?
- Yeah.
What do you think?
We'll split up.
You go in from the right, across the field.
I'll go straight down the road.
We'll meet at the church.
I don't see any white flags.
You think they're friendly?
Let's sit tight until the patrol comes in.
What a way to fight a war. The goddamn conquering army sleeping in the streets, the Krauts nice and warm in their beds.
All clear, Angel. Secure the town.
Bed down the rest of the men.
Send a signal to Major Barnes with...
Murrie!
Send a signal to Major Barnes with the main column.
"Entered Meckenheim, 2300.
No - repeat no - resistance."
"Await further orders. Hartman."
Where do I bed the men down?
In the half-tracks?
Speak to Pattison. He found someplace.
- Hotel?
- Yeah, first class.
Jesus Christ, it's a goddamn jail.
- I want my lawyer.
- Home sweet home.
- Where's the can?
- Use your boot.
Oh, man. Real showers.
- It's even got a bed in it.
- I think that's mine.
Move it. That's my bunk.
All right, boys, find a spot and sack out.
They're rotten, these mattresses.
I've seen better accommodations in a zoo.
Clear the way. Come on, make room, boys. Make room.
- You never saw a girl before?
- Not like that.
She's fine.
- Get out.
- What?
- Out.
- You're joking.
What do you want? Get her for yourself?
- You don't understand.
- Get out! Move it!
- I love her.
- Move it!
They scared you, huh?
You don't have anything to worry about.
I wouldn't let one of those guys lay a glove on you.
Understand?
Would you like to sit down?
Listen, everything's gonna be all right.
I'll be nice to you.
I swear to God.
You hungry?
Chocolate.
Real.
What's going on?
Who brought her in here?
She was here all the time, for Christ's sakes.
What are you doing here?
- Warum sind Sie hier?
- The Germans arrested me. I am French.
- I thought you didn't speak English.
- Go on, get outta here. Get out.
You're a bastard, sir.
If there's not enough for everybody, there sure as hell ain't enough for you.
If I see her in here again,
I'll break your neck.
Lieutenant, she went that way.
What are you gonna do with all your money, Slavek?
Buy me the biggest whorehouse in Texas, then lock the door and retire.
The bastard's already got over $1200 in markers from all us poor people.
Deducting, of course, what I owe you, Lieutenant.
- I'm going to sleep.
- Lieutenant.
This belonged to Captain Colt, sir, and being as you're acting CO, I guess you'll be the man who'll write the letter.
- Well, he sure was a first-class...
- Yeah.
- What I mean is, sir, all the men...
- Can it, soldier.
Cold bastard, ain't he?
What is it you owe me, Slavek?
Well, that's all you're worth to me, Slavek.
$78.50, not a damn bit more.
And in future, you watch your mouth.
All right, let's play cards.
I thought I kicked you out.
I've nowhere to go.
How'd you get here?
I'll sleep with you.
Do you have cigarettes?
Help yourself.
I lived with a German.
He was killed in the Ardennes.
Before that, I went to a convent school.
They didn't teach you this in the convent.
Privileges of rank, eh, Lieutenant?
What do you want?
Signal from Barnes at battalion headquarters.
Tough, huh?
Get the men up. We're moving out.
Those men are tired. They'll kill us.
They're so happy we found no Germans, they want us to keep going till we do.
Where might that be?
Captain Schmidt,
Remagen Bridge Security Command.
- Major Kreuger.
- Thank God you have come.
- Headquarters said you were on the way.
- I must use your phone.
Yes, this is Major Kreuger. Get me
General von Brock at headquarters.
Yes, it's urgent.
- What's the last report on the Americans?
- Still in Stadt Meckenheim.
Good. Perhaps they'll head towards Bonn. Thank you.
At least it'll give us a little time to prepare our defences.
Captain Schmidt...
Oh, excuse me, Herr Major.
You must do something about the civilian traffic. We can't get our work done.
This is Captain Baumann,
Chief Engineering Officer. Major Kreuger.
I'm glad you're here. If we don't clear the bridge, we'll never be ready to blow it.
The most immediate problem is not to blow the bridge up but to keep it open.
Excuse me, but is it not true the Führer has ordered the bridge destroyed?
Does the Führer transmit his orders directly to you, or are you simply spreading idle gossip?
But I understood...
At this moment, Baumann, a loose tongue is our most dangerous enemy.
Surely you know the penalty for spreading defeatist rumours?
Please sit down, Captain Schmidt.
Baumann, you stay.
Will you brief me on the condition of all of the units at our disposal?
The regular company, is it fit for instant duty?
But there is no regular company.
I don't understand.
It's been transferred.
Oh.
The reserve company, is it fully equipped?
It no longer exists.
And the 600 Polish and Russian volunteers, can we count on them?
The so-called volunteers have vanished.
Captain Schmidt, on paper at least, you have some 1600 men.
How many, in fact, do you have?
About... 200.
Including the bridge detail.
And the 400 militia, the Volkssturm, the Hitler Youth?
A handful.
- Where are the others?
- Deserted.
Herr Hauptmann, do you realise what you are saying is treason?
No, Herr Major. Only the truth.
Yes?
General von Brock is temporarily unavailable.
This is Major Kreuger. You will convey this message to the general.
It is imperative that he send two panzer battalions at once.
So, Captain Baumann,
I trust that in the event of an emergency at least the explosives are in place to blow up the bridge?
Not yet, Herr Major. It is reported that 600 kilos of high explosives are on the way.
But perhaps that, too, is only a rumour.
- Captain Schmidt.
- Major?
Those towers will give us an excellent field of fire on the bridge.
- What is in them?
- Two heavy machine guns on each side.
That old barge, it will be very useful.
- We'll put weapons on it.
- Yes, Herr Major.
Come. Show me your defences.
With only 36 men, sir, there's a limit to what we can do.
Sergeant Becker, I'm not asking you to launch a major offensive.
I'm only asking that you hold off the enemy until reinforcements arrive.
Excuse me, Herr Major. We have heard a lot about reinforcements.
The men don't believe it any more.
I tell you, two panzer battalions will be here in a few hours.
Do you believe me?
Yes, Herr Major.
Then you make your men believe it.
Do you understand?
That's the road the enemy tanks will have to take.
The approaches to the bridge, are they mined?
Heavily mined, Herr Major. Ready to blow.
No enemy tank will reach the bridge.
For the moment, these are the heaviest defences we have against the enemy.
- A great deal depends on you.
- Yes, Herr Major.
Good.
Our best shelter - a whole mountain above us.
First-class gun position.
Get a crew to strengthen these gun emplacements.
Herr Major, still no answer from General von Brock.
Keep trying. What is this?
The master switch to destroy the bridge, when we have the explosives.
And the detonating circuit, what if it fails?
Herr Major.
Nine-centimetre cable. Heavy steel pipe.
- The circuit is tested every hour.
- What if it fails?
An emergency fuse can be lit by hand, over there, by the rail.
If we have the explosives.
I know, Captain Schmidt. I know.
I'll go to the town to see about civil defence.
You, cut up some bedsheets.
I want a flag for every window.
Rudi, check the wine cellar.
Do as Herr Holzgang says.
Greta, get a broom.
Sweep up the glass.
Oh, my God.
Didn't I tell you to pack these things away?
Pay no attention. Find the glue.
- At least we can try to...
- (knock on door)
Go away! We are closed!
What are you doing?
This is private property.
- You are Councillor Holzgang?
- Of course.
- In charge of civil defence?
- Yes.
I am Major Kreuger, new military commander at Remagen.
It's charming.
It is always good to meet someone who appreciates beautiful things.
- It must be very valuable.
- Irreplaceable.
- At least 1500 Reichsmarks.
- Really? That much?
Herr Holzgang, half of your town has been blown apart.
Remagen may be under direct attack by nightfall.
It is your duty to gather every able-bodied man to defend your town.
- But there's hardly anyone left.
- Find them.
The time has come, Herr Holzgang, for you too to make a small sacrifice.
Excuse me, Herr Major.
And what is that?
My only son. Killed at Stalingrad.
What greater sacrifice can a man make?
None, except the sacrifice made by your son.
Bring me some schnapps, and cigarettes.
Herr Holzgang, the sheets are ready.
Greta, quick, bring it.
What are you trying to do, get me shot?
That's a military commander, you fool.
- You are Frau Holzgang?
- Yes.
You have other children?
No.
You must be very proud of your son.
Is that what I'm supposed to be?
Proud that he's dead?
No.
I'm not proud at all.
I miss him.
Germany has lost four million sons.
I pity them, but I pity most my own son.
We must learn to live with our losses.
Even your husband.
Put this on the army circuit. I want the command post at the bridge at once.
Sergeant Becker? This is Major Kreuger.
He's dead, Major.
This is Major Kreuger.
Ja, ja.
Herr General, the Americans are attacking the ridge above the town.
We have no forces to hold them.
Where are the panzers?
Why elsewhere? They were promised here. This is where they are needed.
Herr General, your regrets will not save the bridge, but two panzer battalions might.
Spread out!
Come on, move out! Let's go!
Glover, get down.
Son of a bitch.
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Grebs, get Major Barnes.
Yes, sir.
- You got your camera with you, Glover?
- No, sir, I sold it back to Sergeant Angelo.
When the Krauts blow that bridge, it's gonna be some picture.
We got 'em.
We got 'em.
Hey, yeah, you. Get me headquarters.
Tell artillery to lay on the heavy stuff.
Get tanks up here fast. Start shelling the bridge. You got it? Move!
Yes, sir.
If you wait a minute, the Krauts'll probably save you the trouble.
Don't matter a damn.
Push 'em along, push 'em along.
OK, OK, Hartman, get on down there.
We'll send in tanks for support.
The quicker you boys get down there and blow the bridge, the quicker we got maybe six enemy divisions corked and bottled.
Hartman, boy, you do that for me,
I promise you a unit citation.
Major, sir, there's nothing my boys would appreciate more, sir.
All right, boys. Get goin'.
Move!
Captain Schmidt, transfer this command post to the tunnel at once.
Commandeer every able-bodied soldier.
Commandeer?
What about our reinforcements?
- They were sent elsewhere.
- Von Brock promised...
They were sent elsewhere.
- And the explosives?
- I gave you an order.
Yes, Herr Major.
Ja?
Herr Major, the explosives have arrived.
We are placing the charges.
- Have you enough men?
- Yes, Herr Major.
Good.
- The explosives?
- They are here.
Thank God.
Herr Hauptmann!
Sergeant, double the amount.
Crucial points only.
- Double amount. Crucial points only.
- (artillery fire)
Are you ready, Corporal?
- All ready, Herr Major.
- Get machine guns. Man those towers.
- Yes, Herr Major.
- You.
The white flags are out, Herr Holzgang.
Anything else?
Yes. Pray.
Come, into the cellar.
Greta, come on!
Come on, quickly.
- Column of twos. Get 'em outta here.
- Grebs! Jellicoe!
Come on, move.
Come on.
Come on. You can rob him later.
Come on, damn it. Move.
Line up over here.
You, come here.
Surrender, huh? Surrender.
Please, we are unarmed civilians.
We have done nothing.
Who was the boy upstairs who killed one of my men?
- Your hotel covered with surrender flags.
- Who was that boy? Who was he?
- Rudi. Where is he?
- He's dead.
- I ordered him not to resist.
- You're a dirty, lyin' bastard.
If you ordered him not to resist, how come he resisted?
But how could I stop him?
They were trained to kill.
Hitler made animals of them.
So you hate Hitler, huh?
A tragedy for Germany.
But we were helpless.
I hate this terrible war.
I'm a man of peace.
I'm an innkeeper.
Good. When they blow the bridge, my men'll be back, and they're used to the very best.
Anything you wish.
We will cooperate in every way.
Listen, if you're so anxious to show us how much you hate this terrible war...
Come here. Come here.
Come here.
Yes, sir.
File this among your souvenirs.
Come on.
Blow the approach to the bridge,
Herr Major!
Enemy tanks are at the river.
Keep the bridge open!
The munitions train is coming across.
Five minutes, Herr Major.
Give me five minutes.
We don't have one minute.
Prepare to fire the ramp charge.
- Wait!
- Fire!
Everyone to the tunnel.
Get into the tunnel.
Good to see you, sir. I think you've arrived just in time for the kill.
- Tell the tanks to cease fire!
- Sir?
Stop all artillery.
Tell 'em to hit the far side with smoke.
Yes, sir.
Barnes, where's your lead unit?
They're right on the bridge approach, sir.
We're not gonna blow that bridge, Barnes.
We're gonna take it.
Take it?
As long as it's still standing, we've got a chance. Cut every wire and cable.
Dent, alert HQ. Ask them to give us every available unit on the double.
I'd hate to think of our men in the middle of the bridge when they blow it.
It's a crapshoot, Major.
Take that bridge and we shorten the war.
We're risking 100 men, but we may save 10,000, even 50,000.
It's your chance to make history, Major.
What you've gotta do is throw your men across. Now, Major.
Yes, sir.
Give the order, Schmidt.
If you are afraid to act, I am not.
Prepare to fire.
No! Wait!
I think he's hurt.
Blow, you son of a bitch. Blow!
Relax. 20 minutes from now there ain't gonna be nothing out there but water.
- How about 15?
- How about 30?
Now, now, boys.
This here calls for a pool.
What do you say?
Ten bucks each, winner takes all.
- You're on.
- Name it.
- 30 minutes.
I'll take a piece of that action at 20 minutes.
Hartman, I gotta talk to you.
There's been a change of signals.
Well, get down here.
- Yes, sir?
- We gotta take the bridge.
- Who says?
- Shinner.
- He's crazy. They're gonna blow it.
- No, not if we rush it, cut all the cables.
Let 'em blow it.
That's not a bridge - it's a deathtrap.
We are wasting time, Hartman.
I got time to waste.
What makes that bridge so goddamn valuable?
- If we take it, maybe it'll shorten the war.
- Maybe?
Dying's a lot more definite than that.
So I've heard. Now, would you move it, get your men out there.
Why don't you "maybe" boys take on some of the dirty chores?
Why don't you take us across, Barnes?
Because I'm orderin' you!
Now, get going.
Hartman, that is an order.
Move.
That's a court martial for you, Sergeant.
You're dead.
You goddamn idiot. Do you think we ever had any choice? Come on.
- Come on.
- No!
You want me, you know where to find me.
Come on! Come on, let's go. Come on.
We're not giving them enough cover!
Hit the bridge with more smoke!
16th Field Artillery.
More smoke, more smoke!
Hold your fire!
Give the order, Herr Major!
For God's sake, give the order to blow!
We are about to explode the bridge.
I want everyone to lie down, open your mouths and cover your ears.
Cease fire!
Take cover!
Fire!
Fire!
The cable is broken.
A shell hit.
The emergency charge. At once!
- Send a man to light the fuse.
- If he can get to it.
- Where is it?
- I can show him, Herr Major.
Well, keep to the right side of the bridge.
Give covering fire to the left!
Fire only to the left!
They're blowing the bridge!
Get outta there!
Somebody lit the fuse! It's gonna blow!
Come on. Come on!
Get outta here! Come on!
Come on!
Angel.
Come on! Come on, get back!
It's gonna blow!
Come on, back!
We're alive.
They blew it, and we're alive.
Jesus loves me.
The army promised us first-grade military explosives.
Look. Donarit - cheap industrial explosives.
Get me General von Brock at headquarters.
It's these damned Poles.
We should kill them all.
Herr Leutnant,
I must give you one more order.
Get to General von Brock at any cost.
Tell him to bomb the bridge at once, and send reinforcements before morning.
- Otherwise...
- Yes, Herr Major.
He'll never get through.
Move forward!
Spread out! Keep moving!
It's not much of a bridgehead. Don't you think we oughta spread out a little?
With what? We don't even have enough men to hold what we've got.
- We'd better do something.
- Sure.
Sit here and pray Barnes sends help across in a hurry.
Medic!
We'll never fill up this goddamn hole.
Like hell we won't.
I'll put tanks across here by morning.
- They're back on the river.
- Must be the barge.
You stay here, Pattison.
You're in charge of the bridgehead.
- Where we goin'?
- You stay with him, Grebs.
What now?
Move out there and attack.
The Americans will have tanks across the bridge before daylight.
It's a farce! Where are the bombers?
Our reinforcements?
The most important place in Germany, and what do we have to fight with?
Old men, riffraff, the sweepings from the road.
And you, Baumann, will you fight as hard as you talk?
You will find out when we attack.
Tell Captain Schmidt to assemble the men.
Hartman!
Hartman!
Hartman!
- Schmidt. Where are the others?
- Gone, Herr Major.
- Where?
- God knows.
Tell the truth. They ran away, the cowards. If only you had...
All right, quiet.
Where are your weapons?
- You! Arm them.
- Yes, Herr Major.
Come on.
Herr Major, 27 men, three officers.
- What can we do?
- Fight.
The enemy doesn't know how many we are.
Listen, all of you.
We will divide into two squads.
Captain Schmidt will lead one and I the other.
I want every man to draw as much ammunition as he can carry.
Check your weapons and stand by.
Halt.
Halt!
Why?
They say that dying animals bite at their own wounds.
Now we are killing our own people.
Come.
- We must attack.
- It is useless.
These men are not going to die for nothing.
You just killed two men.
Are you going to try to kill us all?
- It is our duty.
- Your duty and mine is to these people.
Stop!
You will not attack?
We cannot.
Then I ask of you one thing.
Hold out till the last possible moment.
Give me a chance to get to headquarters and get reinforcements.
I'll do my best, Herr Major.
Lieutenant.
He's dead, sir.
Where're the guys?
Gone.
All?
Heil Hitler. Your papers, please.
Follow me.
I want to see
General von Brock immediately.
Impossible. He cannot be disturbed.
What do you want?
Wake him. And get on your feet when you speak to me.
But, Herr Major...
I'm Gerlach. And who are you?
Major Kreuger.
I've just come from Remagen.
- Come in.
- The Americans have taken the bridge.
I must report to General von Brock...
We've just been discussing the situation at Remagen with General von Brock.
I've been sent here by the Führer to learn the facts.
I'm sure you can help explain.
It's very simple. We did not have enough explosives to blow up the bridge.
Is that your excuse, Herr Major?
There is never enough for you cowards, is there?
The truth is you waited too long.
We must counterattack, blow up the bridge at once.
Any further delay will be fatal.
It's no use, Paul.
There's nothing we can do any longer.
Major Kreuger, you will address your remarks to me.
General von Brock has been relieved of his command.
And you, Herr Major, the bridge at Remagen is no longer your concern.
You are under arrest.
What's the matter with those guys back there?
What are they waiting on, a bus?
Where's Barnes, for Christ's sake?
Good old Barnes.
Take a count, Grebs.
Hey, Lieutenant, you OK?
Take a count.
All right, you guys. Sound off.
- Jenkins!
- Hawks!
- Montano!
- Vorkapich!
Julius!
- Engel!
- Gebhardt!
Savage!
Sir, they're comin' across.
Let's go, Grebs.
It's time to move out.
Jesus, Lieutenant, we got tanks comin'.
Hartman, get down, you crazy bastard!
Hartman!
Hartman!
All right, you guys, give him cover fire!
Captain Schmidt,
Remagen Bridge Security Command.
I offer you a surrender.
Herr Leutnant?
Bring your men out, hands on their heads.
No funny business.
You will have no trouble.
Los! Rauskommen alle!
Rauskommen! Los!
Hold it there. OK, move on.
Was soll aus uns werden?
Nichts. Du gehst jetzt nach Hause.
I told him to go home, nothing would happen.
He asked me because in peacetime
I am the schoolmaster here in Remagen.
There's not much left, is there?
That was a damn fool walk you just made, Lieutenant.
I'm movin' you and your men back for a rest. You deserve it.
And, uh...
I'm forgetting about what happened back there, do ya understand?
I feel the army and the whole country owes you all thanks and a unit citation.
And you know somethin'? You'll have somethin' to tell your grandchildren...
Hartman!
Hey, Hartman!
You're slowin' down.
I thought you'd be in Berlin by now.
Angel!
Angel!
Where'd you get that uniform?
Look here,
I got some German marks and, uh...
What is this?
That looks like a three-day pass.
I think I'll join the Germans.
Hold it. Hold it, now.
- You've got a wounded man here.
- I'll get you the Silver Star.
- At least the Congressional Medal.
- Anything you want.
- I'd like a cigar.
- Don't have that. Got a cigarette.
Oh, hold it, now.
Not yet, you bastard. Wait till I'm dead.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil.
- Übernimm die Einzelheiten.
- Zu Befehl.
Herr Major, I regret very much.
Ours or theirs?
Enemy planes, sir.
But who is the enemy?
Zur Salve.
Legt an.
Gebt... feuer!
Excuse me, Herr Leutnant.
May I ask - where did you get that?
From a friend.
Let's go.

''October 1 91 8.
The War is almost over.
The Germans retreat, the Allies advance.
A small town in Northern France awaits its liberation.''
- Are the wires set yet?
- Everything's fine.
Hurry up.
Close it.
Hurry up.
Enter. lt's done, Colonel... with not a moment to lose.
The enemy is near the river.
Shall l blow up the bridge?
NOt yet.
First, we pull out of town.
The munitions?
How much is there?
But there's enough there to blow up... the whole town.
The blockhouse and the whole town will blow up... when the English general is sitting here... where l am now.
You have an artistic clock,
Mr. Frenchman.
A very artistic clock!
Artistically the town will blow up.
The clock gives me an idea.
The knight strikes at midnight, no? lt shall strike for the last time!
Colonel, my ideology...
Later, Adolf. Later.
The knight strikes at midnight.
- What is it?
- They're blowing it up!
- The Krauts!
- Blow up?
The town, the bridge, everything.
We must pass the word.
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
Get out! The town is going to explode!
''The mackerel likes frying.
The mackerel likes frying.''
Germans blowing up munitions dump... tonight before midnight.
The knight strikes at midnight!
The knight strikes at midnight!
For God's sake, don't enter the town!
SPQ to Mackerel, answer.
- They have cut off.
- Give tO me, man.
COme in.
Sir.
''The mackerel likes frying.''
The barber, of course.
The resistance.
''Germans blowing up the munitions... before midnight tomorrow.
DOn't enter tOWn... for God's sake.
The knight strikes at midnight. lmpossible to--''
Stop! Halt!
And they have every intention of blowing the whole thing sky-high.
The town and the bridge.
When?
We don't know, but sometime before midnight tomorrow.
Now, gentlemen, that bridge must not go up. l don't care what it costs, but we must save it.
Any delay in our advance at this point... will throw the whole operation off schedule.
We simply can't have that.
What do you suggest?
Well, sir, l'd suggest we send in one of our ordinance chaps.
Time-fuse specialist, trained infiltrator...
French-speaking, all that.
Splendid.
Who do we have who speaks French?
There's Plumpick, sir.
Ornitholography specialist, communications platoon, born in France.
Splendid.
Would you ask him to volunteer?
Would you, Captain?
Now, what's the matter, Little Fat?
You look depressed or something.
Are you jealous of Cucumber, there?
Well, listen. l'm gonna read you something now.
Let me find you something nice to read.
Here We gO, nOW.
''Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptual hour draws on apace.
More happy days bring in another moon.
But oh, methinks, how slow this--''
- Aye, sir.
- Report to the Colonel.
Private Plumpick, sir!
Private Charles Plumpick, ornitholography specialist... communications platoon, headquarters company, reporting, sir.
- Splendid, Pumpernickel.
- Plumpick, sir.
Nickel, splendid.
Good of you to volunteer.
Brave lad.
Stand at ease.
Out! l suppose you can read a map.
Your mission is quite simple.
Get into the town--
- You do speak French?
- Oui, sir.
Make contact with the local spies.
The town barber heads it.
Find the explosives and disarm the fuse.
- lt shouldn't take you long, what?
- NO, sir. Yes, sir.
But l wonder, sir, if you have the right Plumpick, sir.
YOu see, l'm an ornitholography specialist, sir.
This calls for a specialist,
Pumpernickel.
- Plumpick, sir.
- Nickel.
You seem to pick your name out of a hat.
How good is your French?
Quite good, sir.
But you see it's the explosives, sir. l wonder if perhaps one of the chaps from ordinance... may not do the job just a wee bit better, sir.
Send two men in that inferno?
See here, man.
That town can go up at any moment.
You're asking me to risk the life of two of my troops?
Why, blast it all?
The life of every one of those men out there... is dear to me as my own.
The men are aware of that, sir, and we do appreciate it, sir.
That is leadership, lad.
Yes, sir.
But about the explosives, sir--
That will do, Pumpernickel.
Did you or did you not volunteer?
- Well, as a matter of fact, sir--
- Then good. Let's get on with it.
We have no time to lose.
The town can go up at any moment.
Let's not forget that. l don't think, sir, that l could forget that if l tried, sir.
Well, let's get cracking, lad.
By the way, the password for your contact with the barber fellow is...
''The mackerel likes frying.''
Say, if you can find it, what the devil do they mean by...
''The knight strikes at midnight''?
French are so wordy.
Any questiOns?
- NO, sir.
- Good.
But l wonder, sir, if you do have the right Plumpick, sir.
You see, about the explosives--
A ScOtsman!
Make way for the kings.
Chop, chop off the woman's head.
- YOur turn.
- Mine.
Where am l? l'm the Duke of Clubs.
MOnseigneur Daisy. l'm the Duke of Clubs.
MOnseigneur Daisy.
Come, my friend.
Tell them who you are.
King of Hearts!
- YOur Majesty!
- Such an honor!
Let's go...they're all crazy!
Ladies and gentlemen, the King is back at last! l've never seen the King!
Long live the King!
Ah! Here it is!
Nice kitty!
Hey! Come on in, boys!
Madame, am l a suitable husband for you?
And what do you think of me?
- Are you the barber?
- Obviously.
Confidentially:
''The mackerel likes frying.''
Obviously.
Good. l can breathe again!
Don't stop breathing, or you won't live to be old.
- Good-bye.
- So nice of you to come.
- YOu pay custOmers?
- Yes. That's why business is good.
Okay, quick.
Where are the Germans? l'll find out.
Any Germans here? lf you speak loudly, no one listens...
No secrets here.
The knight strikes at midnight.
What does that mean?
This fashionable man is very strange!
- Where is the blockhouse?
- What is the blockhouse?
- MunitiOns!
- That's not my department!
For that, see the General.
- Where is he?
- Open your eyes and look for once.
Young man, have you seen the King?
- What king?
- The King of Hearts!
Now there, where were we?
Looking for someone?
Sit down.
Someone named the General.
Oh, the General! You can help me out. l found my costume... but not my character! lt's so obvious. l'm General Geranium!
What was l thinking?
Let's be brief.
''The mackerel likes frying.'' l don't understand.
Neither do l. No one's listening.
Speak openly.
He won't blab.
''The knight strikes at midnight''?
Ah, midnight, the hour of crimes!
- We must prevent it!
- There's no time to waste.
Where are we going?
Behave, pussycats!
Papa will be right back.
You've left the door open!
He's so used to being caged, he doesn't want to come out!
That's for him to decide.
The king of beasts.
Speaking of kings, have you seen him?
He arrived last night; a very handsome young man, l hear.
Listen, l'm fed up with all your antics and double-talk! l'm here for the blockhouse and the knight, and l don't understand. l don't either. l'm not here for cock-and-bull stories! l'm too old for cops and robbers!
- How old are you, young man?
- Look, l've had it with you!
- You're hurting me!
- Where is the blockhouse?
What's a blockhouse?
He's mad!
King of Hearts! l'm the king of the fools! l have to warn them!
Thank God you're still here!
DOn't wOrry, it's me. l just got some new clothes. That's all.
Now, one of you has got to take a message to the Colonel.
Fine. You can decide between you.
From Charles Plumpick to Headquarters.
Wrong town. lnhabitants odd.
Chimpanzee checkmate.
Encountered single bear, two lions... but no contact with Mackerel.
Little Fat, it's going to be you. lt is. lt's going to be you. Yes.
Let me put this on your leg.
Your little leg because l don't want to hurt you, you see.
That's right. l forgot the most important!
Postscript.:
Blockhouse disappeared.
Good luck!
Carrier pigeon... shoot it!
Hurry, read it!
''From Charles Plumpick.''
''Blockhouse disappeared.''
Hamburger, take some men and go see about it.
You men, come with me, on the double!
Message from Plumpick, sir. lt's high time too.
''Difficulties: wrong town, inhabitants odd... encountered single bear and two lions... but unable to make contact mackerel.''
Gentlemen, l'm sure there's no real reason to be needlessly alarmed... but it would appear that the outcome of this whole campaign... is now in the hands of a stark, raving lunatic!
Private Pumpernickel has gone crackers!
Captain, will you find three volunteers now?
- Men.
- Sir!
- l want you to leave immediately.
- Sir!
Stop! Come back here!
Where the devil do you think you're going?
No idea, sir!
Look here. Here!
Come and find out.
- You're going after Pumpernickel!
- Sir!
StOp!
To disarm that blockhouse!
Pumpernickel. lsn't that a German name?
A polka, Hyacinth!
Look... someone's here.
Got a light?
Buy me a drink?
What a big spender!
Want to know my name?
That's no answer!
My name is Hyacinth.
Shall l dress as a housewife, a mummy Or a nun?
You look fine this way.
Listen...sit down... and don't move.
- Are you a whore?
- Yes!
- And l'm your customer?
- Yes!
Good. We understand each other.
Do you know what war is?
Surrounding the town... there in the hills... are people who want to hurt you.
Go tell them l'm harmless. lt wouldn't work.
The town may blow up any minute nOw... l might not even get to finish this sentence!
What a shame.
You have a nice voice.
Listen, that's just a pipe dream. l'll tell you my secret. l live in the moment.
- That's all that counts.
- You're right, but... l'm not the girl for you, that's all. l'll get you someone else.
Girls!
Daffodil or Rosie,
FOrget-me-nOt Or POppy.
The choice is yours.
Or maybe not.
There's no mistaking a look like that.
Unspoiled and beautiful. l'm Poppy. And you?
Charles.
- Blush! Men go for that.
- Do l frighten him?
Sure. Men seem tough, but they're soft as asparagus tips.
Teeny babies at heart.
- COme On... cOme in.
- Staying with us?
To teach you a thing or two about the birds and the bees.
You don't know where to start?
Neither do l.
This is the bedroom.
The bed. The lamp. The switch. l suggest starting in the dark, then turn the light on.
Look at the object of your desire carefully.
Turn the light off again. Love is played like checkers, black and white.
- Will he get naked?
- Yes. Don't be nasty.
There's liquor to drink. l've drawn the curtains. l feel like l've always known you.
What would you like?
To lose my memory. lt's easy.
- What are you doing?
- Keyhole-peeping. Shut the door.
The King of Hearts!
What are you doing here, sir?
Love has brought the King back to us!
All aboard, your Majesty.
This way, everyone.
The Duke is very emotional. l once saw him cry when a fly died. A fly!
At Waterloo, in '1 5.
He's still crying.
Cousin, you're back at last!
But what a state!
Quick!
A shirt and a sandwich!
Melons and a hat!
Stockings!
The Duchess, my wife.
An old bat.
Her feet are always cold.
But l've loved her for more than 60 years.
Sire, here are my children.
Blow your nose.
Comb your hair.
- Where's Baby?
- There, Mommy!
Alberic, what do you say?
- Long live the King!
- Right.
- Some candy?
- Excuse me, it's a sOuvenir.
YOu must rest before the coronation.
Well, the dromedary is harnessed. You know how impatient these animals are.
See for yourself.
- Where are we going?
- To the cathedral.
1 2th century. A bit restored, like my wife. But l love her, and you will, too.
Little rascal! l'll tan your behind!
Will you be still? lt's the greatest day of my life. l've always wanted the cheers of a nation... seated next to the handsomest man.
DOn't exaggerate.
But l must!
Without it there's nothing!
Everyone here is so happy, and l've come to break up their party.
These flowers, your friends, this kindness--
They will all die, and there's nothing l can do about it.
A real king can do anything.
Maybe, but not me.
Time flies.
Everything will blow up, as sure as my name is Charles.
Look! Soldiers!
Greetings.
Your missal. Your rosary.
Where has Alberic gone to?
Back there in the sacristy.
He's always into everything!
That's fine, darling.
What is this carnival?
Take those hats off!
What a mess!
To the blockhouse!
Sire, allow me to make a comment about all this.
Your mind is obviously somewhere else.
This is a sacred moment... and you're fidgeting!
Do you have to pee?
So, what's the matter? Smile! l'm scared.
You don't like theater?
What theater?
World theater.
Training school.
The Comédie Française, the Vatican.
Ceremonials, masquerades!
Smile. Smile!
The crown. The crown?
Nobody has the crown?
Sire, do you have a crown on you?
No, but l'll go look for one.
Company, halt!
What is this nonsense?
Hurry up, and clear this away.
- Everything's set right?
- Yes, sir.
Who's over there?
StOp!
Long live the King!
Damn! Here we gO again!
You needn't have bothered, Sire.
We have found a crown.
Drat! l've got a frog in my throat from all the stinking smoke!
Thank you.
We've done something fine.
Long live the King!
Long live the King of Hearts!
We want a speech!
He's so beautiful!
My dear flock. Ladies. Citizens.
Life is a valley of tears.
We enter this world with a cry... and we leave with a sigh.
And do you think it pleases God to see
His creatures crying all the day long? ln truth l tell you, our kingdom...
His kingdom--is Joy.
The Arab in his desert carries with him... his fountains and Heaven--
Heaven...is the empire of the prisoner behind bars.
Give me the ball!
StOp!
- My respect, Admiral.
- Enter, gentlemen.
What a splendid machine.
You must get off some nice shots with this, huh?
- How about a little ride?
- l would be delighted.
The fish in the pond, the bird in the bush, the lamb in his wool... friends in our thoughts... and ourselves-- in our voices... like the scent of the rose.
That is grammar and the Law.
We have decided to be happy... and nothing can stop us!
- Quiet!
- Amen.
What...? Show me!
Block the exits!
We're saved! l found the blockhouse!
The enemy has fled!
Long live the King!
Long live my people!
Everyone to the the Throne Room... to start a celebration that will last three years!
The Republic is proud to give you this bicycle as a present.
You can pedal among the people... incOgnitO!
To the side, ladies.
You look dreadful in daylight.
Go home.
Long live the General!
Long live Mr. Marcel! lt's Plumpick.
Come on, lads.
Ho-ho, chaps.
Oh, gosh, am l glad to see you!
Hey, there was a general in the ladies' hairdresser.
They're as gentle as lambs.
There's nothing to fear.
This bicycle-- it was a gift from the court.
You'll be happy to know l found the blockhouse again.
Meaning it was previously lost, l suppOse.
Yes, it was simply covered with flowers for my coronation.
- YOur cOrOnatiOn?
- Yes, my cOrOnatiOn!
Look, there's no time to lose. The whole thing might blow up at any moment.
No door.
There's got to be a way out!
Yes, yes, grab him.
COme On!
What the hell you trying to do? l can find it. l'm sure l can.
This way, lads.
COme On. Hurry up.
Let's go on with it.
Wake me up.
Once mOre.
Good.
Let's get out of here.
- ls he dead?
-Just sleeping.
Exhausted by the coronation.
Carry him gently.
He tastes of raspberries... Taste!
Ripe raspberries.
The way l like them. l wouldn't mind seeing the Duke cuckolded.
- Cuckolded? Who?
- Nobody, dear.
We need a cuckold for the sake of the town's equilibrium.
We don't have one.
We share and share alike.
- He must come back to us very gently.
- He must wake up happy. l like men who wake up happy. l have an idea.
Listen. What do you hear?
The charming ticktock of your heart, sweetie.
A beating heart.
A secret clock.
A heart whose beating will blend... with the heart of our king.
A woman is what he needs!
A woman of his own.
- Where can we get one?
- l sacrifice myself.
- Good girl!
- Generous soul!
Who's talking about soul?
No dirty words, my son.
The Duchess's buttocks belong to the Duke.
Don't l belong to everyone? lmpossible, honey!
Who'd run your house?
Do l look like a madame? l'm foolish! l know whom he needs, and he loves her too!
- Where is she?
- My place.
- The brothel?
- Let's go, on the double!
Calm down, men. This is not state business; it's women's business.
Good afternoon, Your Grace!
Where is Poppy?
The Duchess has a favor to ask of you.
A pearl. lnnocent as an apple.
Please follow me.
Don't undress, child.
We're not here for that, dear.
Tell me, do you know men?
No, but l'd like to.
- That's why you came here?
- Yes. l've a good chance of finding one.
- Who told you that?
- My little finger.
- You haven't seen anyone else?
- NO.
She's the one we need.
Look at these curls!
She'll have to stick out her chest more.
Head still.
Only the legs move.
Some blue on the eyelids.
An orange blossom in her bosom.
- Can't l gO as l am?
- What a good idea!
To your fiancé, the King!
Calm down, ladies. When you want a man, you mustn't be obvious.
- We're just so pleased.
- YOur cOat.
Just my tutu. lt's my favorite outfit.
- You're going out like that?
- Yes, On a wire.
The King's marrying an acrobat!
Gentlemen, let's tiptoe out.
Who are you?
Poppy. Your fiancée.
Oh, yes. That's right.
- l don't need anybody.
- That's not true. l'm a loner, like everybody, with one idea.
TO marry me!
How did you get in?
Through the window.
We're getting married. l might have known. lt's starting again.
Yes, everything's starting. l'm a little naive... because, well... l don't know. l don't know.
But we'll make up for lost time.
Lost time! What time is it?
There's got to be a way out!
There's got to be!
This is madness! l can't let it happen! l've got to get in there! l've gOt tO!
Now we'll see some sparks fly!
Or we'll know the reason why! l can't take it anymore!
Why?
Don't applaud, you fools! l'll be blown up!
Do you know what dying means?
Do you have any idea?
NO.
Listen. The enemy--
- Where is he?
- My army will charge.
No, l'll speak to him! l doubt it, but no matter.
Listen. There are bombs wired here.
Time bombs.
Before midnight, in a little while... a spark-- explosion! lt's all over!
Who cares? l do! lf you need to examine all the ticktocks, we'll get them.
What are you doing?
This is the last one, l assure you.
- Leave it.
- ls that an order?
- lt's my royal pleasure.
- Well, in that case...
At last, you're laughing! lt's just nerves.
Your Majesty, your balloon.
You can keep these balloons! l burst his balloon, and he claps!
What characters! l can't let you die.
COme On. l'll take you all with me!
- To the sea?
- No, to the snow.
To a candy store?
On vacation? ls it far?
Yes, very far.
We'll pass the lines, then take a train, a boat--
- To an island?
- To the other side of the sea.
- On horseback?
- Yes. Follow me!
Here's the King's horse!
Don't leave me all alone!
Come along.
Follow me.
Sir, come back.
There are wild beasts!
Can't you hear them?
They're bloodthirsty.
You must come with me.
There's a wall between us and the world out there. lt's too dangerous.
Come on, for the last time!
Charles!
You have no idea how wicked they are out there!
He's come back!
Look. There he is.
Sire, what's the point of traveling when everything you want is at home?
Long live the King on my word as a duke.
Duke?
Who made you a duke?
Who made you a king?
Brother, yesterday you were in an asylum!
Are you jealous?
And you, Mr. King, yesterday... you were outside with ''the others.''
Gentlemen, the King's polka.
Brilliant idea!
A polka for a king.
What's wrong? We didn't say anything offensive.
Who needs a king?
- We're all equal!
- You and your communist ideas!
- Tempers.
- Enough!
You're right, sweetheart.
Let's calm down.
Marie, everything is simple, even dying.
HOW?
Just close your eyes and never open them again.
But if l shut my eyes... l can no longer see trees or flowers... or your lovely moustache. l love its prickly caress.
Was l born for a love duet?
Yes. We've been cuddling for 1 1 0 years!
We've been together for quite some time.
What a gracious hour, Your Grace.
You know why l've been coming up here... every evening since...
My God, l was so young! l already knew that to love the world... you have to get away from it.
Have you ever noticed, Hyacinth... how peaceful it all is... on the eve of a battle?
How sweet it all seems?
HOw it rests Our cOnscience?
- GOing tO war?
- l'm thinking of it.
What army will lead you to victories?
There's the rub!
Make your own army!
HOW?
We'll make babies for you!
A battalion of sturdy boys!
- Make generals.
- And a batch of pretty girls.
All in brothels, like their mamas!
The world's so simple. On one side men, and on the other side women.
On one side, the whores.
On the other, the generals!
You're right. Life is simple.
Three minutes until 1 2:00. ln three minutes, it'll be over. l don't want to die.
No one's ever known his own death.
There are only three minutes to live.
Three minutes is great.
You're right.
You'll see the knight come out.
The knight comes out at midnight.
- Where?
- Up there.
On the clock. At midnight.
The password!
Saved!
We are saved!
Good work, men. l've done these sorts of things before.
Long live the Queen!
Midnight?
Good show.
Pumpernickel pulled it off.
The man's a hero.
The town is ours.
Any more of your drunken ravings,
MacFish, and l'll have you locked up.
- Be thankful l'm in a good mood, man.
- Sir!
- Forward, Sergeant Major!
- Sir!
Company, prepare to fall in!
Fall in!
Five minutes after midnight!
Five minutes late!
Nothing went off, Hamburger!
- You checked the bombs?
- Yes, sir!
SOrry.
Lieutenant!
Take him away!
Retreat!
Retreat! l want to make love.
With a king?
You're not afraid?
You must be marvelous.
Tell me later.
The soldiers!
Good show, Pumpernickel.
First rate.Jolly good.
Yes. Sir, l couldn't have done it without them, sir. l must say, how fiendishly clever.
That bit about the chimpanzee. l was worried that the townspeople are a wee bit on the--
Love to see the Jerry's face who intercepted that messenger, eh?
Surely, sir, the men you sent after me must have told you that--
You think l'd listen to anything that dipsomaniac has to say?
- MacFish!
- Yes, sir!
We'll bivouac here.
- Here, sir?
- Yes.
The Duke, the Duchess, my wife.
An old bat, but l love her. l'd love to curl myself around that cute moustache!
- Sir, l really must explain to you--
- Later, please, Pumpernickel. Later.
Pleased to meet you, General.
Long live France!
- Let's celebrate!
- l don't have the time.
DOn't waste it.
MacFish! Overnight pass for all the troops, Sergeant Major!
Give me a moment to change into decent clothes.
Sir, l must explain to you.
Later, Pumpernickel, later. l'm too busy listening to the music.
What's under their kilts?
Nothing!
You mean everything!
This is the greatest day of my life! l'd like fireworks!
- MacFish.
- Yes, sir!
- You heard the lady.
- NO, sir!
- We would like a display of fireworks.
- What shall l use for fireworks, sir?
Cannon, mortar, powder.
Good heaven, man. l have to do all your thinking for you?
Look, Colonel!
Victory! The town has blown up!
Everyone is dead!
Yes, but Hamburger is, too.
The lron Cross is precious.
Even posthumously.
My life is at your feet.
What would you like?
Another ice cream, a pretty ring... and a parade.
Here's the parade. ln any case, it's time to leave.
- Fall the company in.
- Sir!
Company, fall in!
On the double!
Plumpick, fall in behind the church. l'll be waiting at Hyacinth's brothel.
Don't be afraid. l'll return covered with medals.
Hurry up, Plumpick.
Good-bye, Poppy!
Make way for the parade!
Company, shoulder arms!
The King is going to war.
You're letting him go?
Yes, he's going to get medals!
What next?
Say good-bye to His Majesty.
Let's kiss him and bring him to the parade!
Company, forward march!
Let me go! l have to leave.
- More of them!
- All over the place, like rats!
They act like they don't know each other.
Of course not... they're foreign regiments.
- No umbrellas?
- The last bouquet!
Clear out, or you'll all get it!
Fire!
Surrender!
Never!
Don't you think these actors are a bit over the top?
What funny people.
Thousands of soldiers, cannOns... autos, coming from every direction.
What on earth can it be?
The ''liberators.''
This joke has lasted long enough.
Let's go to bed.
Your Majesty, we leave you with your people.
Good-bye, Charles.
Come. Let's go home.
General, my town kept faith.
YOu are receiving an army citatiOn.
Your bird too.
An A-1 winged creature.
Rare bird and soldier.
Brave and astute.
You pulverized your enemy.
Good job.
And l would like... to add my own embrace to that... which the president of the Republic sends you.
Plumpick, you're going up to the front again immediately.
The Jerries are still holding on to this town... and we're going to blow it sky-high.
What now?
- lt's yOur turn, YOur Majesty.
- l still don't understand the rules.
There aren't any.
Well, you're here now.
And you won't be running off anymore. l'm staying here, General.
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Smart thinking.
The most beautiful journeys... are taken through the window.
In the territory of New Mexico,
toward the end of the Civil War...
an Indian, Sierra Charriba,
and his 47 Apache warriors...
raided, sacked, and looted an area
almost three times the size of Texas.
On October 31, 1864...
an entire company
of the 5th United States Cavalry...
sent out from Fort Benlin to destroy him...
was ambushed and massacred
at the Rostes ranch.
We are indebted to Timothy Ryan, bugler,
5th United States Cavalry...
the company's sole survivor, for his diary...
the only existing record of this tragedy,
and the campaign that followed.
Let go of me! I want my mom!
Pony soldier, I am Sierra Charriba.
Who you send against me now?
- Lieutenant!
- Sir?
Take the first, second and third squads and cover the ridge sides.
- Yes, sir.
- If I signal you to come, you come.
If I signal you to charge, you charge.
If I signal you to run, you follow me and run.
- Otherwise hold your position.
- Yes, sir.
- First squad to the right.
- Mr. Potts.
Second squad to the left.
Major.
I'm a long way from Gettysburg.
Any suggestions?
Let's go have a look, slow and easy.
To the left. To the right.
November 1.
This morning I returned with the relief
column to the scene of the massacre.
The Major had expressed little hope...
that any of the civilians or troopers
would be alive.
But Samuel Potts, the Major's scout...
knew Apaches well
and said they never kill boy children.
They take them as captives
and raise them as warriors.
He felt the three Rostes boys
may still be alive.
But he had no such hope
for their sister, Beth.
He was right.
I looked down at her
and thought with hatred of Riago...
our Apache scout, who led us to this place.
His body was never found...
and I will always wonder if he escaped
the massacre or was part of it.
Hold your positions!
- That scarf belonged to Lt. Brannin.
- That's for you, Major.
I hope he was dead when they did that to him.
If he was dead they wouldn't have bothered.
- Go cut him down, Sergeant.
- Brannin was a soldier, Amos.
Goes with the pretty girls and the pension.
How much chance have I of getting those children back?
One chance in a thousand, I'd say... if they gave you a division and a year to do it, at least.
Much chance of that, is there?
I'll take five days to get men, horses, ordnance.
On the fifth day I want you back at Fort Benlin to tell me where Charriba is.
I'll get the children and I'll get him.
- Sam.
- Yeah?
Don't get yourself killed.
That would inconvenience me.
Ryan!
With so many troopers away...
five Confederate prisoners
broke out of Fort Benlin and escaped.
We trapped them on our way back.
Evening, Ben.
Evening, Amos.
Should have tried it before I took command.
Command of what, the burial detail?
- Move them out, Lieutenant.
- Move them out!
Troops, right! Pair of twos, right!
I brought back your wandering boys,
Captain.
Now you tell me how they got loose.
They clubbed two guards and went over the wall.
I'd like to point out, Amos, at the time of the escape...
131 men of this command were half a day's march from here... either digging graves or rotting in the sun, waiting to be buried.
I want every prisoner that can walk on this parade ground in 10 minutes.
Including those in irons.
Bugler, sound assembly.
They're gonna give us a party, Captain.
It sure looks like it.
You thieves, renegades, deserters... you gentlemen of the South.
I want some volunteers.
I want volunteers to fight the Apache Sierra Charriba.
I need horse soldiers.
Men who can ride, men who can shoot.
In return I promise you nothing.
Saddle sores, short rations, maybe a bullet in your belly.
And free air to breathe, a fair share of tobacco, quarter pay.
My good will.
Best offices for pardons and paroles when we get back.
I don't know what that might be worth to you.
But I do know if any man signs on with me and then attempts to desert...
I will shoot him out of hand.
From you I'll accept one man with some experience of command... as an acting lieutenant.
Captain Tyreen... does the prospect of serving under your country's flag once again... seem more attractive than dragging its chains in this prison?
It is not my country, Major Dundee.
I damn its flag and I damn you... and I would rather hang than serve.
Corporal Veitch just died, sir.
And hang you will!
You and your four good friends.
You're going to stand trial on a charge of murder.
That guard you clubbed just died.
You've been found guilty of the charges and specifications here mentioned.
It is the sentence of this court that on November 6... at 6:00 a.m. you shall be hanged by the neck until dead.
Remove the prisoners, with the exception of Benjamin Tyreen.
Right face, forward march.
These proceedings are closed.
Sit down.
Five years.
You're still blaming me instead of yourself, huh?
I'll say one thing, Ben, you sure haven't mellowed any.
When are you going to learn you made all your own troubles?
Who had me cashiered out of the regiment?
I cast one vote out of five.
Two of those votes were for my acquittal.
But not you. Not my own captain.
Not my own friend.
The conscience of the court was not my concern.
What did concern you, Amos?
- That the man I killed was a Yankee?
- He was your brother officer.
It was a duel of honour.
You're Southern born, you knew what that meant.
If he had killed me, and he had a chance...
- would you have convicted him?
- I would.
You're a liar.
You voted to please the generals in Washington.
You voted a promotion for Amos Charles Dundee.
You're a traitor to your country, Ben.
You gonna blame me for that, too?
Sergeant!
Yes, sir.
I should have known better than to try to talk to you.
You'll try again, Major.
The Major had asked for thieves,
renegades and deserters...
and that's what he got.
After four hours he had accepted only three.
Ryan, what are you doing here?
I'm volunteering, too, sir. I've earned it, sir.
You'll need a bugler, sir.
- Stand over there.
- Yes, sir.
Benjamin Priam, sir.
What do you do?
What did you say?
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
- I'm a horse thief!
You a good horse thief?
The best there is, sir.
Sign your name or make your mark.
I need horses and mules, Mr. Priam.
Here's the amount you'll have to spend... and here is your safe-conduct.
- Do you need an escort?
- No, sir.
He'll be back, sir.
Yes, sir. I will, sir.
- Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
- Get Lt. Andreen.
- On duty, Major.
- Lt. Fredericks.
- Hospital.
- Lewison.
- Officer of the day.
- Sgt. Cable?
- Patrol.
- Get me Lt. Graham.
- Yes, sir.
- Five hours, five men.
- You need a regiment.
Charriba can't be taken by a pick-up company of garrison troopers.
You should know that by now.
What are you trying to say, Frank?
Come on, speak up. Spit it out!
I'm not trying to say that the massacre was your fault.
I'm saying that you should recognise that your transfer to this post... was a disciplinary action, pure and simple.
And if you try to fight your own war again as you did at Gettysburg, they'll break you.
They won't break me, not if I get Charriba and those kids.
Has it occurred to you, Major... that the Apache will undoubtedly enter Mexico for the winter?
Mexico presently contains an army of 30,000 French soldiers.
Yes, it's occurred to me.
Frank, I am a professional soldier,
I'm not a prison keeper.
Now this is something that's gotta be done and I'm gonna do it... now!
Are you pursuing the Apache, Major, or a promotion?
Whatever my reasons are, Frank... you'd better get down on your knees and pray to God I don't take you with me.
I suppose you intend to strip this garrison.
I will take just 10 men from the command.
Volunteers.
The bulk of my force will be made up of prisoners.
You'd be well advised not to accept Confederate prisoners... even if they're forthcoming.
In my absence, you'll assume command of the garrison.
Discharge all duties incumbent upon that command.
I have, as you can see... appended to your orders a statement over my signature... to the effect that I assume total and complete responsibility... for all such actions.
Here. Does that cover it?
No, sir.
I consider it my responsibility to notify General Carlton... of what I believe to be an irresponsible and dangerous course of action.
- Do your worst.
- You could be shot for this, Amos.
My executioners will have to stand in line.
That's all, Captain.
Corporal Tinney!
Sir?
Where in hell is Lt. Graham?
Carry on.
- The Major's waiting to see you, sir.
- Thank you, Corporal.
- Sir!
- Lieutenant Graham.
- They're not much, are they?
- No, sir, they don't seem to be.
Cigar?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Coffee?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Why did they put you in the cavalry,
Lieutenant?
- Sir?
- Why did they assign you to the cavalry?
You're ordnance, aren't you?
No, sir. Artillery.
- Artillery?
- Yes, sir.
As Napoleon said, "Only thunderbolts can be preferred to cannon."
- Napoleon?
- Yes, sir!
You'll do, Lieutenant. You'll have to.
I need rifles and ammunition.
It's all listed there in that inventory: number of rounds, types of ordnance.
You go get them for me.
Forthwith.
Yes, sir!
Lieutenant.
- Sir?
- Where are you going?
I said, "Where are you going?"
To obtain... these weapons?
And just how and where do you intend to accomplish that?
It has come to my attention that a supply train from the Ordnance Depot... at Denver, en route to the 2nd California Column... now garrisoned in Santa Fe... should be encamped tomorrow morning at the Sand River crossing... thirty miles away.
Now, if you have the opportunity, you might just take C Troop.
See if you can be of any assistance.
Yes, sir.
November 4.
Lt. Graham had no official orders,
but this didn't stop him.
He was very persuasive,
with Sgt. Gomez and C Troop standing by.
He took what the Major needed.
We returned with 48 new Henry rifles,
5,000 rounds of ammunition...
and a baby howitzer
for the lieutenant to play with.
I see you transferred back to the artillery,
Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
Over a hundred civilian prisoners
volunteered...
and from them the Major took six,
and they were doubtful at best.
While we waited for horses,
the rebel prisoners that we needed...
watched the gallows being built.
The gallows on which the Major will hang
Sgt. Chillum, the Hadley brothers...
Jimmy Lee, and their captain.
Captain.
- You figure he's bluffing?
- Sure, he's bluffing.
He needs us much more than we need him.
Captain, that ain't no dance floor they're building for us.
We just want you to know, sir, that whatever you figure on... we're all with you.
Without Confederate volunteers,
the Major was forced to accept cowboys...
drifters and drunks.
You wanted Injun-fighting, mule-packing, whiskey-drinking volunteers, sir.
Well, by God, you've got one.
What am I going to do with you?
He's the biggest drunk, but the best packer in the territory, sir.
- What's your name?
- Wiley.
Wiley, make your mark.
- Whiskey?
- All you can drink.
When you've earned it.
Sergeant, throw him in a cell and dry him out.
- Come on, Wiley.
- I never seen anything like it.
- How many is that, Ryan?
- Twelve, sir.
- Name?
- Dahlstrom.
Any man with a just cause should travel with the word of God.
With all due respect,
God has nothing to do with it.
I intend to smite the wicked, not save the heathen.
Seventeen years ago,
I married John and Mary Rostes.
Who that destroyeth my flock,
I will so destroy.
Reverend.
November 5.
The Confederate prisoners are angry
and uneasy, waiting for tomorrow...
the day the rebel captain
and his four companions are to hang.
We are fearful of the consequences.
All of us know the Major needs the Captain
and his men...
but the Major is stubborn.
I think he will hang them
if they don't volunteer.
I would like to volunteer, sir.
Me and my six coloureds.
I haven't asked for volunteers from the command.
- We're doing the asking, sir.
- Why?
To fight, sir.
We've been standing guard and cleaning stables for nearly two years.
Tomorrow morning you ask the officer of the day to see me.
You and your six coloureds.
Thank you, sir.
The rebel captain
Ben Tyreen's compliments, sir.
He will see you now.
He will?
Yes, sir.
And he further states that he will volunteer himself and his men as needed... for double rations for all prisoners plus Gen. Carlton's written guarantee... that all Southern soldiers who serve with you, sir... will be automatically granted full pardon.
Now, sir, if I may be so bold as to suggest...
Guard!
- Open it up.
- Yes, sir.
Major, it has come to my attention...
You kill one of my soldiers and then have the gall to dictate terms to me?
You're a damn traitor, Ben.
You were a rebel before you ever saw the South.
And now you're a murderer.
Tomorrow morning, I am going to hang you and be done with you.
Jailer.
Sergeant!
How many men do you need?
Twenty. Good ones.
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed, only that.
Agreed.
Then you have my word, Major.
We will serve.
But after that we're going home.
If it's too rich for you... hang us now and be done with it.
I just might hang you and that Injun to the same tree, Ben.
You'll play hell getting it done, Amos.
This man will hold lieutenant's rank under myself and Lt. Graham.
Will you serve?
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed, sir.
Attention!
Lieutenant Graham, get away from that damn bell!
Priam, they're a bunch of Roman-nosed, broken-gutted, spavined... sore-footed, swaybacked dogs.
You call yourself a horse thief?
Samuel Potts!
Those Injuns you got with you look kind of shy, Samuel.
- They ain't sure they're welcome, Amos.
- Get on up here. I'll buy you a drink.
Ryan!
Today Mr. Potts got back.
With him was Riago.
If Lt. Brannin were alive
he would hang the Apache...
and I would help.
Yeah, but where in Mexico?
The children?
Well, they're skinny, but doing better than you'd expect.
Making their own arrows now.
That's Riago who rode in with you, isn't it?
They all look alike to you, Amos?
I asked you a question, Sam.
That's Riago.
Where'd you find him?
Didn't. He found me.
He said after the massacre he hit for the bush, stayed on their trail... figured I'd be along sooner or later.
I believe him, Amos.
Who's the other one?
He's got a personal score to settle.
Seems old Charriba wouldn't take him along with him on this last raid.
Said he couldn't be trusted.
Now he's got his mind set on killing the old man.
Do you expect me to believe these Apaches will turn against their own families?
Track down their own people?
Why not?
Everyone else seems to be doing it.
Lt. Brannin didn't trust Riago. Right, Ryan?
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid I go along with that, Sam.
Well, you go along with Lt. Brannin then.
Well, you go along without me.
Sam Potts.
Looks like the Union jackets you gave us didn't quite fit, Major.
So I see.
The last day was spent getting
acquainted with our comrades-in-arms.
Learning how to handle the pack animals
with sureness and dispatch.
And learning the character of our officers.
Troop, fall in!
Foot soldiers,
I want a company of twos on my right.
Cavalry, fall in 20 paces in front of me.
I want a column of twos on my right!
Line up here.
Get that mule out of there!
Fall them in with the artillery,
20 paces in front of me!
Column of twos on my right!
Fall in!
If I tell you one more time, you're court-martialed!
Why don't you find a horse and mount up,
Lieutenant Graham?
You don't seem to be doing very well on foot.
Mount up!
November 7, and we were ready,
all who volunteered.
Civilians, criminals, Southerners,
and Negroes.
Gentlemen, we've given the Major our parole... and we will serve him until I say we will not.
And until that time... he will be your commanding officer and will be treated as such.
And any sign of disrespect to him will be taken as a personal insult by me.
Don't worry none, Uncle Ben, when the time comes... we'll turpentine that caulky, chicken-picking Yankee.
I am not your uncle, you redneck peckerwood.
And one more word out of you and you'll end this campaign in chains.
Attention!
Good luck, Frank.
Give my regards to the General.
I mean for you to have that pleasure within the week, Amos.
If you don't, good luck.
I have but three orders of march:
If I signal you to come, you come.
If I signal you to charge, you charge.
And if I signal you to run, you follow me and run like hell.
Move them out, Lieutenant.
- Twos right!
- Twos right!
- Left turn!
- Left turn!
- Whistle me a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.
November 18.
We are now in Texas approaching Mexico.
And the Major
does not mean to be surprised...
by Confederate patrols out of Fort Davis.
- No fires tonight, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Trooper Hadley, you are not part of my gun crew.
Cold coffee again.
It's 50 miles to the border, and 86 to Fort Davis.
I wonder if we'll make it.
Make what, Sergeant Chillum?
Make it back to where we come from,
Captain.
We'll make it. It's just a question of time.
It was just after dawn and we were starting
for the Rio Grande when Riago returned.
I still don't trust him.
- Twos right!
- Major.
Says he got close enough to smell the stink of many white men.
I wager they're waiting for us at the river, Amos.
- We'd better walk on water.
- Let's find out what we're made of.
Boy!
Full gallop, son. We'll let those rebels know there's a Yankee army come to call.
Troop, halt!
Mr. Potts. Sergeant Gomez.
First 12 men across as skirmishers.
- Troop right, roll!
- Lieutenant Graham, move them out!
Column of twos.
Confederate cavalry, Lieutenant.
We don't have much time.
Your word's worth about as much as your cause.
- Then why don't you release him from it?
- Ben, you gave it, you break it.
And be damned to you.
- What do you want from us anyway?
- I've got what I want, Sergeant.
I've got his word.
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir.
- Move them out.
- Which way, Captain?
To Mexico, you bloody idiot!
November 19. We are in Mexico...
and this day's events
have made it clear to everyone...
that the Major's present war is not
with the South, but with the Apache.
- Lunge!
- That's very good, Aesop.
Thank you, sir.
But as Napoleon said, only thunderbolts can be preferred to cannon.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
Order arms.
Thank you, Priam.
Boy, I'm speaking to you!
You're forgetting your manners, nigger.
Come on over here and pull off my boots.
Lieutenant Graham.
Check the pickets.
Did you hear me, boy?
Do it, boy, now.
Let me, son.
Let go off my leg!
Preacher, you sure kick up a lot of dust with your sermon.
Don't forget your footgear, sonny.
- You started it, now finish it.
- No, we're gonna finish it.
By doggies, Preacher, now we're gonna get in line for you.
- I'm gonna cut me a piece of you first.
- You southern trash sit down!
Was you talking to me, Sergeant?
Now maybe you don't know it, but you're fixing to get tried.
You and all the rest of your bluebellies.
Trooper!
Mr. Aesop, we would like to compliment you and your men... on the way you handled the river crossing this afternoon.
Thank you, sir.
That gesture was necessary.
I'm sorry it was so painful for you.
Mr. Aesop is a fine soldier.
It won't happen again.
What happened is what it's all about, Ben.
If it was as simple as that, Amos.
We can take care of our own.
If you can, you waited too long to do it.
All you people, all the way down the line.
"You people"?
I'm not going to thank you for keeping your word this afternoon at the river.
You were obliged to.
But it wasn't easy, and I respect you for it.
I don't need respect from a man who took his kin to fight against their own brothers.
I took soldiers to fight for their country.
- You betrayed it.
- What country have I to betray?
I'm fighting for the only country I have left, and I kill men in a hopeless war for it.
But not men who were my neighbours and my friends.
Friends.
The best friend you ever had was the man who got you into West Point.
He was killed with the 2nd Michigan in Chickamauga last winter.
- Did you know that?
- I knew that, Amos.
You're a would-be cavalier, an Irish potato farmer with a plumed hat... fighting for a white-columned plantation house... you never had and never will.
How exactly do you see yourself,
Major Dundee?
Have you ever stopped to think why they made you a jailer instead of a soldier?
December 22, 1864.
We are five weeks into Mexico...
and have lost all contact with the Apache.
Even the scout, Samuel Potts, admits this,
and I'm glad.
I wish to avenge the massacre,
but I remember it too well, and I'm afraid.
How can we catch the wind
or destroy an enemy we never see?
It is Christmas Eve,
the year of our Lord, 1864...
and there is a deep and reverent sense of
peace and tranquillity in the camp tonight.
Mr. Potts and Riago, the Apache...
indulge in a high-spirited,
brotherly bout of wrestling.
At stake is Mr. Potts' gold railroad watch...
and the Apache's shotgun
with the silver inlaid stock.
It is a friendly contest.
Come on, Injun, get up.
There he is over there, go get him!
- That one brought him.
- Get up!
I think he's going to take you, Samuel.
You know why?
Because the artillery's betting on you.
Do you know Lt. Graham's bet $5 on you?
Artillery and a lieutenant, to boot.
Did you ever hear of an artilleryman winning a bet, or a girl... or a war when there was cavalry about?
- Who bet against me?
- Me.
- Just one, Major. He wants to talk.
- Bring him in.
He says he's a good Apache, and he's peaceful... and for nobody to shoot at him.
- Is he a Chiricahua?
- He surely is.
Why would an old man like that be raiding with Charriba?
He says, why not? It's their land, all of it.
Now he'd like a little soft food as his teeth are no longer with us.
Why did he quit?
Charriba kicked him out.
He says he's too old, much too old to fight anymore.
Ask him why I should believe him.
Well?
He says Charriba's camp is across the river.
He'll lead us there. They'll be asleep.
Does he expect me to believe that?
Let him lead us into an ambush?
He says his heart is true, Major... and he brings proof.
What kind of proof, Mr. Potts?
The children.
He's brought the children.
Pretty good.
Go on, sing up.
Soup's on.
Here's one for you, shorty.
Come on, buck, get around here where you can eat.
- Can I have seconds?
- Get in here.
- Don't we get any?
- Watch out, don't spill it.
Don't look to me like them gut-eaters has been feeding them very good.
- Did you ever see a fat Apache?
- I ain't yet.
This is good.
You're going back now that you've got what you came for, Major?
Everything points to that old man talking straight.
Potts is half convinced.
I'm more than half.
Did it ever occur to you that Charriba gave us what we wanted... because he intends to take it back again?
It's occurred to me.
I want two of your best men to help Sgt. Gomez take the children home.
We'll still outnumber you, Amos.
You surely will, Ben.
Now go do as you're told.
Yes, sir.
But only until the Apache is taken or destroyed.
Sgt. Gomez headed back to safety
with the three Rostes boys...
while we followed the old Apache
toward Sierra Charriba.
Lieutenant, take 12 men across as skirmishers.
First 12 men, follow me.
- Sergeant Chillum, take them through.
- Yes, sir.
Get them back to the far side of the river!
Back to the river!
- Try and regroup on the far bank!
- Hadley, run them out!
Keep moving, Lieutenant Graham, there's nobody left to shoot at out here.
Merry Christmas.
He was making a doll for his girl child.
Riago!
How did they know?
They're Apache.
Just what in hell is he?
I'm a tame Apache.
A camp dog.
Christian Indian.
Charriba is Apache.
Sam, you take this camp dog and go find me Charriba.
That's what you pay us for, Amos.
- Wiley, did you get hit?
- No, sir.
One of them damn mules kicked me.
Fourteen men killed, sir. Thirteen wounded.
Four critically.
70% of all stores lost, 20% ammunition... and 60% of livestock either killed or stolen.
- Damn it to bloody Confederate hell!
- What?
- Sorry.
- He's all right, Doctor.
He'll live forever and have a hundred children.
But if time and battle prove that you have a weakness... for being shot in that vicinity,
I'd wear an iron board inside my pants.
You tell him go easy with that, Major, or I'll shoot you right between the eyes.
You patrolled this whole area with Grant in '47, didn't you?
Yes. The tequila was excellent.
How far would you say we are from the nearest food and shelter?
About a week's march. Maybe less.
There's a pretty village, and rather friendly.
If you're really serious about replenishing our supplies... there's a well-stocked garrison
I could recommend just about here.
But we'd probably have to tangle with some French Lancers.
That's one thing I plan to avoid.
Major, we can't follow the Apache.
I'm not letting go of that Injun.
- Boy!
- Sir!
Pass the word to the command we move out in the morning.
And bring me a bottle of that medicinal brandy.
There is no more brandy, sir, except at the bottom of the river.
Now this time, Lieutenant, try and hold still.
Prepare to move out in the morning.
We left a lot at the bottom of the river.
We ask thee, Lord, to take these soldiers who have fallen in thy service.
Amen.
We got whipped, Major.
Burying your dead is not going to change it.
January 9, 1865.
Sgt. Gomez and the troopers returned today.
The Rostes boys are well and safe.
This made us feel better, but not for long.
He's not running anymore.
He's waiting.
Let's move. Mount up!
January 10.
Two more died last night.
I'm afraid all the wounded will perish
unless we rest.
I wonder whether any of us will ever return.
The war of rebellion and Fort Benlin
seem very far away.
The village is occupied.
The blockhouse, there are 10, 15 men.
Regulars, I think. I don't know.
Their garrison is about six hours away... and about 300 Lancers,
Legionnaires, or maybe less.
We'll move on the village at sunup.
Dismount! Prepare to fight on foot!
- Horses to the rear.
- Get those horses!
- Point blank range.
- Fuse timing zero.
Unload.
Locked, loaded and primed, and ready for firing.
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.
Boy, whistle me a tune.
Will you show the colours, sir?
No, Lieutenant, we will not show the colours.
All right, Sam, make it short and to the point.
Hey, get out here!
Compliments, Major Amos Dundee, irregular United States Cavalry.
You have five minutes to surrender your arms and stores...
- or he's going to cut loose.
- He would not dare.
This is an act of aggression against a friendly power...
- an outrageous breach of international law.
- Sonny... the Major ain't no lawyer.
You've now got four minutes.
Sergeant, I want to talk to the mayor.
- There seems to be no end to it.
- What did you say?
We've been attacked by Apaches, by local bandits... by freebooters from Texas, then liberated by the French... and now United States Cavalry.
Unfortunately, you came too late.
We have nothing to give you.
No food, no guns, no women.
That is what you want, isn't it?
That's why you come here without flying your country's brave flag.
Are you speaking for these people?
You're not Mexican, are you?
My husband was the doctor of this village.
But he was also the doctor for the Juaristas.
He died there, where they did.
I've paid for my place here.
Well, I'm sorry for that, ma'am, but we've come a long way.
I need fresh horses and food.
My men are hungry.
They are no more hungry than this village.
They are willing to share everything they have got with you, Major... most particularly their hunger.
Would you like to see the children in our dispensary... whose sickness is starvation?
- Lieutenant Graham, fire!
- Sir!
Sgt. Gomez, slaughter two mules, distribute the meat... and whatever stores you find in that blockhouse to the people of the village...
- and to this lady.
- Teresa. Teresa Maria Santiago.
- Ma'am. Ryan!
- Yes, sir.
Lieutenant!
With beauty such as yours, this village is rich beyond comparison.
Lieutenant Tyreen!
God save the Queen.
We entered the village
to take food and horses...
but instead gave away our own,
and everyone was thankful.
Our wounds were tended
by a German lady...
who spoke English and was pretty,
if somewhat old.
- Hold it there, will you?
- Thank you, ma'am.
Also, a very lovely Mexican girl
who was kindness itself, gentle and young.
Don't worry, son, it ain't near your heart.
To the victors belong the spoils.
Well, Ben, you look quite the gentleman.
After the war, Amos... the Tyreens of County Clair become the landed gentry of Virginia.
It's not over yet.
By midnight tonight I want every man in this command drunker than a fiddler's bitch.
At that point, our prisoners will escape and run for help.
But we will not discover this until sunup.
Tomorrow night, after following us all day... that French cavalry will camp and prepare to attack our disorganised rabble.
But before they make their move, we will steal them blind and be on our way.
You are either... a $70, red-wool, pure-quill military genius... or the biggest damn fool in Northern Mexico.
No question of it.
You haven't got the temperament to be a liberator, Amos.
I don't?
If I may suggest, sirs, the time has come to join the fiesta.
Sitting alone is bad for the soul.
Captain Tyreen. Does he shave?
- Does it matter?
- Didn't to me.
She's not here.
Too bad.
There was something about that woman.
There sure, sure was.
Made me think of... satin.
- Soft, white satin.
- Major.
Excuse me, Major.
A waltz.
I'd be delighted, sir.
- Lieutenant Graham.
- Sir!
- Why aren't you with the pickets?
- I've been relieved, sir.
Carry on.
Sir, in my opinion we need more guards at the blockhouse... or the French prisoners are going to escape.
Thank you, Lieutenant, for your opinion.
Now, I trust you will carry on.
No, sir. You see, I'm cutting in, sir.
- What?
- Cutting in, sir.
Lieutenant Graham, have you been drinking?
- Señorita.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
A Mexican dance, perhaps?
I wanted to say goodbye, and thank you.
It was good to celebrate just being alive.
- Are you planning to stay on here now?
- I don't know.
I met my husband when he was a medical student in Vienna.
My family disapproved violently.
So violently, I no longer have any ties there.
And I'm needed here.
There is no one else except for Linda, not for a hundred miles.
You will say goodbye to Lt. Tyreen for me?
I'd be delighted.
I liked the way he asked me to dance.
As if we were in a ballroom in Vienna.
- It was a lovely little charade.
- The Lieutenant has style.
He must be a fanciful man.
He is corrupt. But I will save him.
Thank you for being kind.
All I feel is kindness.
Next time I'll be more fanciful.
Hadley! Wiley! Get them mules in here.
Mount up. Just fall in. Get in there.
Ryan is missing, sir.
Graham went to look for him.
- Who went to look for Graham?
- Gomez.
Sergeant Gomez, be gentle with the bugler boy.
He's ill.
Take your time, Trooper Ryan, take your time.
We're delighted you decided to join us.
Now if you'd only warned us, we could have sent Sgt. Gomez... to serve you breakfast in bed.
Ryan, put it in the saddle!
All accounted and...
All present and accounted for, sir.
I can see that, Lieutenant Graham.
I can clearly see that.
Suppose you could manage to move them out now?
Twos left, right turn.
Last night the Major let
the French prisoners escape.
He hoped they would go to
their garrison for reinforcements.
They did.
This afternoon he sent Lt. Graham
and some troopers out as a decoy.
The rest of us hung back, waiting.
Jefferson, that scarf is to decorate the cannon, not you.
- Yes, sir.
- Wiley, secure those pack animals.
Sergeant Chillum, are the pickets out?
They're out. Not that they'll do any good.
If them Lancers has got a fieldpiece... they could move it in, lay in one round, and then finish us off... with them 10-foot frog stickers they're packing.
No, they'll camp.
Begging your pardon, Lieutenant, but who says so?
I do.
Don't they look pretty?
My boys can take that outfit, the walking ones anyway... with one hand tied behind our backs.
How's that, Aesop?
They're soft, O.W.
They ain't never been south.
They're closing up.
They'll be less than five miles from Graham by full dark.
What if they don't stop?
What if they don't camp? They just keep on, smash hell out of the Lieutenant?
Mighty is the arm of the Lord.
January 15. It took the French
three days to discover...
all they were chasing was
a one-armed scout and a renegade Apache.
By that time, Mr. Potts and Riago
figured we were safe...
and decided to lose them and find us.
We rested and healed our wounds.
Hey! I'm drowning!
- Come on in.
- I already had my bath.
Hey, the water's fine.
- First shave, Tim?
- Yep.
- Maybe we should call you Ryan now.
- Yeah.
We are waiting for Mr. Potts, Sgt. Gomez...
and the rebel captain to return
from the scout.
We fear that the French have taken
reprisals against the village.
I keep thinking about Linda
and pray for her safety.
- What happened?
- Just like watching a bird die.
- And the woman?
- I don't know, Amos.
If they hanged her, they cut her down.
Them boys in the pretty hats make the Apache look like missionaries.
Never underestimate the value of a European education.
- No sign of Charriba?
- Don't worry about that, Amos.
He wants to drag it out.
I think he figures on leaving stories about you that'll be told... around the campfires of his people for a thousand years.
We were healing,
becoming a command again.
Hard and watchful, anxious for battle...
when that which
the Major hated most occurred.
Sir! A deserter.
O.W. Hadley has deserted, sir. Last night.
A horse is gone, food and ammunition supplies broken into.
Mr. Potts, you take Riago and pick up his trail.
I want that man back.
It ain't my job, Major.
I didn't sign on to go chasing after no homesick soldier boys.
It's mine.
All right, Sergeant, you find him.
Beg your pardon, sir... but what'll they do to Pvt. Hadley when they catch him?
What?
Son, it'd be our good luck if he killed him.
But he won't and the Major will.
Oh, no, Mr. Potts... the Major will not.
In two days,
Sgt. Gomez returned with O. W. Hadley.
Along the way he found the lady doctor
with some children and Linda.
They had all fled the village.
The Major wasted no time
trying O. W. Hadley for desertion.
Boys, by doggies, I want you to know what kind of company we've been keeping.
He just plain clean shot a hole in me.
And he would have let me bleed to death... if it hadn't been for that woman over there come along and bandaged up my leg.
Now, you know I ain't no deserter.
I just went into that village to court a little señorita and say hello to her folks.
I was fixing to come back. I was.
You all know I always stay close to my big brother.
- Ain't that right, Arthur?
- That's right.
And you ain't gonna let them shoot your kin for no deserter, are you, Arthur?
You gonna do something about it, ain't you?
Sergeant, I don't want to look up at him.
Captain.
You know me.
I've been over the hill before.
But I always come back, didn't I?
And you whipped me for it and I deserved it.
But you never killed me none.
Now you ain't gonna hand me over to no bluebelly... just because I had a hankering for a woman?
She's a sweet little thing, Captain.
She's pretty and polite and a lady.
She surely is.
And that grub is for her kinfolks.
You remember her, Captain?
I was dancing with her and I introduced you to her. You remember her, don't you?
I remember.
Sergeant Chillum, would you say it was common knowledge in this camp that... that village had been burned, people scattered?
Well, I know that, Major, sir... but I just figured I'd sit there and wait till they come back.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
How much food and ammunition would you say was taken?
Enough for three men for a week, sir.
Look, Major, forget about the book.
The men of this command risked their lives for those supplies.
It may have slipped your mind, but he also risked his life.
Trooper... you're gonna be shot.
Hadley!
Major, hand him over to us.
I'll deal with him.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
You used to be a soldier.
Do you know what you're saying?
I'm saying if you kill that boy that's the beginning of it and not the end.
You're wearing out, Ben.
You were a rock once, now you're crumbling like old chalk.
Lieutenant, select a firing squad by lot.
- Exclude the Confederates.
- Yes, sir.
I said we will serve in this command and we will serve!
But only until we have caught the Apache.
And then, Major...
I am going to kill you.
Are you, Ben?
Yes.
Yes, Amos.
You gonna let them shoot me, Captain?
I'm obliged to, son.
You should have remembered you belong to the Major and not to me.
I'm sorry.
That's it, boys, by doggies... let's pitch in and get it over with.
Hell, Major, you're just doing what you got to do... but damn your soul for it, and God bless Robert E. Lee.
We are a command divided against itself,
and I fear nothing will ever heal this breach.
Even some of our own people
are bitter against the Major.
But he bears the burden of command
and I do not feel fit to judge him.
I'm not one of your soldiers.
I could not bear to be with all those men, in the midst of all that hatred.
- May I walk with you?
- Not afraid of the tiger?
Are you the tiger that prowls these mountains?
No, I'm not afraid, Major.
- Oh, it's lovely here.
- I don't spoil it?
No.
What happened today was terrible.
We all died a little with that boy.
But perhaps you, most of all.
Why are you with me?
I've seen too much dying... and I wanted so desperately to feel alive... for both of us to feel alive.
It troubles you a great deal, doesn't it, how the men feel about you?
I'm concerned with how they fight, not how they feel about me.
But why is this so important, this fighting?
There are other things.
Men can understand fighting.
I guess maybe they need it sometimes.
The truth is, it's easy.
Forget about your problems, responsibilities... just let someone feed you, tell you what to do.
But whom do you answer to?
If you go to Durango you'll have to go into hiding, won't you?
It will be difficult, but not impossible.
Did you ever think about living in the United States?
I don't think about that, Major.
Get it out.
I can't. It's too deep.
It's too close to the artery.
They have to take you to the doctor in Durango.
I'm staying with the command.
You get me some whiskey and bandages.
Go on.
Sergeant, get a stretcher for the Major.
You're getting leave, Major.
And it's time you did.
In fact, you ought to give up soldiering altogether.
You were trapped at the river.
Ambushed like a shavetail.
You caused a boy's death and you've split your own command.
And now how do you explain being outside your own picket lines?
What are you doing, Major, easing your conscience in the arms of a woman?
A woman, if I might say so, of rather doubtful virtue.
Just what the bloody hell are you doing here in the first place, Amos?
There are so many French soldiers in Durango.
We won't show the colours.
- I can't speak the language.
- But you understand.
Major.
It is close, very close.
If you're thinking of cutting that leg off, Doctor, don't.
I am only concerned to stop the loss of blood.
Though much of it is alcohol.
You should be able to walk in seven days and ride in twelve.
I'll walk in two and ride in one more.
Mr. Potts, you and Sgt. Gomez can rejoin the command now.
I can get to the river camp by myself.
And I'm perfectly capable of following your trail from there.
Well, you'd better stay off those streets, Amos.
You make an unlikely-looking Mexican.
No, it's no use.
They're on to me, those Frenchman.
Just waiting for me to run, lead them back to the command.
I see our French friends are still waiting.
The tequila. Did you bring the tequila?
I asked for something to drink.
This isn't enough to spit.
No.
Sure, it gets better every day.
Be able to dance on it soon.
You don't believe me?
I'll show you. Come on.
Miss Covington, I believe I have the honour of this next quadrille.
You wait and see.
This army doesn't dance... doesn't march, doesn't fight.
Except on this last battlefield.
We're joining the Juaristas at Guaymas.
I came here to reassure myself that you were still alive.
I'm alive.
Yes, I see.
You should be careful.
The French police is already suspicious of this place.
Wait.
If I ever do get out of here...
The war won't last forever.
It will for you, Major.
No, the war will not last forever.
"Awake! For Morning in the Bowl of Night
"Has cast the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight"
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to rescue you.
We spent all night looking for you.
- Why?
- So I can kill you myself.
Makes sense.
Well, there goes our little watchdog.
Shall we go, Major?
I drink, Ben. Did you know that?
That is the secret of my great success.
I drink.
But I don't drink enough.
Why don't you drink, Lieutenant Tyreen?
Don't you ever have any doubts about who you are?
I've been three men already, Amos.
That's enough for one lifetime.
- Irish immigrant...
- Cashiered American officer.
And Confederate renegade.
- I don't like any of them.
- Well, now, isn't that a coincidence.
Get away from me.
I have orders, appropriate to your character.
I have to take you out the back door.
- Finish it.
- The patrol. We leave now.
Leave me alone, all of you.
Company!
Sergeant Gomez.
Major.
Fire!
Lt. Graham will be a general before he's 30.
Why, come on, get out of it!
- Come on!
- Ben, for God's sakes, let me be.
Why not, Major?
You're not worth killing anyway.
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed.
January 30. We thought we had lost
three troopers in Durango...
but two returned this morning,
and we became a command again.
- Lieutenant Graham!
- Yes, sir.
When I left I gave you a specific order.
You failed to carry it out.
No, sir. You gave me a command.
From then on I gave the orders.
You surely did. Have a cigar.
Move them out, Lieutenant.
We ran from the French
as we followed the Apache...
but time was running out.
The French patrols became thicker
while we never got closer to Sierra Charriba.
- How long ago?
- Four or five hours ago.
Charriba says you're to make your peace with your Christian God... as you are about to join him.
We must have hurt the old man at the river more than we figured.
At least now he's got to finish it.
So far, he's been circling west.
Some time in the next week or two he'll hit us again in a canyon... or the middle of a river at night, or dawn.
When are we going to stop fighting this Indian on his own terms?
Right now.
From this point on we tuck our tail between our legs and run for home...
- straight for the Rio Grande.
- You'd let Charriba escape?
Let's just say I'm giving him an equal opportunity, Lieutenant.
Major, but we have to make it look good.
First swing right, then head for the river.
But we really got to move.
If we don't, he'll be waiting for us there, just like he is now.
- How'll we know?
- We won't, until it happens.
On your horse, Lieutenant, move them out.
- Go cut him down, Sam.
- You cut him down, Major.
I think he's earned it.
March 23. Today we learned
that Riago had been a true soldier.
I bitterly regret my suspicions,
as I'm sure does the Major.
April 18. We ran from the Apaches
and the French...
then circled and headed
for the river and home.
The men were angry,
wanting to continue our pursuit.
And then suddenly we all knew
we weren't running away from anything.
We were running toward
the end of our search.
River's less than a mile from here.
This is your last chance, Major.
It's as good a place as any to do what you got in mind.
Sergeant, if you put your pickets out far enough... the Apache might leave them alone.
But no matter what happens, don't fire unless you're attacked.
Just remember your orders and hope.
Good luck, Mr. Potts.
Who will you send against me now?
Fire.
He looks so small now.
He was big enough, son.
Now, Major... or across the river in Texas?
Right now is just fine, Ben.
You boys want a fight, I got one for you.
Get up here and look.
We had forgotten the French,
but the French had not forgotten us.
Where can we ford the river into Texas?
It's the only shallow spot within a half day's march from here, Major.
Mount up the troop, Lieutenant, we're going back home.
- Sergeant Gomez!
- Sir?
- Mount the troops, we're moving out now!
- Yes, sir.
Congratulations, Major.
It appears that at last you have found yourself a real war.
- Sergeant Gomez.
- Sir?
Dismount and deploy your men... prepare to receive a mounted cavalry charge from your front.
They won't charge, Major. Why should they?
By holding their positions, they hold us here for the others.
- We have to move against them.
- When I'm ready.
- Lieutenant Graham.
- Sir?
- Make ready your artillery.
- Yes, sir.
- It's ready, sir.
- Simon.
Break out the ammunition... we're about ready to engage the pride of Europe.
Yes, sir.
- Well, Ben?
- I'll need five men mounted.
I'll hit their flank after you break their charge.
- Bully.
- Bully.
Lieutenant, show the colours.
- Standard-bearer!
- Sir?
Show the colours.
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir!
Cut the fuse for 500 yards. Elevation 20...
- Make that 28 degrees.
- Ready, sir!
Start the ball, Lieutenant.
A mile, maybe less.
They'll be coming now.
- Sergeant Gomez.
- Sir?
- The bugle will be your signal to fire.
- Yes, sir.
Company, charge!
Any of you damn gringos fire before the signal...
I swear to God I kill you.
On my signal, the horses.
I repeat, only the horses.
Mount your men.
Take up a skirmish line at the foot of the bluff.
Here comes the second wave, Ben.
We're ready when you are.
Rally around me!
Major, I shall see you in Texas.
You're damn right you will. Bugler!
Dundee!
All present and accounted for, sir.
Your orders, sir.
Move them out, Lieutenant, column of twos.
Column of twos.
- Trooper Ryan!
- Sir.
- Play us a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.
Forward, ho!
April 19, 1865.
After a brief but costly battle
with French irregulars...
we crossed the Rio Grande
and re-entered the United States.
London calling... with Frenchmen
speaking to their countrymen.
Take a look at that! What a handsome sight...
...the pride of the Third Reich!
The brave sergeant taking coffee to the beachgunners.
So that's a sample of the master race! In a pig's eye!
In this darkest hour, in the gloom of night...
...we must not despair.
For each of us...
...deliverance is coming!
We need mines and obstacles along the whole coast.
At every beach, on every dune...
...on every rock.
How many have been installed?
Four million, Herr Field Marshal.
The work has completely exhausted our troops.
Which would your troops rather be...
...exhausted or dead?
Just look at it, gentlemen.
How calm... how peaceful it is.
A strip of water between
England and the Continent...
...between the Allies and us.
But beyond that peaceful horizon... a monster waits!
A coiled spring of men, ships and planes...
...straining to be released against us.
But not a single Allied soldier shall reach the shore.
Whenever or wherever this invasion may come, gentlemen...
...I shall destroy the enemy there... at the water's edge!
Believe me, gentlemen.
The first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive.
For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day...
...the longest day!
The poem by Verlaine?
Play it back!
Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.
Here are some personal messages.
"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."
I repeat:
"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."
Have you notified all commands?
If Berlin is right, when we intercept the second verse...
...it will mean the invasion will come within 24 hours.
Give me the text of the second verse.
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."
We've intercepted hundreds of messages in the last year... hundreds!
I've ordered alerts again and again.
Why should this poem mean more than other messages?
Tell me this:
Does it give us any clue as to where they will land and when?
Of course it doesn't.
How can I maintain discipline if
I keep my troops on the alert...
...just because a pair of nitwits in Berlin intercept a poem?
No, Blumentritt... no alert!
And especially not in this weather!
- Anything else?
- No, sir.
Good morning, Field Marshal.
- Any news?
- Nothing important.
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-
Calais yesterday afternoon.
Nothing much happened last night... the storm.
That's all I'm interested in this morning... the storm.
It came from nowhere... blew my roses to bits.
There are five-foot waves in the Channel...
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour.
For the month of June...
...it's the worst Channel storm in 20 years.
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?
General Jodl will see the Führer today...
...and confirm the appointment for you.
Will you still go to Germany as planned?
Can you think of a better time?
The weather is expected to continue like this for another week.
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.
Snap it up.
Jerk the lead.
Snap it up.
Jerk the lead.
You expect us to eat this slop again?
I don't care what you do with it, mac.
Eat it, throw it out.
I get paid for cooking it.
Come on. Put it on.
Snap it up.
Jerk the lead.
Didn't you get any sleep?
Are you kidding? I haven't slept since we got here.
I got the absolute lowdown.
It's on for tonight. For sure.
Yeah.
I got in this crap game with this guy from F Company.
- He's an orderly for some general.
- Move it. Move it.
Hey, Hutchy!
Hutchy, I want to ask you something.
Hey, Hutchinson...
...do you think they'd let me write home? If it was really important?
Not likely, mate. Security.
I don't think old Churchill trusts us.
It's the wife, you see.
She's going to have a baby.
Your first, is it?
Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead worried about her.
She's not too strong, you see.
Man, that stink.
Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit.
And there ain't no place left to get sick in.
The puke bags is full.
The fire buckets is full.
All we got left is our helmets.
June.
Every June my old man used to take me camping...
...up in the Blue Mountains.
We'd hunt and fish all day long.
And at night...
...we'd sleep out under the stars.
Didn't even need a blanket.
June.
Wind and rain. Wind and rain.
Don't it ever stop?
Look, Dad, all I want to do is get going.
Wind or no wind. Even if we land in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.
- Come to think of it...
- Colonel wants us.
All of us.
All troops will participate in ground tactics and deployment.
In this weather, sir?
Of course, Harding, if you can ensure that we'll land in France...
...in sunshine and dry weather.
- Didn't mean that.
- What did you mean?
- It isn't the weather.
It's the waiting.
These men are itching to go.
I don't think I have to remind you...
...that this war has been going on for almost five years.
Half of Europe has been overrun and occupied.
We're comparative newcomers.
England's gone through a blitz with a knife at her throat since 1940.
I am quite sure that they too are impatient and itching to go.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir. Quite clear.
Three million men penned up on this island.
All over England, in staging areas like this.
We're on the threshold of the most crucial day of our times.
Three million men out there...
...keyed up, and waiting for that big step-off.
They aren't exactly alone.
Notify the men. Full packs and equipment, 14:00 hours.
Yes, sir.
This allows you more freedom.
Quicker to get rid of when we hit the beach.
- Well?
- It's on.
Tonight, as scheduled.
- If the weather isn't worse.
- How worse can it get?
Ike has called a high-level conference for 9:30.
I am not Eisenhower. I am an assistant division commander.
I don't know from nothing, but he can't call it off again.
Frank, turn that thing off.
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.
Troops ready to go.
Eleven thousand planes on the line.
Eighteen thousand paratroopers.
God only knows how many gliders.
Norm, relax.
RAF says the gale can stop as suddenly as it began.
So they told us yesterday and the day before.
Look, Norm.
We're all of us just as...
...dedicated to this thing as you are, just as anxious to get going.
And that includes Ike.
Now if he calls it off again, he knows what he's doing.
Of course he does. I know that.
I'm just thinking about those assault troops. 200,000 of them...
...out there on those ships.
They're probably seasick as hell.
Some of those men have been on those tubs for almost three days.
I say go.
Go. Weather or no weather.
No!
A hundred on the bone! Let's go.
- Hey, give me $50. I'm busted.
- I'm not doing so good myself.
Hey, lend me $50?
- Lend me 20 bucks?
- Drop dead.
Lend me $ 10?
- Fifty on a bet.
- I got it.
One, two, three, four, five.
Fifty!
Let me hear it, let me hear it.
- Five and two, four and three.
- Six! That's the way we go!
Seven points in a row. It ain't logical, it just ain't logical.
- There's a hundred out there.
- $ 100 dollars, $20 dollars.
Anything open?
- Forty more.
- Forty more.
You got a bet.
- Okay, you mother-loving...
- Just a minute. Wait a minute.
Here you are. Use this.
- You don't think I'd...
- I don't think anything.
I just like to hear the sound when it comes out of the cup.
That's it. Shake it.
Okay. Let me see what you do with it now. Go ahead. Shoot.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Seven!
- That's what I wanted!
Who put this cup in the game?
- Next shooter. Who's coming up?
- I'll go $ 100.
He's shooting a hundred.
Who's got it?
- Watch your side bets.
You got a letter for me.
Schultz, huh?
Yeah, that's it.
Thanks, buddy.
- How much did you take him for?
- Not much. Just a hair over $2500.
- Yeah.
Oh, man, $2500?
It's too bad you had to win it now.
What do you mean, now?
Suppose we take off tonight.
What will you do with it?
Five I take with me to Paris to blow on the broads and wine.
A thou I leave here for seed when I get back.
And the rest I send to my mother.
Oh, man, $2500. And in Paris.
You always was lucky.
Hey, remember that night in Fort Bragg?
I remember it.
You know, I think I sneak over there and give it a big whang myself.
Why not? What's to lose?
Damn it.
Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?
I was lucky, all right, in that crap game.
Next day I break my leg in a jump.
And two months in traction.
That's more money I ever had in my whole life.
I know.
Man, I just know.
I wonder how long it takes to lose $2500?
Pint of sludge, Ted.
Oh, hello, Dave.
Hey, you seen Johnny?
Yes.
Well, where is he?
Come on, Dave.
I need my boots.
Johnny's borrowed them.
Where is he?
At the bottom...
...of the Channel.
You mean...
...he's bought it?
Ack-ack over Calais.
He jumped clean, but his parachute didn't open.
That leaves just you in the squadron, Dave.
I mean, of the old 1940 mob.
What's always worried me about being one of the few...
...is the way we keep on getting fewer.
Yeah.
Poor old Johnny.
Bad luck, it happening now.
- Now, then. What's the difference?
- He went through the Battle of Britain!
And now if the big show starts tonight...
...he won't be in it.
Look, will you please shut up about him?
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You heard something about tonight?
No, no. I haven't heard anything.
- What are you talking about then?
- Well, it's just...
- Go on, go on.
- I have a feeling it's on for tonight.
- That's all.
- A feeling.
Take your feeling somewhere else.
I've got a letter to write.
I've had this feeling since I woke up.
I've had it with me all day long.
I can't shake it off.
It's tonight. I know it is.
All right, it's tonight.
Suits me fine.
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!
I mean...
...as soon as I finish this beer.
- General, can you spare me a minute?
- Come in.
- Thank you.
- Can I get you coffee?
- No, thanks.
- I'll get some for myself.
Is it still raining?
On and off, off and on.
Sometimes I wonder which side God's on.
What?
I say, sometimes I wonder which side God's on.
Good question.
What's on your mind, Van?
I'm concerned about the placement of our drop zones.
Go on.
I know this is a hell of a late date to bring up something new...
...but you've given me a tough nut to crack.
- It gets tougher every time I try.
- I know, Van.
Sainte-Mère-Eglise straddles the only road the Germans can use...
...to drive into our northern flank.
But it has to be taken.
And it has to be held.
That's why I gave you the job, Van.
- Can I use your board?
- Of course.
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.
Down here is the swamp area that the Germans have flooded.
And in between, four miles from the town, is our drop zone.
Now if anything goes wrong and we undershoot...
...we land in this flooded area and are bogged down.
If we overshoot, we come down like clay pigeons...
...smack dab in the center of Sainte-Mère-Eglise.
That's why I gave the men training in low-level jumps near the villages.
So I've heard.
Got a complaint from the city council at Bexhall.
Some of your men overshot the drop zone and landed in the town.
- Tied up traffic for an hour.
- That's true, sir. I was with them.
Sudden crosswind hit us, swept us over the treetops...
...scattered us all over the place.
- Where did you end up?
- In the courtyard of a convent.
Relax, Van. Sit down.
The last few months have been a tough grind on all of us.
I hear you've been working yourself and your battalion hard.
Almost without a stop.
Now that we're almost at the end of the line...
...why don't you try easing up on yourself and on the men?
Sometimes a battalion can be sharpened to too fine a point.
Sometimes a commander can too.
Well...
...if there's any further delay...
...I request permission to submit a new placement for our drop zones.
All right. Put it in writing.
Make it official.
That's your prerogative.
But Ike has called a final meeting for tonight at Southwick House.
If it's on, we'll get the green light by 9:30.
- What are the chances?
- Better than 50-50.
Forget everything I said. I got the best battalion in this division...
...and they're ready.
Here it is. The latest report.
- It's Southwick House, sir.
- Stagg here.
Yes, sir. The new front's moving in much faster than we thought.
Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.
I'll be there, sir. 9:30.
- Would you like some more tea, sir?
- Coffee, and make it black.
Please.
One moment, Colonel Priller.
Why wasn't he court-martialed?
He shot down 132 planes.
Don't call me "Pips, old boy."
You were a rotten pilot when we flew in Russia.
You're flying a desk now, but you're still a rotten pilot!
What's that you're saying?
I'm squatting here on this
God-forsaken airfield...
...with only two planes... two stinking crates!
Oh, sure, sure... your orders were followed!
Now my squadrons are God-knows-where!
My supplies are all gone. What am I supposed to do now?
But Pips, we had to disperse our fighter squadrons... we had to!
Look what happened to our airstrips around the Pas-de-Calais!
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!
You move us back instead of forward!
Sure, I know the weather's lousy and they probably won't invade...
...but what would happen if they did?
But you know I can't get there with my equipment for two days.
I tell you, you're all crazy!
Priller has always been a hothead...
...but let's not underestimate him.
What he says is not entirely illogical.
What's the weather report?
Slightly better over the Channel.
I wouldn't be surprised if...
- When's the next weather report?
- Tonight at 8, General.
Keep me posted on the weather.
You made my dinner reservations?
Yes, I did, General.
Cancel everything.
Shoes for my wife, I had them specially made in Paris...
...for her birthday... tomorrow, the sixth of June.
Please wish her a happy birthday.
Thank you, Speidel.
Why didn't they attack in May?
The weather was perfect...
An attack now would be embarrassing.
But I don't think we need worry.
Is the plan ready, sir?
Yes, yes, quite finished.
War games...
...theoretical invasions.
Rush to Rennes just to push little flags around a table.
Playing at war!
Do you win or lose, sir?
Have I ever lost?
But General, this time you play the role of Eisenhower.
I win because I go against the rules.
We expect them to cross at the narrowest part of the Channel...
...and in good weather. But that's too simple... too obvious.
I choose the widest part, in the worst weather... and attack here.
In Normandy.
And in bad weather!
Like now...
...bad weather!
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.
From a meteorological standpoint, conditions almost resemble mid-winter.
And Normandy?
High winds, clouds, and some fog over the beaches.
However, I can say with a certain degree of safety...
...that we can expect a brief period of fair conditions.
Let me summarize, then.
What you're promising us is a barely tolerable period of fair conditions.
Am I right?
Yes.
Conditions that are far below the minimum requirements.
That's all I can promise.
You've done your best, Stagg.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Well...
...there it is.
We've postponed the attack once already.
Now, either we go on the 6th, with only marginal conditions...
...or postpone again...
...in the hope of getting perfect conditions.
What do you think, Monty?
I say, go. Go.
I must remind everybody...
...that the American convoy for the Omaha and Utah beaches...
...they've farthest to go...
...must be given the order within the next half-hour...
...if the assault is to take place on the 6th.
We can't keep almost a quarter of a million men on ships...
...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.
The longer we wait, the more acute our security problem.
The next time...
...the tides and the moon will be right...
Not before July.
Gentlemen...
...such a postponement...
...is too bitter to contemplate.
A brilliant plan, General.
Unorthodox, but brilliant.
Fortunately, it's only a game.
I don't think we have much to worry about.
Eisenhower would never take the gamble.
Never.
I'm quite positive we must give the order.
I don't like it...
...but there it is.
Gentlemen...
...I don't see how we can possibly do anything else but go.
Wilson speaking.
Yes, sir.
It's on, sir. Ike's made the decision. Tonight, as scheduled!
Colonel Tomson speaking.
Thank you.
Next stop...
...Normandy.
God help us now.
Gentlemen...
...the day we've been waiting for has arrived.
Invasion! We're on our way.
General.
The orders have been given.
It's on.
Have the battalion commanders join me in the wardroom.
All right, Sergeant.
You men are the eyes of our airborne army.
You, the pathfinders, will have one job, and one job only:
To light the drop zones for our paratroops.
Along with the British and Canadians you'll be the first men...
...to land in France.
And remember this:
When you get to Normandy...
...you'll only have one friend:
God.
And this.
This...
...is Rupert.
Now, we are going to drop Rupert...
...and a lot more like him...
...behind the invasion area.
He's...
...a very extraordinary fellow, Rupert.
He's sort of a...
...one-man army, all by himself.
Let me show you.
Let me show you what happens when Rupert...
...hits the ground.
Sergeant, switch off the lights, please.
All right, Sergeant, that's all.
All right, come on. Simmer down.
Come on, up.
It's possible that Rupert and his men will do the same thing to the Germans.
Confuse them, make them look over their shoulders...
...and launch an attack in the wrong direction.
Ten-hut!
- The crickets have been distributed.
- So I heard.
At ease!
You're as ready as we can make you.
This five-cent toy...
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.
It may save your life.
You're gonna be landing in the dark.
On the other side of that hedgerow...
...the fellow may not be wearing the same uniform you are. So...
...one click...
...is to be answered by two clicks.
And if you don't get that answering click...
...hit the dirt and open fire.
I repeat:
One click...
...must be answered by two clicks.
Now, hang on to this gimmick.
It's as important as your weapon.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear, sir.
All right. One more thing.
Your assignment tonight is strategic.
You can't give the enemy a break.
Send them to hell.
That is all.
London calling with messages
for our friends.
"Molasses tomorrow will
bring forth cognac."
"John has a long mustache."
I repeat:
"John has a long mustache."
"John has a long mustache!"
No, not yet...
Oh, my Lord!
"John has a long mustache."
Make any sense to you, mac?
As I said last night, they're code messages to the Resistance chaps.
Obviously, one message means something to one group...
...and another means something to another group.
"There is a fire at the travel agency."
I repeat:
"There is a fire at the travel agency."
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
I repeat:
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
The bridge... in forty-five minutes.
We'll be back.
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
I repeat:
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
"There is a fire at the travel agency."
The best hand I've had all night.
Let me see here...
Pardon me.
Pardon me, General... it's come!
Wait. Give that to me.
What's come?
It's the second part of the message.
The second verse.
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."
We can expect the invasion within 24 hours!
Put the Fifteenth Army on full alert.
Thank you.
You know, I'm too old a bunny to get very excited about all this.
Now... where was I...?
Oh yes, two spades!
It's almost impossible to believe.
Every dot represents a ship.
You got battlewagons, cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers.
You got assault craft of every size and every type.
The biggest armada the world's ever known.
Here.
You remember it.
Remember every bit of it.
We're on the eve of a day...
...that people will talk about long after we're dead and gone.
You wanna know something?
It gives me goose pimples just to be part of it.
You could call it one of them...
...crazy, quickie wartime marriages, you know?
Met at a dance at the USO and all that...
...but, I mean, I took it serious.
And so did she.
We didn't do it just for kicks.
- When did you get the letter?
- Week ago.
Two weeks.
Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her.
I mean, she's a high-class model and all, and I...
I'm not the kind of guy to get married that easy.
I mean, it wasn't no joke to me.
But oh, man, we really had some wonderful times together.
And you think she's got a boyfriend?
Well, she never actually said so...
I mean...
You think I was right?
I mean, was I fair?
She can't get one without your permission, right?
You gotta give your okay.
I know it's the law.
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.
Well, I guess I better be getting back to the outfit.
Good luck.
You too.
Who was that guy?
The one you was talking to so long?
I don't know, Sparrow.
I never saw him before in my life.
Happy birthday, General... from your staff!
Thank you.
Will you cut the cake, sir?
I trust you don't expect me to eat it, too!
What's that?
Dummkopf, that's the "V for victory" sign. Three dots and a dash.
Ain't you never heard
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?
Release point coming up, Major Howard.
Right, prepare for landing.
Cutting loose now.
Roger and out.
Major Howard, I cannot overestimate
the importance of your task.
The Orne River Bridge must be captured
before the enemy can destroy it.
It's a vital military artery, and the
enemy has prepared it for demolition.
It must be taken by surprise
and captured intact.
Your gliders will land at night,
without the benefit of ground support.
You will assault the garrison,
overwhelm it...
... and hold until relieved.
Hold until relieved.
Major Howard!
There's the bridge coming up.
Just on our left.
Right, link your arms.
Brace yourselves.
Feet up!
Hang on!
Smoke screen. Smoke.
Up the action, bucks!
Up the action, bucks!
Right, Tom.
Over the bridge.
Check for demolition charges!
Hello! Hello!
Clear.
It's working!
Where's the doc?
On the third glider.
There's no report from them.
Walsh.
Sir?
Tom, Ruskin and Royal have had it.
Take over.
On the other end of the bridge.
- What happened to you?
- Broke it on landing.
- Isn't the doc with you?
- No, he's missing.
We crashed in the river.
Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.
I'm all right, sir.
So are the boys.
- Okay, carry on.
- Right, sir. Come on!
Well, I'll be...
Hey, doc! Doc!
What are you doing there?
That's the German side.
Sir, anybody can make a mistake.
Sir?
The demolition charges have been removed. It's all clear.
Good. Corporal Smith.
Send out the success code words.
Keep sending until acknowledged.
- John, set up HQ in that pillbox.
- Right, sir.
All in less than 15 minutes.
Only a matter of time before they counterattack.
- What about the paratroopers?
- 7th Para might not get here for hours.
And Lovat and his commandos...
It could be midday before they get here.
The question is, how long can we hold?
Hold until relieved.
Hold until relieved.
It's raining again.
Thank you.
Did you get the list?
Gen. Schlieben of the 709th has already left for the war games.
The Commander of the 243rd left for Rennes at 18:00 hours.
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd... twelve officers in all.
Yes, I know.
The weather is bad, so everyone enjoys an extra night in Rennes.
I don't like it.
Any of it.
So many key officers are away at the same time.
I don't know why, but I don't like it.
But the war games have been scheduled for a week...
Yes, for tomorrow... not tonight.
Advise all officers who have not yet left for Rennes...
...to postpone their departure until tomorrow.
May I remind you, General...
...that the Allies have always landed in perfect weather conditions.
North Africa... Sicily... Italy...
Yes, and always at dawn!
We're 11 minutes from the green light.
Now, once more, I repeat:
If, for any reason, we fail to hit our drop zones...
...move north by east.
North by east.
The Germans have flooded large swamp areas behind the coast.
Avoid them if possible.
We came here to fight, not to swim.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear, sir.
How'd you make out?
How did you make out at the game?
I lost.
Now we're both jumping clean.
I understand. And when will the Field Marshal return?
I see. Oh, well.
Just a moment.
The radar report.
We are getting reports of strong radar interference...
...and radio reception is jammed.
I realize this has happened before, but never this effectively!
And the...
Call the OB West? Very well.
Give my respects to the Field
Marshal when he returns.
Bye, Rupert.
Do your duty for God, king, and your country.
Call for reinforcements!
We're under attack!
- Are we late?
- No, but...
...we must hurry!
What is it?
I'll go.
Stop!
We said, stop!
Stop, or I'll shoot!
What are you doing here?
I live in that farm.
Nobody lives in that farm.
- It's abandoned.
- Show me your papers.
Hurry up!
Come with me.
Go on!
Put your bicycle there.
Hans!
Hans, where are you?
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!
Who is with you? I want to know!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Good luck at the war games, General.
Anything important?
Communications reports difficulty in contacting our forward posts.
The Underground again!
Some sort of rubber dummies have been dropped by parachute.
Rubber dummies!
Connect me with General Richter!
We can expect commando raids and other diversionary tactics...
...but I don't like this idea of dummy parachutists.
Are you certain?
How many?
What do you think of it?
Paratroopers...
Put it over there.
This is what they dropped, they explode on contact with the earth.
In the dark, they look like soldiers.
Perhaps these are what General
Richter saw, not real paratroopers.
When you create a diversion, it's for a reason.
Connect me with General Pemsel!
Dummies...?!
Rubber dummies!
I agree with you, General.
I'll call you back.
What about my call to von Rundstedt?
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.
They wouldn't drop dummies...
...unless it was to divert our attention from something else.
In this weather?
In any kind of weather!
I must get in touch with OB West.
They're enemy paratroopers!
Blimey, mate...
...you'll wake up the whole blooming
German Army!
Fellas!
I'm hung up!
Fellas!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Where have you come from?
Awfully sorry, old man.
Simply landed here by accident.
What's that?
Sorry I startled you.
I'm trying to find my communion set.
Your what?
My communion set. I've lost it.
Now listen, padre.
We've got no time to look for...
I'm sure that it was here that I lost it.
We're under fire, padre.
Don't you think we ought to...
You go on, my boy. Go on.
I'm sure I shall only be a minute.
Cor! Stuff a grouse.
I've got it! I've got it!
Glory be.
Now, my son, let's go about God's work this night.
Pluskat.
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?
Nothing that I've heard...
The usual bombing, but quite distant.
Oh, yes, I can hear it.
Well, wait a minute.
Yes, just a moment.
Flares... but a long way up the coast.
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.
There's probably nothing to it...
...but we have had reports of paratrooper landings.
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.
Thank you, sir.
Higher! Higher!
Louis, open your store.
We need more buckets!
Mayor Renaud, you must come with me immediately.
- Is it important?
- Very important, Mayor Renaud.
What's wrong, madam?
I was on my way to the little house outside...
Suddenly, I saw a man fall from the sky.
- A parachutist?
- Yes, that's right.
He looked like a big white bird!
- British or German?
- What?
The parachutist... was he a friend or an enemy?
I don't know. He disappeared without a word. Just "Shh!"
- Without a word?
- Just "Shh!"
Bonjour, madame...
... je suis amêricain.
Bonjour, mademoiselle...
... je suis amêricain.
We seem to be circling.
Maybe they're having difficulty finding the drop zone.
Je suis...
... amêricain.
Je suis amêricain.
Voulez-vous...
... mademoiselle?
Okay.
Go!
Go!
Paratroopers!
Anything new?
Heavy bombing over
Cherbourg as usual, sir...
...and now near Caen.
The lines to Stations 6 and 8 have been cut...
...but the direct line is open.
I'll stay for a while.
- Would you like coffee?
- Yes, thank you.
For God's sakes, padre, stop that damn noise.
I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost.
Well, who ain't? Now, come on.
Two clicks.
I heard two clicks.
Man...
...am I glad to see you.
- You guys the 82nd?
- No. This is the 101.
Where's the 82nd?
Look, bud, we don't even know where our own outfit is.
Well, somebody's shooting at somebody.
Let's us go find this war.
Come on.
Maybe they're Limeys and ain't got no cricket.
They must be our guys.
Okay.
No.
Hey.
Hey, they were Germans.
Hundreds of planes have been flying to my left and right.
Toward Caen.
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula... something must be happening!
But what, Pluskat, what?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Has anything been observed on the beaches?
No... nothing.
Yes, I'll let you know right away.
Of course.
Are you positive that ankle's broken?
Compound fracture, sir.
Well, put the boot back on and lace it up...
...tight.
Don't get mad, I didn't break it.
And you're not walking on it.
- You're not going to try...
- Knock it off and do as you're told.
Yes?
A, B and C Company are scattered all over like we are.
Go on.
Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke his shoulder. I left him with a medic.
Any contact with F Company?
No, but they must be up ahead in the direction of Sainte-Mère-Eglise.
Well, go ahead. Tie it off.
Tie it off.
Well, here's where we are.
The northern edge of the swamp area...
...five miles from our drop zone.
Five miles.
- F Company?
- No, sir.
And we've got scouts all over the place.
We even picked up a group from the 101.
F Company were the first of the lead planes.
Well, give me a hand.
Can I have my rifle?
Well, we'll head out this way.
We ought to reach high ground and open country by daybreak.
All right. Have the men spread out...
...pick up any stragglers they can find.
- Pass the word.
- Right, sir.
All right, men, spread out.
Pick up stragglers you see.
Pass the word down.
All right...
...let's go.
From the latest reports, this is how I see it:
American paratroopers have landed...
British paratroopers...
The invasion...
Yes. Thank you, Pemsel.
General Pemsel is convinced that this is the invasion!
I do not agree with him.
This is my conclusion:
Normandy is the objective of a diversionary attack.
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.
It's not the main attack. That will come at the Pas-de-Calais...
...where it was always expected.
Where we always expected it!
But we can't take any chances.
I want the reserve panzers moved up at once!
We need approval from the
Führer's headquarters.
They wouldn't dare refuse me!
Call the Führer's headquarters and insist.
Insist that the panzers be released to me immediately!
An invasion of Normandy would be against all military logic.
It would really be against all logic...
Well, that about covers it, gentlemen.
Most of you have had your feet wet before:
Dunkirk, Dieppe, Norway.
And we know what it means to be driven into the sea.
In a few hours we're going back from the sea.
And this time we're going to stay.
There's no time for any sob stuff about...
...England, home and beauty.
Remember, our people have had a rough time for four and a half years.
They've earned the final victory.
Let's give it to them.
And to our French comrades in arms,
I say:
Good luck.
Tomorrow morning, we'll take them.
Come in, Teddy.
Did you have to put it in writing?
I knew you wouldn't let me go unless I did.
You're putting me on the spot.
- I didn't mean to, Tubby.
- The hell you didn't.
You put that request in writing, made it official.
You're the assistant division commander.
And that's why I'm supposed to go ashore in the first wave.
That's where I'm supposed to be.
You know that.
You're important to this operation.
We can't have you knocked off on the first day.
But that's not the real reason.
Isn't it because my father was president of the United States?
And a great president.
And a great soldier.
He led the charge of the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill.
So now you've got to be the first man ashore on Utah Beach.
But that's where I'm supposed to be,
Tubby. That's my job.
Also, I've been there side by side with the men all through training.
They're used to seeing where I belong.
They have a right to expect me there.
President's son or not.
Is my request denied?
No, you know it's not.
Request reluctantly approved.
Thanks, Tubby.
Thanks a lot.
Say...
...how's that arthritis of yours?
Arthritis?
Haven't had a touch in months.
Glad to hear it.
The street...
...the bridge...
...the hotel...
...the casino.
One more thing...
You have been fighting everywhere for four years...
...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete...
But this time you are going to fight on French soil...
...in our fields...
...in our villages...
...under the eyes of our own people.
The Führer took a sedative, I won't wake him for these reports.
First we hear that the paratroopers are shot down plane crews.
Next they are identified as mechanical dummies.
If paratroopers have landed...
...it can only be a commando raid.
Is that a sufficient reason to send the panzers to the coast?
I will submit all reports to the
Führer as soon as he awakens.
I understand.
Jodl has turned us down.
He will not release the panzers without the Führer's approval...
...and the Führer is still asleep!
Will you tell von Rundstedt?
No, not now...
Not now.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Sit down.
This is history!
We are living an historical moment.
We are going to lose the war...
...because the glorious Führer has taken a sleeping pill...
...and is not to be awakened.
It's unbelievable.
Think of it, Kurt.
Don't ever forget it.
We are witnessing something...
...which historians will always say is completely improbable...
...and yet it is true.
The Führer is not to be awakened!
I sometimes wonder whose side God is on.
Can I...
...bring you anything, sir?
In my room there is a bottle of excellent cognac...
...Napoleon, unopened.
I was even saving it for a fitting occasion.
This isn't exactly the right occasion, but get it anyway.
Daylight at last.
A whole night wasted again!
Where's my dog?
He was here a minute ago.
Let's have one last look.
Not even a seagull...
My God!
The invasion.
They're coming!
It's the invasion! There must be five thousand ships out there!
Get hold of yourself, Pluskat.
The enemy doesn't have even half that many.
Well dammit! Come and see for yourself, you fool!
It's amazing.
It's beyond belief.
My dear Pluskat, where are these ships heading?
Straight for me!
General, in exactly two minutes...
...the fleet will open fire.
Your attention, please.
The Admiral has an announcement.
Soon we shall be engaged in battle.
To drive the enemy out, we must fire on our homeland.
This is the price of liberty.
Long live France!
There he goes, right on time... as usual.
They're landing!
They're coming! They're coming!
I'm not crazy.
Look, they're landing!
The Americans, the English and the French!
Do you hear me? What's the matter with you? What's going on?
You must be deaf! Can't you...?
Dammit can't you hear it for yourself?
We're under fire. Yes, under fire!
Those five thousand ships you say the Allies haven't got...
...well, they've got them!
It's wonderful!
Yes? What is it now?
Listen to me, Pips.
The invasion has started!
Put yourself on alert at once!
What the hell can I do with only two planes?
Where are the others, you idiots?!
Priller, that's an order! Get ready at once! Understand?
If it isn't too much trouble...
...would you tell me where the invasion is?
Normandy! How delightful!
Thanks my faithful Hans.
That's the end for us! So long!
It's getting very difficult to get any sleep around here.
Your prospects for a long sleep are excellent. The invasion has begun.
We're flying there, the two of us.
Nobody else is left.
I don't think we're coming back.
The shelling has stopped.
Landing craft approaching.
Return to headquarters. Direct your troops from there!
Landing craft approaching the coast!
Those French bastards!
Sergeant!
Send this to headquarters by courier.
No! Take it yourself. Tell them our lines are cut!
Gentlemen, come here please.
There it is, men.
Omaha Beach, dead ahead.
Lock on the target!
Stand by!
Get off of the beach!
Let's go!
Come on, move up!
Hello, General, sir.
Are you all right, boy?
Yes, sir.
Don't you think you better go back and get your rifle?
Out there, sir?
You're almost sure to need it before this day is over.
Yes, sir.
Come on! Move on up! Let's go.
Medic!
Medic!
General, first reports from Omaha, sir.
"Assault teams have landed.
No direct radio contact, but destroyers report...
...first and second waves appear pinned down on the beach.
Concentrated artillery and mortar fire.
Third wave floundering."
Heavy casualties, sir.
When the mortars and machine guns are silenced...
...have the battalion commanders join me...
...over there.
Okay.
Hang on to that map case, Eddie.
I made it.
Hey, I made it.
Did you see me get those two guys?
Hey, Sergeant?
Sergeant?
As best as I can figure it, this is the wrong beach.
We're a mile and a quarter south of where we were supposed to land.
We should be up there.
Control boat must've been confused by the naval bombardment smoke.
I agree with you, but what will we do now?
Our reinforcements and heavy equipment will approach in a very few minutes.
- I know, I know.
- What if they land at the right beach?
The reinforcements will have to follow us wherever we are.
We're starting the war from right here.
- Head inland. We're going inland.
- Okay, let's go.
Follow me. Do everything I do!
All right. Let's go!
Head for home!
The Luftwaffe has had its great moment!
Stand by to beach.
Duncan, take care of that strongpoint.
Any minute now. Stand by!
Let's give it them back for Dunkirk!
You hear that? Dunkirk.
Do you hear it, Clough?
Sure he was at school at the time.
Come on, you bums!
Come out, you dirty slobs!
Flanagan's back!
The evil of it all. Drowning a man before he fights.
Oh, come on!
Keep those vehicles moving!
MP, chase out those cyclists.
Get off the beach! Move inland!
Come on, you lot!
Hurry it up.
Never mind the blathering!
We must put these down somewhere.
The sooner you get off the beach...
...the sooner they'll stop this blasted shelling.
It's very bad for the dog!
Down, Winston, down!
Beach Master Sword, Section 2-A.
Third wave ashore on time.
No obstruction to follow-up.
Standing by.
Get going!
For heaven's sake, get that carrier off the beach!
I was told I could transmit a newsflash on your radio.
If you can't drive it, carry it!
You were saying?
I was told I could transmit a newsflash on your...
My dear fellow, I don't want to appear uncooperative...
Yes, I know all about the power of the press.
But this line happens to be rather busy! Come on!
Down, Winston. Down, Winston.
What did he say?
The answer is no.
We have to use the damn pigeons.
I've got these ready.
Here, clip this on.
They're going the wrong way.
Not toward the Germans, you idiots!
The other way! The other way!
Damned traitors!
- Hold it.
- Can't you get your finger out?
What's the matter?
Engine won't start, sir.
Full of seawater, I think.
My old grandmother used to say...
...anything mechanical, give it a good bash.
Try it now.
Thank you, sir.
Off you go. Good luck.
I'm sure that got it out.
That's what I call a hell of a man!
Aye, I like his dog too.
Don't stand there yapping!
This isn't Hyde Park Corner!
The war's over there!
Come along!
Come on!
- Thank you.
- Everything's going according to plan.
Stand by to move.
Millin, "Blue Bonnet."
What in God's name...?
Oh, my friends. What a day!
What a day!
Welcome to France.
Welcome to Colleville!
Most kind of you.
Very nice to meet you...
Look at this. I kept it for you all.
But I don't think there will be enough for everyone.
Perhaps next time. We have a previous engagement: The war!
Mustn't lose that champagne!
All right, men, fall in!
Millin, "Blue Bonnet."
Goodbye.
Thank you, boys! Thank you!
Long live France!
Long live the Allies!
If you ask me, Flanagan...
...there's a lot of very peculiar blokes on this beach.
Welcome!
Welcome to you all!
Thank you, dear, they're lovely!
Better try them on first.
Rommel speaking.
Good morning.
What?
What!
Where?
Normandy!
Have they a foothold already?
They must be thrown back!
What about the panzer reserves?
Did von Rundstedt obtain their release from the Führer?
Normandy!
How stupid of me!
There it is.
You mean to tell me that's all we gotta climb?
They're not as high as the practice ones.
They wasn't shooting at us then.
Why can't the Air Force or Navy do this job?
The big guns in bunkers behind the cliff can't be seen from the air.
We knock them out or they'll murder our guys on the beach.
Yeah, well if you ask me...
...three grandmothers with brooms could sweep us off there...
...like flies off of a sugar cake.
That's it, the one we're after.
It's empty.
The Air Force and Navy really plastered this baby.
But I don't get...
The guns.
There ain't no mounts.
They've never even been installed.
You mean...
...we come up all this way...
...for nothing?
Don't worry, sarge, you'll be all right.
Medic! Medic!
I wonder what "bitte, bitte" means?
What the hell are you wearing a life preserver for?
I can't swim.
Normandy. It really is Normandy.
This is madness... madness... sheer madness!
I just talked to General Jodl... the Führer is awake.
I don't care if he's awake or not!
What about the reserve panzers?
The Führer went into one of his tantrums...
...and no one dared bring up the subject.
They're still held in reserve!
Yes, Field Marshal.
Sir, if you would call the Führer yourself...
...I am convinced he would respect your views.
Call him?
Call that Bohemian corporal?!
Crawl on my knees to him?!
No! It is out of the question!
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."
What's that?
Nothing... nothing of importance.
Here, let me help you.
You all right, Tom?
Come on, they're up there.
- Sir.
- Well?
Mr. Smith says to tell you he's stood his men too.
The Jerries are moving up into the woods...
...with machine guns and mortars.
- Tell the men to stand firm!
- Tell the chaps...
Tell them to expect another counterattack, a heavy one.
- Here you are, mate.
- Ta.
What's the matter?
Listen. I thought I heard bagpipes.
Don't be daft!
I told you I heard bagpipes!
It's the reinforcements.
It's Lovat!
Come on!
Come on!
- Sorry I'm late.
- Better than never, sir.
Glad to see you, Shimmy.
You boys are right on target.
What's the situation?
Jerry's regrouping in the woods, about a mile.
With mortars and machine guns.
Numbers?
No idea, Shimmy, but they seem to be moving forward in force.
In that case, we won't wait.
We'd better get moving.
All right, we're going across.
- Millin!
- Sir?
"Black Bear," sir.
All right, come on.
Everybody up!
On your feet!
There he goes. He's at it again.
Ever hear such a bleeding racket in all your life?
Yeah, it takes an Irishman to play the pipes.
Hold until relieved.
Hold until relieved.
North by east, north by east.
Sainte-Mère-Eglise is that way.
Somebody turned that sign around.
Doesn't anybody in this outfit look at a compass besides me?
Hey, you guys!
Over here! Over here!
Over here, on the double.
- Where you taking that?
- We don't know, sir.
We took the wrong road.
What do you got in here, ammo?
Yes, sir.
You 82nd?
No, sir, 101.
Well, you're in the 82nd now.
- But, sir, we're...
- But what?
Nothing, sir.
All right, move out.
- Knock that sign down!
- Yes, sir.
- Something's moving up there, colonel.
- Hit the dirt! Take cover.
Lieutenant Sheen, sir, A Company.
Colonel, it's me!
- Where did you come from?
- Sainte-Mère-Eglise.
We hold the main road and north side of the square.
The Germans have a battery on the other side of the town...
...and command the countryside.
- And Major Lance?
- Holed up in a building in the square.
- F Company?
They overshot the drop zone and landed in the middle of the town.
Go on.
It was a nightmare, sir. A slaughter.
They were mowed down before they hit the ground.
Major Lance sent me to try and contact you, sir.
He wants your permission to pull back and regroup outside of town.
No, damn it. We came here to take Sainte-Mère-Eglise.
We're gonna take it and hold it.
Follow the lieutenant, gentlemen.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
British and Canadians advancing steadily from Sword, Gold, and Juno.
Anything from Omaha?
Nothing since the first message:
Heavy fighting, heavy casualties.
Sir.
Omaha?
No.
I can't understand why Jerry hasn't brought his heavy armor into play.
All the panzer divisions except the 21 st...
...seem to be sitting it out in the rear.
Sir.
French commandos driving inland from Sword...
...have reached the outskirts of Ouistreham.
Ouistreham.
Fall back!
Take cover!
Tank support!
We must have tank support!
I can't get them!
Keep trying! We must have support!
Hold your positions...
I'm going for a tank!
Give us as much cover as you can!
Fire!
Try for the cannon!
Get the wounded out of here!
Go back!
Get out of here!
You can't stay here!
I am Mother Superior of the convent.
The sisters are qualified nurses.
But Madame... I mean, Mother, we're in the middle of a battle!
Take care of the wounded.
It's a tank!
It's Kieffer!
In the other direction!
Clear away the debris! Hurry!
But where is the Luftwaffe?!
I'm trying...
Yeah, yeah, you're trying.
The British troops have a beachhead here. They are moving inland.
The Americans hold Ste-Mère-Eglise and have cut the highway.
We control this center section.
The Americans have landed but their attack has bogged down.
Rommel is right...
If we can hold them on the beaches...
...the invasion will collapse.
That thing still work?
Yes, sir, now and then.
- Anything from the other beaches?
- Not directly.
A while ago the sergeant picked up some flashes from the destroyers.
The 4th Division is off Utah Beach and moving inland.
Inland?
- What about the 1 st Division?
- They're hung up, sir.
Like we are.
Move out.
- What do you think?
- Think?
We must have close to a thousand casualties up to now.
Do you want me to have the ships start picking us up?
- You think it's that bad?
- I don't see what else to do.
We can't get up this hill.
If we don't get off this beach, we won't have any division left.
What?
These are our men, Tom.
You think we brought them in so some die and ask the rest to turn tail?
Hell, no.
We're gonna get up that hill.
Find me somebody to speak for the Rangers.
Back down the beach on the right there's a gully.
With a heavily defended roadblock and machine gun nests on both sides.
- If we can blow our way through...
- We've hit it three times.
- We didn't get close.
- Three times isn't enough.
We're gonna hit it again.
Can you find me some engineers?
They're all around you!
I mean engineers with equipment still working.
Then I shouldn't radio the ships?
No, damn it!
We need bangalore torpedoes, bazookas, mortars, wire cutters...
...and every man that can stand.
Pass the word, will you?
Okay, Norm.
Now listen to me, all of you.
You guys got to snap out of it.
We're getting off of here, and we're going inland.
What about weapons, General?
My men lost everything.
They gotta have something to fight with.
Strip the dead and the wounded.
Pick up anything that'll shoot.
I don't have to tell you the score, you all know it.
Only two kinds of people are gonna stay on this beach:
Those that are already dead and those that will die. Get off your butts!
You guys are the fighting 29th!
I've looked at the naval reports.
Yes?
According to reports from the offshore destroyers, Omaha is a shambles.
There's no evidence...
To quote the report exactly:
"There is no evidence of any movement that can be observed off the beach."
I'd better have a look through these.
How is Ike taking it?
Like everybody else, sir.
Hanging on by his fingernails.
No, no! We must regroup according to Plan Six!
Can you hear me?
I said we must regroup according to Plan Six.
Nonsense!
If the panzers arrive, we still have time to use them.
We'll drive to the coast!
Shall we remove the files?
I don't care! I want to get to the front at once... to Normandy!
Yes, General.
- Where is everybody?
- What?
I said, where is everybody?
I can't hear you.
It's them bells.
I've had them in my ears for 10 hours.
Ding-dong, ding-dong.
Hey, Sergeant, where's Major Lance?
We moved the CP to that building. The major's there.
Get him, the colonel's here.
What?
Hold it!
Colonel, am I glad to see you!
Those bodies. Get those bodies down.
Why are you leaving them up there?
Get them down!
But we've been under fire, sir.
I know you have, but I don't care!
Get them down! Down!
- I don't want those boys left there.
- Take a detail and cut them down.
- At once!
- Yes, sir.
Has there been a linkup between our forces and the troops from the sea?
I don't know, Major. I don't even know if the landings took place.
But I am sure we're gonna hold this town until the linkup does come.
Whenever that is, today, tomorrow, till hell freezes over.
For their sake, if for no other reason.
Show me the enemy positions.
Well, sir, the Germans' strong point is right there.
That's over there on the hill.
They've got no tanks yet.
They've got heavy guns and machine gun positions at the top of that road.
How many men have you got?
Not enough.
Lt. Wilson will take A Company and reinforce Major Lance.
The rest of the command will follow us straight up that road.
Good luck, Major.
All right, A Company, fall out.
- Private.
- Yes, sir.
It's a helluva war.
It's a privilege to serve with you, colonel.
Well, God willing, we'll do what we came here to do.
Ready, sir.
Move out!
The old man sure has changed since yesterday.
Or maybe it's just that we've changed...
...since yesterday.
Lovat and his commandos have reached the bridge.
Bob, did you hear?
Yes, I heard.
"Sainte-Mère-Eglise captured by units of the 82nd Airborne."
"101 Airborne driving on Utah."
That's good. Good.
Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.
We'll have two cut-off beachheads, one in British zone and one at Utah.
Yes...
...and the Germans in between.
You guys engineers?
Yes, sir. 299th.
Where are your officers?
Who's in charge here?
I guess I am, sir.
None of our officers made it in.
What about your equipment?
Those torpedoes work?
Yes, sir, we'll make them work!
- What's your name, Sergeant?
- It's Fuller, sir, John H.
You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on, whether you like it or not.
You send some men down to the foot of that gully with those torpedoes.
You and the rest of the men follow me.
Yes, sir!
All right, men!
Let's move that equipment down here.
- I got a rifle, sir.
- Well, good for you, son!
The Rangers are ready, General.
Okay, Major, move them out.
Captain, move them up.
Move them up!
- Well, Tom?
- We're ready.
As ready as we'll ever be.
It'll work. It's got to work.
We're getting murdered here! We might as well move inland and get murdered!
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.
You're gonna blow that roadblock for me.
When I give the word everything pops at once. Okay?
Yes, sir.
First, we gotta blow a hole through that wire with bangalores.
If that works, we'll pack everything we've got into that wall.
All right, let's go!
All right, let's go! Go! Go!
We must leave. The main highway is under aerial attack.
You don't say!
Don't worry, Yank.
He's dead.
Give me a cigarette.
I'm dying for a cigarette.
You hurt bad?
Shot down during the night.
He was gonna make sure of me, but I got him...
...with this.
You ever killed a man?
I mean, face to face?
No.
Neither had I, face to face.
I've been sitting here looking at him.
Have you noticed anything peculiar about him?
No.
He's got his boots...
...on the wrong feet.
He must have been in a big hurry, huh?
Is it bad?
Split wide open...
...from the crotch to the knee.
A medic came along and gave me a shot of morphine.
I hope he'll be back before it wears off.
He said he would.
Did he sew you up?
Well, when he came to shore he lost most of his equipment.
So he pinned it together...
...with safety pins.
Getting on toward night.
You know something?
I haven't fired my gun all day.
I keep hearing shooting, but every time I get there, everybody's gone.
Funny, isn't it?
He's dead.
I'm crippled.
You're lost.
I suppose it's always like that.
I mean war.
I wonder who won.
Okay, run me up the hill, son.
The Round-Up
Pest Buda.
The 1860's.
The industrial revolution, enrichment...
The age of Ferenc Deák, Gyula Andrássy,
Kálmán Tisza.
The spirit of 1848 is no more than a phrase,
only the welfare of the bourgeoisie is important.
The people have lived the same way for centuries.
Indeed, the lean years, following one after another,
from the middle of the '60's, have increased their destitution.
Criminal cases are multiplying,
as are the desperate attempts
by those born in poverty to break free.
The regime is pitiless.
It seeks the outlaws and highwaymen everywhere.
They are the last vestige of active resistance.
They are criminals in the eyes of officials,
they are freedom fighters in folk songs.
In 1869 Count Gedeon Raday was appointed Commissar
with a specific sphere of authority.
His task - to create material security.
His main target - the outlaws.
He wasn't particular about his methods.
- Is it them?
- Yes.
- Your husband and your son?
- Yes.
Please come with me.
Stop here.
- Do you have any relatives?
- Yes.
- Parents?
- Yes.
Don't be surprised if they never see you again.
- I won't.
- Won't you?
- No.
- Why not?
You people don't really like my kind.
I speak four languages and I've often been abroad.
You smuggled in Kossuth's papers in those days.
- I was young.
- Yes, you were young.
You may go now.
Line up!
All in order.
- Bring them closer.
- Come closer!
- Any hard cases?
- Yes.
Which one?
- That one.
- Any more?
And that one with the cape.
- The short black cape?
- Yes.
Let's go.
- Are you János Gajdor?
- I am.
Come over here.
Are you a farmer?
Yes, I am. I have three farms.
Are you a self-seeker?
- That's what they say.
- A clever man?
They say so.
Do you know whether in your area there are any renowned herdsmen?
There are.
- Shepherds?
- Those too.
Who, for instance?
The Kecsege Szûcs family, the Ferde Balogs, Kis Balogs...
- Kis Balogs?
- Yes.
Did you know the Kis Balogs?
- I know them.
- I didn't ask if you know them.
- I asked if you knew them.
- I knew them.
Well, the Kis Balogs are dead.
They were strangled.
They were renowned shepherds.
Renowned and wealthy, too.
- Wealthy.
- Did they have quality sheep?
Yes.
A lot of their sheep vanished.
Renowned sheep, quality sheep.
Do you know how they were strangled?
- No. No, I don't.
- With a halter.
With this halter.
Don't you recognise it?
- No.
- Take it in your hand.
- Are you frightened of it?
- No.
Seeing you've taken it, put it around your neck.
Men were killed with it.
You're not frightened of it?
- No.
- Didn't you kill them?
No, no. I don't kill people.
I'm self-seeking, but I don't kill people.
- You're not frightened, then?
- No.
Then keep it around your neck and tie a bow.
I can do that.
- Finished?
- Yes.
Good.
You may go. Take him away.
Please, stop.
Come here, János Gajdor.
Go inside.
- I killed them.
- Come on.
Do you know the penalty for killing them?
I do.
Ease your conscience, have you killed others apart from them?
Yes, I have. But not many.
Who and what?
Would you tell me?
For your conscience and maybe your fate.
Well, I've killed... three other people.
- Three?
- Yes.
Gabor Telkes in '61, then two years later,
Palkó János Czeder.
Then, in '66...
No, in '67, Feri Csulak.
- This Feri Csulak...
- We know who he was.
Maybe it doesn't count that I killed him.
Maybe.
I don't know.
So, János Gajdor, there is a solution for you.
If, at the earthworks, you find anyone more guilty than you... someone who killed more people... then you'll be pardoned.
We won't hang you.
So the terms are that you find such a man.
- Understand?
- Yes.
- Will you undertake it?
- Well...
I must.
All right, you may leave.
One, two, one, two...
Halt! Rope down. Follow me.
Let's go. Faster.
Come here.
Open them again.
Good day.
Please...
That one is such a person.
Open up!
Out! Stand straight!
Leave him. What's your name?
You know it. Varjú.
Of course. Béla. Béla Varjú.
You've had many a beating from me, haven't you?
You're going back to the big yard, understand?
You may thank this man.
- Why? Don't you know him?
- I know him.
- Well? What did I say?
- Thank you.
Not like that, with respect.
Is that enough? If you want, he'll even kiss your hand.
Let's go.
You, too.
Come here.
Take off his shackles.
Go back to your friends.
Get going!
Do you have any friends?
No, nor relatives at a time like this.
I should have kissed your hand, János.
You mean, the bishop's, my son.
You can't imagine what it was like in there.
You can't endure it.
I couldn't have if you hadn't intervened.
I have a lot to thank you for.
How did you get here?
- They caught me.
- Why weren't you careful?
- They caught you, too.
- Did someone squeal?
Maybe.
Was there any evidence against you?
Or any action?
Well?
You're not here for nothing.
What did you do?
Listen... they questioned me a lot and I said nothing.
Why are you inquiring about this?
Do you still remember the old songs, Béla?
Leave me alone.
Stop! Come back from there.
They'll shoot you.
Don't you understand?
Stand over there.
You come with me.
You... and you.
You... and you.
No, you. You come here.
You, too. Hurry up!
Well, let's go.
You're coming with us.
Let's go.
Come here!
Put it down there.
That's right, there.
And you people, put those down there.
And you, too. Over here.
You may go. Move back.
Go on, go on.
Come here.
Women, go further back. Even further.
Stop. Stop!
Shoot in the air. Fire!
- Come back.
- If he doesn't stop, shoot!
Come on, Béla Varjú.
Pick two friends to accompany you.
Ease your conscience, Béla.
Why don't you do it?
Confess. Who did you kill?
- Six people.
- Who? Tell me, who!
- Six people.
- The names. Say the names.
- Köves Kovács, Pista Kis, Kenyér.
- And?
Józsi Kenyér.
More, more!
Tell me about the other two.
Their names. At least say their names.
Józsi Kenyér.
Excuse me, officer.
Stand aside. Step back.
Demote him.
Take him away.
Come on.
Sir, please exonerate me, and save me from the gallows.
Because the man you just executed has killed more people.
When I went with him to the gallows he admitted to six.
Look, János Gajdor... everyone should have the brains to relate the confession of a dead man.
It's your life that we're talking about.
If you could tell me exactly who he killed, then maybe we could find out.
The trouble is he only told me of three.
After that his strength gave out.
Then he started to get really scared.
Well, you see, János Gajdor, that doesn't help you at all.
It's as if you heard nothing.
Just go back.
Go on.
Don't upset yourself.
You must get used to it.
We'll have to be redeemed one day, some way, some other way.
Why don't you speak?
They're impossible, and yet I'd have given them a farm.
They're as hard as nails.
Haven't you tried them out?
They used to let you go.
Three calves and I could go.
The next time, another three.
Now they're hard.
Come on. Let's see our friends.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Come on. Let's take a walk.
I know you.
That's possible.
You've escorted me.
One escorts many people.
- Aren't you from the lower regions?
- No.
- Are you from Szeged?
- No.
- They say I'm Veszelka.
- Veszelka?
Yes, they say I'm him, that I killed an officer and took his place.
Before, they said he was dead.
Now they say that I'm him.
- Can you understand it?
- No.
If I can't prove I'm not him, they'll hang me.
Yet this Veszelka has killed many.
- At least seven.
- Seven!
I'll be absolved. Seven!
- This man has killed...
- Go to hell!
Come here. Let's go.
Excuse me...
- I know you.
- But I don't.
Get away from here.
- Excuse me...
- Come on.
Stop.
Yes.
Wait outside.
Sir, this convict wants to say something important.
- Go on.
- Excuse me...
- I was told to find...
- Yes, I know.
If you'd allow me to go around and look...
- Now?
- Now.
It should be done now, among the solitary ones.
Take him.
Open the cells.
- Show this man out.
- Have you found Veszelka?
It's not him. Please...
Let's go.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Let's go.
Line up. You too.
Sir, they're assembled.
You stop here.
You go ahead.
So, he's not here. Let's go back.
Stop.
- Don't put the lamps out.
- Yes, sir.
Stand against the wall.
Come here.
We're going back.
Everyone, stand up. In line.
Stand up in line again. Hurry up.
What are you waiting for?
Get back. Hurry up!
Let's go.
- Excuse me...
- Stay there.
You are lmre Veszelka.
You are intelligent and clever.
We're not asking you to find anyone.
We're not asking you for any names.
Just tell us how many of Sándor's men we've caught.
You...
Come with me.
Halt!
Attention!
Turn around!
Five steps forward!
Women stay there.
Stop there.
Excuse me...
You know, Veszelka's killed more people than I have.
Therefore I'm absolved.
And Veszelka has been found.
- Take off his hood.
- Right.
Go over towards that row.
Stop.
Come here.
Help him.
Walk along here.
Know anyone here?
- No.
- Then walk along again.
Put that down.
Go on.
Come here.
- Know anyone now?
- No.
Excuse me! I know someone who belongs to Sándor's gang.
Juli!
Run!
One... two...
Come on.
Sit down.
Hoods off!
Come on.
- Stop it!
- Don't!
Restore order.
Everyone settle down.
Hear me?
Form a square.
Let's go, let's go. Faster.
Move it. Let's go!
Bring that man over here.
Come here.
Which one of them is Sándor?
Sir, he's not here.
Sándor is not at the earthworks.
Had he been here,
I'd have reported it long ago.
Are you certain of that?
It's in my interests.
So you're quite certain he's not at the earthworks?
He's not.
But if you like,
I'll find out where he is.
The girl has died.
You're to find someone who belongs to Sándor's gang. Clear?
- Yes, Sir.
- You help him.
Go to hell!
Excuse me...
I'm frightened. Please protect me.
We'll protect you.
Sit down over there.
Hand out the provisions.
Sir, they usually get it in their cells.
Now they'll get it here.
Over to the wall.
Sit in groups of five.
Come on, hurry up... Sit down.
One... two... three... five...
Come to the front.
Three...
Hurry up.
Go to the front.
Let's go.
You hurry, too.
Sit down.
Escort that man up.
Put him in that one.
In cell number two.
Bring him out.
- They've strangled him.
- That's obvious.
Which two cells did we leave open last night?
- Apart from Gajdor's?
- Of course.
This one... and that one.
You...
- Are you Mihály Lovas Sr?
- Mihály Kabai Lovas.
- Did you leave your cell today?
- No.
No?
Right. Go over there.
- Mihály Kabai Lovas Jr?
- Yes.
- Did you leave your cell?
- No.
No. Right. Come inside.
We left two cell doors open last night.
It was either one or both of you.
Who killed him?
I asked, who killed him?
- Not me.
- Not me.
Right.
Both of you should be hanged.
But we'll only hang one.
One man for another.
Think about who killed János Gajdor.
Come back.
You, too.
Was it you?
- No.
- No.
Right.
So you won't admit it.
What I said will happen.
We'll hang one of you.
Choose.
Is Sándor here?
- No.
- Is Sándor here?
No.
Right. Go inside and think about if he's here or not.
Close the door.
Father, do you know Sándor?
- You know him too.
- I don't.
You do. You've seen him.
You've seen him often.
Is he inside here?
- No.
- Are you certain?
- Yes.
- Come outside.
You stay here.
I'd like to say something, please.
I'll show you who Sándor is, if you will pardon me.
If you pardon both of us.
All right.
If you show me Sándor,
I'll pardon both of you.
- Do you want their hoods off?
- That's not necessary.
Found him?
Show me.
- So, is it him?
- Yes.
He was very brave in '48.
His gang joined Kossuth's with Sándor as captain.
It was reported to him once that two of his gang had attacked a merchant and assaulted his wife.
Sándor summoned the two men.
He waited for them with his pistol loaded.
When the two lads appeared,
Sándor shot them.
Then he shouted loudly,
"That's outlaw's honour!"
They never stole while they were Kossuth's soldiers.
How do you know Sándor?
He came out to the field in '67, he even spoke to me.
He visited us last year.
I served the wine.
I saw him this year, too.
That's not Sándor.
You know it, too.
Sándor is not here.
Take him away.
Come on.
- Go inside.
- Excuse me...
I strangled that man.
Come out.
Repeat it.
- I killed him.
- You're both lying.
You're lying. Both of you.
Both of you should be hanged.
But I stand by what I said.
Only one.
Choose.
- This is the longer one.
- Please...
Please...
I'll tell you who killed him.
- So it wasn't you.
- No, sir.
I just opened the door.
I opened it, waited till he did it, then I went back.
My son didn't leave his cell all night.
All right.
Come and show me who it was.
It's him.
Well?
I killed him.
How?
His son came to my cell during the night.
He opened it, took my place, waited until I'd done it, then he locked me in.
So it wasn't him?
You're all lying.
Take them away.
Stand there.
- The chains.
- Men, the chains.
Turn your backs.
Stand up.
Kabai, stand up. Don't you hear?
Hear that? It's music.
Put it down here.
Put it next to it in a row.
Put that down, too.
Boots, over here.
Company, halt.
Get undressed.
You may rest.
Warden, sir...
- Well?
- I'd like to have a wash.
Hear that, Józsi?
He wants to wash.
What about the rest of you?
That's enough, Torma.
Maybe you'd care to report.
I humbly report... two guards and three prisoners.
Why are you people still here?
There were no other orders.
Everyone must join up.
- But they are hard cases.
- Even the hard cases.
They're part of Sándor's gang.
Even so, everyone must. Let's go.
Let's go.
Wait here.
- I humbly report...
- Bring them here.
- Name?
- Mihály Kabai Lovas Jr.
- Ever been a soldier?
- No.
- And you?
- I was, sir. In '48.
- Where did you serve?
- With the rebels.
- Were you a rebel?
- I was in the cavalry.
Sir, I was also a cavalry rebel.
That's rare.
You still have the skills?
It's not possible to forget, sir.
I've never witnessed it.
Would you show me?
- If you have the horses.
- We do.
- Any choice?
- Yes.
- Saddlery, too?
- Whatever you like. Come on.
Help yourselves.
This one. I don't need a saddle.
Stop! Give that to me.
Stop!
Stop it.
Give it to them.
That was beautiful, my friend.
You're an expert.
Would you form a corps like that?
A cavalry troop?
Yes, but I don't want him in it.
- Are they all from there?
- Yes, the earthworks.
- Everyone here?
- Yes.
- Any sick?
- No.
Go ahead.
Let's go.
Line up at the back.
Come on.
Are they all here?
There are more.
Are they all the former ones?
Yes, they are.
- Are they all alive?
- No.
At the time, many died in Damjanich's army.
And since then, at the earthworks, too.
Imre Veszelka.
But those who are alive... are they all here?
Yes.
Line up according to height.
You, too.
- So, now they're all here.
- Sándor is still missing.
- He won't come, anyway.
- Of course, he will.
- If we asked him, he will.
- No need!
Sir, I humbly report the troops are assembled.
Men... from the Commander-in-Chief...
His Majesty Ferenc József I,
Emperor of Austria, by the grace of God,
Apostolic King of Hungary, pardons Sándor, the leader, in his absence.
Lajos Kossuth sent a message
That his regiment is spent
If he sends that message again
We must all go
Long live Hungarian liberty!
Long live our homeland!
The rest of the troop will get their just punishment.
Bon soir, Ann-Marie
- How's it going
- bon soir
Some turnout this evening, eh?
...you know, really...
...no, listen, it's true. I tell you,
I've met you before, you must believe me...
...not at all...
...it'd be a pleasure...
Alan, it's for you...
Sandra, you're an angel!
Sandra! You grow more ravishing...
Don't be silly...
Would you like a drink?
...thank you...
...nothing - fortunately I have a good character...
...because otherwise you'd be bored, now...
...ah, Andrew!...
You're leaving tomorrow?
Yes, tomorrow
Darling, something wrong?
It's the music
Shall we go closer?
- Thank you
- Good luck, Sandra, dear
- Good luck in America
- Bon voyage
Good night
Good night, Sandra, bon voyage
- Good evening, thank you very much
- Thank you, good night
Bon voyage, Andrew
Have a nice trip. Good night
I'm dead... absolutely dead!
So am I
And we have to get away early in the morning
Everyone seemed to enjoy the party
So it seemed... what a mob
- You liked it?
- Yes
Want a scotch?
- A sip - Have some of mine
Thank you
Good night
Thanks for everything
Let's get some sleep
Fosca - hang on a minute
Do you think we'll be there in a half hour?
Maybe less
Good. Fosca, we'll be there within the half hour
Yes
I hope you'll recognize me
Yes
I'll see to them when we get there
She says there are two telegrams
From your brother?
No. He phoned from London.
They're from Florence
Father's side of the family
Thanks, goodbye
So you'll meet only our old maid, and relatives even I don't know
See the terraces?
We've arrived!
Here is the San Francesco Gate
The sea is down there
Look!
The old Etruscan wall
We're here, Fosca!
I'm coming
You look fine, Fosca.
All in order?
The house yes, but the garden...
I'll see later
This is my husband,
Andrew Dawdson
- Good evening
- Good evening
- So you're Fosca
- Yes, sir
No, thank you, it's not necessary, I can...
This way, please
Pleasant trip?
The best, thank you
Signora...
Was I right to prepare the guest room?
Magnificent!
Excuse me, would you give these to the Signora?
Certainly
But first I must bring up the bags
May I help you?
No, I'll bring up only what we need for the next few days
You're leaving so soon?
In a couple of days
Signorino Gianni comes and goes...
...like the wind too
He comes to Volterra?
Of course
Not as with Signora Sandra.
We see him often, particularly of late
Last year he was even here for Easter
Don't be stupid
He was in London last Easter
Couldn't come to our wedding. Remember?
It's true
Yes, I even spoke to him on the phone
But I know he was here for Easter
Came on Good Friday and stayed a month
He was here when they took madame to Palagione
Before that too?
Both before and after
He comes often
Didn't you know?
No, I had no idea
I've never been informed
Sandra, this house is a marvel, a jewel.
I didn't expect...
It is like a museum
But excuse me, I'm forgetting
I must bring up our bags
I'll see to it at once
And what about Signor Gilardini?
He sent you those flowers, didn't you see?
He didn't want to upset you on arrival
He'll tell you about madame tomorrow
I've visited her several times at the clinic
But not at the villa
He says the doctors object
They treat her well.
Private nurse
Fornari's son, who is now Dr. Zanutti's assistant...
...visits her almost every day
But he thinks she was better off at the clinic
All that isolation
You can go now, Fosca
I've prepared the drawing room, signora
Would you like me to sleep in?
What if those from Florence...?
No. No one is coming from Florence
Sandra! Look here!
Look! Come now, smile.
Stop teasing me, please
Come and sit down
Much better
You'll laugh, Sandra
I got lost on my way back
This is the strangest house
Like you in a way
No, no, don't say that!
All right
I'm not sure it's a compliment
I meant it to be
Then let's stay here...
... forever and ever
Well... I... I...
See, you're worried
Poor Andrew
A compliment, you say?
Are you sure?
What do you mean?
Don't evade. It's better to keep silent
Anyway I made you laugh
Forgive my moodiness
It's those telegrams
I don't understand...
But why speak of it?
Let's take a look at the garden
It's pitch black out there
There are lights we can switch on
I'll get a wrap
As you wish
Not that way, that wing's been closed off for years
Mother's apartment -- closed ever since she was taken ill
I understand
I'd like you...
...to go there with me tomorrow
Of course
Come now
Sandra, I thought
I saw someone
Sorry to disappoint you, but we haven't any ghosts
"From a Nazi rage, he was torn away, to the studies of life, and his loved ones"
Sandra...
Gianni!
Gianni! What are you doing here?
Does Forsca know?
Forsca's always been my accomplice
They're not coming
Who?
Father's relatives
They wired from Florence
They're senile and can't travel
No, they want nothing to do with us
Mother's fault.
Can you blame them?
I'm Sandra's brother,
Gianni
I thought so.
Pleased you could make it
You see, he came
Is this the bust to be dedicated?
I must get a closer look at the inscription
I must go in the house and change
Gianni...
I've come to do my duty, then I'm leaving this house
I understand you
You'd better learn some things about me
What are these papers?
Forsca told you that
I come here often?
Yes, that was a great surprise to me
Your husband will feel we desert him
What's his name, by the way?
Andrew? Here!
He's a nice chap
I was telling Sandra...
Isn't that a snap judgment on your part?
First impressions are what count with me
Is Sandra a good wife?
She used to be disorganised, lazy
That's Sandra - a disorganised lazybones
I thought marriage might change her
Hope she gave you fair warning
She told me all
Stop it, Gianni!
What are all these papers?
Receipts for what I've sold
I often need money
I can't live on the pittance
Gilardini doles out
Hasn't Sandra told you?
I've chosen a difficult calling
She said you have many interests
Meaning none. True, I used to be like that
Then I started writing for certain papers
Oh, trivial society stuff - not serious
But I made a discovery -
I love to write
So I started a novel
My editor likes it...
Really?
Story of my adolescence
Are you serious?
See, she never had any faith in her brother
Wait till I'm rich and famous
But unfortunately that day's far off
So, when I'm broke...
...I come back here
Haven't you noticed?
Silver missing, fewer pictures
All this belongs to
Sandra and me, you know
I admit I have no right, but I owe a lot
I'll pay you back, Sandra.
With interest
I think you did right
Does Gilardini know about this?
Of course. He thinks you do too
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Didn't want to worry you
Tell me why I should live like a pauper run down to mother's place every time I need money?
We must decide, Sandra
Tomorrow our garden becomes a park dedicated to father's memory
So at least someone will enjoy it
But what about the house?
Is it to crumble away?
We can't afford another such gift
Let's sell the furnishings and rent if selling upsets you
Have you a serious proposal?
Just that... I want your consent
Sandra, wait, Sandra...
You're angry
If I've done anything to annoy you, please forgive me
I don't like you undressing in front of me
Very well
Quite correct, Sandra
I beg your pardon... excuse me one moment
Aren't you going to offer a drink?
There's nothing in the house
That's like Forsca.
Never thinks of it
We'll go for supplies and drop in at the bar
Been there?
I've not been anywhere
She wants to keep you shut up.
But you rebel, don't you?
How stupid you talk,
Gianni
Get out, both of you
I want to stay here and get some rest
Then we'll all stay
No, please go and I'll go to bed
You can't do that
We've a thousand things to talk over, and you want to sleep!
The thousand things will keep till morning, when I'm rested, calm
Please order wine when you're out
And try to come in quietly
I might wake you
No, you won't disturb me
I'll sleep in my old bed
I don't like the guest room
Over the centuries, landslides have been burying this ancient town
All attempts to prevent them have proved futile
Over there stands
San Giusto
Volterra is the only town I know condemned to die of disease... like most human beings
No! Be careful
Slides occur even down here
This is Camaldoli Abbey
The monks had to leave for fear of being buried alive
Here's the church of San Giusto --
16th Century at its best
I'm sorry.
The town is beautiful but I'm absentminded.
Do you know I'm very much in love with your sister?
Glad to hear it
She has spoken of you and the family
For me, however, Sandra was born when we met in Geneva
She had a job as interpreter where I worked
Was she good?
She showed great courage during our investigation of Auschwitz
Particularly with survivors who had been imprisoned with your father
Before we started the inquiry I thought
I knew everything about your sister... but during this inquiry about a man - a stranger to me and also practically to his own daughter...
I came to realize I didn't know Sandra at all
Have you been in love?
It happens
Then you too have felt this sudden curiosity... this desire to know all about a loved one
It's a curiosity that doesn't last
One loves a woman for what she is, not for what she was or will be
I used to think that too, but not now
Tell me about your sister
Her life here
Her first love or loves?
I wouldn't dream of asking that
What then?
I want to know about her life here
I'm a foreigner. Everything is so different in my country
Provincial life is the same everywhere
The same unbelievable boredom
Unbelievable when you're away, real the moment you return.
Maybe even after 100 years
Want a drink?
A beer
Good evening, sir. Welcome home
Thanks. How are you?
Not bad. Is Signora Sandra back too?
Yes, this is her husband,
Andrew Dawdson
A pleasure
Mariella, two beers, and send some whiskey to the palazza
Yes, sir
Andrew, a surprise! Your wife's first Volterra lover
Don't look yet
He's the son of our agent
For love of Sandra he studied and became a doctor
He's Dr. Zanutti's assistant
Care to meet him?
Pietro! You're looking well
Come here, please
I want you to meet Mr. Dawdson,
Sandra's husband
Good evening, pleased to meet you
Most lucky of mortals, the man who wed my sister
Where is Sandra?
Well, we're back.
This is it, isn't it?
Yes, go on in,
I'll close up
- Do you remember where the room is?
- Of course.
How glad I am that you could come
You've grown more beautiful
Thank you
Tomorrow's my father's birthday
We've been kept waiting over a half-hour.
This is too much
I won't promise anything, but
I'll speak to the major
- It seems the lady is late,
Your Honor. - This wedding?
They've been waiting since ten
Do you mind? It'll only take a few minutes
I've never know a wife to keep one waiting this long
Your Honor, my sister
- Good day
- Good day
- Do you know the notary?
- Yes I know everybody.
Here is the deed of gift.
Please read it
Senor Gilardini has consented
All is in order
I'm tired of warming the bridegroom's chair
What are you up to really?
What do you want of me?
What do you want of me
Why have you come here to humiliate me?
Four years, and you glide in here like a snake
You take advantage because I'm ill
But I'll tell Antonio you came to insult me. He'll punish you!
We can now turn to the signing of the documents
We are indebted to you above all for the gardens and adjoining land
From tomorrow, a park... dedicated to the memory of your illustrious father
In the name of our town, I express our profound thanks... for this generous gift
You're afraid
You don't want to know the truth about your father
You've got his
Jewish blood in your veins
You're corrupt just as he was you with your rottenness your secret vices
We think this is the best way to express our love for our father... this will testify to his tragic fate
Everything is in order, sir
You've seen mother?
We've finished, Your Honor
Dedication tomorrow
I warn you in advance that
I'm a poor speaker, but I'll do my best
Till tomorrow then
Good bye
I was looking for you
What do you think you are doing?
Your duty is to ask my permission for any visit
You came here to justify yourself because...
I asked him
You've been complaining about your mother's treatment...
Saying I took her from the clinic...
...not for her good...
No one says that
Oh, yes they do
I don't want any scandal, but there comes a time when one must speak plainly.
Good
Wouldn't it be better to talk this over later?
Gianni's right
We'll talk calmly another time, another place
Calmly
Not lose our temper... or we might live to regret it
Maybe they did try to explain to us... at the time
But now I know... I'm sure
They DID denounce father
When news of his death came through, mother refused to see Gilardini, and then tried to forget in the arms of other lovers
What more proof do you need?
But she married him, Gilardini
Later!... Later!...
Gilardini knew how to wait
He knew that despite her lovers... her gestures... her frantic goings and comings... she'd end by giving in to him
Yet it was only after she was ill that they married
He installed himself as head of this house
Said we needed disciplining...
Took over our education
Before it was a governess...
We were always taught at home
Now Gianni was to go to boarding school in Florence
And I to convent school
He couldn't bear our criticism
That's easily understood
Gianni wrote mother immediately saying he'd die rather than go to boarding school
He actually took some veronal... bluffing suicide...
And I... I egged him on
It's not normal for children to play such degenerate, vengeful games
But our was not a normal atmosphere
Gilardini was always taunting Gianni about that mock suicide
He still speaks of it as a scandal
Anyway, Gianni won
Mother interceded, he went to school here
We stopped speaking in
Gilardini's presence
This led to a new game...
We found great fun
We communicated by messages...
Deposited in secret places
Shall I show you?
Show me
Come
You see, in a place such as this...
Or in this Etruscan vase, for instance
Wasn't it a rather morbid game?
Morbid?
I don't think so
Where else?
Come
Sometimes we hid them here
You see?
And sometimes in mother's room in this Cupid and Psyche clock
What's that?
A note
"Most urgent!
"Your faithful slave awaits you...
"at the water tower
"Make sure you're not followed"
It can't be so urgent after all these years
All these years?
What are you thinking,
Andrew?
Nothing
Do you know who was the "faithful slave"?
It was Pietro
Our agent's son
He loved me and
Gianni protected us
We couldn't meet openly... would have caused... a scandal at home
Yes, Gianni told me
What else did he say?
That provincial life seems unreal when you're away...
But when you return, even after many years... you're thrown back into it
I don't want that to happen to you, Sandra
It's been almost 20 years
As to your mother, consider her present condition
Besides, I'm not convinced
What you told me proves nothing
Your hostility towards your step-father is only natural... a normal reaction
Sandra, darling, I want to get you away from here
You're jealous of phantoms
Yes, I'm jealous, I feel a strange force... a force that's trying to separate us... and I'm afraid
But I love you... you know I love you
Sandra...
The signora is resting
- I'm going out
- Very well, sir
Gianni? Gianni!
Gianni - where are you?
You've kept me waiting
Are you sure no one followed you?
No
But I warn you, Gianni,
Andrew found the note
Did he
Why make me come here?
To prove... something
You want to say...?
So many things!
I wanted to say them last night, but your door...
It was you!
Yes
Did you lock it to keep out your husband?
Poor chap. I thought you were happy with him
But I am happy with him.
Look, let's go back to the house, we can talk there
This is our house
It was once
It isn't any more
What do you want?
Will you lend it to me?
Just today
No! No!
You're crazy!
You're mad, mad, mad!
Give it back to me at once!
No! This evening
Reprehensible!
You're irresponsible!
Leaving me to face mother alone
Two monsters... monsters, my children...
yes, my children...
He was always hiding there, behind the door
What am I to say?
Are my children monsters?
My enemies?
Don't speak of it
I'll only hate you
Remember the first time we went down there?
The wind banged the door shut, and you were so scared...
We thought no one would let us out
You cared about me then
I still do, Sandra, I swear it
- It's in mother's room
- What is?
The novel
Read it and you'll understand everything
Don't you believe me?
You'll know why I don't want to hear of your visit to mother
Why I can't talk about it
I've freed myself from some things forever
I don't want to involve you needlessly
You seem an intelligent, decent man
Please listen to me...
I would like to ask a favor
Take from me the administration of Sandra's and Gianni's inheritance
I want nothing more to do with their affairs
I never want to see them again
I'm sorry, but...
Signor Gilardini, weren't you going to the house with a lawyer today?
You could talk to Gianni and Sandra
No! I won't set foot in that house!
What I've gone through for that family!
But for me, every cent would be gone
And what would've become of that poor lady, their mother... if I hadn't looked after her?
I'll continue to take care of her, despite limited means and without help from anyone
You must talk to Gianni and Sandra.
These misunderstandings -
Misunderstandings?
You're joking
You think I don't hear their insinuations?
Please, Mr. Gilardini...
It's the fault of their upbringing
I was wrong... wrong to give in
Sandra told me about it
- Really?
- Yes
Gianni's difficult adolescence
The fake suicide... the anxiety
Such things often happen
Not so often
I think so
That affair of
Sandra's, too
All water under the bridge now
Poor Dr. Fornari
Mr. Dawdson, more than loving Sandra, he actually worshipped her
Sandra at 16 - already a raving beauty... socially high above him
Yes, I can well understand the mother's opposition, the small town gossip
No. The real trouble that ravaged my wife's family was something quite different
What?
Can't you tell me?
Well... nothing to say?
Is what I've written so terrible?
Has anyone else seen this?
My editor
When it's published...
It won't be published
Why not?
Are you taking it personally?
Try to remember... this is fiction that I've written, fantasy
No one will believe that it's fantasy
You mean a few lazy louts from around here?
Why worry about them?
Why be ashamed of a sin we've not committed?
You're a real bourgeois, Sandra
I don't care what they say.
If they criticise what we did,
I'll shock them.
Can't you see their faces when they come to this?
"My desire grew...
I hurled myself on my sister's body...
as if to destroy mine enemy
No intimacy could satisfy..."
Good writing, eh?
Stop it! You're disgusting!
What do you want?
How much to destroy it?
How much?
This is priceless
Shall I sacrifice money and success too?
Judging by your reaction...
I'm on the threshold of a successful career
All right. How much?
Can I ask you something?
You want my book destroyed?
It would be a weapon in the hands of our enemies
Only that?
And because of this
Why have you avoided me?
You ask that when you didn't even come to my wedding?
Look, Sandra...
A strange thing happened to me then
I went into convulsions... like a romantic hero
As a child, did I...?
No one here remembers
I became frightened and ran
In all the years since we separated
I had scarcely given you a thought
A new life, the past shattered
I wanted to see, to know everything to travel... fall in love
I loved... many women... so many they have no importance
This I realized the day you wrote of your coming marriage
It all came back to me then...
Our talks... our silences... my anguishes, anxieties...
Walks on the terraces, sleepless nights
How happy I was with you...
Even in childhood before passion is known
Only you can understand me, help me
You know the fright of solitude... of returning memory...
A sound... a voice... a colour
I sought to record all these
But the child has felt passion
Has grown up... has grown beyond innocence
I can't help you
Stay with me a little longer
No, I can't
Gianni, among mother's letters
I found one of your letters... a child's letter
You were only 8 or 9
Mother was off on one of her concert tours
You wrote...
"Dear mother
"I'm glad you arrived in Vienna
"Sandra and I have done our excercises
"I haven't been able to sail the little boat
"I've been too busy in my garden"
When mother returned from Vienna she brought presents
- Remember?
- Yes
Yes
Andrew...
Andrew!
I've invited Mr. Gilardini and Dr. Fornari for dinner tonight
Try to be pleasant
Your husband is right about Gilardini
Bury the hatchet
Sandra, please be nice to them
A relief to all
Those bulbs needed changing, now it's easier to see
Sandra...
Something to drink?
This is better than neon.
The curse of neon!
Is it used much in America?
In offices, bars
In better places, candles are the rage
I understand
Did you know that light has certain clinical effects?
Red, for instance, is an aphrodisiac
No, I never heard that
Good evening, Sandra
I'm sorry I can't stay, I'm on hospital duty tonight
You must eat first
Insist, Sandra
You can't say no to Sandra
Yes, I must -- even to her
I simply can't stay
This is the end of the world.
He doesn't love you any more.
No matter
Good evening. How are you?
Good evening
Darling, what's wrong?
Nothing
It's my fault
She's cross with me
Thinks I'm a lousy writer
Shouldn't have shown her my book
It's not bad, really
And I'm happy tonight, for
I've found the title
"Vaghe Stelle Dell'Orsa"
By Leopardi. Know it?
No
Of course. Perfect!
"Beautiful Stars of Ursa Major"
"Did I return only to lose myself in you...
"shining high o'er our garden...
"To whisper to you from the windows...
"of my childhood...
"where all happiness ended"
- Mr. Gilardini is here
- Show him in
Good evening
- Good evening, Mr. Gilardini
- Good evening, Mr. Dawdson
I swore I'd never enter this house again, Sandra
You see, I'm frank with you
You husband has been so understanding, so generous
He insisted so that...
Well, here I am. Can't we let bygones be bygones?
- Hi, Gianni
- Hi
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please
I'm sorry, Sandra, I'm late and must run
You're so funny, Pietro, you never change
Not at all
She defends you as always
Sandra, I invited the doctor here after a talk with... Mr...
- Gilardini
- Yes, excuse me, Mr. Gilardini
- Water?
- Yes, please
Mr. Gilardini will not oppose your mother's return to the clinic
I talked to Pietro about that
We all know his opinion
You think I turned him into
Excuse me, Mr. Gilardini, let me speak for myself
I've told you I think the clinic preferable... even though the villa has comforts... not available at the clinic.
Sandra,
I propose some special therapy for that sick woman
A new method of treating your mother
Mr. Gilardini consented to this approach after visiting her this morning
Yes
Your mother has been insisting all day on attending the dedication tomorrow
She understands
Moreover...
She now seems to remember, when before she was completely blank
- Right, Doctor?
- Yes
You're not bringing mother to the ceremony?!
I know you. To play it safe you'd stuff her with sedatives
What do you mean?
What are you saying?
Exactly what I said
Please, Sandra...
We're here to try to agree... not to quarrel again
Agree! You heard her.
I know what's hatching... in that hostile, merciless brain of hers
- Isn't that right, dear?
- Yes
If anyone tries to help you you draw back... become evasive, hard... aggressive!
Mr. Gilardini
What is this truth you want to expose?
I know all about the one you seek to conceal
Do you know what you're doing?
I'll tell you
Please...
You're accusing your mother and me of a horrible crime... to maintain your innocence... to hide the filth we've tried to cover like cats purring over their own excrement
To hell with you and your rottenness!
Mr. Gilardini... please.
Please, wait
Wait! You can't leave like this
I've got to know!
Yes, yes, speak!
Speak right out!
Think I care!
I've no one
Not even you
Yes, he too
How can HE help you?
Have you told him how many times
I've gotten you out of trouble?
I can prove it
I could put your knight-errant behind bars
Maybe I will
He with his treats of suicide, boasts of hereditary taint, incestuous love!
Is it a joke?
What do you want?
Look at me!
Answer him!
Talk!
I've nothing to say
Answer him! You dirty swine!
No! Don't!
Enough
Enough! Leave me alone! Please!
Please! Oh, please don't hurt him!
No, no, no! Let him alone!
Let him alone.
Let him alone!
Let him alone
Don't you believe me?
Trust me? Have you no faith?
I had faith in the woman
I married
I want to go on believing
I'm ashamed
These shadows. This shifting of ashes of a dead past, these doubts...
You don't mean you...?
I'm sorry, I have nothing more to say
Ah, but I have
When Gianni and I went separate ways
I felt deserted, alone in a hostile world...
I was desperate
Yes, when he wrote begging me to rejoin him,
I refused
Why
Because of lies, because gossip and slander... had cast a shadow over our relationship
We had nothing to reproach ourselves for
We would've been proud to have the world know... the true nature of our bond...
A passionate loyalty... to father's memory... to our race
Sandra...
For you, as well as me, this past must be blotted out, nonexistent
We must leave together. Now!
No
How can we go on together after this?
We've nothing to say to each other
My poor dear
No...
You don't dare say what you think
And I'm tired of repeating again and again
I quite understand, you know
You so want to believe
Yet those doubts.
"They say at Volterra..."
No, we cannot go on Andrew. No
You must go, and I shall remain here... forgetting nothing
I'll do my penance
I don't know how to forget
And I don't ask forgiveness, for I forgive no one
Sandra
Andrew's gone
A fine exit
See? He's not at your side when you need him
The star exits... the play is ended
Poor Sandra. What now?
Will you go running after him with a leash?
Listen to me
We stay here together
Those intervening years, they didn't exist
Anyway, stay a few days then decide
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Why?
Because I have guts to say what you only think?
I speak the truth!
You know it
Then face it
You disgust me!
You know I'm right. You don't believe yourself
You're like the one who becomes a nun not out of faith, but unrequited love
Sick with desire they mortify their flesh for pleasure... and turn on those who won't share their guilt
You were wretched, alone
In order to identify with me... you went to the concentration camps, relived father's calvary... hid your love for me under the mask of self-sacrifice... persecuted a poor, sick woman... let your husband go
I may be cynical, corrupt... but I'm capable of the grand gesture
I've burned my book for you, Sandra
You're lovely, so lovely
We must be as we were before
Help me! Stay with me!
Don't leave me! Don't go!
You can't leave me again
I beg you!
I burned my book
I did. If you go, I'll kill myself
I'll kill myself!
This time I mean it, not like before
If you go I'm done for, finished
Look
I've prepared everything, right here
Here, you see? You don't believe me? You'll see!
You'll see!
To me you're already dead, Gianni
"Dear Sandal,
"I leave for Rome, then New York
"Need I say that my waiting period begins?
"I ask nothing. I know you need to be alone
"For me, the past is but a time for choosing the future
"May the choice you make bring you to me
"Soon, darling -- Andrew"
"Sandra -
"I'm alone, wretched
Waiting, waiting for you
"Can't you overcome your revulsion?
"I am at the bottom of the pit
"In the blackest hell one can imagine
"I'm frightened, so frightened
"Don't abandon me!
-- Gianni"
I'm frightened. So frightened
I don't want to die
Help! Help me,
I don't want to die
Help
Help...
Help, help
Help, I don't want...
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die
Sandra...
Sandra...
I remember so well that
April evening in 1942
"My hope is yours, Andrew
"You've put me to the test.
I've not betrayed your trust
"We'll be together soon
"Free from phantoms and remorse
"Love, Sandra"
I think we can begin the ceremony
Excuse me
Place it here
"From a Nazi rage, he was torn away, to the studies of life, and his loved ones"
Ladies and gentlemen
This is the first official tribute to our town's great scientist
Good day
Forsca, tell Gianni I've gone ahead to the ceremony. It's late
Very well
Signorino. Signorino Gianni...
Sir...
...for his achievements, his genius
It is not difficult to recall the image of
Emanuele Wald Luzzati
Doctor! Doctor!
Signorino Gianni - he's not in his room!
Have you looked everywhere?
The bath...?
Only his bedroom
Let's have a look
No, he's not here
Look, that door's open!
No, Tosca
God bless the soul of
Emanuele Wald Luzzati...
...at rest with those of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
May the lord welcome him... and may his soul awake on the
Day of Resurrection together with all the Righteous
For it is written in the
Prophet Isaiah:
"Your dead shall rise, shall live again"
You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy!
The dew of light and earth shall again fall upon thy loved ones and the earth will revive the spirits of the dead
Seek thy consolation in the Lord,
O thou survivors
For Thy mercy and justice, we thank Thee, O Lord!
Let us say thank you and goodbye. Amen!

- Sì, americano.
Ah! Pilota!
Party, inward... turn!
Party... flag!
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God to take unto himself...
...the soul of our dear brother here departed...
...we therefore commit his body to the ground.
Uno, due, tre!
Detail, outward... turn!
Detail... quick march!
Major Fincham, will you now please dismiss your men? Please.
- Where is your commandant?
- As I told you, Major Battaglia is indisposed.
His orders are to disperse immediately after the funeral.
- Major Fincham, please.
- Get that Fascist bastard out here!
Grazie.
- You'd better follow me, please, Colonel.
- Thanks, pal.
What are they celebrating out there?
Signor maggiore.
Ryan, Joseph L.
United States Army Air Corps. 0718359.
Don't you salute senior officers in your army, Major?
- Are you the official interpreter?
- Yes, sir.
- Then interpret exactly. Clear?
- Yes, sir.
And add this: No wonder Italy's losing the war, with officers like him.
Well?
Battaglia! Battaglia!
Battaglia! Battaglia!
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!
Battaglia! Battaglia!
We have today buried our commanding officer...
...Colonel Brian David Lockart!
The purpose of this parade is to bear witness to his death...
...and charge the man responsible for it!
Major Battaglia!
The Ninth Fusiliers now formally charge you with the murder of Colonel Lockart!
Come forward and meet your accusers!
Sì, signor maggiore.
Battaglia! Battaglia!
Follow me, please.
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!
Major Fincham, unless you dismiss your men now, it will be out of my hands.
- That swine hasn't the guts.
- You have left him no choice.
You've shot one of my men!
He's fainted, sir. It's Ransom.
One of those from hospital.
Dismiss.
Parade... dismiss!
Captain Stein! One moment.
This is Colonel Ryan.
He needs your attention too.
- American.
- Army Air Corps.
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we still beating them in Sicily?
We took Messina three days ago.
- Are you reporting for sick parade, Sergeant?
- No, sir.
I'm still trying to get what my boys have needed all along.
I'm afraid I still have the same answer for you: There isn't any.
Easy, fellas. Easy.
Over here, Colonel.
The stool will do.
- Looks like you got a full house.
- And getting fuller, I'm afraid.
- What's the matter with these men?
- Malaria, scurvy.
Made worse by malnutrition.
- I've only alcohol for a disinfectant.
- Go right ahead, Doc.
How come you can't control the malaria with drugs?
The Eyeties make no mepacrine.
The Eyeties grow food.
Get extra rations for your sick.
And clean up some of this filth.
And perhaps get 'em some clean uniforms.
Our diet and filth are Battaglia's punishment for escape attempts.
He's taken our soap and razors, turned off our shower baths...
...issued us with no uniforms or Red Cross parcels, and kept us on half rations.
But he can't break us, and he can't stop us trying to escape.
Even with the way the war is going for us now?
Are you suggesting we should knuckle under?
If that's what it takes, yes.
Liberation can only be a few weeks away.
Did you hear the colonel's suggestion, fellas?
What do you think?
Well... meanin' no disrespect to him, sir...
...I'd say the colonel ought to muck off, sir.
I can't expect you to understand this, but these men belong to the Ninth Fusiliers.
This regiment fought with Mariborough in 1704...
...with Wellington against Napoleon, and in the Crimea.
These men are all volunteers, professionals, and they've come to fight a war.
It may come as news to you, Major, but that's why we're all here.
Yes, but each in his different way. You ought to know that. You're a professional.
Negative. I'm what they call at home a 90-day wonder.
- I'm an airplane driver. My business is flying.
- Ours is soldiering.
OK, clue me. Suppose you do rig an escape.
How many men do you figure to get clear?
- Colonel Ryan, if one gets out, it's a victory.
- Sure it is.
Can somebody show me where I bunk?
- Sergeant Major.
- Sir?
- Escort Colonel Ryan to his quarters.
- Yes, sir.
We dine at six, sir.
- Major.
- This way, Colonel.
Sergeant Bostick, sir. 113th Tank Division.
This is Corporal Giannini, and Private Ames.
The reason we didn't say anything to you in the sickbay, we wanted to get you alone.
They've all gone to mess.
- Are you cold, son?
- It's that damn malaria.
Don't knock it, Bostick. You ever have it,
Colonel? The fever makes you dream.
And, man, what dreams!
You know what I mean, sir?
- No. What?
- Well, they...
Hey. He's pretty sharp, huh?
You're a welcome sight, sir.
We need an American officer real bad.
- How many of us are there?
- Eight. We've lost two.
And if we don't get some decent grub and medicine, that's gonna double and triple.
That's tough. From what I've seen, everybody's in the same boat.
Sure, because the guys running it are section eight.
Those stir-crazy limey officers are trying to fight the war from in here.
They got so many tunnels dug, you could fall into one.
- You expect me to keep them from digging?
- You got the rank for it, sir.
Don't get us wrong, sir. Nobody's here to defend Battaglia. He's a two-bit Mussolini.
But if they'd let up, he would too.
With Sicily gone, our guys will come through
Italy like shoe polish through a tin horn.
All we gotta do is get healthy, sit tight and wait.
These people have been here for two years.
I just got here. I need time to check this out.
Not too long. Please, sir.
Three of my boys are just about gone now.
Colonel Ryan, this is Captain Costanzo, our regimental chaplain.
- Lieutenant Orde.
- Lieutenant.
- Delighted, Colonel Ryan.
- Please sit down. Sorry I kept you waiting.
Colonel Lockart always sat here.
I'll be fine right here. Thank you.
Major, if you don't mind talking about it, how did your colonel buy it?
He struck Battaglia with his stick.
Do you see that sweatbox there?
Colonel Lockart died in there last night.
Which makes you the senior officer of this camp.
My regiment will await your orders.
It's still your regiment, Major.
Thank you, sir.
It's made from pumpkins, you know.
Just a little different, don't you think?
We couldn't help noticing where you sat, Colonel.
It took 200 years to make officers like those. It took me 90 days.
- They're nuts, sir.
- It's their ball game.
- We're still shut out.
- We did as good with a sergeant.
Now we got us a bird colonel.
A bird colonel outranks a birdbrain. Clear?
- Anything else, Sergeant?
- No, sir.
Bird is right. Chicken.
OK, OK. Now we know we're on our own.
- Do you feel up to a bit of running, sir?
- Running?
Dodging the lights, I mean.
It's pretty important.
- What the hell is this?
- Earth, sir, from the tunnel.
We reckon the barracks ceiling can hold two tons of it if we spread it around right.
Sorry to ask you to make this trip, but I thought you ought to be here.
Your countrymen were caught trying to steal supplies.
- What supplies, Major?
- Escape rations. See for yourself.
These men are thieves.
But since they're Americans,
I wanted your approval to punish them.
- What's your side?
- My boys need things from those parcels, sir.
- Food. And more important, mepacrine.
- That true, Major?
Perfectly. But these men are thieves and should be punished.
Negative. These men are sick. You've also got
50 men in sickbay with the same disease.
- What the hell are you doing about that?
- War produces casualties, Colonel.
Everyone in camp's been exposed to malaria.
The only way a man has a chance of escape is for him to have mepacrine to keep him going.
Forget the punishment, Major. Bostick, get these men outta here. See me later.
- My boys are sick, sir.
- Out.
- Major, move those parcels to the sickbay.
- What did you say?
- That's a direct order.
- Damn your direct order!
I'm the ranking officer here. You'll deliver those parcels tonight. Is that clear, mister?
You'd better know what you're doing, unless you want a mutiny on your hands.
Mutiny in the Ninth Fusiliers?
Wellington and Mariborough would spin in their graves, Major, what?
321 present, 83 in hospital,
404 men present or accounted for.
- You may dismiss.
- If you don't mind, Captain...
...l'm assuming command as senior officer of the camp.
That is, of course, between you.
I will inform Major Battaglia.
I'd rather do that personally.
Will you take me to him?
Rest the men, Major, but keep them here.
Stand at... ease!
Stand easy.
Avanti!
My major warns you that he has no patience left with the prisoners.
By taking command, you have become personally responsible for their actions.
Good.
And tell him that, from now on, things will be much more different than they've been.
You have made a good impression on the major.
- But he warns you against trying to trick him.
- Never. Of course not.
Ask the major to come with me now. I'll prove how different things'll be around this camp.
What in heaven's name is he doing?
What does it look like?
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan, you can't do this.
You can't do this to anyone.
- I'm glad you could join us, Major.
- If you betray us, you'll pay for it.
You're just in time to watch. Have the men turn about face so they can watch too. Major?
Sergeant Bostick, rip up that shower floor.
Parade... about... turn!
All right. Now hear this.
While I'm in command, anyone attempting to escape will be held for court martial.
Clear?
Stand steady on parade!
You'll get the Nazi Iron Cross for this, Von Ryan!
By order of the commandant, the showers will be turned on at 1200 hours.
Razors will be provided and delousing powder issued.
Beginning tonight, Red Cross parcels will be distributed once a week.
- You may dismiss the parade.
- Not so fast, Captain.
What about the clothing in the Red Cross parcels in that storage house?
I advise you to forget this matter.
Sure, because Battaglia's got a black market going in Red Cross clothes. Right?
You tell this man I trusted him as a gentleman. I want those clothes.
I'm sorry. The major says he cannot issue... wine.
Wine? Who the hell said anything about wine? I'm talking about clothes.
It's for your own good, Colonel.
You let yourself be bought pretty cheaply, didn't you?
Louse powder and hot water? Hah!
- Orde, dismiss the men.
- I'll tell you when to dismiss, Lieutenant.
Bostick, tear the door off that bathhouse, and use anything else you might need.
Right, sir.
Major Fincham, you will give an order for the men to strip.
Strip. Understand? Naked.
Parade... strip.
Now take off all of those rags. All of them!
And, Major, that goes for the officers as well.
Pass thatjunk from the rear to the front of the line and throw it in the fire!
Captain Costanzo, I said strip.
Sir, I take being a member of the cloth literally.
I bow to your convictions, Captain.
- Here comes II Duce!
- Attention!
The major feels the fire should be put out at once.
Tell him we have no firefighting equipment.
- He says you are no gentleman, Colonel.
- Only by an act of Congress.
Now what about the clothing?
The prisoners will be issued clothing,
Colonel Ryan.
But you, sir, I'm afraid, must follow me.
Good show, Colonel!
Major Fincham!
You may dismiss when ready.
We made it, Colonel. Our guys landed at Salerno. Italy's surrendered.
That's great. Just great.
Yeah. Our guys are ready to shove off, but these limeys back here are giving us trouble.
Hello, sir. Are you all right?
Could you come right away? There's trouble.
- There are no guards.
- They bolted during the night.
Major Fincham took Battaglia prisoner.
He's court-martialling him.
Let the regimental records show Captain
Stein appearing as defending officer...
...Lieutenant Orde as prosecuting officer.
Major Fincham presiding.
If the court pleases.
- Colonel Ryan, this is no affair of yours.
- I'm still the senior officer in this camp.
We're holding a summary court martial exactly according to regulations.
What happens when you find him guilty, according to regulations?
- He will be hanged.
- That'll be murder. He's now a civilian.
No, sir. We're still at war, and the enemy is still the enemy.
I say hang him!
Major, release this man.
Oriani, get him outta here.
The parade will stand at ease!
The major begs me to say that...
...he never meant you harm.
It was Mussolini and his Fascists who forced him to be harsh.
Now it's all finished for Italy.
Let the killing be finished too.
You want your revenge with this?
I wantjustice.
Not only for Colonel Lockart and the other dead, but for those of us who are still alive.
We're 200 miles behind the lines.
I say not only military justice but military sense dictates we cannot turn this man loose.
- Aye!
- There's a better way, Major.
- You all wantjustice?
-  Yes!
Then do to him what he did to your colonel.
Put him in a sweatbox to rot.
- No!
- Yes!
You fool.
- You soft-headed, sentimental fool.
- That's privilege of rank, Major.
Damn your rank. If letting that scum live costs the life of one of my men, I promise...
Scatter! Hit the deck! Hit the deck!
He pinpointed us. We'd better move quick.
- Brilliant, Colonel. Where?
- We're a day's march from the coast.
- I could contact your navy.
- Move 400 men in daylight? You're mad.
- I'll lead you.
- Why should you?
You think you hate the Germans more than I do?
- It's worth a chance.
- I don't trust the Eyeties.
But I'm in command here and I say we move - now.
Halt!
German convoy! Everybody down!
Those ruins could hide a thousand men.
Let them rest there for the night while I go ahead and contact the ships.
How much farther to the coast?
Five... perhaps six miles.
I should be back well before dawn.
That's as pretty a place for a trap as I've ever seen.
Good luck, Oriani. We'll be waiting for you. Now let's go.
Kamerad.
Face it, Yank.
Your little Eyetie chum has deserted us.
We're left in a box.
Colonel!
Something's moving!
Out! Out!
Germans! Scatter!
Scatter! Scatter! Come on!
OK. Now.
Hold it. Hold it!
Colonel Ryan, Major Fincham, Captain Stein and Costanzo, Lieutenant Orde - the front car.
I'm a doctor. I stay with the wounded.
They will remain behind so we can care for them properly. Get aboard, gentlemen.
That little Eyetie bastard Oriani led us to the railhead and turned us in.
It was that pig who betrayed us!
I'll kill you!
They've cared for our wounded properly now.
The poor bastards.
Just cos you let Battaglia live!
You'll get your Iron Cross now, Von Ryan.
Hey, the roads are full of Germans.
It means we must still be headed north.
You can bet on it, Yank. Von Ryan's got us all a one-way ticket to the Fatherland.
- Yeah!
- Aw, blow it out your barracks bag, mate.
Listen, I'll take you on any time you like!
We are coming in to Rome.
I am Major von Klement, now in command of this prison train.
You will be in my charge until we reach the final destination.
You have now 30 minutes for rest, relief, and there is food and water for all.
Major von Klement?
Captain Oriani is an Italian officer. He's not a prisoner of war. He doesn't belong with us.
I have my orders.
Heil Hitler.
The guards are on top again.
They're not needed here as far as we're concerned.
No chance of our tunnelling through this coop, Von Ryan.
Say, Doc, you got a knife in that manicuring kit of yours?
Are you planning to snip your way through it?
No.
I'm planning to tunnel my way through it.
Do you mind, Major?
No, no, Colonel, wait. Wait until... until the wheels hit cross tracks.
It will cover the sound of the wood breaking.
It's impossible to get out while we are moving.
- And when we stop, the guards will patrol.
- If it's dark when we stop, I'll risk it.
- What about the rest? If one goes, we all go.
- Do we, now? Mind telling me how?
- We'll have to eliminate the guards.
- Brilliant!
They have machine pistols and we have bare hands.
If we could take one gun from one guard...
Oriani?
Turn around.
Go on. Just turn around.
Learn that from the cowboy films, did you?
You got a better idea?
It would take you too long to strangle a man, Colonel Ryan.
The average Nazi would get impatient while you were doing it.
Orde.
The knots smash his larynx, the knee breaks his back. He's dead in 15 seconds.
Thug garrotte - India.
All right, then. Now what's your scheme?
If you haven't the guts for it, I'll do it.
We're stopping again.
Something must have gone wrong.
- Perhaps they've been caught.
- Take it easy, Padre.
- There's a station up ahead.
- Wait.
- Someone might be watching.
- It's a chance we'll take.
The guards are on this side.
Open the door on that side.
- What kind of insanity...
- Knock it off.
- Get the men on the roof right away.
- Right, sir.
If you fail, the Germans won't have to kill you. I will.
Shut up.
Shh. Shh.
Bostick, you follow me with half the men.
Dunbar, spread out with the rest. Move. Quiet.
Let's turn 'em loose.
- Can we get moving?
- The engineer's alive but not the fireman.
- I can stoke the boiler, sir.
- Get Oriani up with the engineer.
- Send the chaplain and the doctor here.
- Yes, sir. Get those bodies in the boxcar!
Get this stiff in the boxcar.
Get those bods in quick!
Move, you people! Come on, move!
Ten more minutes... Of all the luck!
He'll have to stop for water, same as we did.
By the time he gets goin' we'll be miles away.
Damn thing's right behind us.
Can you bring him around? We'll need him.
Come on. Come on!
All the comforts of home.
Please. I am Italian.
I have done nothing. Please.
- What on earth are you doing here, my child?
- Padre, you're priceless.
Don't you think she ought to get dressed while we discuss it?
He's right. Go on, girl. No one will hurt you.
Now, about some questions, Major.
- May I rise?
- Of course.
I will answer no questions, Herr Oberst.
Major... All your guards are dead.
We're running this train now.
I want the schedule of when and where we're gonna get that food you promised us. Clear?
- Florence at 0600 hours.
- And what happens in Florence?
The train will stop in the rail complex and the prisoners can dismount.
Colonel Ryan! Colonel, look!
Looks like we're headed for Innsbruck.
What do these circles mean, Major?
I am to receive instructions in those cities from the dispatchers. I, myself. No one else.
Did you receive those instructions through that radio there?
- No. It is a simple commercial radio.
- All right. Over there.
Lieutenant, if he wiggles, put a hole in him.
- They're keeping pace with us.
- A German troop train is on this schedule.
Gentlemen, you have been very daring.
Yet what have you gained?
In Florence, other troops are waiting.
You have been brave.
If you now wish to be sensible, I will see that you are treated with respect in Florence.
We had a sample of your Nazi respect when we boarded this train.
- Still, you have no choice.
- And nothing to lose by trying to make one.
Von Klement's identification papers and railroad priority, good as far as Florence.
- You do very well with German, Padre.
- I studied in Germany.
I went to Breslau after Oxford.
Would the dispatcher in Florence recognise the major by sight?
- He'd be an Italian, wouldn't he?
- Of course! Under German supervision.
- And I think you're lying.
- I'd say, with the country in such a flap...
...the chances that the dispatcher will ask for identification is pretty small.
Will ask whom? I mean, you just said just now...
- Yes. It'll just have to be the chance we take.
- You are extremely foolish!
- Quite right.
- Oh, no. But I...
But... look at this picture!
I don't look remotely like this chap.
No, no. I won't do it.
I won't do it. Absolutely not.
- Heil Hitler!
- That's better. Now let's see you walk.
- It won't work, you know.
- Yes, it will. Let's see you walk.
Put some style into it. Hand on your hip.
The Boche have style.
Slap your gloves against your leg.
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler.
Gut. Sehr gut.
I think you had him goin' there, vicar.
You all set?
Yes, sir. I came over the tops of the cars to check. 14 of our guys are stationed as guards.
The rest of the uniforms were too bloody.
- Did you get rid of the bodies?
- While we were passing over the last bridge.
The lieutenant wants our men down from the top of the train, to be fed first.
If they get down, we're dead.
They can't speak German.
We've had it.
Crikey! Ain't that our vicar?
Better check our lovebirds.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler.
- Here they come!
- My God, they've done it!
Well done, Padre. You've done it.
My God, you've done it.
Believe it or not, the poor devil's fainted.
They must be moving a couple of divisions south.
From the map, we'll be away from the main roads by dark.
The men could be gone in ten minutes.
How do we get ten minutes with that troop train only five behind us?
- It could turn off at Bologna.
- Or follow us straight to Berlin.
Escaped? We haven't escaped.
All we're doing is this bastard's job for him.
Exactly. And in Verona, which is marked by an X on the map, I will be properly grateful.
At Verona, both the train crew and guard detail is scheduled to be changed.
That's if we go to Verona.
Look here.
Suppose, when we get to Bologna, we...
...we could pass it and go to the left into Milano.
And you go, hm?
Perhaps on American railroads, yes?
But this train is under the orders of the German high command.
Such things are not possible.
To reroute a military train...
...requires a written order signed by a member of the general staff, Colonel.
Major, yours is not the only army that works in triplicate forms.
Obergruppenführer Wilhelm von Kleist.
- Does that mean general staff?
- It does indeed.
Well, now. We've got a pad full of blank forms and we've got a typewriter.
- I say! Wizard!
- We can't be any worse off than we are now.
Quite.
Let's say we type an order to Klement here.
Upon arriving in Bologna, he's told to go to Milan...
...where he is given confidential instructions from Gruppenführer...
- Give me a good Aryan name.
- Um... Ottfried. Johann Heinrich.
Gruppenführer Heinrich, who is in charge of a trainload of sealed boxcars...
...to be delivered to somebody... big, important.
- Fatso Goering.
- Der dicke Hermann. Brilliant!
- Loot for the Reichsmarschall.
- Major?
It might do. It's got enough nerve -
I'll give you that.
And we have it signed by our good friend from general staff, Wilhelm von Kleist.
- Amerikanisch, nicht?
- Ja.
Hauptmann Joseph Sonneberg, Herr Major.
Danke sehr.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Give this to the engineer.
Gestapo.
- How long is it now?
- Ten minutes, and my pulse is up 12 points.
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake.
Leave it. Everybody stay low.
Gestapo. Get those blinds up.
Gestapo.
Nylon.
Amerikanische Zigaretten.
Ja.
That chap ought to be reported to his superiors.
That's the end of ruddy that.
Colonnello.
- We have found it.
- Found what?
We have found a place to leave the train.
An abandoned branch line halfway to Milano.
Come on. Let's have a look.
Looks to be about...
...90 miles.
- We'll get there by 2100 hours.
- Add half an hour, to stop for water.
- That's better still. It'll be good and dark.
- By morning, 90% of your men will be dead.
We don't need him any more. Or her either.
Don't flinch. If you haven't the stomach for it, it'll be my pleasure.
- I'll decide that.
- Like with Battaglia?
- That was different.
- I intend it to be.
- You'll take your orders, Major!
- I'm afraid not.
- For God's sake! These are people!
- People don't shoot wounded!
But they do commit murder in cold blood?
Are you that far gone?
May I go to my compartment now?
Yes, of course.
You haven't had any food since we took over the train.
- I'm not hungry.
- Of course you are. Here, take it. Relax.
You cannot hide it. I know you will do what the British major wants.
You mean to kill you both?
It is the right thing.
In your place, I would do it.
No, you wouldn't. You're not that tough.
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.
Not to help me?
If I can, yes.
That is what all men say.
How old are you?
The first was the same man who helped my mother.
I was not yet confirmed then.
Such things do not happen in America?
- Why are you with this German?
- For food, for clothing. To stay alive.
- Is that all?
- There is a war, you know.
Yeah.
How did you say it?
Relax?
You think my legs are too thin?
Why don't you close the door?
I will.
On the way out.
-  We need water! We're hungry too!
- Knock it off in there!
- If they knew what was going on, they would.
- They'll just have to sweat it out.
What the hell are we waiting for now?
Come on!
They're gone. They're not here.
He's dead.
Back! Back! Get up on top!
- We can't leave them behind to talk.
- Cover that side. Work up toward the engine.
Get back!
All right. Let's move.
Get this train moving now!
Don't run away!
Get your hands off me or I'll blow your head off!
These tracks have quite a shine for not having been used.
Something's been running on this spur.
These tracks have been used recently.
But we don't know what's ahead.
It's deserted here. Let's get cracking.
- Last stop, Colonel?
- Last stop, soldier. Everybody out.
All cars unload!
- Those are not German planes.
- American?
No. British. Lancaster, I think.
Sorry to turn you out in the middle of nowhere, but it can't be helped.
Now, head for the mountains or the sea.
We'll form up again and have another crack at Jerry. Off you go, lads. Good luck.
Everybody back on the train!
Back on the train!
Get back! Get back on the train!
Come on, move! Back! Get in!
Come on, move! Back!
Oriani!
Take this train outta here! Go! Go! Come on!
Let the coward go!
Stop the train!
Bostick! Bostick!
- Injured to the lounge car!
- Tell Oriani to cut the burning cars loose!
- Where's Oriani? We're ready to roll.
- Roll? Roll where?
Three dead, and the rest need better help than
I can give 'em. Maybe it's the end of the line.
Colonnello.
This man thinks he can get us through.
- What are you talking about?
- Switzerland. The whole train. All of us.
- Switzerland?
- You're mad. You're all raving mad.
Here. North of Milano, where the track forks.
Since the war, all traffic goes right, into Germany.
But the left fork, the old Maloja Pass route, goes to Switzerland.
In a matter of hours we could be over the border and free.
- You know, it's possible.
- Yeah, maybe, but... Milano - that's the key.
- You think we can fool 'em again?
- The engineer says there is a way.
On the outskirts of Milano is a control tower at the beginning of the traffic complex.
This tower controls the whole Milano area.
If we can capture it and smash the signals, the main station, here...
...will not know where we are until they repair it, but by then it will be too late.
We can go through Milano without stopping?
Yes. The engineer says it can be done.
Let's move.
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!
Soon we cross back into the complex. If the power is back on, we will show on the board.
By then it will be full speed.
Too late for anyone to stop us.
- Can't this damn thing go any faster?
- Not before we reach the top of the pass.
From there it's downgrade all the way to Switzerland.
Shouldn't we go a bit slower?
If they've blocked the line ahead...
Keep it wide open. Let's move it.
Ryan.
- Whether we make it or not...
- We're gonna make it, Major.
What I'm trying to say is
I'm sorry it had to be you with the girl.
- Hey, mate, look! The Alps!
- We made it!
Now that we're over the hump, sir, Major
Fincham, I figured you'd want your stuff too.
Pepino! Pepino!
Messerschmitt!
He's trying to blow the engine.
Here comes his chum.
There's another one!
Oriani!
OK, let's go.
What the hell's he saying?
That footbridge leads around the mountain!
It's shorter than the tunnel to the other side.
- Fincham, get them moving on the catwalk.
- Follow me! Everybody follow me!
Move it! Move it!
- Come on, lads! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!
All right. Back! Back to the trestle!
Back!
Looks like they're takin' off.
Let's see those glasses.
No wonder they're takin' off. Let's go.
What about the German troop train back there?
- We have guns. We will stop them.
- Then what?
- He says we can replace the damaged track.
- Replace it with what?
It's simple. Remove track from behind the train - put it here.
Well, then let's get the troop train!
All those with Schmeissers, follow me!
This one's much too long.
Take that one there. Hurry up.
Clear this off! Clear this off! Hurry!
Pull! Pull!
Come on, hurry!
Come on, quick! That'll do it!
Move it!
Come on!
It didn't work! Back! Back!
Get back! Back!
Fire!
Come on, come on! Get it up!
Come on, hurry!
Let's pull back! Back!
Watch it! Over here! Stop!
Keep down! Hold your fire!
Fire!
Cease firing! Fall back!
- They'll try to outflank us now, huh?
- If they haven't already.
- Give me those grenades. I'll take some men.
- No. You're needed here.
Bostick, come with me.
Run!
Grenade!
Back!
There they are!
Come on, Ryan!
Come on, Major! Give me your hand!
Hurry!
Come on! Faster!
 I once told you, Ryan,
if only one gets out, it's a victory.

On the double!
You're crazy.
We've done nothing.
We didn't say ya did! l did nothing, either.
And l said l didn't say ya did!
So why'd ya come?
We got a letter for ya.
A letter from who?
A letter from the King.
A letter from the King?
What a joke!
Yes, a letter from the King. l don't believe ya.
Here it is.
Let me have it. lt's not true!
Look!
Look... the King.
''Mo-bil-i-za-tion.''
What's that mean?
War.
The King wrote Ulysses and Michelangelo!
Great!
There's something l don't understand.
What?
Why'd the King write to me?
He wants a personal favor.
The King? From me?
Yes. You'll see.
Let's go inside. l'm freezing.
During the hard times we're going through... with suffering saddening the people... the police should take into consideration... how to distract the population.
Sit down!
We've been on the road.
Take off your coat.
No, thanks. l'm fine.
Coffee?
OK.
Got a cigar?
OK.
Here.
Oh, sorry.
The electricity's off.
My wife's gorgeous.
She has heart-shaped lips. l love that.
Have a seat.
Thanks. lf the King wants a favor... it means he considers me a friend.
Yes.
Really...the King considers me his friend.
Yes.
Right?
Yeah, sure.
''Mobilization.'' That means we gotta go to war?
Yes.
When do we leave?
Today.
Shit!
Why?
Because.
War's no fun.
On the contrary.
What'll become of us?
Right.
We'll be ruined.
On the contrary.
You'll be wealthy.
How so?
How?
Yes, how?
That really interests me.
We'll explain it to you.
You'll enrich your minds by visiting foreign countries.
Then you'll become very rich.
You'll be able to have whatever you wish.
OK.
But where's all that?
With the enemy.
You take it from the enemy.
Not only lands and herds... but houses, palaces, cities, cars... movies, dime-stores, stations, airports... swimming pools, casinos, theaters... bouquets of flowers, arches of triumph... cigar factories, printing plants... lighters, airplanes... ladies of the world.
Freight trains.
Fountain pens, jewelry shops...
Alfa Romeos,
Hawaiian guitars.
Splendid landscapes... elephants, locomotives... subway stations.
Rolls Royces, Maseratis... women who get undressed.
Locomotives!
Diamonds!
Chocolate factories!
Maseratis!
We can really have all that?
Yes, all that.
Oh, that's nothing. l got a question.
Wherever they go, they can take what they want?
Yes. l just told you that.
Wonderful!
What's wrong?
Go on, asshole!
Go to war! Fast! l don't know...
Sure. Go on.
Assholes.
So, what's going on? l'm hesitating.
Why?
Why?
Why?
You say it, but it's not true. lt is, too.
Ya don't know what war is.
You'll see. lt's extraordinary.
Won't we be punished for stealing?
No. ln war, anything goes.
What's to prove that?
The proof... the King's letter.
-Here.
-lt proves nothing!
Of course it does.
Each soldier can do as he wants... in the name of the King.
So, sign it.
Yes, sign it.
-OK.
-Get my pen from the jeep. l got a question.
Go ahead. ln the war, can we take slot machines?
Yes.
No charges if we take old men's eyeglasses?
Can we break a kid's arm?
Both arms?
Stab a guy in the back?
Rob apartments?
Burn towns?
Burn women?
Yes.
And steal classy pants?
Yes. lf we want, we can massacre innocent folks?
Yes.
Denounce folks, too?
Yes.
Eat in restaurants and not pay?
Yes, yes. That's war.
Yes.
We'll have a lamb to celebrate.
Bring me a horse!
A velvet dress for me!
And some ribbons!
A Max Factor lipstick.
And a washing machine!
Ulysses!
Yes?
Don't forget!
No.
Hurry!
Bye, Cleopatra!
Hurry up!
Go! Quick!
Bye!
Bring me a bikini!
What?
A bikini!
What do soldiers do before battle?
Before battle, soldiers are afraid.
We landed in ltaly... and lined our path with a thousand bodies.
We're gonna take a hit!
We saw grenadiers die without a cry... generals with gaping bellies... bloody uniforms, holes for eyes.
The day of glory is at hand!
Even so, it's a nice summer.
We're sowing death in the families... and fulfilling our bloody mission.
Got any money?
No. We're poor.
Take a look.
You got any money?
No, we're poor.
We'll see about that!
Over there!
Send her out!
Go in the kitchen.
Up on the chair!
Turn around!
What're ya doin'? l'm looking!
Where'd ya put the old guy? l'll be back.
Where'd ya put the old guy?
Get down!
Take off your sweater!
A soldier salutes an artist!
Don't move!
Take off your dress! lf you please.
On your knees!
Forward!
Forward!
''Giddy-up, horsy!'' said little Claus. ''Hup!''
Hurry up. lt's always the same thing!
Always the same words: bodies, decay, rot, death, etc.
We were trucked into Northern Silesia... to be firing squads... and check on hangings.
''10 Hostages Were Shot Today.''
Yes, yes! Yes, yes!
Stop!
Who are they?
Hostages to be shot. l don't have the time.
Where's Juno?
No. Died in battle.
Poliansky?
Died in battle.
Mitchum?
Died in battle.
So do it on your own.
One of our most urgent jobs is... to find all the King's enemies.
To do so, we are ready... to shed our own blood and that of others.
Cigarette?
How far we goin'?
Till l find a pretty spot.
Hands up!
Get their stuff!
Got the blindfolds?
No.
Never mind.
Ready!
At times we make them... lie on the previous bodies... and shoot them in that position.
The King asks his people... to commemorate forever... our sons' heroic combat... in Europe and Oceania.
At these pyramids, we've seen... centuries of history contemplate us.
Yesterday the war began... its 3rd springtime... henceforth offering no sight of peace.
The captain took our ammo.
We fought 132 days with knives... to save Rostov.
Officers distribute books... about the great conquerors.
We memorize their battles and... study their magnificent lives.
What is it?
Say your prayers!
What're you doing there?
Commandeering buildings and killing the guardians.
They said it's allowed.
The King's spies and police... infiltrate the universities... but can't destroy... the tradition of freedom... the students cherish.
We kill people in groups... with a bullet to the head.
Once the hole's full... we fill it with dirt.
Have him get out.
Get out!
Are you a Mexican?
Yes. ls he your husband?
No.
Pity.
Because l wanted to say...
''l've never seen a Mex-who-can.''
We rip women's rings off... and make people undress... when we shoot them... naked by anti-tank traps.
Come look!
Cleopatra?
Look! Look what l brought ya!
And this is for Venus!
Yesterday we captured
Santa Cruz.
The girls threw us flowers.
That night l saw my first movie.
''Superboy and Holgat...
''roamed the mesa in search...
''of the 2 mysterious men.
'''Superboy, why are you interested in these men?'
'''Like you, Steve...
''l think they're from elsewhere.'''
Eat your pie!
No.
Eat up, dammit!
No.
Son of a fascist bitch!
A Worldly Lady in her Bath.
We're in the Condor Legion.
We leave blood and death behind us.
With tender kisses... lf Papa knew it, tra-la-la!
He'd break my hand, tra-la-la!
Keep marching, boys!
Keep marching, boys! l lost my clarinet's flange.
Go that way!
Ulysses, the machine gun.
Do eels have a soul? l got no idea.
Michelangelo.
The machine gun.
Hands up! Get up!
Get over here!
Help!
Hands up!
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
4th Territorial Action Group.
Why are you fighting us?
We're friends.
Lenin said...
''Bourgeois capitalism...''
''and its reactionaries...''
''are merely evil insects...''
''and must be considered as such...''
''by the international proletariat.''
She's a pain. Shoot her.
And him?
Him, too.
Michelangelo.
Put this on her head.
Or they won't dare fire.
My brothers!
My brothers!
My brothers!
You have something to say? l'd like to recite a wonderful fable by Mayakovsky.
Never mind!
This can't be Death.
Why would she hang about here?
Aren't you ashamed to believe in a fable?
Someone has a party... creates a carnival... invents this killing... as he blinks his eyes.
She is charming, but like the cannons.
The gas mask is but a simple toy.
See? ln her careful course... she measures the heavens.
Has Death slipped on the floor of the sky?
Don't say a wound's blood is awful.
Simply, to honor heros... we gave them carnations.
True, the mind won't and can't understand it. lf cannons' necks aren't for kissing... why do the trenches' arms embrace them?
No one has been killed.
Too weary, all have lain down, from the Seine to the Rhine... as gangrene flowers among the slain.
Who says ''slain''?
No! No.
All are going to rise again... and come smiling home and tell their wives...
''What a joke it was!
''What a phenomenon!''
They'll say,
''There were no shells nor mines.
''There wasn't even a fort.
''lt was all a great fable for your birthday!''
She's still moving.
Again.
Again!
Again.
There is no victory.
Only flags and... fallen men.
After desperate combat... the 8th Royal Army... surrendered April 9th... overwhelmed by human suffering.
Hello.
Hello, sir. l want a Maserati.
You have money?
Yes.
The King's letter.
That won't do.
You need money.
A lot?
Yes, a lot.
Madam, l want money!
Money.
The last one of all! lt's always the best of the--
Like our love, it's full of chances.
The last one of all.
Come dance the time away!
We hears its call...
And it lasts till the end of day.
The music you hear...
-is just for your ear.
-Look, Venus!
Yes, Mama.
The last one of all.
Before we go--
Mama, it's them !
Mama, it's them !
We can't always smile...
So when things go wrong--
A next time?
Shit, you've kissed me enough!
Hi, Cleopatra!
Poor Ulysses.
What happened to you?
Some bastard poked my eye out... when l kissed his daughter.
Who cares?
We're rich now!
Right. Who cares?
We're rich!
Yes! We're rich!
We got the world's treasures!
Where are they? l don't see anything.
Me, neither.
You got everything?
Sure.
Where is it? l can't begin to tell ya.
Where is it? lt's in there?!
Yes, yes.
You didn't bring a thing, ya dumb vet!
Cowards!
Liar!
Lazy slob!
Deserter!
Bastard!

What?
Why? l'll tell you. l'll tell you.
We lost the war.
The King made peace... but the cost was great.
The enemy demanded the death of the Prime Minister.
The treaty demands... the arrest and punishment of traitors... and war criminals.
Moreover... l have letters for you... from the King. l'll be right there. l've something to tell you.
What?
A secret!

This is London.
Ed Murrow reporting.
To an American reporter...
...there is something very special about the people of this city...
...this island, this nation.
Never in the long and stormy history of Great Britain...
...have her fortunes been as low as they are in this spring of 1941.
Britain is fighting alone for her very existence,...
...fighting desperately.
Yet her people remain steadfast and unflinching.
Britain's allies have been defeated one by one,...
...as the dark stain of Nazi conquest spreads across the map of Europe.
In Africa, Rommel is giving the Eighth Army a very bad time.
Greece has fallen.
And the Luftwaffe continues to smash English cities.
The worst news of all comes from the North Atlantic,...
...where last month, German U-boats and surface raiders...
...sank 600,000 tons of shipping.
In this battle,
Britain's lifeblood is at stake.
This is the battle on which depend the future course of the war...
...the future course of British history.
The battle of the North Atlantic is fought at sea...
...but it is directed from the admiralty, here in London.
Very deep in the ancient
Admiralty Building,...
...200 feet underground, is the War Room.
Here is the guiding brain and central nervous system of the British Navy,...
...The Operations Division.
- Robert.
- Sir?
Take Captain Shepard's things and put them in the office.
Aye, Sir.
Thank you.
This, of course, is the message center for incoming and outgoing signals.
These tubes lead to the wireless room just down the hall.
Oh, Shepard...
- Anything wrong?
- That man's uniform.
Oh. We're quite informal here about some things.
You'll find it's much different from the bridge of a ship at sea.
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes. It has to be that way.
Shepard, this is Commander
Richards the duty plot officer.
Captain Shepard is the new director of operations.
- How do you do?
- Don't let me interrupt your meal.
Captain Shepard, Second Officer Anne Davis.
Captain Shepard's taking over for me.
- How do you do, Sir?
- How do you do?
Be nice to her, Shepard. If she ever got angry and walked out, we'd lose the war.
Really?
Seriously, you can depend on this young lady.
I've done it more times than I care to admit.
Anne, be a darling, will you and get your plot report in as soon as possible.
We mustn't be late for Jimmy's party tonight.
Right-oh.
I suppose I should shed a few tears at leaving this place, but...
...quite honestly, I've hated the job.
Too much responsibility, too much strain.
I'm getting a command at sea.
That's what I've always wanted.
Congratulations.
I hope you find one that doesn't involve too much strain.
Yes, The point is, it's a different kind of strain.
After all, if a man's going to serve in the navy, he ought to serve at sea...
...unless, of course, it's a man like yourself who's already seen a tremendous amount of action.
He should still serve at sea.
Yes. Well, I'd better get along.
I'll say good-bye now unless you have any questions.
I don't think so, thank you. Good luck.
Thank you.
We thought we might be of some assistance,
Sir,... not knowing your way around yet, Sir.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, there is something you can do.
A few moments ago I saw a rating enter the War Room without his jumper.
From now on, everyone will be properly dressed at all times.
I cannot have officers eating sandwiches on duty, Commander Richards,...
...under any circumstances.
I'm sorry, Sir. It won't happen again.
Excuse me, Sir. I think you should know that Commander Richards...
...stood two watches without relief and...
I'm sure Commander Richards doesn't need an interpreter, Miss Davis.
I was also surprised to hear a Wren officer addressed by her Christian name.
To me, this kind of informality is both irregular and inexcusable.
Come in!
Sorry to interrupt, Sir.
- Priority signal.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
Come in.
Oh, Shepard.
- You know the assistant chief of naval staff.
- Yes, indeed, Sir. Very well.
How are you, Jonathan?
I'm glad to see you again.
Thank you. I have a signal here sent from our naval attache in Stockholm.
He reports two large German warships steaming through the Kattegat.
- What ships are they?
- He doesn't say.
Do you think it might be the Bismarck?
It's possible, Sir.
She's just completed three months' training in the Baltic.
They couldn't pick a better time to break out, could they?
With this Crete business going on, and our convoys scattered all over the ocean.
- I have a nasty hunch that's the idea, Sir.
- I hope for once you're wrong.
We can't afford to have that monster on the loose.
Look what Scharnhorst and Gneisenau did to us.
- 22 ships sunk... 115,000 tons.
- All in two months.
And they don't have anything like
Bismarck's fire power.
She could stand off and sink every ship in a convoy without ever coming under fire.
Shepard, get on to the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.
Tell him we're not sure, but we're very much concerned.
Tell him we'll let him have every scrap of information we get.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Oh, and, Shepard. I wish you'd prepare your recommendations in case it is the Bismarck.
Very good, Sir.
Pretty rough assignment for a new man on the job, isn't it?
I suppose, Sir, I'm not worried about Shepard.
He's one of the ablest men in the service.
I'm also told he's as cold as a witch's heart.
That's may be a slight exaggeration, Sir.
I want a man who's cold.
I'd like a man with no heart at all, no soul, just an enormous brain.
The battle of the North Atlantic is a grim business.
It won't be won by charm and personality.
- We've had too much of that here.
- I've known Shepard for years.
We've served together before.
He was different from these days.
Any particular reason for the change?
I suspect there are many reasons, Sir.
Reasons of a personal nature.
Oh. I see. Well, how are we going to get the information on those two ships?
- We have an agent in southern Norway, Sir,...
- Better get in touch with him.
We don't want to get in touch with him directly. It's much too dangerous.
And there isn't time to go through Zurich or Stockholm.
In this case, you'll have to make direct contact.
Sir, this man is in Nazi-occupied territory.
I realize that.
All the same, we must get in touch with him immediately.
Aye-aye, Sir.
The enemy ships were sighted coming out of the Baltic...
...obviously heading out to sea, obviously not in the service of the king.
Now, what have we got over here at Scapa Flow?
Battleships King George V, Prince of Wales,...
...battle cruiser Hood, and a few cruisers and destroyers.
The rest of the fleet's out on convoy escort.
It's from Admiral Cunningham, Sir.
"Situation in Crete is deteriorating."
"German airborne troops have captured Maleme Airfield."
Why is it we never get our bad medicine in small doses?
Perfect timing for an enemy breakout in the North Atlantic.
Cunningham and his fleet busy down here in Crete.
Sommerville's got his hands full trying to reinforce Malta with Force H.
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau are up here at Brest ready to come out again.
We must keep them covered.
And 16 convoys to guard, scattered all over the Atlantic.
If we had a hundred more ships, we still wouldn't have enough.
Sir, we've just had a signal from our agent in Norway.
The message is incomplete.
"Sighted two enemy ships off
Kristiansand at 0335 sailing due west,"
"...Cruiser Prinz Eugen and..."
The transmission stopped abruptly at that point, Sir.
- Did you try to get him back?
- Yes, Sir. No further contact.
Where is Kristiansand?
Off here, Sir. Southern tip of Norway.
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?
I don't think this man would have transmitted in the circumstances...
...if it hadn't been something really important.
Then we'll proceed on the assumption that it's Bismarck.
May I suggest we put Coastal Command to work on air reconnaissance?
By all means. Everything from Bergen southwards.
Tell them to photograph everything that looks suspicious.
I'll talk to Commander-in-Chief at Scapa Flow.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Excuse me, Sir.
First Sea Lord on the line, Sir.
Commander-in-Chief, Sir.
- Hello, Jack. How are you?
- I'm fine.
Those two German ships were sighted off southern Norway at 0335.
One is the Prinz Eugen... and we're not sure about the other.
Do you think it's...
I suggest you proceed on the worst possible assumption...
...that it's Bismarck and she's trying to breaking out.
Allright.
I may be wrong, but I can't think of anything worse at the moment.
Yes, I agree. We can't let that ship get loose in the Atlantic.
I'll come to immediate notice for steam, Sir.
All right. Good-bye.
We're directed to assume that it's Bismarck accompanied by Prinz Eugen...
...and that they're attempting to break out into the convoy lanes.
Now, gentlemen, they'd have four available passages, wouldn't they?
Here's the Denmark Strait, the passage south of Iceland,...
...the Faeroes-Shetland Passage, and the Fair Island Channel...
...between the Orkneys and the Shetlands.
Anyone care to place a bet?
What about the Iceland-Faeroes Channel?
Not too near our bases, and a plenty a room to maneuver.
Why wouldn't he take the nearest exit?
Fair Island Channel, is only a few hundred miles.
Much too close to our air patrol.
You're of no help to me, gentlemen. All you're saying is it could be any one of the four.
Actually, of course, you're perfectly right.
And I'm afraid somehow or other we've got to guard them all.
Have we any idea where they are now, Sir?
Nothing definite.
Jenkins, check with Coastal Command that they're still carrying out a search.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Looks like two cruisers.
That's what the pilot said.
One's a cruiser, all right.
The other one's...
...Bismarck.
- Bismarck's been located in Norway.
- Definitely identified.
Bismarck's in Grimstad Fjord.
They want us to send everything we've got.
Bombers, torpedo planes, everything.
- How was it?
- No luck. Nothing.
- Visibility down to nil.
- Cloud down to 200 feet, Sir.
You can't get a bombing run in weather like that.
We came in as low as we could,
200 feet along the fjord here.
- What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?
- O.G.62, Sir.
Right.
Now, Miss Davis, take the Arethusa from
O.G.62, and put her with the Home Fleet.
Good.
Now take the Victorious from that convoy forming up in the Clyde... W.S.8.B....
...and put her with the Home Fleet.
Sir, Operations Home Fleet calling.
Director of Operations.
No, I'm sorry. We still have no information.
Well, the weather's closed in over there and the aircraft can't see a thing.
Yes, as soon... as soon as
I hear, right. Right. I will.
Now...
...take the Repulse from W.S.8.B and put her with the Home Fleet.
Right.
Home Fleet looks better now, doesn't it?
Yes, Sir, but I wouldn't give much for the convoy.
You do recall that's a troop convoy, don't you, Sir?
Yes, I do.
They've got a long way to go round the cape to the Middle East.
This leaves them with almost no protection at all, Sir.
I'm quite aware of the circumstances, Miss Davis.
In my opinion this is a risk we have to take.
We have to take, Sir?
Well, Shepard.
What do you have in mind?
I think we must reinforce the Home Fleet, Sir.
We can't expect them to patrol everything from here to Greenland...
...with what they've got now.
Well, where do we get the ships?
We'd have to take ships from other duty.
It would involve some risk.
We could take Victorious and Repulse off escort duty.
That would give the Commander-in-Chief an aircraft carrier and another battle cruiser.
What convoy were they covering?
The W.8.S.B., sailing from the Clyde tomorrow.
It's a large troop convoy, Sir... 20,000 men.
We'd be exposing them to a long and dangerous voyage without proper escort.
Is that what you're recommending?
Yes, Sir.
You're willing to gamble the lives of 20,000 men?
I think there's a difference between a gamble and a calculated risk.
Good for you, Shepard.
Of course, I realize it's...
It's not an easy decision to make.
The important ones never are.
All right, go ahead and detach those two ships from the convoy.
- Inform Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
They're giving us Victorious and Repulse.
Now we can send Hood and Prince of Wales out...
...to support the patrols in the Greenland area.
- I want them ready to sail within an hour.
- Yes, Sir.
The Prince of Wales has civilian workers aboard.
They're making adjustments to the gun turrets.
If they finish on time, have them put ashore. If not, they'll sail with the ship.
Aye-aye, Sir.
As far as the rest of the fleet concerned, we'll wait here for definite information.
I suppose my nerves can stand it if yours can.
I've just talked to Captain
Shepard in London, Sir.
He says the visibility over the coast of Norway is absolutely nil.
She may still be there. She may have sailed hours ago.
What's the latest forecast?
Pretty bad, I'm afraid, Sir. It looks like two days of very thick weather.
The weather report is very good, Admiral.
Two days of heavy overcast.
Good news, is it not so, Captain?
It is, Sir.
Thank you, Bernhardt.
We have a most interesting chess game here, Lindemann.
The important moves this time are at the opening.
To break out into the Atlantic will not be easy, Sir.
Yes, but we have the advantage,...
...because they do not know what we are going to do.
We can move out immediately or we can hide for a while under this beautiful overcast.
Also, we have a choice of four different exits.
Group North has suggested the Iceland-Faeroes Passage.
You're not forgetting that, Sir?
We have to take orders from Group North.
- We do not have to take suggestions.
- Yes, Sir.
Lindemann, we have a great opportunity here.
I do not intend to let Group North or anyone else lose it for me.
There can be great glory in this voyage.
Glory for the Third Reich.
Glory for us!
- For you, Sir. You are the fleet commander.
- I will see that you are not forgotten.
I was forgotten after the last war.
Until the Führer came to power,
I got no recognition, no promotion.
I was ignored, just as Germany was ignored.
The world only remembers the winners, Lindemann.
We must make sure this time that it will remember us.
- I am sure it will.
- How soon can you get under way?
I can have steam in half an hour, Sir.
Captain, I want to be out of here in 15 minutes.
- Very well, Sir.
- Signal Prinz Eugen.
Very well, Sir.
Sir, it's a signal from the
Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.
An aircraft from Hatston's got through to Grimstad.
There's nothing there now, Sir. Nothing at all.
Well, they've sailed.
At least we know that much.
Now we can get moving.
- Position of all convoys, Sir.
- Thank you.
All we can do now is wait and see what happens.
That's the worst part of our job... The waiting.
By the way, you have a son in the service, haven't you?
Yes, Sir. He's at Gibraltar.
He's an air gunner in the Ark Royal.
I bet you're glad he won't be mixed up in this Bismarck show.
Why should I be glad?
If you were, you wouldn't admit it, would you? Even to me.
He's serving with a fleet. He must take his chance like everybody else.
I see.
There's an air vice marshal coming in later to help out on reconnaissance.
- Give him a briefing, will you?
- Very good, Sir.
You wanted to speak to the crew, Captain?
- They've been alerted.
- Yes, Sir.
Achtung!
Captain Lindemann.
With your permission, I would like to address the ship's company.
As you wish, Sir.
Thank you.
Officers and men of the Bismarck, this is the fleet commander.
I can now tell you that we are going out into the North Atlantic...
...to attack the British convoy system.
We are going to sink their ships until they no longer dare to let them sail.
It's true we are only two ships, but the world has never seen such ships.
You are sailing in the largest,...
...the most powerful battleship afloat, superior to anything in the British Navy.
We are faster, we are unsinkable, and we are German!
You cadet officers, you were selected the highest authority to make this voyage.
When you return to the fleet, you will have many inspiring stories to tell,...
...stories of German sea power, stories of Nazi victory!
To all of you, I say this never forget that you are Germans, never forget that you are Nazis!
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
In the center, the main plot.
What's that?
- Another convoy, Sir.
- Fine. Carry on.
Now, Sir,...
...over here, we have the Hood and the Prince of Wales.
They left Scapa Flow 40 hours ago.
Here we have the Repulse,...
...the aircraft carrier Victorious, and the King George V.
They've been steaming for approximately 18 hours.
In this area,...
...the cruisers Arethusa,
Manchester, Birmingham.
In the Denmark Strait, the cruisers "Suffolk" and "Norfolk".
As you can see, Sir,...
...our cruiser screen is spread out much too thinly.
Now, if your people would get into the air...
Can't fly reconnaissance missions in weather like this.
We realize that, of course, Sir.
We must assume that the "Bismarck," in company with the Prinz Eugen,...
...is going to attempt a breakthrough to the North Atlantic.
But we don't know where and we don't know when.
If it's here...
...or here...
...then the "Repulse", and the "Victorious" and the "K.G. V" will have to do the job.
If it's here in the Denmark Strait,...
...then the "Hood" and the "Prince of Wales" will have to go after her.
I should think they could handle it very nicely.
Well, Sir, Hood's a great ship.
So is the Prince of Wales.
But she's fresh from the builder's yard.
No training for her crew.
In fact, in this emergency...
...she had to put to sea with some of contractor's workmen still on board.
The Bismarck's a tough proposition for any two ships.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
The First Sea Lord can see you now.
- Oh, good. Thank you very much, Shepard.
- A pleasure, Sir.
Yes, Sir.
Right, Sir.
Yes, I will.
Commander Richards, who's your relief?
- Dexter, Sir.
- He's late, isn't he?
A little. I don't mind, Sir.
Well, I do. Tell him I'll require him for duty the next three nights.
My dearest Tom...
Come in.
Thought you might like a cup of tea, Sir, long as you're not going to take any rest.
What are you doing here, Miss Davis?
I thought you're off duty.
Third Officer Simpson's down with flu. I'm just filling in.
Oh, thank you. Would you file that for me, please?
There's an air raid going on up top.
A Bad one?
No, not very.
Won't your family be worried about you?
I have no family here.
My father lives in Canada now.
I thought that surely you must be married or something.
No, Sir. Nothing at all.
Doesn't that seem a little odd, if you don't mind my saying so?
I was going to be married last year, but... It didn't work out.
His fault or yours?
He was at Dunkirk, and he was listed as missing in action.
It was just a year ago.
A year ago next week.
He was a rather wonderful man,...
...not... brilliant or dashing or anything like that, but... just rather wonderful.
I'm sorry.
Actually, I think it helps to talk about these things, don't you, Sir?
No, I don't. As a matter of fact
I don't think it helps at all.
Getting emotional about things is a peacetime luxury.
In wartime, it's much too painful.
You can't turn off your emotions just because there's a war on.
- You can't do anything about your feelings.
- Yes, you can.
- Director of Operations.
- Tell you why I called, Jonathan.
Dexter's here in my office... and he has rather a special problem.
I understand you've given him extra duty.
Yes, that's quite correct.
I said I'll require him for duty the next three nights.
It seems that his girl is an army nurse...
...and she's got orders to sail tomorrow night from Portsmouth.
I'm very sorry that Dexter's young lady is going overseas, but surely, that's beside the point.
Can't you make an exception?
No, Sir. I'm not prepared to make an exception for this officer or any other, for that matter...
...certainly not for reasons of personal convenience.
Well, it's very simple, Sir,... either you have discipline or you haven't.
Well, I'm sorry, Dexter.
Thank you, Sir.
By the way, Jonathan, there's a fleet commander aboard the Bismarck.
- Yes. Admiral Gunther Lutjens.
- Lutjens.
You know this man?
Yes, Sir, I do.
One of his cruisers sank my ship.
Oh. Then you'll have a special interest in him.
Commander Richards, have a bunk made up in my office.
Yes, Sir.
I want the latest report on all shipping in the North Atlantic,
- enemy, friendly, neutral.
- Yes.
Is there any air reconnaissance yet over this area?
No. The weather's still too bad.
You show two cruisers in the Denmark Strait.
Is Suffolk back on station?
We assume she is, but we don't know for certain.
She's quiet as a tomb.
- Alter course to 1-9-0.
- Starboard 15.
Starboard 15, Sir.
Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. Very good, Sir.
Bloody fool!
This blasted fog.
It's like looking into a cake of ice. I can't see a thing.
If you see something out there, it will have 15-inch guns on it.
A solid foot of armour plate, that's what the Bismarck's got.
- Who said so?
- The gunnery officer, that's who.
He said for all the good our guns'd do, we might as well throw crumpets at her.
I wish someone would throw a crumpet at me.
Ship bearing green 4-5!
Two ships bearing green 4-5!
Hard aport! Full ahead both!
Hard aport. Full ahead both, Sir.
Shall we follow them, Sir?
- Steady on 1-3-0.
- Steady on 1-3-0!
- Yeoman.
- Sir.
Make to admiralty.
"Bismarck and cruiser sighted."
"Course... south."
"My position..."
Give latitude and longitude.
Get that off immediately in case we run into trouble.
Aye-aye, Sir.
- Check radar.
- Check your radar plot.
Enemy report from Suffolk, Sir.
They've found her. Picked her up in the Denmark Strait.
Bismarck and a heavy cruiser.
66-45 north...
...26 west.
There, gentlemen.
Course southwest.
Now things are looking up.
- Tell the First Sea Lord immediately.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Good job we've got some heavy stuff in the area.
Richards, let me have an intercepting course for Hood and Prince of Wales.
- Yes
- Sir, this one's from the Norfolk.
Norfolk's there, too, Sir.
She's with Suffolk.
They're shadowing in thick fog, using radar.
I hope that radar works better than usual.
If she decided to turn on them, she could blow them both out of the water.
No. Lutjens is too clever for that.
He'd rather shake off a pair of cruisers than stop to sink them.
Course to intercept Bismarck is 3-1-0.
That would bring Hood in contact... just about... There.
Just about here, Sir.
The intercepting course is 3-1-0 degrees.
At full speed, we should make contact at 0300.
I don't want to engage him until daylight.
Give me a course and speed to intercept at dawn.
Aye-aye, Sir.
At 27 knots... Course 2-9-5,... we should meet them at first light.
- We'll proceed on that course at that speed.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
- Pass the word to Prince of Wales.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Anything further, Sir?
Signal from flag, Sir.
Speed... 27 knots.
200 revolutions.
- 200 revolutions.
- Admiral's intentions follow, Sir.
Very good.
Wilson, tell the captain we've gone onto 27 knots.
- Also, the admiral's sending his intentions.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Oh, Wilson, how are the civilian workers enjoying themselves?
They're loving every moment of it, Sir.
I'll tell you one thing, I'm not sleeping in one of these bloody hammocks.
Make a note,
Walter to speak to the captain.
We'll have double beds put in.
Oh, very funny.
Well, I reckon it's a diabolical liberty.
I believe, I never even had a chance to phone my wife to say what was happening.
They were afraid she might not let you go.
- I'm just Imagine what she thinks I'm up to.
- Pity she's wrong, isn't it?
She'll never believe this.
Where are we going? that's what I want to know.
A couple minutes ago, we picked up speed.
What's that for in the middle of the night?
Captain speaking.
Bismarck has been sighted in Denmark Strait.
She's on her way out into the Atlantic.
And we plan to tackle her about dawn tomorrow morning.
You'll be going to action stations shortly after midnight.
So get all the rest you can before then.
I'm confident tomorrow is going to be a big day for us.
Good luck and good shooting.
They can't do this to me.
I'm in a reserved occupation.
I never thought a thing like this would happen.
Fancy me fighting Germans on the high seas.
- Here, lad. You ever been in a battle before?
- Yeah, hundreds of times.
Don't hardly give it a thought any more.
Latest plot report, Sir.
Suffolk and Norfolk still in contact.
Hood and Prince of Wales are estimated 120 miles from Bismarck.
Should be quite a show tomorrow morning.
I know where I'd rather be.
Excuse me, Sir.
What a time for Shepard to take over.
I hope he's getting all the help he needs.
Help, Sir?
I didn't think he needed any help.
Captain Shepard is a very old friend of mine, Miss Davis.
You would be quite wrong if you judged him too harshly.
He had his ship blown from under him last year up in Norway.
This job here means promotion for him but he can't wait to get another ship.
As long as I've known Shepard, only two things matter to him.
His family and the sea.
I didn't know he had any family, Sir.
His son is an air gunner serving in the Ark Royal.
He and the boy are terribly close.
And his wife?
He hasn't spoken about her, and I haven't asked.
Signal from Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet. Sir.
"Suffolk and Norfolk will continue shadowing tonight."
"They will make no attempt to engage the enemy."
Right. Make to Hood and Prince of Wales.
"If enemy maintains present course and speed,..."
"...you should make contact approximately 0510."
Right, Sir.
- And, Dexter.
- Yes, Sir.
- Add to that... "Good luck".
- Very good, Sir.
I'm not strong enough for this sort of thing.
- Besides, I've got flat feet.
- Ah, shut up, Henry.
If we're gonna fight the Bismarck
I'm gonna check "Y" turret.
Yeah, and we'd better check that turbine. Come on, Henry.
Anyway, I always get seasick.
Hood and Prince of Wales are somewhere in here.
Suffolk and Norfolk... report
Bismarck and Prinz Eugen here.
If so, we shouldn't have long to wait.
- It should be getting light up there now.
- Signal from Suffolk, Sir.
"Have sighted Hood and Prince of Wales bearing southeast."
- "Distance... 15 miles."
- That means they've made it.
Good old Hood, she'll get them.
Come on, hurry up!
Come on, everyone!
Breach open!
Right gun shell!
Right gun shell!
Right gun, first half charge!
Right gun, second half charge!
Bridge.
Smoke bearing green 4-0, Sir.
Bismarck and cruiser...bearing green 4-0,...about 12 miles.
Closing fast.
Those are not cruisers.
They are battleships.
Captain, open fire on the leading ship.
Target leading ship!
Stand by to open fire!
Target leading ship!
Stand by to open fire!
Hard aport.
Open fire when you in range.
Concentrate on Bismarck.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Let me know when you're ready to engage guns
- and then we'll turn.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Tell Prince of Wales to open fire
- when she's in range.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Hard astarboard!
Shoot!
Range... 25,000.
Bearing... 300.
All turrets ready to open fire, Sir.
Open fire.
Fire!
Fire!
That was too close for comfort.
Turn 20 degrees to starboard, Captain.
Shoot!
Fire!
Unbelievable.
- Blimey.
- What happened?
The Hood's gone.
Good God.
- Yeoman.
- Yes, Sir?
Make to admiralty from Prince of Wales.
Tell them...
- Tell them the Hood has blown up.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Starboard 15.
Starboard 15, Sir.
Starboard 15.
Signal from Prince of Wales, Sir.
Well, what is it?
It says... HMS Hood has blown up.
Bring it here.
Signal from Suffolk, Sir.
Johnson.
"Hood sunk. Prince of Wales and Bismarck exchanging fire."
Fire!
Shoot.
Port 20!
Tell the engine room to give me everything they've got.
Course 2-4-0.
Very good. Course 2-4-0.
Fire!
Give me a hand!
Hard aport. Steer 1-5-0.
Make smoke.
She's badly damaged, Sir.
She's turning away and making smoke.
Do you want to pursue?
No. We have more important work to do.
Hold your course.
- Steady on present course.
- Very good, Sir.
Captain, congratulations.
It's a great moment for the German Navy.
Yes, Lindemann... and for the two of us.
This morning, HMS Hood, largest British warship, was sunk by the German...
This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.
This island, which is no stranger to bad tidings,...
...received news today that HMS Hood, the largest warship in the British fleet...
...and pride of the British Navy,...
...has been sunk by the German battleship Bismarck.
From the Hood's complement of 1,500 men, there were three survivors.
In the same engagement the battleship
Prince of Wales was badly damaged.
Two British capital ships have been put out of commission...
...and the most powerful battleship in the world is now loose on the high seas.
It remains to be seen whether British Navy has the capability at this crucial moment...
...of concentrating enough sea power to deal with the situation.
There is undoubtedly great rejoicing in
Berlin tonight and also on the Bismarck.
Here's to the ship, Lindemann, and here's to us.
We have beaten the best they have.
- Do you realize that?
- Yes, Sir.
They will never stop us, not now.
You wanted the damage control report, Sir.
What is it?
We received one hit, forward on the port side, over number two fuel tank.
- We're losing a little oil.
- Anything serious?
No, Sir. I would say the damage is very slight.
However, I would recommend we put about and have it repaired.
Put about? You mean go home?
Yes, Sir. We could refuel at the same time.
Are you mad?
We have fought our way out into the Atlantic.
- This is no time to turn and run for home.
- We wouldn't be running, Sir.
- We've won a tremendous victory.
- But it's not the victory that was ordered.
You haven't been close to the high command, Lindemann.
Do you know what will happen...
...when Admiral Raeder reports the sinking of the Hood?
The Führer will smile and everyone else will smile,...
...and then, a few moments later, he'll turn to Raeder with a scowl.
"What about the convoys, Raeder?
Have they sunk any convoys?"
There will still be plenty of convoys,
Sir, after we make repairs.
Is your ship unmaneuverable, Captain?
Are the guns damaged?
Anything out of action?
No, Sir.
Then we will push forward, as instructed by the high command.
But surely the Führer must realize...
Are you now going to tell the Führer what he must realize?
- No, Sir.
- Then do not tell me.
For the time being, we will hold our present course and speed.
Yes, Sir.
There will be no further statement to the press...
- ...not for the present.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Make a signal to admiral commanding First Cruiser Squadron.
"Suffolk and Norfolk must maintain contact..."
"...with the Bismarck, so that Home Fleet can intercept."
"Continue shadowing as long as you have fuel to do so."
- Aye-aye, Sir.
- Excuse me, Sir.
This is Bismarck's latest position, course, and speed.
Send it to the C-in-C,
Home Fleet, right away.
Now, Shepard.
At its present speed, Sir,...
...the Home Fleet cannot make contact with "Bismarck" until tomorrow,...
...and then only if she maintains her present course.
What if she doesn't maintain her present course?
That's it exactly, Sir.
- They won't make contact at all.
- Prime minister for you, Sir.
- First Sea Lord here.
- Now, First Sea Lord,...
...I want to make it unmistakably clear that there is absolutely nothing as vital...
...to the nation at this moment as the destruction of the "Bismarck"
You are authorized to employ any means at your disposal,...
...regardless of risk and regardless of the price that must be paid.
This is a battle we cannot afford to lose.
I understand, Sir.
I don't care how you do it.
You must sink the "Bismarck".
Good luck to you.
Thank you, Sir.
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?
In my opinion, Sir, we cannot leave this entirely to the Home Fleet.
We must reach out and pull in everything we can lay our hands on.
I've ordered Rodney to leave her convoy. She was the last available ship.
I don't suggest this lightly, Sir.
Down here, at Gibraltar, we've Force H.
Renown, Sheffield, Ark Royal.
We can't strip the Western Mediterranean with this Crete business going on.
Perhaps if we left Ark Royal down there and sent the other two out.
No, Sir.
We may need Ark Royal's aircraft.
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?
It's taking a serious risk.
I know Shepard has weighed that very carefully.
In view of what the prime minister said, we don't seem to have much choice.
Well, I may be able to argue with you two, but I can't quarrel with the prime minister.
Order Force H to sail at the earliest possible moment.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Johnson.
Smith.
It's not for you, boy.
Stratton.
Singer.
Shepard.
Oh, thanks.
- Thompson. Thompson, where are you?
- That's me.
My dearest Tom,...
...I'm really much too tired to write, but I think of you so very often...
...that I'm always afraid there may be things I will forget to mention.
Marvelous. No letter again.
Well, where are we off to this time?
That's what I'd like to know.
Hey, Tom, is it true your father is director of operations?
Yeah, I'm afraid it is.
He's got a nerve, moving us out of Gibraltar.
Just when we get fixed up with a couple of girls.
Why don't you drop him a line, Tom?
Tell him we don't want to go to sea.
It's my fault, really. I thought you blokes would like a couple months in England.
- You said England?
- You're kidding?
Not at all. You see, my girl's in London.
That's what gave me the idea.
You mean to say you asked your father if
They wouldn't dare. Well, not in wartime.
Go on.
Your father would do the same for you.
This is the captain.
I thought you'd be interested to know...
...we shall be operating in the Atlantic for a while.
We've got orders to go out after the Bismarck... and we should engage.
- No! No! Boys!
- Grab him!
If Bismarck holds her present course and speed,...
...when's the earliest we can engage her?
Nine o'clock tomorrow morning, Sir, at best possible speed.
If Norfolk and Suffolk can keep track of her, they can guide us in.
Suppose Bismarck gives them the slip?
If she shakes off those cruisers during the night,...
...if we lose contact, we may never get hold of her again.
She's got the weather on her side, Sir.
Looks very bad for tonight.
We've got to try and slow her down before nightfall.
Sommers, do you think Victorious could launch an air strike?
Well, she's supposed to get her deck landing training in Mediteranian, Sir.
Most of her pilots have never flown off a carrier.
I'm afraid they'll have to start their training now.
Detach Victorious from the fleet.
Tell her to close Bismarck at 30 knots, and she's to launch an air strike as soon as she gets within 100 miles of the enemy.
Aye-aye, Sir.
That's all, gentlemen.
Signal Prinz Eugen that she is to proceed on her course...
- ...and make for Brest.
- Yes, Sir.
We will keep the enemy cruisers occupied until Prinz Eugen is out of sight.
All right, Captain, you can make your turn.
- Hard aport.
- Hard aport, Sir.
Stand by to open fire.
Radar plot, range decreasing.
Decreasing very rapidly.
Range down to 22,000 yards.
Doubled back on us, Sir!
There she is, Sir!
Hard aport. Full ahead both.
Hard aport!
Make smoke.
Make smoke. Full ahead both.
Signal to Prinz Eugen.
"Good-bye and good hunting."
- That's all, Becker.
- Very good, Sir.
Cease fire, Captain.
Cease fire.
Cease fire, Sir.
Signal to Group West.
"Prinz Eugen successfully detached and proceeding independently."
"Have been unable to shake off enemy cruisers because of radar."
"Will attempt to break away during the night."
- Thank you, Mueller.
- Very good, Sir.
All right, Captain, you may resume your original course.
- Starboard 20.
- Starboard 20.
Starboard 20.
Contact!
There she is... Starboard beam.
Hard astarboard!
What is it?
All right.
- One hit on the port bow, Sir.
- What is the damage?
Very slight, Sir, and no one wounded.
We will have the damage repaired in a few hours.
That is good. That is good.
- Lindemann.
- Yes, Sir.
If there were submarines in this area, we would zigzag, wouldn't we?
Of course, Sir.
And the cruisers following us would be obliged to do the same.
- Yes, Sir, but I would...
- Captain,
I want you to set a zigzag pattern.
Hold speed at 20 knots.
In exactly two hours we shall stop zigzagging
...and proceed at full speed in whatever direction we're headed.
We will be out of radar range before they realize that they have lost us.
This hit Victorious claims it hasn't slowed Bismarck down at all.
I know, Sir. She's been zigzagging now for more than two hours.
That's odd.
She must know we haven't any submarines in the area.
I wonder if Victorious can get off another strike tonight.
- I'm afraid not. It's too dark now.
- Signal from Norfolk, Sir.
Yes?
What is it?
Sir, they've...
They've lost contact with Bismarck.
This is London.
Over 24 hours have passed...
...since the battleship Bismarck destroyed HMS Hood.
It is reported that the British have attacked the Bismarck...
...with aircraft from a carrier, but Berlin says the attack was beaten off successfully.
Berlin adds that Bismarck was able subsequently...
...to shake off the surface vessels pursuing her.
The German battleship has survived...
...the heaviest guns and ships in the British Navy, and the gloomy speculation now is,
...that the British Navy may have trouble finding her, let alone destroying her.
Of one thing we can be sure...
...the lights will burn late in the admiralty tonight.
This is her last known position,... and this... her farthest on.
That means she has to be somewhere inside that circle.
In this sector, search aircraft from Victorious.
To the south and west, the cruisers Suffolk and Norfolk.
That leaves two possibilities.
Either she's broken back to Germany or she's headed for one of the French ports.
Now, Miss Davis.
If you were Bismarck, what would you do?
Well, I suppose I'm not very brave.
I'd head for home, Sir.
And a very sensible thing to do, too.
Plenty of fuel, good repair facilities, complete protection.
But not Lutjens or any other
German fleet commander.
Why not?
Because in Nazi Germany, he'd lose face.
I've fought these people before.
They have to prove their superiority every day.
- That's their one tremendous weakness.
- Sir.
- Yes?
- Signal from the Commander-in-Chief.
"King George V running short of fuel."
"Can't maintain full speed much longer."
Supposing she is heading for a French port.
It won't be long before she gets friendly submarine support and complete air cover.
Too late to stop her then.
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at Brest.
Supposing Bismarck joins up with them...
...and all three of them decide to come out together.
What then?
What's the trouble?
He just collapsed, Sir. I think he's got a temperature.
Take him in the office.
Why is this man on duty if he's sick?
I don't know, Sir. He didn't report sick.
Ring the sick bay and get someone over here.
Aye-aye, Sir. Simms, take over.
- All right. Leave him here.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Sorry about this, Sir.
If you had a temperature, why the devil didn't you report sick?
I'm sorry, Sir.
I didn't want to miss anything.
All right, Brown. We'll get you along to the sick bay.
If anything happens, I'll let you know.
Thank you, Sir.
What time is it, Miss Davis?
- About 6:30, Sir.
- Morning or evening?
It's a very fine morning, and I think you should go on up and take a short walk.
You haven't been outside for five days.
Take down this message for
Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.
"Our interpretation of best available information..."
"...indicates Bismarck heading for the coast of France."
Proceed accordingly.
Excuse me, Sir, but do you have to stick your neck out quite so far?
I'm afraid that goes with the job.
Make to admiral commanding Force H.
"Proceed to intercept Bismarck, on assumption she's headed for Brest."
"Suggest search by aircraft from Ark Royal."
Your son is in Ark Royal, isn't he, Sir?
Yes, yes. Yes, he is.
- Get that off immediately, will you?
- Yes.
Come in.
Come in, Miss Davis.
Signal for you, Sir.
Thank you.
This is a report on the
Ark Royal's air search.
They haven't found a thing.
- Better tell Captain Shepard.
- Yes, Sir.
Also, two of Ark Royal's aircraft failed to return to the carrier.
No need to tell him that,
- I should think it can't do any good.
- No, Sir.
By the way, how would you like a trip to America?
America, Sir?
The admiralty's sending a mission to discuss a master plot for convoys.
Two regular officers and a Wren officer.
The board picked you as first choice.
It sounds very exciting.
There will be no change, of course...
...until this Bismarck thing is settled, then talk to Captain Shepard.
Aye-aye, Sir. And thank you very much.
Yes, it would have to be long-range aircraft, Catalinas, I should think.
Yes, that's right. Call me back.
- Shepard.
- Sir?
It seems to me our forces are very heavily committed to a single course of action.
Is that based on the definite knowledge that Bismarck is headed for one of the French port?
On definite knowledge? No, Sir.
It's based on my summing up of the general situation.
I felt it was a decision that had to be made.
I hope you're right, Shepard.
I hope to God you're right.
A report from Ark Royal, Sir. they haven't found anything.
All right.
Are you off now, Miss Davis?
Yes, Sir. My watch ends at seven o'clock.
Alright, I seem to have a devil of a lot of work to do.
Do you think you could stay an hour and help me out?
Of course, Sir. I have a dinner date, but that's not until nine o'clock.
Good. Let me have the latest information on the available of aircraft in Force H.
Aye-aye, Sir.
"Coastal command will activate two crossover air patrols."
"The northern-most will cover possible enemy courses from Brest to La Rochelle."
The southern-most will cover
La Rochelle to Cape Finisterre."
Good. Now, if you'll coordinate that with Coastal Command,...
...I'll get on with the business of Force H...
...then you can run along and enjoy your dinner date.
What, at half past one in the morning, Sir?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea what time it was.
By the way, Miss Davis.
I'd like to make arrangements for you to work with me full-time, if you think you could face it.
What I had in mind was to take you off your present duties and make you my assistant.
I appreciate you thinking of me, Sir.
I need someone who's intelligent and dependable.
Quite honestly, someone like yourself.
Well... What do you say?
I don't know quite what to say, Sir.
I... I'd make an effort not to be so rude...
...as I have been in the past, if that's what's bothering you.
It isn't anything like that.
If you want to say no, please say so.
Well, you see...
Director of Operations.
One moment, please, Sir.
It's Captain Farnum... Casualty Section.
Hello, Richard. Yes?
What sort of bad news?
Is there no other information?
I see.
Yes. I appreciate your telling me.
Thank you, Richard.
My son's missing.
His plane ran out of fuel and failed to return.
I'm terribly sorry, Sir.
There's a good chance he'll be picked up.
You were picked up.
When I got out of hospital,... all I could think about was getting back to London.
I wanted to see my wife.
I took a taxi from Waterloo.
As I drove into Welbeck Place, everything looked so familiar.
Every house was just as I remembered it.
Every house except mine.
There was a large black hole in the ground where my house had been.
Uh... Where my wife had been?
I didn't think it was possible to feel such pain.
I know.
I've been through it myself, and I know.
I swore that night...
I'd never again get emotionally attached to a human being as long as I lived... but I made one mistake.
I forgot about... I forgot about my son.
You can't avoid pain by fencing yourself off.
Sometimes you need the help of other people more than anything else.
But you have to let them get close enough to help.
I don't want any help.
I found when I was deeply troubled that I needed people very badly.
People want to be needed.
I found that out, too.
We're in business again.
Bismarck's been spotted by a Catalina flying boat, headed for Brest.
Your hunch was right, Sir.
Excuse me.
Sir, Captain Shepard has offered me a new job, to be his assistant.
I'd like very much to take it.
I hope you'll have no objection.
Jonathan, what have you done to that girl?
She's just been offered a marvelous opportunity...
...to go to America.
It means sure promotion.
Now she's turning all that down just to stay here with you. I don't understand it.
Here's the situation. The flying boat spotted Bismarck at 1030 and has been shadowing ever since using cloud cov...
Jonathan.
I'm sorry, Sir.
- You were saying,...
- The flying boat spotted Bismarck at 1030 and has been shadowing ever since using cloud cover.
From time to time, "Bismarck" has put up very heavy anti-aircraft fire.
By now, the British know where we are.
They'll send out everything they have.
We can sink anything they send out.
What was your latest fuel report?
We've lost about 200 tons from the tanks that were damaged.
- We have 35 percent left.
- That is more than enough.
I want to check the plot.
- Becker.
- Yes, Sir.
- Keep me informed about the fuel situation.
- I will, Sir.
I've requested air cover from the Luftwaffe.
How soon can we expect them to be with us?
Shore-based aircraft can operate approximately that far from the coast, Sir.
We will arrive at that point about dawn tomorrow.
What about King George and Rodney?
What is their position now?
Based on reports from Group West,
I have them plotted 200 miles to the north of us, Sir.
That is good.
They cannot possibly overtake us now.
A day or so in Brest to make repairs and then we come out again with our tanks full.
Also, Lindemann...
I have an idea.
Suppose Scharnhorst and
Gneisenau came out with us.
We would be the most powerful fleet that ever sailed.
Nothing in the world could touch us.
Excuse me, Sir. Personal signal for the fleet commander.
Thank you, Mueller.
"Best wishes on your birthday."
Look.
Adolf Hitler.
This is a great honor.
Yes, please. Right.
Here are the fuel consumption reports for...
...K.G.V. and Rodney, Sir, as close as I can calculate them.
- Don't look too good, do they?
- No, Sir.
They're 140 miles astern of Bismarck.
Can they steam at full speed long enough to overtake her?
If they did, Sir, they wouldn't have enough fuel to get home.
Sir.
By daylight tomorrow, Bismarck will be in range of German air cover.
They'll send out the whole
Luftwaffe to their bearing.
- And a line of U-boats as well.
- Well, we have to slow her down by tonight...
...so Home Fleet can overtake her before she gets into friendly waters.
Well, Renown and Sheffield can't do it.
That leaves... Ark Royal.
Ten hours of daylight left.
Call it nine and a half.
There's time to get off one air strike anyway, with luck, they might get off two.
Yes, Sir.
We'd better get in touch with Ark Royal.
Your torpedoes have been fitted with the new magnetic exploders,...
...so you should get very good results.
You have Bismarck's position, course, and speed.
She's now 24 miles away, bearing 183 degrees.
You can't mistake her.
She's all by herself, so make your attack immediately.
Oh, there's just one final word.
The Home Fleet's 100 miles astern.
Unless you stop Bismarck today, they'll never catch up her.
It's up to you, gentlemen. Good day.
The Sheffield's been detached from the flagship, Sir.
She was ordered to close
Bismarck and shadow her.
How long ago?
This was sent an hour and a half ago, Sir.
An hour and a half?
It wasn't decoded immediately, Sir, because it wasn't addressed to us.
We just happened to pick it up, Sir.
Our pilots have orders to attack any ship alone in that area.
Get down below and send a message to all aircraft.
"Look out for Sheffield."
Send it in plain language and getting it off, immediately.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Bit of a cockup somewhere.
It's the Bismarck, all right!
It's all right. They're ours... Swordfish.
Sounds as if they're going to fly right over us, Sir.
They're using our position to get their bearings.
I can see them now, Sir. There they are.
They're attacking us!
- Full ahead both! Hard aport!
- Full ahead both.
- All guns, hold your fire!
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Torpedo exploded as it hit the water, Sir.
There's another one.
They're exploding short.
What's the matter with those?
It's those damn magnetic exploders.
Here comes one that didn't explode, Sir.
- Hard astarboard.
- Hard astarboard.
That was the Sheffield, Sir,
It just came through from the carrier.
Signal the other aircraft.
Tell them to break off the attack.
- Wheel amidships.
- Wheel amidships, Sir.
We all feel the same about what's happened so there's no point in discussing it.
Let's just say we've learned a very important lesson...
...which may well prove a blessing in disguise.
All right, let's get on with the job.
There's still enough light for one more attack.
Think you're up to it?
Yes, but what about those magnetic exploders?
They're being changed at this moment. We'll go back to contact exploders on torpedoes.
Keep your seats, gentlemen.
I have a message here from the Commander-in-Chief.
"Unless the enemy's speed has been reduced by midnight,..."
..."King George V will have to abandon the chase and turn back for refueling."
There's no need to tell you what that means.
This is our last chance, gentlemen.
I suggest you go below and get something to eat.
You'll be taking off at 1830.
Skipper! Ship bearing green 4-5.
This is it, boys! Come on, let's go!
Hard astarboard!
- Where was that?
- The hit was on the amidships.
- No serious damage, Sir.
- Thank you, Mueller.
- Tell damage control to keep us informed.
- Yes, Sir.
- Hard astarboard!
- Hard astarboard!
Hard aport!
Captain.
Hit in the steering compartment, Sir.
- Put your rudder amidships.
- Rudder amidships.
The rudder won't move, Sir.
What ships are these?
The 4th Destroyer Flotilla, Sir.
They're getting close.
We picked up two very peculiar reports from Coastal Command...
...following the attack by Ark Royal.
The first one says, "Bismarck circling."
The second one reads,
"Bismarck heading nor-norwest."
Nor-norwest? But that's impossible, Sir.
She'd be headed straight for "K.G. V" and "Rodney."
Sounds like faulty identification.
Wrong ship, most likely.
Sir? Signal from "Sheffield."
They made contact with Bismarck.
She's steering north at 10 knots.
That's incredible!
It must be Bismarck.
But what's she doing on that course and at a speed of 10 knots?
- Hit by a torpedo, I'll bet, and damaged.
- Propellers?
Could be, Sir.
Or rudder, and can't maneuver.
We've got a chance now, Sir.
I think we've got a chance.
Yes.
It's the Bismarck, all right.
- Yeoman?
- Sir?
Make to Solent. "Intend to attack with torpedoes.
Ships turning to port.
Firing range 4,000 yards."
Aye-aye, Sir.
Bring on 30 knots.
300 revolutions.
From Captain D, Sir.
"Speed 30 knots."
"Turning to port to fire torpedoes.
Firing range 4,000 yards."
Good! Then it is the Bismarck.
Damage control.
Damage control.
Damage control, Sir.
Captain speaking. I want a report on that rudder.
The divers are down now.
They'll be up in a moment, Sir.
Range 6,000 yards, Sir.
Yes.
I see.
It's impossible to free the rudder, Sir.
It was jammed too badly by the explosion.
How early in the morning can you put a couple of divers over the side?
At first light, Sir, about five o'clock if the sea is not too rough.
I do not care about the sea.
I was thinking about the men, Sir.
Sir, from fleet commander.
Thank you.
"Group West is sending out three seagoing tugs."
"All submarines in the area have been ordered to concentrate at this point."
That is good.
That is very good.
Range 5,000.
Attention all hands. Attention all hands.
This is the fleet commander.
We are having some difficulty repairing the damage to our steering gear,
...but I assure you there is no cause for alarm.
4,500 yards, Sir.
Stand by the torpedo tubes.
Stand by the torpedo tubes.
By morning, we will be in good hands.
And if the British Home Fleet should be foolish enough to appear,
...they will be torpedoed by U-boats.
Meanwhile, let me remind you that our guns have not been damaged.
This is still the most powerful ship afloat.
I have in my hand a message addressed to the entire crew.
"All Germany is at your side."
Your gallantry is an inspiration to our people.
"You will forever occupy a place of honour in the history of the Third Reich."
This message is signed by the Führer.
Range 4,000 yards, Sir.
Port 20, fire when the sights come on.
- Two enemy destroyers on port bow, Sir.
- Alarm port.
Alarm port, Sir!
Range 4,000, bearing 300 degrees.
Guns ready port.
Guns ready port, Sir.
- Illuminate with star shell.
- Illuminate with star shell.
They've seen us!
Now we're for it!
20 degrees to go, Sir.
Fire!
All torpedoes gone, Sir.
Let's get out of here. Hard aport.
- Hard aport.
- Open fire, main armament.
- Torpedo hit amidship, Sir.
- Good man!
Fire!
She's got the Solent.
Good shooting, Lindemann.
- Cease firing!
- Cease firing!
One hit on the armor near the forward boiling room.
The damage can be repaired and it won't affect our speed, Sir.
- Thank you.
- That is good.
Destroyers are still shadowing, Sir.
They have orders to keep track of the
"Bismarck" until the Home Fleet closes.
They claim three hits with torpedoes.
It hasn't even slowed her down.
What about the reports of enemy submarines?
A.C.N.S. says these have been confirmed.
I've notified the Commander-in-Chief.
What is C-in-C doing about it?
He hasn't altered his plans.
I'd like to send him a signal telling him to be careful, but I'm sure he'd resent it.
Cigarette?
No, thank you, Sir.
- I'll be here if you want me.
- Very good, Sir.
Shepard?
Sorry about your son.
Yes, Sir.
Captain Shepard, Sir.
Excuse me, Sir.
I took in an operational signal from one of the destroyers shadowing the Bismarck.
They picked up three flyers in a rubber boat.
It must have been over an hour ago,
Sir, so I couldn't get off in time.
I heard about your son so I thought I'd tell you.
It might not be him at all,
Sir, but you never know.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Oh, Sir, A.C.N.S. has been calling you, Sir. Says it's very urgent.
- Assistant chief of staff, please.
- Yes, Sir.
Hello, Sir. Shepard here.
Jonathan, I've got the most marvelous news.
Your son is alive and well.
He's been picked up by a destroyer.
This is absolutely official. Farnum got the message half an hour ago.
Jonathan?
Don't you understand, Jonathan?
Your son is alive and well.
What did he say, Sir?
He didn't say anything.
Well, if you'll you excuse me, Sir.
Signal for Captain Shepard.
- I'll take it.
- It's from King George V.
What is it?
- They've sighted Bismarck, Sir.
- Oh! Here comes the main event.
Urgent signal for you, Sir.
Right gun load.
Right gun second half charge.
Right gun loading.
How much fuel have we got left?
We shall have to break off action in two hours, Sir.
- Main armament ready.
- Enemy speed 10 knots.
Course 3-5-0, Sir.
They outnumber us 2 to 1 and we can't do more than 10 knots.
What are you saying, Captain?
This is the Bismarck.
We still have all our guns and any moment now the Luftwaffe will arrive.
Open fire, Captain.
- Open fire.
- Fire!
- Open fire!
- Shoot!
Fire!
Shoot!
She's hit.
- Good shooting, Captain.
- Shoot!
Shoot!
Shoot!
Signal from King George V, Sir.
"Bismarck on fire amidships.
Two of her turrets out of action."
All right.
I thought I'd be cheering, Sir, at this point, but I'm afraid I can't.
I know. It's always that way.
Shoot!
Hoffman, we have to flood the forward magazines. Get the men out.
They can't, Sir.
They're trapped by the fire.
There's too much danger of blowing up. Flood them!
What about the men?
I gave an order, Hoffman!
Flood the forward magazines!
Flood the forward magazines!
Our fuel state is critical, Sir.
Get closer. Get closer.
We've got to finish her now!
Shoot!
All the guns out of action except "A" turret, Sir.
- Where is your Luftwaffe now, Sir?
- I don't understand it.
The Führer promised
He promised to send help.
They will be along any minute now. You will see.
He was proud of that.
"Tomorrow, the world."
He said that only yesterday.
He was right.
Heil Hit...
Sir, all the officers on the bridge are dead.
I have to tell you that all the guns are finished!
- Finished? Tell the men to abandon ship!
- Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
We've got her! She's finished!
The Dorsetshire has joined us, Sir.
Tell Dorsetshire to finish her off with torpedoes.
Aye-aye, Sir.
- Cease firing!
- Cease firing!
She's going.
- Yeoman.
- Sir?
Tell Dorsetshire to stand by to pick up survivors.
Aye-aye, Sir.
- Jenkins?
- Sir?
Make to admiralty.
"Bismarck is sunk.
Fleet is returning to Scapa Flow."
Aye-aye, Sir.
Well, gentlemen... let's go home.
- Shepard?
- Sir?
The prime minister would like to see us tomorrow morning at eleven o'clock.
- I assume you can make yourself available.
- Certainly, Sir.
- But why should he want to see me?
- I don't know.
He seems to think you had something to do with this operation.
- Thank you, Sir.
- Well done, Jonathan.
Thank you, Sir.
- Petty Officer Williams?
- Sir.
Take a message for
Telegraphist Brown in the sick bay.
- Tell him the Bismarck's been sunk.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
- May I offer my congratulations, too, Sir?
- Thank you.
Uh, take a message.
"Request pleasure of the company... of Second Officer Anne Davis at dinner."
Accepted.
Good.
Now, I know you must be very tired,...
...and it's nearly nine o'clock, but how about tonight?
Right now.
I'll get my things.
Great heavens.
It's nine o'clock in the morning, and I asked you out to dinner.
We could always make it breakfast, couldn't we?
Why not?
You know, Harvey, these boys worry me.
Four stripes on his arm and he don't even know what time of day it is.
-- English --
December, 1944.
British and American Armies were on the threshold of victory.
Stretched across half of europe.
The allies cathered themselves for the final assault of Germany.
To the north stood montcomery's
Eichth army.
To the south, patton's third.
In the center.
Along an 88-mile front.
A few battle-weary Amercan divisions
Rested in a quiet sector.
To them.
The war seemed already won.
This is their story.
Colonel, we've been flying
Over these woods all week.
There's nothing but trees.
Let's turn back.
Getting hungry, Joe?
The war is over.
I hear CHQ is shipping
Us home for Christmas.
Joe, the German Army still has
Six million men carrying arms.
They're not going home for Christmas.
Hey, there it is.
The German Amry.
Let's go down and have a look.
Buzz him acain. Joe.
I'll get a picturre.
Ok.
This time gun your engine.
Make him look up.
It worked.
Swing around, Joe.
I want to get another one.
Conrad?
I am ashamed of you.
Get up.
They could have killed us, sir.
If you had taken the pains to look carefully.
You would have observed.
It was an unarmed reconnaissance plane.
You would stay in the car
If fighter planes were shooting at us.
I did not lose a man to die in the back
Seat of a car.
Does the Colonel think anyone has a
Choice where to die?
I know where you'll die, conrad...
At home, in your own bed.
Is the Colonel trying to cet rid of me?
I think...
The world is coing to get
Rid of both of us.
Pick up your cap!
Put it on!
Try to look like a soldier!
What good is a soldier anyhow?
He wins, he loses.
What's he good for anyhow?
Conrad, I've told you before.
Never leave the motor running.
Petrol is blood.
I am sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.
Looks like something
On the cround at 10:00.
Let's take a look.
Nothing
Let's go home
Herr oberst Hessler is here.
Nach links, herr oberst.
Colonel Hessler, sir.
Ja.
Well, Hessler...
It has been a long time.
How good it is to see you acain.
You look the same.
A little... a little leaner, perhaps, hmm?
The Russian front does not put meat on a man's bones.
Cenral.
Ah, yes.
War is hard on all of us.
Central heating.
Crystal Chandeliers.
You have a nice cellar.
Field Hitler goering gave me that painting.
Lovely, isn't it?
I imagine he found a barcain in Paris last year.
My corporal is waiting outside. He's had a hard drive.
Is there somewhere in these runs. He can find a bed?
Sit down, Hessler.
You have too little faith.
In the genius of the german people.
A few stones have been knocked down.
But our country is strong...
United... Determined...
And more productive than ever.
The allies think that their constant air raids.
Have undermined our morale.
This they shall never do.
Why send for me, General?
You are our finest panzer commander
Hessler.
You will lead us to victory.
Our Germany is now like an iceberg...
Only a fraction of it can be seen on the surface.
Let me show you some of the results of
What Germany has produced underground.
You will discover a new Germany
And will take a new pride in being a German.
Our latest airplane.
A jet.
It files at more than
900 kilometers per hour.
Within six months.
We will have enough jet fighters
To shoot down every allied plane in the air.
Our V-1 rocket.
Destroyed 20% of london.
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.
The new 70-ton king tiger tank.
It has 21/2 times the fire power
And double the armor of the American tanks.
Our Germany is far from finished, hmm, Hessler?
It's a very... beautiful model, General.
It proves that the Germans
Are still the world's best toymakers.
Ha. The toys we are making these days.
Are not for children.
Let me show them to you.
We will attack...
Throuch the losheim cap.
Which is deffended only by a sincle battalion.
The American division on the schnee
Eifel will be cut off.
The our river bridge will be in our hands.
From there on the Ambleve, with the road network.
In four days, we will be across the river Meuse.
The strategic objective?
Antwerp.
By taking Antwerp.
We split the enemy forces in two.
It will take them 18 months to recover.
By then, we will have air superiority
With our jet encines,
And we will have even more significant
Aeapons- Weapons which can destroy
An entire city with a single blast.
You have forgotten one important detail, General.
With their present control of the air.
The allies will smash our tanks, machine Gun our troops
Bomb the bridges.
And cut our communications.
Suppose I tell you there will be no
Allied planes.
Another secret weapon?
From Spitsbergen, norway...
The northernmost weather station in the world.
We have been waiting two months for this report.
"A low pressure area over northern europe "Starting december
"Low clouds and FOG, which will ground all aircraft."
How long?
Long enough.
If we keep strictly to our timetable.
Unusual clock, isn't it?
It has only 1 cycle...
50 hours.
We have the resources for
50 hours full-scale attack.
Maps... Clocks... Toys
But with what will I fight?
Colonel Hessler,
I am putting you
In comand our armored spearhead.
I got a Christmas cake from home today.
Think I'll be around to eat it?
Bring me the prints as soon
As they're developed.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Kiley.
Find any Germans under your bed this morning?
Marching there all night.
Couldn't sleep a wink.
That's an order.
I want every item on that menu
Delivered to every soldier in the Division,
Especialy those in the forward positions.
Deliver them in time for
Christmas dinner.
Counterintellicence picked this up
From an enemy acent, dated November 29.
"From field marshal Kitel, most secret.
"Officers and men who speak English
"And wanted for special mission.
"Volunteers will report to
General Kohler's headquarters."
What do you make of it?
In my opinion, General,
This is one more confirmation
They're going to attack us.
Come on, Kiley. Not that acain.
They're probably preparing a fifth column
To drop behind our lines.
Were you in the state department, too. Kiley?
I thought your experience was limited to police work.
Haveing have an inspector of police
Doesn't disqualify me from thinking.
All cops aren't flatfoots.
Your limited military experience
Doesn't exactly inspire confidence in your conclusions.
If you think... Why do you say they're mounting an offensive?
I spent 20 years before the war asking questions.
Ever since D-day, you've had me doing the same thing...
Interrocating prisoners.
I can only report what I've learned.
The Grman soldier facing us is still undefeated.
He can still fight.
His leaders know that.
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.
I have io other officers in my section.
We see the same information,
Get the same facts as you.
All of us arrive at one answer,
And yours is a complete opposite.
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,
You'd better lie down.
You may be my superior officer...
He is.
Excuse me, sir.
Here are your prints, Colonel.
Thank you.
Look what showed up on this one.
I took it over the ardennes.
Is this a tiger tank, or isn't it?
So it appears.
Doesn't make a juncle.
Sir.
Tiger belong in jungles.
But when there's one in a peaceful neighborhood.
I recommend we all look under our beds.
Excuse me, sir.
Step outside.
With your permission, sir.
This is from headquarters,
Kiley. Top secret.
The third army has been ordered
To attack the cermans in the saar.
General Patton is launghing the offensive in two days.
Does it seem possible headquarters would commit an entire army
To an offensive in the south
If there were any possibility
Of germans attacking in the ardennes?
With all due respect toheadquarters,
They could be wrong.
Send this to headquarters anyway, pritchard.
There seem to be new features on that tank.
Yes, sir. Anything else?
I'd like a rundown on this german officer.
All right. Send this along.
Yes, sir.
Get up to the line. Tell them to grab some new prisoners.
I want any fresh information I can get.
Yes, sir.
And one thing more...
Why are you in a reconnaissance plane?
You're not a combat soldier.
Trying to shorten the war.
All by yourself?
I just want to enjoy
That nice Christmas dinner you ordered.
I see the Colonel's in fine appetite again.
I am.
Join me in a glass of wine.
Thank you, sir.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Conrad.
Speak.
What does the Colonel wish me to say?
Speak your mind... the truth.
Don't be afraid, Conrad.
I must have someone to tell me the truth.
I've always been fortunate to serve under brilliant men.
Who know everything.
From them I have learned one thing.
When all was lost,
These brilliant men never lost hope.
I admire that.
What else do you admire about these men?
The illusion.
Maybe... l'm not using the right word,
Colonel.
I'm... Not an educated man.
The hope that there's always one more chance,
That is the illusion.
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.
On, it's not my place to speak of such things.
Go on.
I order you to.
Colonel.
This new command...
Is an illusion.
Give it up.
I am martin Hessler.
For years ago, my panzers overran poland in one week.
That was no illusion.
In 39 days.
My tanks smashed all the way to Paris.
That way no illusion.
I conquered the crimea.
That was no illusion.
Today...
I was given a brigade of tiger tanks.
When I have a brigade of tanks.
That is reality.
And who will drive your tanks?
The men you led were soldiers veteran soldiers.
Are there any left?
What will they give you now?
I was by your side in Poland, france, the crimea.
Look at me. I'm no tthe same man.
I jumped in a ditch today
At the sight of an unarmed reconnaissange plane.
My two boys remember me as a good soldier.
They wouldn't believe it,
But, Colonel, I am not the only one.
How sure can you be
Of the men who will drive your tanks?
Major diepel.
Jawohl, oberst.
Diepel.
I want to see my tank commanders.
Have them assemble at once.
Jawohl, oberst.
Conrad.
My boots.
Achtung!
Your commanders, sir.
Boys. Too many boys.
The first battle will turn them into men.
In the old days, I lived six months with my men
Before going into action.
We knew each other.
These are strangers.
Too many boys.
They have never tasted defeat.
Do they know what is expected of them?
They are ready to die for you
Can you ask more?
Sing.
Louder.
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!
Pull up.
We got brass on our tail...
Pull it forward, you idiot!
Heh heh heh.
Drop dead.
Pull it forward, you idiot!
Just a little bit. Hold it.
Hold it! Hold it!
You're dropping my merchandise!
Barrel, Eddie, come on out of there!
Come on, Cortland!
Oh ho ho ho.
Oh, wow.
Disaster.
Oh.
Solid.
Some driver, huh?
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.
Complain to my union.
Yeah, tie it up.
Are we near enemy territory yet?
Too near. Give me a cigarette.
I don't smoke.
When will we see some germans?
Hey, Barrel.
Smoke your own.
You got a cigarette, Eddie?
You kidding?
You cheapskates.
Reach into my duffel bag get me some cigarettes.
What's with you and the germans?
Nothing. I've just never seen one.
I've never even seen a german plane.
When are we going to get any action?
What are you, some kind of a nut?
What kind of replacements they sending us, huh?
"I want to see action."
What's this?
Put that back.
That's merchandise.
Don't tell me there's women where we're going.
Who are you giving these to?
Guffy don't give nothing.
He's peddling them.
Keep tying it up, huh?
Peddling them? To who?
The boys in the front.
They'll need that when they cet to Germany.
There's lots of broads there.
Wow! French perfume!
Champagne
That's going to bring me bills a bottle where we're going
Because there's nothing too good for our boys.
Yeah. What's in here?
The mail.
Are you going to charce them for that, too?
Huh?
No. They wouldn't sit still for that, huh?
Just kidding. Sarge. Just kidding.
No. When you get these good thoughts,
You tell me anyway.
One thing I'm not going back home again is poor!
Keep thinking, Kid. Very nice.
Germans?
This is the up-front front.
Wide-awake bunch of boys.
Don't you people post a sentry?
Sorry. I just came in for a second.
What's the matter with you?
Close the pneumonia hole!
Where where you born, in a barn?
Sorry, sir. We didn't know it was you.
Major Wolenski?
He's over there, sir.
Oh, hello, Colonel.
I wasn't expecting a visit from the front office.
I would've had my men smarten up.
Some hot coffee for the Colonel.
Come over and get warm.
You run a pretty loose outfit here.
That radio's been yakking between Christmas carols
We're all going home.
Here, sit down.
It's tough to try to keep discipline
When the only action around here
Is sitting on your butt, trying to keep warm.
What are the Germans doing on the ridge?
Same thing, except they don't have ny heat.
They exercise to keep from freezing.
I got a little exercise for your boys.
I want a patrol tonight to pick up some prisoners.
Well, there they are.
Hey, Sarge, put those blankets back.
Come on. Shut the window.
Why are you doing that, Sarge?
You know they're out of range.
They'll only shoot back with something heavier.
It's you or them, docface.
I need practice.
That's enough, Sergeant.
You want to play with that popgun, go outside.
What if I take the men out
For a field drill, Lieutenant?
In the weather?
What for?
Because they're drilling, that's why.
I'll let you know when I want a drill,
Sergeant.
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
I'll take that Sergeant.
All right. That's all right.
But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.
Here you are, Colonel.
We got about three hours before dark.
How about some half-and-half?
Just sweeten it.
Bitte.
You are Colonel Hessler?
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
General Kohler's signature is magic.
You will excuse us. Major.
Before you give orders.
May I ask your rank?
Courtesan first class,
Compliments of General Kohler.
I think we have covered everything, Colonel.
General Kohler did not tell me
You were so handsome.
What did General kohler tell you about me?
Nothing.
Whatever I want to know...
I'll find out for myself.
I'm very good at that.
Aren't you going to offer me a drink,
Or have you been at the front so long,
You have forgotten your manners?
What shall we talk about?
Your wife, perhaps?
Won't you join me?
I am told I'm an attractive woman.
You are not paying much attention to me.
Very little has escaped my attention.
General Kohler did tell me one thing.
What he admires most about you
Is your reputation with the ladies.
I regret that is the opinion of my commanding officer.
I have worked very hard
To achieve a reputation as a soldier.
Do not the two go together?
Give the general my compliments.
Tell him thank you,
I appreciate his gesture
And good night.
You can make your own way out.
Zero minus two hours.
All units ready to attack.
Repeat.
Zero minus two hours.
All units ready to attack.
Come with me.
Come on.
Put them down, dummkopf.
Hello, Kiley.
I was curious to see how you interrogate your prisoners.
My other officers may be asking the wrong questions.
I'm afraid you won't hear any new answers.
Sometimes it's more important what you see
Than what they say.
Could we get a little more light in here?
How is that, sir?
Hmm.
So this is the face of the undefeated enemy.
It looks you've captured
A sunday school class.
Is this all they have left.
For their front lines?
Where are their weapons?
Here, sir.
What's this?
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.
Did they put up any fight? No, sir.
Just gave up?
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.
Take a good look at them, Kiley.
They're not even tough enough
To be classified as delinquents.
Go ahead and question them.
Ask them if Germany's going to win the war.
Go ahead, Kiley.
They could be plants
Put in the front lines to misleas us.
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.
Have these prisoners escorted to the rear for proper interrogation.
Yes, sir. Move them out.
Let's go! Move it out!
Sir, all these prisoners
Were carrying these rubber hoses.
Send them along and anything else you've found on them.
Yes, sir.
Do you actually still think
That the Germans are preparing a Major offensive?
Yes, sir, Colonel, I do.
You mean those kids you captured
Are just replacements for more seasoned troofps
Who were sent to the bear to re-form for the big attack?
Yes, sir, Colonel, I do.
Kiley, you're crazy.
Facts mean nothing to you.
Evidenge means nothing to you.
The only thing you can see
Are your own cock-eyed hunches.
Well, that doesn't work in the army.
I'm recommending you for transfer
To a desk in washington.
You can tell the president how to run
Major.
Speak English!
Ok, Lieutenant.
Let's get this stuff out of here.
Luftwaffe calling standard O.B.
Luftwaffe calling standard O.B.

What the...
What's that noise?
It's airplanes.
Everybody out!
Sounds like a thousand of them!
Get battalion.
Move! Move!
Get battalion.
On the double!
Sergeant, haul everybody out!
Everybody out!
Zuckerman, report to me!
On thed duble!
The line's dead, sir.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
What's that?
"What's that?" And you wanted to see Germans, right?
Come on!
On the double!
On the double!
Turn them over! Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Come on! Let's get this baby moving!
Colonel Hessler reports

Prisoners at the bar, these are the jurors that are to try you.
If you wish to object to any of them, you must do so as they come to the book to be sworn, and your objection will be heard.
Michael Arthur Rubens.
Take the book in your right hand and say the words on the card.
I swear by almighty God...
Steven William Walter Brown.
I swear by almighty God that
I will faithfully try the issues joined between the Queen and the prisoners at the bar, and true verdict give.
Are you all sworn?
Members of the jury, the prisoners stand indicted for that they on 15th January 1962 in the county of London murdered Arthur Walter Baxter in the course of theft.
They have pleaded not guilty.
It is your charge to say, having heard the evidence, whether they be guilty or not.
Sit down.
My Lord, I prosecute in this case with my learned friend, Mr Crowhurst.
The defendants are represented by Mr Montgomery and Mr Morris.
My Lord, members of the jury, the prosecution's case is that the 4 defendants conspired to rob a garage, known as the Lantern Garage, situated in Perth Street in the West End of London - and that this plan led to the savage murder by the accused of one Arthur Baxter, who was the night attendant at that garage.
I'll bring before you evidence of four hooligans on the rampage in the suburbs and in the West End of London, who knew where to find about £100 in cash.
This money was kept in the cash box in the office of the Lantern garage.
I will show you how the four defendants left their homes in Wharf End in the East End of London, scandalised, intimidated and brow-beat their way to Perth Street, broke into the garage through the side door, and opened the cash box to find not £100, but 15 shillings.
I put it to you that when they were surprised in their act of plunder by this 74-year-old widower,
Arthur Baxter, they brutally put him to death with a knife.
Describe to us the scene that met your eyes.
The body of the deceased was behind the desk, doubled up.
The clothing was dishevelled and very bloodstained.
In the deceased's hand was a £1 note.
The floor was covered in blood, files from an open cabinet were scattered about.
There'd been a violent struggle.
Did you perform a post-mortem examination on Arthur Baxter?
I did. On the morning of January 16th.
Would you tell us what you found?
The main artery leading from the heart had been severed.
There was a severe haemorrhage in the left lung.
There were six deep incisions in the upper back, penetrating to about three inches.
There were two incisions in the upper left lung, two between the left clavicle and the spine, two in the lower artery.
With what were these incisions consistent?
They were consistent with having been made by a knife or sharp blade.
Acting on the statements of the accused,
I ordered the area around
Waterloo Bridge to be dragged.
What did you find,
Superintendent Larner?
A knife, my Lord.
Would you look at this please?
Exhibit seven.
This is the knife, my Lord.
You are an analytical chemist at the police laboratories?
- Yes.
- Would you look at that knife, and tell this court whether it was the one you examined.
Yes, that's the one.
You found specks of blood underneath the blade and analysed it.
What were your findings?
I compared it with blood from the deceased. They were identical.
Expand on that statement please...
- See if Patrick Bell's arrived.
- Yes.
The knife had been in water some time...
- No sign of Patrick Bell.
- What is the idiot playing at?
- He has rather a long distance to travel.
- So have we.
- Your name is George Henry Tanner.
- Yes, sir.
Address his Lordship, will you please?
And is your address
18 Acorn Lane, Wembley?
Yes, sir.
Are you the owner of the Lantern
Garage, Perth Street, Soho? I am.
- Was Arthur Baxter employed by you?
- Yes, he was.
Now...
I want you to look at the defendants and tell his Lordship and the jury if you recognise any one of them.
- Er, yes.
- Who?
- Er, the one at the end.
- You mean Coulter?
Yes, sir.
Would you tell this court how you recognise the defendant Coulter?
Yeah. He's an apprentice mechanic, sir.
He works for my friend Mr Champney who runs a garage in Hackney.
He visited my garage with his boss.
- When?
- Just after Christmas.
Tell us what happened, Mr Tanner.
Take your own time and watch his Lordship's pencil.
Er, well, I always work in the office till about seven at night.
This was about 4.30 in the afternoon.
Hang around, Stan,
I'll only be a minute.
Anybody home? Harry!
How have you been since Christmas?
I got your card, thanks.
See, I'm in the money.
- That's my apprentice Stan, remember?
- Yes, I remember.
- What's the matter, Harry?
- I'm in a bit of a jam about storage space.
- I was wondering...
- If it's about that shed, I sold it.
I got an offer I couldn't resist.
Sid, this is Mr Champney.
He owns the garage in Hackney.
Harry, this is Sid, my day man.
- How are you?
- Hi.
- That's a bit risky, isn't it?
- What?
The cash box isn't hidden.
Haven't you got a safe yet?
- How much you got in there?
- Never more than £100.
You must be round the bend!
A business like this with no safe.
It's on order, I promise you. Here.
There. It's on order.
It's all right.
It's not fair on Arthur.
He's got to stay here all night.
- I usually empty it at midnight.
- I wouldn't like his job at night.
The safe is coming.
It'll be all right.
- You know the trouble with you?
- What?
You worry too much.
When he saw you looking at him, he averted his eyes from you and the cash box?
Yes, sir.
- Sly and furtive, you said?
- Yes, sir.
Isn't it strange, Mr Tanner, that you didn't have a safe?
Yeah, well, I've been meaning to get one.
I should have got one, but you'll have to put that down to a trusting nature.
- I've been taken for a mug many times before.
- Yes, quite.
About the night of January 15th.
- Did you empty the cash box?
- Er, yes.
About midnight as usual?
No, no. It was a Thursday, and I wanted to take the cash at about 10.30 because there were wages to make up. and my wife objects if I sit up late.
How much was left in the cash box at
10.30 on the night of January 15th?
Oh, about... er... 15 bob.
15 shillings.
Tell me, Mr Tanner.
Would Coulter have known that you always empty the cash box early on a Thursday?
I didn't mention that at the time.
Thank you. That's all.
- Mr Carlton...
- Tanner...
- What?
- Tanner.
Mr Tanner.
You're a trusting man.
Yes, sir.
More than ordinarily trusting.
Yes, sir.
Much more than ordinarily trusting.
You trust anybody.
It never occurred to you anybody might want your cash box.
That's correct, sir.
So trusting that you watched the defendant Coulter every moment that he stood there?
- Oh, but...
- You did on your own admission.
"I watched the defendant Coulter.
He had a sly and furtive expression as he watched the cash box."
Yes, but I mean, it's obvious he was watching the cash box.
- Some you trust and some you don't?
- That sort of look I don't trust.
What is there about that face you wouldn't trust?
Well, er...
It's the er... the eyes and the mouth.
That's only my opinion.
Do you believe that there's a criminal type of face?
Yes, I do. Yes, I do!
- That face, for instance?
- Well, as I said, it's only my opinion.
We must certainly never forget that it's only your opinion.
Mr Tanner, you've been asked whether you trusted the face of the defendant Coulter.
Did you have any reason to trust his face or him?
No. None at all.
And to quote your own words, you have been taken for a mug before?
Yes, sir.
That's all, Mr Tanner. Thank you.
Call...
Er...
Charles Mark Salmon.
Are you employed as a conductor by the London Transport Executive?
Yes.
Look at the defendants, Mr Salmon.
Have you seen them anywhere before?
Yes.
Tell us where and when.
I saw these boys at the stop in East Indies Street.
There was quite a bit of fighting.
INDISTINCT SHOUTING
Hang on, fellas! 'Ere, fellas!
All right, lady?
Let me give you a hand.
I don't want none of that on my bus.
- None of what?
- Put that knife away.
- I'm putting it away.
- You nearly killed that old lady.
What old girl?
Don't give me that.
I've got six at home. If they were like you, I'd beat them!
You can start on me, mate!
Not on the bus, but I'll meet you outside!
- Let's get off then!
- No, you get off. All of you!
All right.
Give us your fares.
Give them to me, fellas.
There's your wages.
Now go and get them, eh?
I'm sorry, sir.
- Get out of it!
- Excuse me!
Get out of it, you ruffians!
- Was this the knife?
- Yeah.
- It was this sort of knife.
- Definitely this type of knife.
I remember him closing it.
Now, throughout this incident, you said that Coulter's attitude was surly, aggressive and menacing, didn't you
Definitely.
Thank you, Mr Salmon.
What newspapers do you read?
- Newspapers?
- Mmm. Newspapers.
Well, I suppose the Daily Mirror.
On Sundays, the Sunday Express.
News of the World?
On your way to work yesterday, did you read your paper?
I glanced at the headlines.
- Is that all?
- I haven't got time for more.
What do you do with your time?
I work, sir. I work very hard.
Speak to his Lordship, will you?
Do you work overtime?
Yes, my Lord.
How much do you earn?
With all deductions, about £11 a week.
- That's including overtime.
- What are your commitments?
- How many have you got in your family?
- Eight of us.
You must have an anxious life.
How do you manage?
I get by.
You don't have time to think or read, it must be one long headache.
I manage.
I cope.
I get on top of things.
Are you an out-patient at St Thomas's Hospital?
Yes, I am.
Being treated for a nervous disorder?
Yes, I am.
We'd better change the subject, hadn't we?
When you first saw these boys, what was your impression?
I don't know what you mean.
What sort of people did they seem to be, Mr Salmon? Milkmen?
Postmen?
Politicians?
Teddy boys.
- What do you mean by teddy boys?
- Well...
They dressed like Teddy Boys and they behaved like...
Teddy Boys.
Have you got any Teddy Boys in your family?
- Oh, no.
- How do you know?
They don't behave like hooligans, sir. Not that I know of.
I hope they don't.
I hope so too. Thank you.
My learned friend is interested in your private life.
- Tell me, do you have a happy home life?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Are your children troublesome?
No, no.
- Do you manage to live on your wages?
- We always have done, sir, and we always shall.
Thank you, Mr Salmon. That's all.
That'll do, Mr Salmon.
Call Samuel Wallace.
- He's here.
- Where was he?
I met him coming back from the Tower.
- The Tower?
- Should be in the bloody Tower.
Do you know the defendant
Stanley Coulter?
- Yes, I do.
- Has he ever been to your billiard hall?
Yes. But I should tell you that he'd been barred from the hall because he was a troublemaker.
No, Mr Wallace. What can you tell us about the evening of January 15th?
Oh. Certainly, yes.
It was quiet, see?
Early in the evening, I was at the snack bar, serving a customer, when I first saw him come in.
What do you want?
I can see there's nothing doing here.
Not for you there isn't.
Go on, off out of it.
I'm looking for somebody.
Not in here, you're not.
Look outside.
How can I look outside if he's in here?
What happens if I don't go?
Wheatley's over there.
He's liable to go raving mad.
I'll pay him back.
How? You haven't got 50 quid.
Tell him I'll have 50 quid.
Tell him I'll have a lot more.
You?
Come on, Stan.
That's about the size of it, yes.
Yes. Same colour.
Yes. Same type of knife.
You say that Coulter was barred?
Did he know he was barred?
He certainly did.
I made that very plain to him.
He was a scorer at snooker games.
He used to get a percentage of the winnings.
He mis-scored in favour of a player and the game was declared void.
We believed he'd done it deliberately.
Thank you, Mr Wallace.
Mr Wallace, your customers play for stakes.
Have you got a licence for gambling?
No, sir. They do it without me knowing.
I see.
On this night when Coulter made a mistake with the marking, did you know they were gambling for £50?
No, sir. I found out when the bubble burst.
I see.
What do you do when you find they're gambling?
I sling them out, sir.
But my facts are that on this occasion, it wasn't the gamblers, it was Coulter who was "slung out".
Well, I...
Speak to his Lordship.
Are those the facts or aren't they?
Well, yes, they are, but...
No buts.
I put it to you that if Coulter had been gambling, he wouldn't have been slung out.
He might have been.
He was an undesirable.
What do you mean by that?
He was always on the fiddle.
Always trying to con people.
Oh, you mean he wasn't gambling for £50?
No re-examination, my Lord.
Thank you, Mr Wallace.
Call Randolph St John.
- And you are a stockbroker?
- Yes.
On January 15th, were you driving along Wharf End Broadway?
Yes, I was.
- At about what time?
- About 7.15 pm.
Kindly look at the defendants over there, and tell his Lordship and the jury if you've ever seen them before.
- All of them. That night.
- What happened?
One of my tyres went flat and I pulled up rather quickly.
Another fellow behind me brushed my bumper.
I got out and we exchanged a few words.
You've got a blow out anyhow.
There's no garage around here.
Wait a minute. Phone this number.
- They'll send a man along.
- Thank you.
Get away from there!
- What are you doing?
- You've got a blow out.
That's nothing to do with you.
Clear off!
And if you find something valuable, you're welcome to it!
- Careful, Ralph.
- I'm not intimidated by a few thugs!
- Careful who you're calling names.
- Here's some money. Now go away!
Don't give them money!
- There are four of them!
- I don't care!
- They've gone.
- It's just like Chicago!
It's just like bloody Chicago.
Look at this thing.
If I'd had time,
I'd have called a policeman.
You were frightened?
I wasn't frightened, so much as the lady.
I don't believe they'd have done much.
Their type is a coward at heart.
Thank you, Mr St John.
You didn't call a policeman because you hadn't time?
Yes.
I suggest that the real reason you didn't call a policeman, was because the lady with you wasn't your wife.
That is nonsense.
I suggest it was your attitude that was aggressive, not the defendants.
I suggest that you wanted to put up a show for your lady.
Absurd! I wasn't threatening them.
Now, one last question, Mr St John.
When you first saw these boys surrounding your car, what was your impression - your first reaction?
What sort of boys were they?
Describe them.
They were trying to steal from the boot of my car.
No, no. I mean, what sort of boys?
- Uncouth?
- Yes.
- Uncivilised?
- Yes.
- Teddy Boys?
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Mr St John, was the lady you were with that day known to your wife?
Certainly.
Did your wife know you were taking her to the theatre?
Yes.
- Who was this young lady?
- My wife's sister.
Thank you. That'll be all.
Worth a try.
Robert Norman Albert Brewer.
And your occupation?
I'm employed by borough council as attendant in gentleman's convenience, Wharf End Broadway.
Mr Brewer, look at the four accused, please.
Have you ever seen them before?
Yes, I have. They all come into my washroom that evening.
Tell us what happened please.
Well, I was outside in office, see, and I heard this row, so I come down the steps...
INDISTINCT SHOUTING
He shoots! Goal!
'Ere! Where do you think you are?
- Playing for Spurs, of course!
- No, it's West Ham, innit?
Behave yourselves.
I've had enough of yobbos.
What do you mean, yobbos?
Be careful what you call people, grandad.
Just get out of here, go on!
Me, him, him and him are coming into some money, then we won't have to come down this stinking hole.
That's right.
Not after tonight we won't.
We're only your best customers.
Go on. Sling your hooks.
Get out of it, smelly.
And you're not coming,
I told you!
- I'm coming.
- You're not old enough, Billy!
- I'm old enough to go to his garage!
- Get lost! You'll get us all nicked.
You heard him. Now, stay here!
They left the young one, but he ran after them.
Let's be sure of their words,
Mr Brewer.
Herne said, "Me, him, him and him are coming into some money"?
Yes, sir.
And Coulter said they wouldn't go down there again after that night.
- What did you understand by that?
- They could afford a better place.
And Herne said, "I'm old enough to go to the garage."
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr Brewer.
Don't leave us just yet, Mr Brewer.
- How old are you?
- 70, sir.
- What was your job before you retired?
- A carpenter, sir.
What was your wage when you were a carpenter?
Anything between 13-14 pound a week, sir.
And what's your wage now?
Altogether, £3.18 a week, sir.
Do you think a boy of 17 today gets too much money?
Yes, sir, I do.
- You called these boys "yobbos"?
- Yes, sir.
Yobbos?
What do you mean by yobbos?
Er... Yobbos is er... layabouts.
Why layabouts? They were just out for the evening, weren't they?
I know yobbos. They're Teds.
Are you proud of being a lavatory attendant?
That's a most unseemly question.
The witness needn't answer it.
Well, I will answer it.
I am proud. Very proud.
Pardon, m'Lud.
I withdraw the question.
You can't.
The witness has answered it.
I'm sorry, m'Lud.
Thank you, Mr Brewer.
It's all right, Mr Brewer.
You can go now.
Call Gordon Percy Lonsdale.
- Is Patrick Bell still out there?
- Yes.
Stay with him till he's called. We can't have him wandering off again.
I was with the Ministry of Pensions.
I'm retired now.
Speak up please, and address his Lordship.
Sorry. I was with the Ministry of
Pensions for 32 years. I'm retired.
Where were you on January 15th at about 8.30 pm?
I was in a queue outside the Princess Cinema in the West End.
It was my wedding anniversary.
I'm a widower.
Look at the four accused,
Mr Lonsdale.
- Have you ever seen them before?
- Yes. Outside the cinema that night.
- Did you have cause to speak to them?
- I did. They were causing a nuisance.
One at ten shillings!
BILLY: One at ten shillings!
- One ten shilling, please.
- Sorry. There's a queue.
I'm in it.
You have to wait for the commissionaire to call.
But he...
Won't they serve you?
Ever been had then? Good picture?
Enjoy the picture?
A bit short though.
I bet that film steamed your glasses up! Aren't you 16 yet?
Move off or I'll call a policeman.
No, I'm stopping. This if for everybody. I can stay here.
- I'll give you a minute.
- I'm stopping.
This is a public thoroughfare.
I saw you do that!
You're the sort who'll end up in prison.
The type who hits old ladies over the head at night.
You ought to be in an institution.
- What are you talking about?
- You just cut that down!
- I didn't cut nothing.
- Don't come that on me!
Everybody saw you do it. Look at the blade of your knife, huh?
Yes. This is the knife, my Lord.
When he tried to cut the rubbish bin, he made a pattern of blunt edges that I remember very clearly.
Are you absolutely sure of this?
Oh, absolutely, yes.
Thank you.
Part of your evidence was,
"as soon as I saw them" meaning my clients,
"I recognised them as wild, aggressive and surly."
Can you recognise these qualities in people on sight?
I think I can, yes.
Could tell us where you took your degree in psychiatry?
I haven't taken any degree.
Not? Oh.
I suggest it was your attitude that was wild, aggressive and surly, and it provoked these incidents you so graphically described.
That's nonsense, it's not true.
Very well, whether it's true or not, perhaps you could demonstrate to the court these qualities you possess, the ability to recognise the wild, aggressive and surly. M'Lud?
I would like to call a person who I may call later as a defence witness.
- What do you want to do with him?
- I want him to stand beside me to assist this witness demonstrate his power of character assessment.
Have you any objection, Mr Webster?
None at all, my Lord.
Very well.
Call Patrick Bell.
Patrick Bell!
Just stand there, Mr Bell.
Will you take off your overcoat?
Now, this gentleman has certain physical characteristics.
Perhaps the court may hear your judgment of his character.
I wouldn't dream of doing that. I've no wish to insult the gentleman.
He's prepared for anything you have to say. How does he strike you?
I can't do that. Why not?
Because this is a law court, not a public street?
Come along, Mr Lonsdale. Be bold.
In his natural environment, I'd say he possessed some of these features.
If you want me to be more explicit, the hair, the sideburns, the forehead, those clothes.
But I could be wrong.
I'm not infallible.
What is his "natural environment"?
I don't know.
Of course I don't know.
Could you also be wrong about the defendants?
I wasn't though, was I?
They behaved like vandals.
Thank you.
Will you wait outside?
Now, I'm going to ask you once more.
Was there anything in your attitude that provoked the defendants into this vandalism?
Nothing at all.
Thank you.
Mr Lonsdale, about the serrations on the blade of the knife.
Have you any doubt that this was the knife you saw?
None at all.
Thank you, Mr Lonsdale. That's all.
- You're a shop assistant?
- Yes.
On January 15th, were you in the saloon bar of the Knight's Arms public house,
Tottenham Court Road at about 9pm?
- Yes.
- Would you speak up.
- Pardon?
- Would you speak up?
Yes.
Do you remember meeting any of the defendants there?
I do.
Tell the court what happened.
I was sitting at the bar with a friend. We were going dancing.
'These two fellas come up.'
Hello, darling. Drink up.
Where are we going?
- Where are we going then?
- Go away.
Where are we going?
I thought we were going dancing.
That's right. Dancing.
Look at the time.
Excuse us. We've got business.
There's time.
We're laughing here.
We've got to get ready.
- We've got an appointment.
- The nerve!
I suppose you think we're a couple of tarts.
"We've got some business to do."
Is that right?
Yes.
"There's time," said Coulter.
Thompson said, "We've got to get ready."
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- You objected to them, Miss May?
- Yes, I did.
You're sitting in the bar of a public house and you object because two boys talk to you?
It wasn't that.
I just didn't like them.
- Why?
- I don't like Teds.
- Why?
- They're roughs. They're trouble.
- I suggest to you that you didn't object...
- I certainly did.
Will you let me finish! And you were waiting to be picked up.
Your objection was that they left you in the lurch.
That's not true.
All right.
Do you frequent public houses, Miss May?
No, not usually. We were waiting for the dance to start swinging.
Thank you. That's all.
- Call...
- Ann Celia Barker.
Are you employed as a barmaid at the
Three Aces public house in Perth Street?
I am.
Is it possible to see the Lantern
Garage from the window of your bar?
Oh, yes. It's only about 30 yards away and it's all lit up at night.
There are four accused here, Miss Barker.
Would you tell his Lordship and the members of the jury if you've ever seen them before.
Yes. They all came into the bar on the evening of January 15th.
It was about 20 to 11.
'When they sat down, I couldn't see what they were doing,
'but then I went to collect some pots.'
Nothing to worry about.
It's a garage like any other.
Do what you're told and you can't go wrong.
Ah, come on, let's have it away.
Here you are, Stan, it's like this.
Look at this cigarette packet, would you?
Do you recognise it?
Yes. This is the one.
Did you see who did that drawing?
Yes, it was that one.
What were the others doing?
Oh, they kept looking at the garage.
Would the usher show that to the jury?
Members of the jury, you will see that there are two drawings like petrol pumps in front of a building.
Miss Barker, how many petrol pumps are there at the Lantern Garage?
There are two. I thought they were drawing the garage.
I thought, "Trouble", as soon as I saw them.
- What did you do the following morning?
- I contacted the police.
The detective found the plan in a dustbin.
Thank you, Miss Barker.
"I thought, "trouble", as soon as I saw them" you just said.
Why did you think trouble,
Miss Barker?
I expect trouble all the time in that district.
Let me put this to you.
If an identical situation had arisen and they'd been dressed in city suits with short hair, you wouldn't have thought "trouble" then?
No, of course not.
I know this type.
No more questions.
I'm a little surprised that you've no further questions, either about the cigarette packet or the conversation about the garage, or the defendants looking through the windows.
No, my Lud, I accept the witness's statement. I have no questions.
Neither have I, my Lord.
Thank you, Miss Barker.
My Lord, members of the jury, that is the case for the prosecution.
We're past time, Mr Webster, so I shall adjourn.
Be upstanding. All persons having anything further to do...
I knew that cigarette packet would do it. He hasn't got a case now.
We'll get a decision tomorrow.
Tell Hodgson we can take that brief in Exeter.
Right.
You lost the knife.
I told you,
I lost it the following day.
If you'd lost it then, somebody else might have used it.
They've identified your knife!
- It couldn't have been mine.
- Why are you so certain?
I told you, I put it by my bed.
Did any of you see it after that?
- You may have lost it.
- I didn't see it.
I still had it when I got home.
All right.
Now, Webster is...
Will you listen to me?!
Webster is blackening your characters to such an extent that you'll be found guilty, knife or no knife.
You tell me what the witnesses say is true.
I can't go on shouting
"circumstantial evidence"!
You've got to give me something to go on.
- We've told you.
- You haven't.
Look at the statements you made.
You confirm everything they say.
You threatened an old man - you've admitted it. You took a...
You took a pound off a girl, you said so.
You deliberately slashed the rubbish bin.
Don't you understand? This is hooliganism right across London.
I thought you were defending us.
What have you given me to defend?
You throw a fare across the bus.
Why were you using a knife on a bus?
Cleaning your nails?
You don't believe anything we say...
If I believed you, you'd be found guilty on your own admission!
You spread your net of terrorism half over London!
Listen to me. You knocked down an old woman at the bus stop.
- I was going to apologise.
- Not good enough!
- I was going to apologise.
- Don't keep saying that like a parrot!
Why were you looking through the door of the garage?
I wasn't looking at the cash box.
I can't remember what it was.
You'll have to remember, if we stay here all night.
What are you hiding that's more important than yourself, you idiot?
- Lay off him.
- I'm not paid to lay off him!
Leave him alone, you fat old...!
He didn't mean it.
Billy. Why is fat a swear word?
- I didn't mean it.
- You used it as a swear word.
- He didn't. He just called you fat.
- Yes, he did.
No, he didn't! I knew about that word long before you were born!
I've never been allowed to forget it.
- He's said he's sorry, didn't he?
- What difference does that make?
Does it help him understand why he said it?
Or what happened to me when he said it?
I was back at school, standing far away from the swimming pool.
- Why?
- I didn't want to be pushed in, you chump.
Work it out yourself. A fat boy has to stay at the back.
If he doesn't, you can depend upon some youngster singing out,
"Look at that fat man."
Well, we've dealt with fat boys.
Let's talk about Teddy Boys.
I've told you more about myself than any of you have told me about yourselves.
I don't want you to go into the box and just repeat what's written here.
I want the court to hear what Ginger and Barney and Stan and Billy are really like behind this great tough act.
And, remember, you'll be dealing with Victor Webster.
My Lord, members of the jury, in the case for the prosecution, you have heard that the four defendants set out, on the evening of January 15th, with a plan to rob a garage.
Any number of witnesses have stated that they betrayed their intentions by advertising them in a vicious, unruly and boastful manner.
It has been repeatedly suggested that they entered the garage, were intercepted by the attendant, stabbed him to death, and on the way home, they threw the knife, the weapon of murder, into the Thames.
Then they conspired together to conceal from this court the responsibility for this savage act.
You have heard Coulter's knife identified before and after the crime.
A cigarette packet, a manner of behaving, all these have been brought before you as evidence.
They are nothing but a farrago of circumstantial evidence which would never have got to court had the defendants not finished their evening near the garage, hadn't happened to leave the public house moments before the murder.
Apart from that, my clients have no case to answer.
I shall show you that the knife is one of thousands on sale in London of an exactly similar make, and that the serrations on the blade could be easily reproduced.
The defendants crossed the bridge that night, but so did thousands of others, on foot, by bus, and in innumerable cars.
You will wish to hear of the hooligan behaviour of these boys.
My Lord, they will go into the box and you will hear an unbiased account.
This was a perfectly ordinary outing, as innocent and as innocuous occasion as any upon which four boys of this age have organised an evening out, on that barren Thursday night before payday.
Call Stanley Herbert Coulter.
Take the book and repeat the words on the card.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
You're Stanley Herbert Coulter and you live at 106
Grand Buildings, Wharf End?
Yes, sir.
First, remember what Mr Tanner said about your seeing his cash box and overhearing the conversation?
- What have you got to say about that?
- It didn't happen like he said, sir.
Sid, this is Mr Champney.
He owns the garage in Hackney.
Sid's my day man.
- How do?
- Hi.
- That's a bit risky, isn't it?
- What?
The cash box isn't hidden.
Haven't you got a safe yet?
- How much is in there?
- Never more than £100.
You're round the bend!
A business like this with no safe.
It's on order,
I promise you. Here.
It's on order. It's all right.
It's not fair on old Arthur
He's got to stay here with that, you know.
I take out what's in it at 12.
- I wouldn't like his job at night.
- I know.
The safe is coming.
It's all right.
- You know the trouble with you?
- What?
You worry too much.
- Is this the calendar?
- Yes, sir.
Exhibit 13.
Members of the jury, you'd better see it.
Of course, you did see the cash box being opened.
Yes, I did see that, sir.
Did you at any time plan to rob the garage?
No, sir.
Let's come to the events of January 15th.
It's been said that you left home that evening with a plan to go to town and break into a garage.
Is this true?
No, sir. We hadn't intended to go out at all that night.
I'd seen Billy outside the building site where Ginger works and I went over.
# Tote that barge!
# Lift that bale!
Is that all you managed to do then?
- Don't kid us you're working.
- Hello, Stan.
That's a man's job, not for nippers!
You couldn't do this if you tried.
- Let's have a go then.
- Oh, no!
The union would have something to say about that, eh, Charlie?
That's right, Ginge.
You're scared to have a man on the job!
Hey!
You going out tonight?
- Going out tonight, Stan?
- I'll think about it.
What you gonna do if not?
Gonna watch telly?
There's a good show on.
You watch it.
TRAIN RUMBLES PAST
- I suppose the doctor left here quickly.
- She was here all morning.
Should have got a man doctor.
She don't know what she's doing half the time.
Here, give me that, I'll take it.
I've done some bread and butter pudding.
Grub's up. Come and get it.
Let's have you then.
Oof! You weigh a ton.
Nice bit of fish.
Cooked specially for you in the grill room of the Savoy Hotel.
I'm obliged.
Them flats are going up quick, eh?
Yeah.. We'll have one of them ourselves soon.
That's right.
With bells on.
No, straight up. The town clerk's put us on top of the list.
Pull the other one, Stan.
Ask Dad what's happened to that wireless.
Them floorboards are damp again.
I'll see Dad about it.
Hey, how do you fancy a bit of bread and butter pud?
All right, mate.
- She don't want any pudding.
- Take her some just in case.
- I told you, she don't want any.
- All right!
She's been going on about those new flats again.
- You been down the council?
- What's the use?
- There were 4, 000 on the waiting list.
- Keep on at them.
- She can't stay here.
- You go down?
- I've been.
- Then stop blaming me.
Her wireless has busted again.
It's that damp.
- I'll fix it.
- You'll fix it?
KNOCKING
KNOCKING
- That's my mum's room there!
- I forgot. You coming out?
If I can make some money,
I'll go to the dogs.
I got ten bob.
So open a bank account.
Now buzz off.
- Should I get my hair cut?
- I don't know. You'll wake my mum.
Don't you shift yourself, will ya?
Stan?
Stan.
Stan.
You ain't half a lot of trouble, waking all the neighbours...
Get me some fags.
Don't tell your dad.
You know you're not allowed to smoke.
Oh, go on, get me some fags.
Bring them back with you.
- It'll go to your chest.
- My chest is all right.
- All right, mate.
- Take it.
- You keep it. Have a smoke on me.
- Oh, thanks.
Gotcha!
Why don't you get off my back?
- I can go to the dogs.
- You're not old enough.
I'm 16, aren't I?
INDISTINCT CHATTER
- I've got the money.
- Get off my back, will ya?
Shove off!
- Let's go to the dogs.
- You're too young.
I'm 16!
- Watch it!
- I'm sorry, Stan.
What are we gonna do tonight?
So the plan wasn't to go to London at all, or to rob a garage?
The plan was to get some marking to finance an evening at the dogs.
Yes, sir.
Mr Salmon has said that he saw you fighting at the bus stop, that you knocked down a lady, jumped on the bus, brandished a knife, and when you saw him, you threatened to beat him up. Is he right?
Well, yes, sir, but it didn't happen at all like he said.
When Billy and me got to the bus stop,
'Ginger was going on about his union card.'
He's not a member!
- Hello, fellas.
- Stan and me's going to the dogs.
- It's a mug's game.
- Are you going to meet a bird?
We might go to the pictures.
Yeah. Stan, how's your mum?
- She had the doctor today.
- No, she didn't.
- She's a woman doctor, ain't she?
- No. She's a man doctor.
Stan, your mum got cancer?
Here, he was only asking!
Stan!
Here!
Here, fellas!
Here, hang on, fellas.
Hang on, fellas.
That's nice. You've just knocked some old girl over.
What old girl?
- There. Look.
- Where?
I didn't even see her, did I?
- It was when you pushed Billy.
- I didn't do it.
It's him pushing.
She must be all right or he wouldn't have started the bus.
- You should have picked her up.
- I didn't knock her down.
- He knocked her down.
- You always pick on me.
- Who says it was us?
- Go and say you're sorry.
- Go and tell them you're sorry.
- You pushed me.
Just go and say you're sorry.
All you've got to do is say,
"Sorry, I didn't see you."
- If it's easy, you go down.
- All right. I'll go down.
I don't want none of that on my bus!
- None of what?
- Put that knife away.
I'm putting it away.
You nearly killed an old girl.
- What old girl?
- Don't give us that cobblers.
I've got six at home. If they were like you, I'd give them a belting.
You can start with us, mate!
- I'll meet you outside anytime!
- We'll get outside then.
Come on, you get off. Come on.
All right, fellas.
Give us your fares.
Give them to me.
There you are, mate.
There's your wages. Go and get them.
I didn't see the lady, sir.
I was cleaning my nails with my knife. It's a habit I got.
Yes?
I'd like to say I'm sorry now, if it'll do any good.
To the old lady? I'm sure she'd accept your apology.
Mr Wallace, the manager of the billiard hall, has spoken of your menacing attitude.
You said, referring to a Mr Wheatley,
"Tell him I'll have 50 quid.
Tell him I'll have a lot more."
It wasn't my idea to say that, sir.
When we got off the bus, we walked down Broadway and Barney and Ginger split off to go to the pictures.
You stay down here.
- I can go up there. I'm 16.
- No! It's dead dodgy in there.
If there's a game, I'll call you.
You've got to find £50 for Wheatley.
He's probably forgotten it by now.
Anyway, I only made a mistake with the scoring.
- You can tell him you'll get it.
- Yeah, with bells on!
- You might win it at the dogs.
- With my luck?
What does you want?
I can see there's nothing doing here.
Not for you there isn't.
Go on, off out of it.
I'm looking for somebody.
Not in here.
Look for him outside.
How can I look for him outside?
What happens if I don't go?
Wheatley's over there.
He's liable to go raving mad.
- I'll pay him back.
- How can you pay him back?
You haven't got 50 quid.
Tell him I'll have 50 quid.
Tell him I'll have a lot more.
You?
Come on, Stan.
- That was quick.
- Yeah. A great giggle.
- Billy, got that ten bob?
- Yeah.
- I'll open a bank account for us.
- You don't need money for that.
So you were on the defensive?
Yes, sir. I was scared. I thought he'd clobber me any minute.
Had you any intention of paying back the £50?
No, sir.
I only made a mistake with the scoring. I'm sorry I did, but I did.
I'm not going to ask you about the other incidents.
Because I want to hear about them from the others.
I just want you to tell
His Lordship and the jury about your return home from the Three Aces.
And remember,
Speak to His Lordship.
Yes, sir.
Well, my Lord, we all left the pub just before 11 like the lady said.
Ginger split off because he'd lost his union card, and Billy, Barney and me had a bit of a row about the fares home.
We got that sorted out, and we took the number one bus across Waterloo Bridge straight home.
Only I'd forgotten the fags for my mum, and I got them out of this machine by the shops, put them by her bed and went to bed.
- And that's everything?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Is it your practice to terrorise bus conductors with knives?
No. I was just putting it away, sir.
Where is it now, Coulter?
I lost it the following day.
I wish I could find it, sir.
- That's it, isn't it?
- No, sir.
Not if it's got blood on, it's not.
I didn't kill him. None of us did.
You knew where the cash box was and you were within yards of it at 11.
You thought there'd be £100 in it, but there wasn't.
You killed Mr Baxter and threw the knife in the Thames.
This is true, isn't it?
No, sir. None of it's true, sir.
I didn't even know we was near the garage, sir.
I wouldn't have recognised it in the dark.
Now, Coulter, supposing you had killed Baxter, you decided to lie and the knife had been identified in the same way, how would you have explained the knife?
Well, sir, I would have said
I'd lost it that day and somebody must have picked it up.
But I had the knife when I got home.
Thank you, Coulter. All right.
Go back there.
Brian Harold Lee.
Take the book and repeat the words on the card.
I swear by Almighty God the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
You are Brian Harold Lee and you live at
82, Grand Buildings, Wharf End?
Yes, sir.
You're a labourer for a removal firm in Stepney.
Yes, sir.
Now, we're interested in a plan for breaking into a garage at the instigation of Coulter, and stealing £100 which wasn't there anyway. What can you tell us?
Well, there was no plan, sir.
Didn't you make a plan with Thompson when you came home?
No, sir.
That was just like any other
Thursday night.
My mate gave me a lift home on the van, and he dropped me near Ginger's building site.
Righto! This'll do you.
Oi, hang on!
Oh, Barn, you went base over apex then!
- What's all that about?
- That's it, Barney.
You could have broken my bleeding neck!
Oi, you big berk!
- Go on, you'll catch him!
- Come here!
You've been smoking too much, Barney.
You could have broke my bleeding neck! Oi!
Get him then!
WHISTLE BLOWS
Here, Charlie, put that away.
There's my mate.
Just a minute, Barn,
I'm with ya.
You wait till I see him tomorrow.
I wish you was insured, Barney, you'll need to be.
- Yeah. I wish this coat was.
- You'll be all right.
I hope so. It cost a bomb.
- Going out tonight?
- I'm skint.
We could go to the caff.
It ain't half been cold up there today. How was it for you?
I'm knocked out, had a right hard day.
Hurry up. I want you to take this shopping over to Ginger's mum.
I'm busy.
Look out! Blimey, look what you've done! You've squashed my new shoes.
You leave them everywhere.
I don't have eyes in the back of my head!
You don't have to pay for them.
£38s 11d a pair they cost.
You can't get them just anywhere you know
- You walk on his winklepickers again?
- Again?
- Have you trod on these before?
- Oh, shaddap!
Take this over to Mrs Thompson.
You've got a liberty after treading on my shoes.
- My legs ain't up to it.
- Neither are mine.
I've been lifting crates of antiques all day.
That's why your legs ache.
Give them here.
£3 eight!
You're a mug. That's the worst quality leather on the market.
They're not made to stand up to her kind of weight, are they?
Oh, take the shopping, Barney.
- Doctor come to see Mrs Coulter today?
- Yeah.
Don't wonder she's ill, breathing the kind of air you get here.
- They say it's cancer.
- You're a right happy pair.
- Take the shopping, Barney.
- All right, Mum. I will.
- You going out?
- I'm skint.
You haven't got a few bob till tomorrow?
You could earn a few quid wearing them in a sideshow.
Oh, very funny. You ought to be on the Palladium with jokes like that.
HE WHISTLES
Come in!
- Hello, Mrs Thompson.
- Hello, love.
Got your shopping here.
Thanks, Barney. Put it down.
How much was it?
Mum didn't tell me.
Settle up when you see her.
Here you are.
- I don't know how much it is.
- No. It's for you.
- Oh, no, Mrs Thompson.
- Go on, go to the pictures with Jim.
Thanks, Mrs Thompson.
- Enjoy yourselves.
- We will.
- Coming then?
- Yeah, sure.
- Ta rah, Jim.
- Ta rah.
- Don't be late.
- No.
Ta rah, Barney.
Ta rah, Mrs Thompson, and thanks.
It's all right.
- What's wrong with your shoes?
- Someone trod on them!
I got my union card today.
I've never seen one.
Did Coulter tell you about the Lantern Garage or the cash box?
No, sir. He didn't mention it, sir.
You were supposed to have behaved like vandals and hooligans and to have boasted about stealing the money.
One of the witnesses who said you behaved like a thug was Mr St John.
Remember he said you intimidated him and his young lady?
And that you wouldn't go away till she'd given you a pound?
It wasn't like that fella said.
Me and Ginger were looking for a film worth seeing.
We couldn't find one, so we went to the caff.
'The other fellas were there.'
Here, Barney!
Hello!
I thought you was going to the dogs.
- What about the pictures?
- Nothing on. Lot of pony.
Ta, bill.
Here you are.
What happened to them two birds you had Saturday?
- Went over the park.
- What happened?
- What do you think happened?
- Phwoar!
What do you mean phwoar?
16 years old and it's phwoar!
- You heard what he said.
- He said nothing.
- What do you think I meant?
- What?
- Me and Ginge just went for a walk.
- Yeah. That's right.
You tell us what happened then?
I hope you won't do this when you come to my garage on Monday.
He said they went into the park with two birds.
- Well? How do I know what happened?
- There you are then!
- You had an accident?
- Oh, cut myself shaving.
Shaving?
What do you want to shave for?
- I shave twice a day.
- Twice? It's only bum fluff.
It's like a scrubbing brush.
Feel it.
Feel it.
I can't feel nothing.
No. That's 'cause I shave twice a day.
I got my union card today.
You told us about 20 times.
BANG AND HORN HOOTS
There's something up.
Billy, you're starting at the garage Monday, come and help.
I'll get dirty.
Come on, fellas, get to work. He's had a blow out. How does it open?
- You've had a blow out.
- That's nothing to do with you! Clear off!
- Careful what you say.
- I'm not intimidated by thugs!
- Watch what you're calling people.
- Do you want money? Now go away!
- Don't give them money!
- There are four of them!
- Come here, Bill! Come here!
- I'll give you a right good hiding!
Give me the money back.
I'm warning you, Bill, stop!
Give that money back!
When I get hold of you! Come here!
Come here, Bill!
Where's he gone?
He's not here!
He come down here!
Wait a minute, he's in here.
Come out! Give that man his money back.
She gave it to us!
Come on, give it back!
We're taking that man's money back!
BILLY: We can go to the dogs now.
- Send him to Coventry.
A majority decision. I'll send him to Coventry when I get hold of him.
I'll give him a right good hiding!
He's not coming out with me tonight.
BILLY: She gave it to us.
BARNEY: We're giving it back!
- Get him, Barn!
So I got the pound off Bill and we went to look for the driver, but we couldn't find him.
His car was there, but not him.
So we went back to the gents to wash up.
- He said you behaved like thugs.
- We wanted to help him.
We would have changed his wheel for him, but he turned on us, sir.
Now, Lee, you're accused of leaving the Three Aces public house, of breaking and entering the garage, and killing the attendant.
What did you do when you left the Three Aces?
We went straight home, sir.
All except Ginge who'd lost his union card.
We went straight home on the bus.
Stan left us, then I went home.
You were raiding that car, weren't you, Lee?
No, sir.
You didn't try to give Mr St John his money back, you wanted more!
That's not true, sir.
If there hadn't been people about, you'd have taken care of Mr St John too!
M'Lud, I have never heard a more unfair question!
I don't think I have either.
Mr Webster, I'm surprised.
- I'm sorry, my Lord
- Anyway, sir, that wasn't true, sir.
What did you do with the knife?
Did you throw it into the river before the bridge or after it?
We didn't get off the bus, sir.
We went straight home.
All right.
You can leave the box.
William Henry Herne.
Repeat the words on the card.
I swear the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
You're William Henry Herne of 92 Grand Buildings, Wharf End?
- Yes, sir.
- Speak up, Herne.
Speak up and address his Lordship.
You're an apprentice mechanic with Coulter at a garage in Hackney.
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.
And you had a diabolical plan on the evening of January 15th, right?
No. I just wanted to go out with Stan.
What's on the telly?
I reckon you'll soon be shaving three times a day.
Then four, then five.
By the time you're my age, you'll be dead of exhaustion.
He'll still be using your razor.
I can't help it if my beard grows faster than yours.
- Mine?
- No, his.
Stan shaves twice a day. When you start work with him, use his razor.
Tell him to get his hair cut.
You're looking more like your mother every day. It's dreadful.
- It's the fashion, isn't it?
- It ain't half shaggy.
- Here, come on.
- Where are you going with that?
You can't see there.
Come to the window.
Here we are. Here, you've missed a little bit there.
- Where?
- No, that's the shadow of his ear.
- Watch it, son, you'll need that.
- Oh, shut up.
- Shut...? My razor, my blades, my soap!
- I haven't got any money.
Yes, you have.
I give you ten bob.
When?
There it is, look.
Oh. Oh, thanks, Dad.
- You're not wearing that shirt?
- Yeah. Why?
- It's filthy.
- No, it's not.
Well, what about putting the stuff back?
- It's all right, duck, I'll do it.
- Thanks, Mum.
Where are you going?
- To buy a razor!
- Oh, yeah!
So you went to meet Coulter to discuss your plan to rob the garage?
- I just called on him.
- Hold your head up and speak to his Lordship.
Now, then, did you say to Mr Brewer,
"Me, him, him and him are coming into money"?
Yes, sir. It wasn't anything to do with breaking into garages.
After we'd tried to find the girl who'd given us the money,
'they weren't talking to me.'
If you're going up west, I'm coming.
How does a geezer like that get hold of a bird and a motor like that?
Probably a company director.
- Cost a thousand quid.
- Two thousand.
- How can you spend £2, 000 on a car?
- I'm going with you.
If you've got it, you spend it.
How long would it take me to buy it?
£7.50 into 2, 000
- You ain't a company director.
- Why shouldn't I be?
That's right.
You be a company director.
If you're going up west, I'm coming!
- What's he got that I haven't got?
- £2,000! You could win the pools.
If I won £100, 000 on the pools, I'd split it four ways, £80, 000 each!
You could buy that flat for your mum, and do you know what I'd have?
I'd have a house in the country and under my bedroom window,
I'd have a big football pitch, and I'd have Spurs down to play with only me watching them.
Then if they were losing at half time, I'd put my gear on, and go out and score some goals...
Don't be daft.
I would!
Look, here's the ball!
It's Billy Herne! He's got the ball!
'Ere! Where do you think you are?
- Playing for Spurs, of course.
- No, it's West Ham, innit?
Shut up and behave yourselves.
I've had enough of yobbos!
What do you mean? Yobbos?
Be careful what you're calling people, grandad.
Just get out of here, go on!
Me, him, him, and him are coming into some money.
When we do, we won't come down this rathole, will we, Stan?
Right.
Not after tonight we won't.
We're only your best customers.
Go on, sling your hooks.
Get out of it, smelly.
- You're not coming.
- I told you, I'm coming with you.
You're not old enough.
I'm old enough to go to the garage with him!
Get lost. You'll finish up getting us all nicked, my life, you will!
You heard him, stay here.
What do I want to stay here for?
- What were they going to the West End for?
- Going dancing.
- Not to break into garages?
- No.
Barney had split this quid up.
I had about 14 bob all together.
Just a moment. Mr Lonsdale said that outside the cinema you used Coulter's knife to deliberately sever a bin from a lamp-post, and the rubbish tipped into the street. Is that true?
Yes, sir. But I wouldn't have done it if he hadn't been there.
I got on the train without the others seeing me and we all got out at Piccadilly.
'I saw the others come out over the other side of the street.'
Hey! Oi, fellas!
Hey, fellas, it's me!
Here, Stan, wait for me!
- Where are you going?
- I'm coming with you!
Here, wait for me!
INDISTINCT SHOUTING
This is a public street!
Not a beer garden!
A what? Andy Capp, look!
Citizens should be able to walk in peace, not have to avoid hooligans.
- Behave yourselves.
- One at ten shillings!
One at ten shillings!
THEY LAUGH
Wouldn't they serve you then?
Ever been had, then?
Good film? Good film? Enjoy it?
I bet that film steamed up your glasses.
Aren't you 16 yet?
Move off or I'll call a policeman.
Come on, fellas. Ta ta.
No. I'm waiting here. This is for everyone. I can stand here.
Very well.
I'll give you one minute.
- Billy, come on.
- I'm warning you.
- I'm staying.
- Don't mess about.
It's a public right of way.
Come on, Bill.
I saw you do that!
You're the sort type who'll end up in prison.
The type that hits defenceless old ladies.
You should be in an institution.
I saw you do that.
- Dunno what you're talking about.
- You cut that down!
- I didn't cut nothing.
- Don't come that. Everybody saw you.
Look at the blade of your knife.
When are you going to start growing up?
- Billy.
- Behaving like a pack of savages.
Don't look at me like that.
You slashed the bin because you were provoked?
Yes. He kept on at me.
Herne, did you kill Arthur Baxter?
No, sir.
I went home with Stan and Barney.
We didn't go near the garage.
You ask this court to accept that intimidating and terrorising these witnesses was letting off steam?
Knives are drawn, money is stolen, people are assaulted!
Chaos reigns, but it's only fun?!
- I didn't mean...
- Speak up! What did you say?
I didn't mean to slash the rubbish bin, sir.
You left the Three Aces just before 11 o'clock?
- Yes.
- You forced the door of the garage!
- No, sir.
- What?
No!
You killed Arthur Baxter or watched him being killed.
No, sir.
- You crossed Waterloo Bridge.
- Yes, sir.
- And threw the knife in!
- No.
I left the pub.
I went straight home.
JUDGE: Have you finished, Mr Webster?
Yes, m'Lud.
That's all, thank you, Herne.
Call Patrick Bell.
Patrick Bell!
Take the book and repeat the words on the card.
I swear the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
You're Patrick Bell of
50 Stadium Road, Walthamstow?
Yes
Tell the court your occupation.
Yes. I'm the assistant priest of St Stephen's Church, Walthamstow.
Thank you, Mr Bell.
What does this mean?
My Lord, Mr Lonsdale recognised in this witness's appearance characteristics which he described as "wild, aggressive and surly."
Mr Lonsdale said he would be better able to recognise these qualities if he saw Mr Bell in his natural environment.
I thought the court would like to know Mr Bell's natural environment.
Did you dress up for this?
Yes, my Lord. I wanted to help in every way.
It's only the clothes.
I always wear my hair like this.
Mr Montgomery, I will not have this sort of masquerade in this court.
- There are other ways to make a point.
- I beg your Lordship's pardon.
Have you any questions to ask this witness?
No, my Lord.
- Then kindly call your next witness.
- Thank you. James Alan Thompson.
Take the book and repeat the words on the card.
I swear the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
You're James Alan Thompson of
72 Grand Buildings, Wharf End.
Yes.
You're an apprentice carpenter on the new flats near your home.
Yes, sir.
When you came home from work on January 15th, did you intend to go to the West End?
No, sir.
I met Stan, Billy and Barney, but they didn't know what we was going to do.
I walked home with Barney.
We got in about 5.30.
- Hey, Mum, I got it!
- Take your things off the table, Jim!
- Take your boots off there!
- I'm a member, Mum!
- What is it?
- It's me union card.
"Amalgalmated Society of Woodworkers."
Will it keep the money coming in?
Don't take your socks off now.
- I won't be a minute.
- Hurry up, it'll get cold.
I just want to put this away safe.
- Where did you plan this robbery then?
- We didn't, sir.
According to Miss May, at 9 pm, you said,
"We've got some business."
To which Coulter replied,
"There's plenty of time."
You said, "We've got to get ready, see you later."
- Did you say these things?
- Yes, sir.
After the trouble with that man, we was on our way to the dance hall.
We'll have a drink here before the dance. Act with a bit of decorum.
Smarten yourself up! We're up West, not down the building site.
What about the money? It's five bob each for the dance hall.
We need our fares home, so we've got enough for two drinks.
I'll get the drinks. Give us a bob.
- A bob? We're up West now.
- Yeah. One and three.
Here you are.
Here.
Right.
SOFT PIANO PLAYS
Four light ales, 20 Seniors and some crisps, please.
Ginge, there's a couple there.
Go and chat 'em up.
Come on.
They won't pull those birds.
- If they go to the dance hall, we go.
- Why?
- We're broke!
- We can meet them inside.
Hello, darling. Drink up.
Where we going then?
- Where we going then?
- Go away.
Come on, Evie, we're going dancing.
Oh, look at the time, Stan.
We've got some business to do.
There's time. We're laughing here.
We've got to get ready.
Sorry, darling, we've got an appointment. See you later.
What a nerve!
We're not a couple of tarts!
I told you they wouldn't pull.
Well? What happened?
- He messed it up.
- Shut up.
He just doesn't think.
Let's go. Maybe we'll find some more birds that he won't mess up.
That's a good idea.
Come on, Bill.
DANCE MUSIC PLAYS
Come on.
- Here, Stan, where you going?
- I don't want a drink. I'm not thirsty.
Four cokes.
Them birds were just waiting for us.
We can't pay their entry in here.
- We didn't have to come here.
- That's what we come up here for!
- I want to be with them birds.
- Here they come now.
Marvellous.
Now you've really done it.
Now they'll know we're skint.
We'll have to make sure they don't see us.
Not me. They didn't see me.
Bloody nit!
You lay off of me, Stan.
- You can have it any time you want!
- Fellas.
- Bird ain't worth fighting over.
- I want a dance.
- Not with them birds.
- There are other girls.
Come on. Let's have a giggle.
Come on.
What a marvellous night this has turned out to be.
Come on, I'm going.
He won't dance. I'm not going to dance unless he does.
Got blisters, Fred Astaire?
I can't dance.
My shoes are killing me.
This is a square joint.
I thought you'd been here before.
I should be dancing myself.
Where are those two birds of ours?
They're dancing with one another.
Go and ask that bird to dance.
- That old boiler?
- The place is full of them!
So the great Romeo's come unstuck.
- Turn it up, Stan.
- Why don't we all turn it up?
We can't go yet. It's lucky number night at 10.30. £45!
I don't think she's so bad, Barney.
- Where's Billy?
- I don't know.
- He's dancing.
- Where?
That Bill is the greatest!
Here, hang on, we'll send him up.
- She couldn't dance.
- You were doing some great steps.
- Really?
- Oh, great.
- You don't learn it all...
- Leave off.
- Are them birds still there?
- Yeah.
- We can wait.
- We didn't come up here to wait!
Why don't you have a dance then?
COMPERE: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
The time is now 10.30, and it's lucky number time!
CHEERING
We have £45 for you very lucky people here tonight.
If this charming young lady would like to put her hand in the box for the winning ticket, which is...
Thank you.
The winning number tonight is 0352.
APPLAUSE
Hey, how much money you got?
- One and seven. Why?
- Stan?
- Two bob.
- We've got enough for a light ale.
- Let's go home.
- Why?
- How about our fares?
- Bill's got enough for us.
Am I treating you or something?
Yeah.
Don't you complain.
You're lucky to be out with us.
Let's go home. This is luck?
Come on. Give us your money.
All right, Ginger.
We can't go home yet, it's early.
Come on.
Now we come to the vital part of the evening when Miss Barker says you drew a plan of the garage, and you looked through the window at it, and Coulter told Billy
"when you get to the garage, you do as you're told."
What was all that about?
Well, sir, when we got to the pub,
I brought this round of drinks and we all sat down by the window.
We could go back to the dance.
I...
Why don't we see if we can see any gangsters?
Eh?
Gangsters?
They don't wait around street corners for American tourists.
What's up with you?
It's the heart of the underworld.
Barney's right. It was in the News of the World.
An ex-superintendent said the bloke next to you could be a copper.
It was in the paper, Stan.
You're right.
Stan.
Look up there.
- Where?
- Those two birds in the window.
They've got a record player on.
STAN: I bet they've got a lot of drink up there.
Big thick carpets and colours on the walls.
Kissing and dancing till three in the morning, then leaping into the old bath.
Would you like a flat like that for your mum, Stan?
A room for her, a separate one for you, a breakfast room.
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?
I'll draw you one, Stan.
We could come and have our Snap, Crackle and Pop with you.
You wouldn't have a central light, you'd have "concealed lighting".
You'd have brackets on one wall.
And the other side is dark.
That's what the sparks are putting in where I work. Like this.
'Ere, fellas. Let's go over there and knock on the door.
You wouldn't know what to do if one of them answered.
I could show you something.
I'd have a bath.
That's not for the likes of us.
That's for the nobs that don't have to get up.
You've got to be up at half past six Monday morning.
Yeah, I'll be all right.
Mum said she'll give me a shake.
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.
It's a garage like any other garage.
Just do as you're told.
I wish I was up there with them birds.
Ah, come on, let's go.
'Ere you are, Stan.
Hey, my union card.
I've lost me union card.
Hey! I've lost me union card!
I can't find it anywhere.
It's all right, they print thousands...
I've got to find it.
I'll see you.
You'd think it was his birth certificate.
What then?
I found it. I'd dropped it outside the dance hall.
I took a tube to the
Broadway, then a bus, and I got home about midnight.
I put me union card back in me working jeans, and then went to bed.
The evening was a total washout.
Yes, sir.
We should have stayed at home.
You've been called hooligans.
What have you got to say to that?
I don't know, sir.
We just behaved natural, but nothing seemed to go right.
Thompson, I put it to you that you invented this losing of your union card.
Why should I, sir?
You've invented this episode of union card.
You went with Coulter, Lee and Herne to the Lantern Garage.
The reason why you've invented this story is because when you decided what you were going to tell this court, you said to the others,
"Your story won't hold up.
I'm going to clear myself."
That's the truth, isn't it?
I don't understand, sir.
It's a fabrication, Thompson.
A what, sir?
You're lying, aren't you?
No, sir.
I've told the truth.
Thank you, Thompson. That's all.
Call...
I think I'll adjourn the court,
Mr Montgomery.
- Certainly, m'Lud.
- Be upstanding.
All persons having anything to do before my Lords the Queen's Justices...
PHONE RINGS
- Hello.
- Victor here.
Tom, I'm going through the depositions again, word by word.
- I may call you later.
- 'Certainly.'
Tom, what do you think?
We may get a verdict on the knife.
No, I mean the boys.
Do you think they did it?
I believe so. Don't you?
I don't know.
Anyway, I'd better get on. Bye.
PHONE RINGS
- Wellbeck 9816.
- 'Tom, it's Victor.'
Listen. Five and two, seven shillings, four and nine, ten shillings, one pound, that makes £2, 6s and 11d.
- That's what the boys started out with.
- Yes.
Work out their expenditure for the evening. Every penny counts.
They bought crisps. Don't miss a thing. We'll compare notes tomorrow.
- Yes, I understand.
- Go through the entire brief.
Right.
Call your next witness, Mr Montgomery.
My Lord, I wish to make an application.
I'm seeking your
Lordship's permission to put further questions to two of the defendants.
I know I have a discretion in these matters, but to ask leave to recall a defendant for questioning is surely asking too much, especially in a case of this sort.
I have never known such an application.
I could only allow it, firstly, if Mr Montgomery consents, and, secondly, if it is made clear to the defendants that none of them need return to the witness box.
I would only allow it if they were prepared to return.
My Lord, my objective in making this application is because I believe that if your Lordship allows it, this court may be saved a great deal of time.
My Lord,
I have given this case a great deal of earnest consideration.
I will not mislead this court into believing that I am altogether happy with our case.
In short, there is much about some of the evidence that has been given by several of my witnesses that I believe to be prejudiced and mistaken.
Silence.
Silence.
M'Lud, with respect to my learned friend, it seems to me the grounds he puts forward suggest that the Crown has already acquitted my clients.
That is a question for the jury,
Mr Montgomery, as you know.
My Lord, if your Lordship grants this application, and if Lee and Coulter are willing to answer further questions, it may well be that I shall consider it my duty not to press these charges further, and to leave it to your Lordship.
What do you say, Mr Montgomery?
So confident am I of the innocence of my clients,
I have no objection, provided they agree.
Lee, Coulter.
Are you prepared to answer further questions which the prosecution wants to put to you?
If you are not, I shall not allow this application.
- Yes, sir.
- It's all right, sir.
Very well then, Mr Webster.
Brian Lee, please.
Lee, Coulter said in evidence that he gave that when you left the Three Aces public house,
"we had a bit of a row,
Billy, Barney and me.
"It was all about the fares home.
Anyway, we got it sorted out."
Now, neither you nor Herne have mentioned this row in your evidence.
If you had this quarrel, could we hear about it?
Go into details for me please.
It was a misunderstanding, sir, about how much money we had left.
Mmm. Well, how did it proceed?
Um...
Well, Ginger came flying out the pub, see?
My union card!
I can't find it anywhere.
- It's all right.
- I'm going to look for it!
Anyone would think he'd lost his birth certificate or something.
How much are the fares home then?
Eh?
How much are fares home?
One and a penny.
That's nice.
I've only got fourpence left.
How much have you got?
Ninepence.
One and a penny, one and tuppence.
- Why haven't we got the fares?
- It's your adding up.
What do you mean?
We gave you one and thrupence for them light ales.
- How much were they?
- One and a penny.
Well, then you owe us tuppence each.
But we bought them crisps, Stan.
I didn't buy crisps!
Ginger hasn't given us the change from his round.
Marvellous, innit? Never mind.
We'll fiddle the bus.
"We'll fiddle the bus"!
Wait a minute.
What's the matter with you?
What do you mean?
You short of four stinking coppers, are you?
Here you are then.
You go on home.
- Are you having a go?
- Let him pick them up, Bill.
- Don't you have a go with me.
- You be careful.
What do you mean?
I'll punch your teeth in!
Leave off!
- Everyone had some crisps!
- Shut up!
What's the matter with you?
Get out of it!
I'm telling you, Stan, leave him alone!
- So you fiddled the bus?
- Yes, sir.
We bought ninepennies instead of one and a pennies.
Thank you, Lee.
Any questions, Mr Montgomery?
My Lord, I wish to put further questions to Stanley Coulter.
Coulter, this is what you said, wasn't it?
"I'd forgotten the fags for my mum and I got them out of this machine and put them by her bed.
"Then I went to bed."
That's correct, isn't it?
You remember doing these things?
No doubt about it?
No doubt at all, sir.
That's all right.
I accept that.
I'm satisfied as long as you can tell me where you got the money to put into the machine.
You see, according to our arithmetic... you didn't have enough money left.
Just tell his Lordship where you got the half crown, or two shillings, to put into the machine.
I couldn't have gotten them then.
I must have got them before.
All you had to say, Coulter, was "I didn't know I had the money on me."
That's all.
Now you've decided to change your story and I'm not at all satisfied, neither are the jury.
That half crown was part of the 15 shillings from the Lantern Garage!
No, sir.
It's no use lying now, Coulter.
You went to two pubs and at neither time did you handle the money.
If you'd bought them before, you'd have explained to the others.
Anyway, on this, the most important recollection of the evening, the memory of buying cigarettes for your mother who was ill in bed, it's impossible you imagined you went to that machine.
You said you had no doubt at all that you put the money in!
Yes, sir.
Now I'll tell you, Coulter, what really happened on the evening of January 15th.
Broke and happy to be out, you were determined on a good time, but everyone you met put a damper on it.
The last bitter pill to swallow was being short of your fare home.
And lurking at the back of your mind was the cigarettes that you'd promised your mother.
You didn't plan to rob this garage until a few minutes before the crime was committed.
You didn't plan to kill anybody, but you did!
Brutally!
All of you!
Ruthlessly!
No, sir.
Which one did it, Coulter?
Who held the knife?
I think it was young Billy.
Young Billy.
Your friend.
The daredevil, the tearaway.
He held the knife. He did it.
A kid of 16 who idolised you.
He didn't do it, sir.
How did it happen, Coulter?
We...
We... We was fighting and... fighting.
Leave him alone!
Stay out of it, Bill.
You're always the same, Stan.
Cut it out!
What's the matter with you?
What are we fighting for?
A blinking shilling!
Look at him!
We don't have to walk home!
We shouldn't be crawling in the gutter! We should go home in a taxi!
We're skint!
Well, we'll get some money.
Where?
I know where we can get some money.
I know where we can get a 100 quid!
No, straight up!
We can get £100!
What's the matter with you? Don't you want to go out on the town?
Don't you want any birds?
What's the matter?
You cowards?
All right, you walk home!
I'll go out on me jack!
I'll go out and have a dance and a nosh-up and all the birds on me jack!
Marvellous, you are!
Billy's out front,
Barney's on the corner, and this copper comes along.
Billy gets so scared, he can't move.
Barney's seen the copper and he walks past the door, only I can't get out
'cause this copper's there.
Then this car comes up and this geezer's coming through, and he's going to turn the light on...
Copper's going to see the door's busted.
And I'm stuck there.
I've got this knife in my hand.
You killed him, Coulter?
My Lord, I must ask for a brief adjournment.
Granted, Mr Montgomery.
The court will adjourn for as long as you please.
... murdered Arthur Walter Baxter in the course of theft.
Stanley Herbert Coulter, how say you?
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty, sir.
Brian Harold Lee, how say you?
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty, sir.
William Henry Herne, how say you?
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty, sir.
James Alan Thompson, how say you?
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
M'Lud, I don't know whether my learned friend has any observations to make in respect of Thompson.
The crown will not press for a conviction in Thompson's case.
Your Lordship may see fit to adopt a certain course.
Members of the jury, you've all heard and seen what has happened this morning, you've all heard and seen what has happened this morning, and I'm sure there can be no doubt in any of your minds that Thompson had no part in this crime.
I am quite satisfied in my own mind there is no evidence on which any jury could convict him.
I direct you to bring a verdict of not guilty.
Members of the jury, on the direction of his Lordship, do you find James Alan
Thompson not guilty?
We do.
Very well. James Alan Thompson, you are discharged.
You may go.
Members of the jury, you have heard how the other defendants now plead, but they are in your charge and I direct you to return a verdict of guilty.
On the direction of his Lordship, do you find Brian Harold Lee,
Stanley Herbert Coulter and William Henry Herne guilty?
We do.
My Lord, in view of the extraordinary circumstances, may I make a few observations before sentence is passed?
Certainly, Mr Montgomery.
My Lord, I don't wish for one moment to minimise the enormity of the crime.
An old man...
An old man.
My Lord, I could say that any four boys, given the circumstances that involved my client, might have done this dreadful senseless thing.
That any four boys, consistently condemned by social and economic background, by their fellow citizens, by their very appearance, took the inevitable next step, indulged in petty robbery.
That this was a petty crime, and that the killing was as foreign to their nature as the killing of a bird or a cat.
I could say that these were no more than boys trying to have an evening out.
I passionately believe this to be true, my Lord.
At the same time I could say, while we must not forget for one moment that a man has been brutally killed and a family has been bereaved, some of our concerns should be with the other victims, the guilty ones.
My Lord, I have no right to say these things because I know that the law proscribes one penalty for my clients.
Today this court must hear a sentence of death, and nothing I can say can alter that.
Because my clients did not kill
Mr Baxter for pleasure or in anger, or for revenge.
Had they done so, the law would have said imprison them.
They killed for gain.
For gain, the law says kill.
My Lord, this law is in need of a counsel.
It stands accused, this law, particularly in this case.
It's in need of an eloquent defence.
It needs a bold counsel to come into court now and plead on its behalf.
So who will plead for the law, my Lord?
Who will dare?
Brian Harold Lee and William Henry Herne, stand up.
Prisoners at the bar, you both stand convicted of felony.
Have you anything to say why the court should not give you judgment according to the law?
No, sir.
Both of you, together with Coulter, quite clearly were acting in concert with the intention of robbing from the garage this night.
Equally clearly, both of you knew that Coulter had a knife, and that he had the knife on him when he entered the garage.
You had as much a part in the killing as you had in the theft.
That you ran away and were not present when the blow was struck proves only that you were prepared to do anything to save your own skins.
You, Herne, are 16, and you, Lee, 17 years of age.
The law proscribes that no person shall suffer death as a penalty if he be under the age of 18 years.
Therefore, the sentence of this court is that you be detained until Her Majesty's pleasure be known.
Stanley Herbert Coulter, stand up.
Prisoner at the bar, you stand convicted of felony.
Have you any reason, why the court should not give judgement according to the law?
It is impossible for me not to comment on the several acts of savagery to which you have admitted.
The wanton lawlessness, the contemptuous and reckless disregard for public property, and, finally, this bestial attack upon an old man.
You broke into the garage, Coulter, while your friends kept watch.
You had in your hand an offensive and dangerous weapon.
You used this weapon, not once, but six times upon this poor man.
You silenced him because he would have given you away.
But even then, the dreadful crime committed, with the full horror of it before your eyes, even then you remembered the small change in the cash box.
No £100, but 15 shillings.
And even then, you made away with that.
You were given many opportunities of confessing to your terrible crime, but you and your friends kept this a secret until the learned counsel for the prosecution prised it out of you.
Stanley Herbert Coulter, you have pleaded guilty to capital murder - a murder committed for gain - and, as such, the law provides but one sentence.
Stanley Herbert Coulter, the sentence of this court upon you is that you suffer death in the manner authorised by law, and may God have mercy on your soul.
Amen.
Be upstanding.
All persons having anything further to do with my Lords the Queen's Justices, and the general jurisdiction of the central criminal court, may depart hence and give their attendance here tomorrow at 10.30 o'clock.
God save the Queen.
Some of us put up a better front than others, but underneath... all of us were god-awful scared.
I was scared until just a few minutes ago, when our landing craft came up.
But now it's gone.
I feel fine, you know?
It's the waiting, I guess.
Once you get into action, the adrenaline gets into your system.
Tell us all about it, Mouse.
Us kids wanna hear the facts of life from a tried-and-true hero.
Cut it out, Sarge.
I was just saying how I feel.
When are we gonna go in?
We've stood around that compartment since 0500.
That's why you're getting that big fat salary for, Red.
Just hold your water.
Hey, Colombo, maybe the Japs took off... when they saw that we're here in force.
- Maybe, huh?
- Stop dreaming, Chubby.
They are dug in ten, twenty feet underground.
Sure, they're just laying low till we hit the beach.
God, that bombardment last night must've softened them up some.
Hey, Colombo.
How long was that Bougainville operation?
Too long, man.
Pushing through those jungles got me.
My boondockers rotted off.
And this is worse, with these lousy beaches.
We're going in for a wet landing about 200 yards off.
Holy mackerel!
For God's sakes, Colombo.
Hey, what do you want me to do, kiss it?
Come on, come on. Clear the way.
Let old Gopher get his shot.
Would there be wars if clocks had never been invented?
Cut the philosophy.
You're not a lawyer anymore, you're an officer.
And this is it.
Don't get impatient in the landing craft, you men.
We're going to be circling a long time in the rendezvous area before we go in.
In the landing craft, until the Coxswain lowers the ramp, keep your heads down and your helmets on.
Keep your weapons close by and try to keep them dry.
Good luck to all of you.
I could get killed today.
Well, boys, here we go.
All right, move!
Hey, wait a minute!
Me first. I wanna shoot up as you're coming down. Get your best angle.
Let's go!
Move!
Get your ass over!
All right, girls! Don't let 'em step on your tiny little hand! Let's go!
Move! Let's go!
Go!
Move!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Move!
I thought I had it.
I studied all the points...
...sticking up.
They'll cut hell out of you.
What were you doing? Praying?
Nothing wrong with it.
Just now?
No, not really.
I was... I was just thinking about all these fish that are gonna get blown up today, and then about back home.
I used to go fishing a lot with my pop.
What's your old man do?
Is he a doctor or something like that?
Worse. He's a minister.
That's why I was named
Joseph Joshua Cliff.
A minister! Sure enough?
But he's a great guy, too.
I mean, most people think because he's a minister, he's gotta be square... not fun, not human.
You should hear him at church.
He gets more laughs than Bob Hope.
I never heard a minister but he was funny as a graveyard.
He's serious, too.
I mean, he makes people think.
Most people, he says, pray like they were going to the bathroom or brushing their teeth... a reflex, almost.
"Forgive us our trespasses, and help us to forgive those who trespass against us."
How many people ever stop to think what that really means?
Yeah. You're damn right.
When is something gonna happen?
When are we going in?
Goldberg said it'd be at least an hour more.
...sometime tomorrow.
Anytime.
Your folks still alive?
Hell, I ain't seen 'em since I was four.
That sits just fine with me.
For God's sakes, Colombo.
Only man among living things says prayers.
Or needs to.
They can't get me.
I hope we don't have any hand-to-hand fighting.
What the hell?
Keep your fat head down, you won't catch any spray.
Let's go! Go!
Move!
Get the hell on your feet!
Corpsman! Let's go!
I got to move faster.
I can't move.
I can't move.
Oh, please.
You're ruining my shot.
Get the hell out of there, you slo...
Oh, my God.
Yes, there's very heavy fire, mostly mortars and machine guns.
Yes, sir, we're moving. Out.
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.
All right, come on.
Come on, move.
Charlie One to Charlie Six.
That damn smoke.
I'll stop it down, make it a 5.6.
Oh, please.
Oh, please.
Egan, get that...
Mouse!
Not there! Move up!
Charlie One. Charlie One.
Move them out to the next shelter.
Move up!
All right, every man move up.
Move up!
Move up!
You too, Colombo! Go!
Okay, you, move up!
Move!
Egan, get some fire on that gun!
Move up!
Move up!
Spread out! Move up!
All right, Mike.
Come on, son.
Please.
Oh, please.
You men seen Mouse?
Not in some time.
Go look for him!
God!
Mouse!
No. No.
Gotta get 'em off this beach.
Get up here!
Get up, Colombo!
Get your butt up here!
Charlie One.
Charlie One.
This is Charlie Six.
Move 'em out, Domingo.
Yes, sir.
Over and out.
Move 'em out!
Move out! Move out!
I'm gonna move over.
You follow me!
Come on up here!
Automatic weapons, cover!
Let's go!
- Over the line!
- All right!
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus...
Corpsman!
Oh, Jesus!
- Honeywell! Lindstrom!
- Here!
Corpsman!
Hey, Gunny.
We're in a crossfire here.
You get that right gun.
Lindstrom...
- Go ahead fast.
- All right.
Cover me.
I'm going for that machine gun.
Corpsman...
Don't forget to cover me.
Corpsman! Corpsman!
We need a corpsman over here!
Coming.
Corpsman!
Move 'em out!
Move 'em!
Egan, Cliff, move up.
Hell, my eyes aren't as good as they used to be.
I'll have to get glasses when I get back.
Pardon me... if I get back.
Hold it, you two!
We got the son of a bitch!
Get back here!
Hey! It's a dummy!
Cliff and Egan didn't do too bad.
That Cliff though...
I don't know.
He'll grow up or he'll go to pieces or he'll be dead.
It's so easy to get killed.
I never saw a man die before today.
Or even a dead man.
They can't get me.
I tell you, they ain't gonna get me.
Weaver and Ullman... and poor Huff.
Always yakking about his wife and kids.
I'll have a lot of those... those letters to write.
I'd rather get shot, I think.
Gunny, let's hold them up here.
Hold up!
The tanks will be here in a minute.
We'll wait for them.
We don't know what the hell to expect in these damn rice paddies.
Fix bayonets.
Fix bayonets!
Charlie Six calling Pickax Six.
Come in, Pickax.
Come in, Pickax.
Yes, sir?
Oh, we've crossed through the Palm Belt, and we're in the Rice Paddy area... we're crossing that.
No, sir.
No incoming fire.
Hey, Egan.
How come you're still alive?
Hell, boy, they can't get me till I get me one more woman.
I bet you a pack of cigarettes they get you before they get me.
If I win, you won't pay off.
Yes, sir.
Right.
Roger and out.
You gotta figure the odds.
We got 8,000 guys here.
Now, why should I buy it?
The best thing to do is to get yourself a wound... a good one that doesn't hurt too damn much.
Then you're on your way home, out of this muck.
Hit the deck!
Hit the deck!
Move 'em out!
Move out!
Hey, Domingo, Gunny, get that tank on that machine gun, the other one on the bunker, and send us a flamethrower.
Aye, aye, Skip.
I'll get that one on the machine gun.
All right, get that tank to zero on that bunker, and then you bring up the flamethrower.
I've got you.
A little lower.
Gunny, drop the packs.
Drop your packs!
Are you crazy?!
Are you crazy?!
All right, move up across that ditch and cover the flamethrower.
Let's go!
Move up!
I got him!
Oh, my God...
I got him.
Don't!
You do your job, Sir Galahad.
I'll do mine.
I'm just glad I got boots to fight this war.
Colombo! Snyder! Down!
Corpsman! Corpsman!
What about Snyder... is he gone?
Yeah, Skipper.
He caught one in the head.
Well, then forget the corpsman.
I think it missed the bone.
Let's put a bandage on it and let's go.
You're damn lucky, Skipper.
A couple of inches lower...
Looks like it went clean through flesh.
Move your arm around a little bit.
It's okay.
Gunny, don't let those men bunch up.
Get the Lieutenant.
And, Lindstrom, keep those people back.
Aye, aye, sir.
All right, forget the corpsman!
The Skipper wants to see the Lieutenant!
The rest of you people spread out!
Skipper's okay!
- Gonzalez!
- Yes, sir!
Pickax Six, this is Charlie Six.
We have objective Able.
Moving out to Baker.
Yes, sir.
Roger. Out.
Is it all right, skipper?
Yeah. Domingo... there's that beautiful jungle.
We're going in in column.
You take the advance guard, find us a trail.
Yes, sir.
Lindstrom, move 'em out!
Cliff... you stay back with me.
Egan, you and Ginger take the point.
Colombo, you and Bill keep back.
Now, watch out for an ambush and keep quiet. Let's go.
Egan, it's so easy to get killed.
Yeah, it sure is.
Hope I never get it like Mouse did.
Yeah... his arm.
I never figured on this kind of war.
Bunkers, pillboxes... hell, we're out in the open like a possum on a dead tree.
How many men did it cost us to take that bunker?
Those Japs went up in flames like... like tissue paper.
Yeah. Everything goes poof except the skull and the kneecaps.
That bunker really shook me.
The flamethrower's the worst. I...
I mean, I'd rather get shot or anything.
Except maybe a bayonet.
Mouse'll be okay, I guess.
Yeah.
They'll take care of him.
I know a lot of guys that would settle for that right now.
I suppose.
Why did he have to get it like that?
I mean, Mouse, of all people.
What did he ever do wrong?
Bullets don't give a damn about that, I reckon.
There ain't no use thinking about it.
Come on, buddy.
We got some diggin' to do.
There's gotta be some other way.
There's just gotta be.
Or what's the point?
Not bad. Not bad.
I'd thought it'd be a lot worse, seeing it's you.
Look, Sarge, why do we have to go through all this trouble?
'Cause I said so, that's why.
We may only be here a couple of hours.
We may be here all night.
I bet you ten bucks. Ten bucks we'll move out in... in three hours.
And I have 1411.
You make it five bucks, you're on.
Okay, five bucks.
Okay.
Well, who renovated this hotel?
I don't know if I can afford it.
My work of art, Captain.
Great job, Colombo.
Too bad we're moving out pretty quick.
Charlie Company is out on perimeter security.
Not a sign of a Jap anywhere around.
Battalion needs prisoners.
Domingo,
I'm gonna give you this job because we lost Menasco back on the beach.
You're the only one who understands Japanese.
This is the area.
Take the Gunny and pick the rest yourself.
Now, let's get this clear.
We need prisoners, but take no unnecessary risks.
Here's your coffee, Captain.
Wow. Damn, that's good.
Now, good luck to you.
And password is "Lucky," the countersign, "Darling."
Aye, Skipper.
Let's go, Gunny.
"Lucky darling."
Darling.
Darling, you really should read the comics.
They just kill me.
This one is really marvelous!
It's just too much!
Up you go!
Don't you like it?
Higher!
Those were the good times.
Sometimes I think
I ought to wear more makeup.
Maybe you'd like me to be all glamorous and jazzed up.
I'd ratherjust wash my face and forget it.
Don't watch.
Don't watch me, darling.
It makes me laugh!
Please don't watch!
Darling!
Darling! Darling!
Oh, my darling.
I love you so much.
You don't know.
Yes, I do.
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do without you?
You have to report in two weeks.
They've called up your reserve unit.
In two weeks!
- Darling!
- Don't be like this, love.
It's not the end of the world.
I'm not the only one.
I don't care!
I don't care about anyone else on this whole earth but you.
I love you, Julie mine.
I'll miss you terribly, too.
Let's make the most of these two weeks, huh?
Oh, I swore I wouldn't tell you.
I even hid the telegram.
Then I put on all this perfume and this silly negligee and... and it took me two hours to iron the damn thing.
I'm sorry, love.
Hey, Egan, it's Christmastime.
I got a gift for you.
Your favorite chow.
Beans.
That's real nice.
Thanks a lot, Sarge.
Egan, how in the world can you eat so much of that crud?
That's the fifth can you've had today.
I've had better, but I've had worse... most of the time.
Worse than nothin'.
Different for you, I guess, your being from a nice home and a big town.
Oh, it's not that big.
It would be to me.
Damn little one-store town
I come from.
You know something?
There wasn't no flush toilet in the whole damn place.
I never saw one till I got to the recruiting station.
Or a new car or a big store.
And the same gals, what there was, every fella was trying to catch 'em soon as they was old enough to wear a bra.
Some of them was real ugly, too.
I mean, you had to cover their heads with a paper bag.
For real!
Keep eatin', Egan, baby.
This is just for the record.
Might use it in the Gourmet Magazine... or maybe a recruiting film.
I'm famous!
Hey, don't bunch up, you men.
Come on, now.
Okay, Captain. I was just trying to make Egan here immortal.
We're gonna put his picture on every can of C-rations. He eats the stuff!
How do you feel, sir?
Okay. Hey, is that your lunch, Egan?
He ate all of these, Captain.
I'll put you in for a new medal, Egan, for abdominal fortitude.
You know, Captain,
I've decided when this is all over,
I'm not going back to school.
I'm gonna take Egan out on the road for eating contests. Make a million.
What were you majoring in, Cliff?
I was gonna be a lawyer like you, sir.
Keep planning on it.
You'll make it.
Might even be a better lawyer for having gone through this.
Why did I say that?
Is anybody better for having gone through this?
I suppose some are.
I don't know.
You won't do no more killing, but you'll talk.
It's a little tough. Could've been here two or three weeks, but it's food.
- Looks good to me.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot, Sarge.
Boy! I really stink, don't I?
Yeah, you're real raunchy, Egan.
You get upwind of the Japs and they'll just surrender.
Tell Captain MacDonald.
Hey, Cliff... what do you miss the most?
Well, I don't know.
A good, clean bed, maybe.
You know the one thing that I really miss is a woman.
I tell ya, some nights I think
I'm just gonna go nuts.
I tell you, when this operation's over,
I'm gonna scout out every inch of this damn island.
There just has to be a woman on this patch of sand somewhere.
I mean one woman... any damn woman... even a paper-bagger.
Hey, Cliff... when was your last time?
A babe?
Just before I left home.
Hey, kid, now how old are you?
Now, I mean really.
I'm almost 19.
How old are you?
Well, I'm 24, but sometimes I feel like I was your old man.
What difference does it make, Egan?
I bet you never really had a woman.
Not once.
Come on, now.
I don't care what you think!
What I know is what counts!
Okay, okay.
Don't scratch my itch either way.
That's what counts, all right.
What you know.
I don't want anybody to know, Cliff.
Not anybody. Promise?
'Course, honey. Why would I?
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Wait just a little bit, darling, please.
I'm scared. Really scared.
Why, honey? Why?
You know. Not just that you might hurt me, but what if...
I mean, if anything happened and you were away, what would I do?
I'd kill myself, Cliff. Honest.
Don't talk like that.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Susie!
- Susie, are you out there?
- Yes, Daddy?
You'd better come in now, dear.
It's getting late.
All right, Daddy.
We were just about to.
We would like to say goodbye to Cliff too, you know.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Damn beans.
Hold it, Egan. Where the hell do you think you're going?
I gotta go to the ladies' room.
I got your permission, Mother?
You know the orders.
Nobody goes without a guard.
This place could be full of Japs, and I can't think of any better target than that great big fat...
- I'll go.
- All right.
- Wait a minute.
- I can't!
- You know the password?
- Lucky.
- The countersign?
- Darling. Let's go!
Let's go!
Wouldn't it be a hell of a thing in the middle of an attack, Egan?
Is something happening?
I'll be right with you.
Oh, no, you won't. You point that thing at me, and I'll shoot ya! I swear!
Lucky!
Lucky!
Damn it!
Cliff, put that damn pipe down!
Come here!
What's happening?!
Honeywell, what the hell's going on?!
Honeywell, I asked you what's going on.
There's your prisoner.
A Jap captain.
That slope-headed dummy there just shot him dead!
Damn it, Cliff.
What's the matter with you?
What happened to his arms?
I broke 'em.
- You broke his arms?
- Yes, sir.
One after he knocked off the lieutenant, one after he gave me this.
Daniel's dead, too.
Sergeant, get these men back to their holes.
Get the hell outta here!
Get back to your hole!
You, too. Move!
Everybody back.
Come on, move!
Honeywell, I want an explanation.
What was the point?
Was it necessary to break both his arms?
Was it unavoidable?
Will the captain drop rank for a minute, sir?
Go ahead.
I'm a Marine.
Who gives a damn about this dead Jap now?
He's nothing!
He's worth nothing!
When I brought him in here, he was worth something... to talk!
He didn't need his arms for that!
That's the way I look at it, sir.
More of these little slobs would be alive right now if they thought like me.
I'm gonna kill these bastards.
I'm gonna shoot 'em,
I'm gonna bayonet 'em,
I'm gonna break their arms so they don't give us no more trouble.
That's what we're here for... to kill!
That's what they're doing to us any way they can.
Everything else is just a lot of crap!
That's all, sir.
I want you to understand me, Honeywell.
I want this company to fight hard... as hard as they can.
But I don't want these boys to be professional killers.
I don't want them to break a man's arms unless it's a necessity!
Not just out of hate!
This isn't the end of everything.
A lot of us have been killed, and a lot more of us are going to be killed.
But a lot more of us are going home.
You understand me, Honeywell?
I hear ya, sir, but it don't change anything for me.
Can I go now?
I wanna get a burial detail.
- Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.
I guess that's what happens with killing.
After a while, we forget why we're doing it.
That's the danger... the real danger.
Oh, God, my shoulder hurts.
Hey, Cliff.
Take a look.
Come on. Take a look.
If you squint your eyes a bit with the light on, you can almost damn fool yourself.
See what I mean?
Don't that look like the real thing, though, Cliff?
Well, yeah. And that rock really looks like her belly, too.
Yeah.
I wish she had some thighs and legs.
Damn, she looks pretty good, though.
If we stay out here till nighttime, you better look out.
Brace yourself.
You know, she reminds me a bit of my last woman.
Did I tell you about that last one?
Which one?
I don't know with you anymore.
This was the last one, before we left, on my weekend pass.
A real big gal. Tall.
We hit it off the first damn minute.
She was sitting in one of those little sports cars, waitin' for a light.
When I saw her,
I started to paw the ground.
I asked her for a lift, and she said, "Where?"
I said, "Wherever you're goin'."
She thought that was pretty cute.
So the next thing, we were up in her room, real nice with a big, soft bed.
You know.
I bought a bottle of hundred proof to hurry things along.
And I got her in a game of strip poker.
Okay, now. This time you're gonna win... I bet you.
Boy, did I cheat.
I better!
Come on, now.
Let's play. Come on.
Let's dance.
- Come on, let's play.
- No, I wanna dance!
- I wanna play.
- Come on, come on.
She had a better idea.
She wanted to dance.
She was the tallest damn gal
I ever danced with.
But I didn't mind a damn little bit.
I even scooched down some.
Boy, what a king-sized dish she was.
I really hit the jackpot.
You're a little goof.
The only hitch was that damn tall gal could out-drink anybody.
Me with that hundred proof...
You had a little bit too much to drink!
Yes, ma'am.
Say... Iooky here!
Looky here! I win again!
I'm sorry, sugar.
But, hell. Remember...
Unlucky at cards... lucky in love.
Well...
I suppose that sooner or later...
I know we had one dadgum hell of a ball, but now when I wanna dwell on it,
I can't remember!
Ain't that hell?
So the answer must lie somewhere in this area.
The Colonel's ordered up patrols out of the other outfits that cover around here with no reports of anything out of the ordinary.
We've got to find out what's up. It's... it's unnatural the Japs haven't counterattacked by now.
So it's up to you men, before we get our heads pounded off, to find out what the hell is going on.
I've marked some red X's here where I think you may find a clue.
You could use some morphine, sir.
Shall I send someone?
No, later. I...
Thank you.
What was I saying?
Oh, yes. I want you all to try to remember out there all the instructions you've been given about that jungle.
In some ways, it's as deadly as the Japs.
- Good luck, Lindstrom.
- Thank you, sir.
- Colombo.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Cliff.
- Thank you, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
There are instructions on everything...
...except on how to die.
The mosquitoes are out there waiting for you.
The anopheles, the aedes, the culex... operating under unified command.
Their target... you.
The ticks are waiting, too, to bury their heads under your skin and suck your blood.
There are vicious sand flies, bloodsucking flies, buffalo great fly, assassin bugs, colonies of fleas, mandated gnats, whole republics of mites.
Leeches make getting next to your skin their life's ambition.
All these insects will attack you with a Japanese accent.
Their bites can cause malaria, filariasis, espundia, typhus, trench fever, bubonic plague.
The growing things of the jungle can spell death, too.
Jungle fungus will damage and pigment your skin.
The sap of the beach apple and mango tree bring sores that never seem to heal.
The milky sap of the buta-buta can cause total blindness.
The oil of the Kamanday tree, if it enters your body, will be fatal.
Equally fatal is the bark of the abuab tree or the sap of the Dalit.
But your greatest danger will be from your fellow man.
I think I sprung a leak.
God.
I'm sorry, Sarge.
You guys are wasting your time.
We gotta get Lindstrom outta here.
One of us, anyway.
Why don't we all get the hell outta here?
Take Lindstrom back.
Captain MacDonald says we gotta know what's out there.
You gotta.
I don't.
I don't need no medals.
Hey. What about you, Egan?
No, I think we gotta go on.
What hell good will it do us or them if we are dead?
Hell, Colombo, now,
I ain't no more a hero than you are.
Me and Cliff, we're going on.
Right, buddy?
All right, Colombo, somebody's gotta get Lindstrom back.
You got the urge to head that way, so how about it?
You gonna take him?
Okay. Okay.
Help me get him on my back.
I don't wanna bust his guts.
Egan doesn't seem scared.
I hope it doesn't show how scared I am.
Let's go report to Captain MacDonald.
Yeah.
If I get him back okay, the odds are I won't get sent out again.
Not for a while, anyway.
I'll be a hero.
This'll ease the pain, sir, but you can carry on.
Good. Good.
Captain MacDonald.
This is Red 22.
Red 22, this is Charlie 6.
I've been parked in this hole sweating you out.
Why in hell haven't you kept me informed?
Lindstrom's a casualty, sir.
Colombo's taking him in.
I think you'll have to send some Corpsmen.
He'll need some blood.
Just have them follow the telephone wire.
Lindstrom. My God.
Okay, Cliff, who's in charge of the patrol now?
You've got to!
You're older.
L... I guess no one, Captain.
I think Egan ought to.
He's older.
Well, all right, Cliff.
Yes, l... I guess you're right.
Let Egan be in charge.
Put him on.
You heard him.
You're it.
Okay! I mean, yes, sir.
Egan, you're in charge now.
What's your present position?
We can't be more than 500 yards out past the first X mark on the map, Captain.
All right, good.
Now I want you to tell me everything you see and hear, you understand?
Yes, sir. Okay.
What good is a medal if this is gonna give me a heart attack?
How is it, Sarge?
- Bad?
- Can't make it.
You mean me carrying you?
Too tough.
You're right, Sarge.
I think you're right.
Maybe I could hurry on back and send a Corpsman for you.
You're still the boss.
Is that you want, huh?
I'd go on.
I'll hurry.
I can make it pretty fast alone.
You're right, Sarge.
Look at that!
Thank you!
Come on, Sarge.
Hey, you didn't think
I'd leave you here, did you?
Come on.
Colombo'll get you back.
The odds aren't as good this way, but I can't leave old Sarge out there.
Hell, Colombo, you're a dope.
I'm hung up.
That's got it.
Boy, I sure don't like this.
They can't get me till I get me one more woman.
Not till I get one more woman.
You wanna stop for a minute?
I got a can of beans.
No. We'd better not.
Why in the hell am I always so hungry?
Get back!
They're coming!
Look, Egan!
The phone, Egan.
Hello, hello.
What's going on out there?
Can you hear me?
They're coming, they're coming!
- How many?
- I don't know, Captain.
Good Lord, they're everywhere.
A patrol?
No. Dozens of them, all heading past us.
How many?
This place is too hot.
We gotta get out of here.
Captain.
Captain MacDonald?
Look, Cliff, Egan, they've gone past you now, haven't they?
Yes, sir.
All right, so you're in no danger this damn minute, are you?
Well, not exactly this damn minute, sir.
Well, now, those Japs who just went past you, they were going somewhere.
It's important for us to know where and why.
Now, you... you two are the patrol.
Make your decision.
Do you wanna go on or come back?
Well, we... I guess it'd be better to go on, maybe.
I want you men to remember that it's all right if you change your minds.
Yes, sir.
We might get around to doing that.
The gardenerjust doesn't water enough in my little garden... just splashes around where it shows, and then off he sneaks.
Everything is in bloom now at home.
Camellias, azaleas.
If I lose one camellia, I'll fire him.
- Why are you laughing?
- Because you're funny.
Bang! Bang!
You must never point a gun at anybody, Mike.
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Colombo, Snyder, down!
I keep worrying that the war might spread and you'd be in it.
That horrible crazy little Hitler!
I don't think the Japanese would fight us, do you?
I like them so much... their gardens and their politeness.
It's so cute, the way they bow and smile.
Would you miss me if you had to go?
God, how I miss you.
I love you.
I think of your hair on warm days at home when you dry it out of doors and the sun shines through it.
I hate my hair.
It's so straight and it takes forever to try, even in the sun.
I wish I had curly hair like you.
Would you like me better with curly hair?
I love you just the way you are.
Captain, you know that sharp rise?
The bare one?
We're just under that, and that's where they all are.
And you know something?
There are hundreds of them.
And they're dressed like us... helmets and everything.
What's all the yelling?
Somebody was making a speech.
And now they're all yelling.
They're all runnin' off toward the beach, down that ravine.
Good God, I've got it.
They're going down that ravine on the right flank of Beach Red.
They'll launch an attack behind us.
They'll look like us long enough to raise hell.
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.
I'm sorry, sir.
Egan, I'm going to call air attack on that area and on that beach, so get out of there as fast as you can.
You men, you've done a good job.
Now drop the wire and move.
Boy, let's git.
Hey, we did it!
- Looks like we did it!
- I guess we did.
Come on.
- There go the flyboys.
- Yes, sir.
Come on.
Grab some wind.
Where in the hell is it?
I've lost the wire.
Is this right?
Yeah. There's that big tree.
Come on!
That's one more.
Corpsman! Corpsman!
There ain't nothin' moving but his watch.
Kolinsky, you seen Homer?
Not since chow.
- I sent him for a pen and paper.
- I got plenty of paper.
- But I'm using this.
- For how long?
I have to write to each of my kids, or they feel left out.
- Cumberly, you got a pen?
- What for?
If I say we're coming home, they'll censor it out.
Hey, who's that?
Henshaw.
Henshaw!
- Henshaw!
- Yeah, Sarge?
Come here!
- Whose truck is this?
- I dunno. It was just sitting here.
- And it happened to need fixing?
- She's running a little sloppy.
- What was wrong with it?
- I'm not sure.
Do me a favour.
Put it back together again. Please!
- Hey, Corby!
- Good afternoon, Sergeant.
- Still charging $5 a fountain pen?
- They're $7.50 now. $8.50 with ink.
I need a volunteer for detail.
Oh, I forgot.
For you, they're only $5, Sarge.
Purple ink is very passionate.
- I'll take it.
- See me pay-day.
- You dirty...
Hey, Homer! Homer!
Come here!
Yo, Homer! Hey, over here!
Come here.
You been goofing off again?
No goof. Gets paper.
Not Homer's fault.
Big trouble, fall down.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Come here, Kolinsky!
What happened this time?
He didn't goof off.
He did what you told him.
He bought the paper and pen.
A jeep... sideswiped him.
He fell in the mud.
He lost the pen.
He looked and looked...
...and turned the mud upside down... and couldn't find the pen.
Me ashamed lose pen.
- I gave you $3. Where's my change?
- No money. Lose, too.
- That's a crock!
- Crock?
- 10 to 1, he spent it on a bottle.
- No bottle. No drink.
Huh?
All right, all right, Homer. Forget it.
Get cleaned up, if you want to see the captain today.
Wonderful! We go see captain, huh?
I'll take him to the fountain and clean him up...
Hey, Sergeant, you got a size forty in a field jacket?
- What's wrong with yours?
- It's not for me, it's for him.
- What kind of an outfit is that?
- Bits and pieces. He's not a soldier.
I guess it'll be OK.
- Corby.
- Yeah?
This pen broke down between "yours" and "truly".
That's a very sexy pen, Sergeant.
Maybe it got bored.
Hey, Larkin. How soon do you think we'll be going home?
I don't know and Sergeant Pike don't know. I asked him this morning.
Could be any time, JJ.
Yeah.
1 st Platoon, 2nd Squad.
Take it easy, soldier!
Hey!
- You 2nd Squad?
- Yeah.
It's about time they were sending us some new men.
- I'm Henshaw. I'm a little greasy.
- Yeah.
2nd Squad?
End of the hall.
Reese, huh? You're three days late.
- I met a friend.
- Where? At the bar?
Where do I put this?
Pick a spot anywhere.
Sarge, how'd you like to buy a sterling silver punchbowl?
It's a genuine antique.
I'll throw in 36 cups.
And a ladle.
What do we have here?
A brand new market, Sarge.
Hey, how are you, buddy?
As you can see, we eat very well around here.
If there's anything you need,
I'm the guy to see.
If I don't have it, I can get it for you.
Beat it.
Excuse me... I didn't recognise you,
General.
Sergeant Pike's coming.
He's with 1 st Squad now.
- Ready to go, Corby?
- Just about.
- Might be it, Sarge.
- Could be.
- What's the word?
- Saddle up. We're moving tonight.
Hallelujah! Where's the boat leave from? England or France?
- They might fly us.
- I like that, I like that!
All I can say is the Company will assemble at the church by 21.00.
- I'll be waiting at the church...
- We'll be there.
- New man report in yet?
- He just got here. His name's Reese.
That's him sitting over there in the corner.
We're going to go home
Hallelujah! We're going to go home!
Yeah. I know him.
Sergeant Pike?
Captain Loomis wants to see you on the double.
All right, you globetrotters, start packing your gear!
Tell the captain it's gotta be planes!
I get seasick.
Come on. Let's go!
1 st Squad, over here!
Pile it over here, Thomas!
Dump it and flake out, you guys.
- Sarge, how am I supposed to sit?
- That is your problem.
Reese!
Kind of rushed earlier,
I didn't say hello.
- Looks like you're still rushed.
- How are you?
- Thirsty.
- I'm sorry, the town's off limits.
I can't keep my guys together unless we get some space.
How about getting a detail together and moving this stuff out?
Bottle of brandy, combien?
Sorry, tonight we're off the limits.
One pack or two?
We're not allowed to sell to soldiers tonight.
Two.
It will not be good for you when the MPs get here.
They patrol this section.
There will be trouble if they find you here.
Lady, the whole world is full of trouble.
You are right. So much trouble.
Let us both drink to better times.
I drink to you.
And to the American Army.
How long ago were you drinking with the Third Reich?
- I do not like the Germans.
- You don't like me either.
People are the same all over the world.
They go with the tide.
You are wrong.
Wrong to think I had any dealings with the Germans.
And wrong to think I do not like you.
A man who is not afraid to break the rules.
I find this interesting.
You do?
I do.
But still, I'm worried about the MPs.
Perhaps if we took the bottle somewhere else where they will not find you.
Like your place?
My room is here in the back.
Welcome to the peace talks.
Let's go, Reese.
Well, it's up to you, buddy.
Say when.
You haven't changed much, Reese.
That's right.
I was surprised to see you turn up in our outfit.
You and me both.
I haven't had time to check your papers.
Where'd you transfer from?
The outfit I came from was a real dilly.
There was a general, a major, two captains, two lieutenants and me.
- There's a squad for you, buddy-o.
- Sounds like a court martial board.
- Thought you hadn't read my papers.
- You were a master sergeant.
That's what makes a good soldier.
You are very observant.
Let's call it a night, buddy.
One for the road.
Yeah.
The long road home.
I guess you'd rather be going back into combat.
Like I said, you haven't changed much.
Finish your drink and let's get back.
Sometimes the brass spreads a false rumour, so there won't be a leak.
Keep this to yourself until we move out.
We're not going home.
We're going back on the line.
Back to the line.
Pike!
- Yes, Captain.
- Was that man in town?
- Yes, sir.
- I want him on report. Name?
John Reese.
He just transferred with us.
Oh, yes.
His papers say he won the DSC.
Yes.
We were together in North Africa.
He was also up for a battlefield commission till a few weeks ago.
He almost ran down a colonel before he cracked up.
I know how he acts behind the lines, but he's a damn good soldier.
Well, I don't know, Sergeant.
OK, I'll take your word for it.
It beats me. A guy who cracks up when the pressure is off.
- Make sure he stays in line.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sarge!
- We'd better take him in to the captain.
- Pretty good, huh?
- Fine.
- About taking him home with us.
- He's pretty busy now.
- Got to see now.
I said he was busy, now drop it!
Too busy?
Homer not go States?
Hey, Corby!
Can't you forget about that loot?
You're in a church.
This ain't a church no more.
And besides, so what?
It used to be, JJ.
You ought to have respect for things that used to be.
You bucking for chaplain or something? I got respect. Plenty.
But it's not for somebody I can't see.
Corby?
Yeah, kid?
Corby, you... you plenty smart.
You figure out the way
Homer go to States with squad, huh?
I'm sorry, kid.
I wish I had some room in the bag even.
You new man, maybe you got new ideas.
Huh?
I Polish DP.
- No place go.
- Get out of here.
All right, you birds, rise and shine!
OK, let's go!
Form up your men and draw ammo outside!
- Ammo?
- Why ammo if we're going home?
We're going back on the line.
Now get the lead out!
Morgan, get your men rolling!
- At least they could've told us.
- Let us think we were going home.
Like fattening up a turkey for Thanksgiving.
I go and kill Krauts. Be good soldier.
Make captain say OK.
No, Homer, you can't go.
I good fighter. I come up to line.
You show up on the line,
I'll blow your head off.
Fall in outside! Let's go!
Come on, shake it up!
Shake it up!
- What's that?
- A butcher knife.
OK, let's go! Move it along!
- Captain Loomis?
- Yeah.
- Captain Mace. Hope you're fresh.
- We got a week's rest.
No replacements though.
We're a third short.
We've been cut to half. Cut to ribbons and we only got our foot in the door.
God forbid we'll replace you in another week.
God willing, we'll get both feet in the door by then.
I'll brief you on position.
1 st Squad, peel off.
Fill up those foxholes.
Let's go, Larkin.
2nd Squad, cover this pillbox area.
Let's go, Thomas.
3rd Squad, follow me.
Come on, fill in these holes.
Sarge, I got a thought.
Why don't I take this pillbox?
It'd be great for storage.
Come on, move!
Corby, will there be room in that foxhole for you?
If I need help with the plumbing,
I'll give you a ring.
Command post. Company L.
Captain Loomis will need six more trucks.
- You sent for me, Captain?
- We're pulling out.
- Tonight, sir?
- We've been ordered 10 miles north.
They expect a German counter-attack and want us there to back them up.
- Don't we wait for replacements?
- There'll be no replacements.
- We're leaving this section open?
- I can leave one platoon behind.
- Yes, sir.
- Spread your squads over the area.
I'll move the men out before dawn - through the woods, not the road.
If we're lucky, the Germans won't know how thin you are up here.
Yes, sir. If we're lucky.
That's all, Pike.
Larkin?
- You hear anything about a move?
- What move?
We're open on both ends.
1 st Squad?
1 st Squad! Yo!
Hey, Sarge, what is this?
Where did everybody go?
There were 100 guys last night.
What happened?
1 st Squad moved out last night,
I thought they were pulling duty.
Hey, Larkin, what is this?
Cumberly, get a blanket and toss it in the air.
That box has got us nailed down tight.
The Krauts must be dug in behind that row of trees. Look at the smoke.
Yeah. Breakfast time.
You're covered here, but walk carefully beyond this point.
Walk? Are you out of your mind?
I'm gonna dig a subway!
Did you see that blanket?
- Sergeant, what gives?
- Where's the Company?
The Company will be gone a day or two.
- Depends on what develops up north.
- What about here?
The six of us have to hold here by ourselves?
That's about it.
Any more good news?
3rd Squad's about half a mile away,
1 st Squad is north.
You guys fill in this area.
I know you're spread thin, but put two men on each flank.
A little thin.
Kolinsky, Henshaw, take the left flank over there by that tree.
Corby, Cumberly, take the right this side of the road.
OK, Sergeant.
It's a good spot for Reese.
- Take the other side of the box.
- Right.
On the level, Pike, what do you think?
It's hard to say. The Krauts probably heard our Company move in.
Let's hope they didn't hear them pull out.
- It's pretty quiet down there.
- Yeah.
- Any movement?
- A belch from the pillbox.
- What are they using?
- 9 mm, light.
Chances are they've got listening posts in those ravines.
They'll think we're a pretty quiet company.
Pike, if they make a push, we're dead.
Yeah, I know.
What about these guys?
- They've all had experience.
- Larkin?
He knows how to give and take orders. He's a good man.
He'd better be.
- Are you sure you feel all right?
- Never felt better.
- Now I know you're cracking.
- I got a system.
Every time things seem bad,
I think of something worse. Try it.
Not me.
- You have no imagination.
- Trouble is I got too much.
I can imagine when those Krauts discover there's nobody over here.
Think they heard us?
They just want to say good morning.
It shouldn't last long.
Hiya, fellas!
Man, who the hell are you?
Driscoll. James E.
Sergeant, which way is
Division Headquarters?
I couldn't say, but it ain't that way.
It's supposed to be in Thionville.
Never heard of it.
Well, I'll show you on the map here.
What are you doing here, soldier?
I was in Metz to requisition these typewriters.
Here it is.
Now, if you show me where we are...
Well, vee just happen to be here on ze Siegfried Line, my dear.
We are?
Well, the Division must be
20, 30 miles away.
- That's right.
- Only... which way?
See, I'm due back by five and...
- A jeep like this might come in handy.
- It sure would.
We have this major who makes us stand reveille every morning, rain or shine, which gives you an idea...
If we kept it on the move, it'd sound like a lot of jeeps.
It could sound just like a truck.
Henshaw could rig it to backfire like a tank.
I'll send Henshaw down.
- Sergeant?
- Right!
- Wait a minute, Sergeant!
- Sorry, we're taking your jeep.
- The jeep?
- For a day or two.
- But this is Major Winston's jeep.
- Combat emergency has priority.
If you take it, how do I get back to Division?
You don't.
- Corby! Come here!
- Sergeant, wait a minute.
Major Winston will be proud of you volunteering for combat duty.
But, Sergeant,
I was sent to clerk-typist school.
All I've done in the Army was type.
- We'll give you on-the-job training.
- What's up, Sergeant?
Take this man to that foxhole and teach him how to shoot.
- With this here? It might get dirty.
- Move!
You heard him. Move!
Here. Audition for me.
If you're gonna hold a gun that way, make sure the safety's on!
- The safety?
- The lever, just pull it.
Not the...!
- He wouldn't.
- You wanna bet?
Look, dum-dum, up here this gun is your life.
Like when you were a civvy, what you own makes you who you are.
Let's try it again.
That way!
- How we doing?
- Splendid.
- He can't hit anything but loads well.
- OK, that's enough for now.
Take him over to that second hole past the box. And stay with him.
That makes me feel real safe.
Come on, Dead-Eye.
This is it. Tea will be served at 5.00.
- You see anything out there, Reese?
- Nope.
They'll send a patrol up here tonight.
Oh, yeah.
Then again, they might not, if they think we have a full company.
Quit horsing around. They'll make damn sure there's no company here.
- What?
- Our patrols, not theirs.
If we were full strength, we'd have a 10-man patrol down there. Tonight.
Yeah, you're right.
The Krauts would hear them.
- Tired? You tired?
- You're kidding, I'm having a ball.
Pike tells me there's a supply dump three miles down the road.
- Go and find me three spools of wire.
- What kind of wire?
Signal Corps wire. The big spools.
- Also, load up some gas for our "tank".
- Right.
- How long will it take?
- About 40 minutes.
Cumberly!
- Sarge?
- Round up three empty ammo cans.
- Empty?
- That's right, empty!
I'll go first to the left.
You take the centre, you take the right.
- See you, kid.
- Good luck.
- Apple.
- Cobbler.
OK.
- Apple.
- Cobbler.
- Apple.
- Cobbler.
- It worked.
- All right, back to your positions.
Hey, Larkin!
- What's the matter?
- A funny thing, we strung three wires, we got four now. Look.
And it goes straight across to the Nazi lines.
Let's find out what it's hooked up to.
Here it is, down here.
It goes right into the pillbox. Come on.
- I can't see a thing in here.
- Let me get this lamp lit.
That's better.
Here it is.
- What the hell is...?
- Shh!
- That was a German mike.
- They got us bugged?
They must've planted it during a back-and-forth action.
Right spot, next to the field telephone.
- I don't call that very cricket!
- You got the gift of the gab.
Go back in there and make like you're talking to Command.
- What Command?
- Fake it.
I'll try to spare somebody to relieve you.
Yeah. OK, Sarge.
Temple... Red to Able Six.
Temple Red to Able Six, come over.
Able Six? Temple Red here, over.
Yes, sir. The entire patrol came back safe and sound.
The activities of the patrol were quite successful.
Although we took no prisoners, we know all the enemy positions.
That's right, we know exactly where they are.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant Larkin says I'm to relieve you.
I'll call you back, sir. Over.
- There's a German mike in there.
- There is?
Don't say anything you don't want them to hear.
I'd just as soon they didn't hear anything at all.
You know, Driscoll, you're a lucky guy.
This is the safest place on the whole ridge.
- It is?
- Yeah. Go in and fake some reports.
- What kind of reports?
- You've never heard them?
Look, all I've ever done is type.
Oh, yeah. We're Temple Red and Command is Able Six.
Beyond that, say anything you want.
Like, "Help"?
Go ahead.
Er... hi.
Temple Red to...
...Able Six.
This is Lieutenant Driscoll, the Entertainment Officer.
About the morale, sir, it's been rather low.
The main complaint seems to be about the evening movie.
Yes, sir. I've had to show
Road to Morocco five evenings in a row.
The men are beginning to get a little surly, sir.
Yes, sir, they know all the lines.
And about the amateur...
The amateur hours are going very well, sir.
We... Sir, could you hold on just a minute?
Yes, sir, I have a call on the other line.
I'll be right back.
Temple Red, this is Lieutenant Driscoll.
Don't... don't send them up here.
Sir, I have five men in each foxhole now.
I have no room for any more, sir.
Have you tried Charlie Company, sir?
Oh, I see.
There's still a war going on in Japan, you might send them over there.
Apple!
It's me, Homer!
Thought I told you to stay away from here.
I... had to come up, kill Krauts.
Show Captain Loomis I good soldier.
I be plenty help.
You like Calvados?
Now... Now I stay, huh?
Hi, Sergeant!
Bring plenty good things.
Eggs, Calvados, all for you.
- Forget it, kid. You can't stay.
- Please. Give Homer a chance.
- Work in labour camp 13 years old.
- Just knock it off!
- Homer, how'd you get here?
- Hitch rides to be with buddies.
We're in a tight spot here.
It's rough enough on guys with experience, let alone a green kid.
Hey, Sarge, we were glad to get Driscoll.
- OK. Pass out the extra ammo.
- I do what you say, Sarge.
I'll relieve Kolinsky on the left flank.
He'll show you what to do.
- I do good!
- You better.
Hey, Homer, if you want to unload anything, feel free to dump it right in my foxhole.
I'd better go over with Henshaw.
- What say, Homer?
- I got plenty work. I put stuff here?
Sure, sure.
Nothing but vacancies in this hotel.
Larkin not be sorry I stay.
Gonna kill plenty Krauts.
Shoot them all up!
See you later, friend.
Oh, boy! If you were my son...
Okey-dokey.
Is that right, sir?
Major Winston's jeep? Right, sir.
We'll certainly be on the lookout for it, sir.
A PFC, you say?
With a load of typewriters in the back?
If we see him, we'll contact you, sir.
Blanke the cook is working out rather well, sir.
One problem, his vichyssoise tastes a little too much like potato soup.
They're supposed to taste like potato soup?
- Ammo?
- No.
Close?
Uh-huh.
- Why you no like Homer? I your friend.
- You got no place in the line.
The Heinies get you and torture you, you'll spill everything you know.
No!
Maybe.
Apple.
Pie!
Homer, get down!
Hey, Cumberly!
Kolinsky! Bring that torch!
Move him into the pillbox!
Get Driscoll to rip the mike off!
Cut the Kraut mike.
He had a great system, Sergeant.
He just never worried about anything.
Larkin!
- He's still alive.
- Move him into the pillbox.
Homer, Driscoll, give Kolinsky a hand.
Check the bodies and drag them to the road.
- Cumberly, too?
- All of them.
Any more out there?
Not now.
Think we got them all? No, huh?
I figure two, maybe three, got back.
You think they know how many men we are?
You'd send one guy back to report a weak spot, yeah?
As soon as they get that report, they'll send a platoon.
We'll try to hold them off.
They won't send a platoon if they're busy.
We should hit the pillbox.
They figure it's an attack from here, they'll suck in.
- And if that pillbox goes...
- ...they'll dig in and wait.
- How about it, Larkin?
- No.
That field is covered with mines.
We'd need ten guys to blast through it.
- We can make it with two.
- No, we stay.
- We stay, we get ploughed under.
- Our orders are not to attack.
Hitting that box is what will keep us alive.
- It's a chance.
- Better than against a platoon.
- It might work. But Pike says to hold.
- Pike ain't here.
But he's still in charge. If he okays the switch in plans, we move.
But not until he does.
Now get back to that flank!
- I'll see if Pike's with the 1 st Squad.
- Don't make it long.
Henshaw, you're in charge until I get back.
Reese?
- Did you ever take a pillbox like that?
- Yeah.
- Satchel charge?
- Yeah.
- How much?
- 30 pounds.
I saw some 40-pounders back at that supply dump.
Good. We'll need them.
Yeah. Providing Pike says OK.
He knows what he's doing.
So does Larkin.
Every man can't follow his basic nature.
They trained him to follow orders.
And you?
I trained myself to make things work...
...not burn them up.
Here I am...
I don't know what's right. I don't know.
- What are you doing, Henshaw?
- I got some satchel charges.
- Just in case. What did Pike say?
- I left you in charge!
I know. I got started talking with Reese...
Let's go!
Speak English.
Don't talk like dumb Polak!
I teach them. Where flame-thrower?
Homer, put that down and get out of here.
- Kolinsky, get back to your position.
- And them?
Reese will guard them.
Reese!
Well?
Get in there. Watch them.
- What did Pike say?
- Never mind. I've something to say.
Are you trying to take over my squad?
You watch them!
You're a good soldier, and you can point out my mistakes.
But nobody goes over my head.
What about Pike?
He wasn't there. The rumour is that the Company's coming back.
- The rumour is?
- And you'll carry out my orders!
Wave that finger again,
I'll take your head off.
I'll give you that chance. When this is over, I'll square off with you!
Wanna know something?
That's the best thing
I've got to look forward to!
Larkin?
All right. Let's get ready.
- Is that the Company?
- On the way back. Where's Larkin?
Dead.
Anybody else?
Cumberly.
- Where are the rest?
- Out trying to take that pillbox.
Get that weapons platoon set up right away!
Fire when ready!
Range 800, use smoke!
My guts!
I can't run.
Oh, my guts!
My guts!
Morphine!
- Morphine!
- Get that jeep here!
My guts!
- Cease fire!
- Get his head up.
- Careful.
- Give a hand.
- My guts!
- Medic!
- My guts! It's not time yet!
- Keep his head up.
- Morphine!
- Medic!
You go home to States. I join you later.
If you see my wife...
If you see my wife, don't tell her it was like this!
- Morphine!
- Take it easy.
He's dead.
Corby.
Yes, Sergeant?
Reese.
- How close did you get?
- About 200 yards.
- How did it happen?
- Minefield.
- Henshaw?
- Yeah.
He tripped a mine.
His torch lit up the whole countryside.
Put us right on the block.
Were you right?
How the hell do I know?
Reese!
Who gave the order for that attempt on the pillbox?
- I did, sir.
- You had orders to hold the ridge.
What about Kolinsky?
What about the man you left in the field?
And you gave the order?
You're a private.
You don't give orders, you take them!
We're attacking at 06.00 tomorrow, or I'd court martial you right here in the field!
Hear me? You'll face a court martial that's gonna pin your ears back!
2nd Squad!
Keep it down.
I'm afraid this is it, Sergeant.
Join up with 1 st Squad.
Come on!
Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
When the barrage lifts, we go.
Captain Loomis is on our left,
Lieutenant Jacobs on the right.
Our job is that pillbox.
Good.
Let's go!
Move up on the line!
Move out!
Radio!
Weapons platoon. We're at the tank on the dragon's teeth.
We're held up by a minefield.
Blow us a path through!
Up two turns, left five-zero. Fire!
Let's go! 1 st Squad around to the left!
Move up on the line!
Move out!
1 st Squad, take the right side of the pillbox. We'll cover!
Move out!
Cover Reese!
Burn it!
Burn it!
