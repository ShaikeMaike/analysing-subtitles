Love from Israel - Sept 2007
Audiences like thrillers.
It's pleasant, watching a story knowing how it's going to end.
In general, it's flattering to feel smarter than the authors.
The people in the capital contend that this improbable story took place in Moscow.
Odessa residents insist that it was their lovely city where it happened.
Leningrad and Rostov-on-the-Don disagree.
Seven cities contend over this, just as seven cities call themselves the birthplace of Homer.
To tell you the truth, it's unknown where this story took place, and whether it took place at all.
And so, as you've noticed, it was a dark night.
The anonymous man tried very hard to remain undetected, and at this he succeeded.
It was so dark, quiet and deserted, that one felt almost compelled to commit a crime.
Beregis avtomobilya
- Call Post number 2-06/B...
- Got it!
- Close down all the roads!
- Got it!
Immediately get me the photos
- ...of the treadmarks!
- Got it!
Tanya! You find out about the fingerprints!
So... This is the third car to be stolen from the same area.
All three were done by the same hand.
Experienced and skillful.
Maxim Petrovich, this hand was working clad in cotton gloves from factory no. 8.
Then it's not "Gold Tooth" Peter.
And what did we learn from analyzing the oil which this criminal so enjoys using on the garage hinges?
Turns out the oil is refined.
Did you notice that in that yard, where this theft occured, and nearby on the street, many garage-less cars are left overnight?
I did.
And isn't it easier to steal a car from the street than out of a garage?
That's a very accurate observation.
If one were to apply Stanislavsky's teachings about the Ultimate Goal, a curious thought arises: the criminal is advancing by the path of most resistance. And why?
Well, when we discover his Ultimate Goal, we'll catch the criminal.
That's grand!
Comrade Investigator, I forgot to inform you of one detail
- ...that might be helpful.
- I'm listening, Comrade Victim.
Above my back-left wheel, there was a dirty word scratched with a nail...
Hold on...
Ok...
Which?
Hello, Luba.
I'm back.
Comrades! Please fill the vehicle quickly, don't just stay near the tail.
Yuri Ivanovich, to get on the trolleybus enter from the other side.
Here I go.
- Hello, Jacov Michaelovich!
- Oh, hello, Detochkin!
- Well, how's your uncle in Dushanbe?
- Uncle? Poorly.
And last time it was your aunt from Moldova...
My first cousin.
- I thought you said...
- She passed away.
Yes... We're all mortal, Detochkin...
All but mortal.
But if people did not die, we wouldn't be able to sell life insurance, right?
You cannot deny, Detochkin, that
I give you special attention and care.
Each time your relatives get sick or die,
I grant you unpaid leave.
You're an exceptionally understanding manager.
That's true, Detochkin, but your relatives are plentiful, but I only have very few staff units... Yes, yes.
You  see, your trips are interfering with our plans.
I'll make up for it!
Really? Please understand,
Detochkin,
I can't put personal considerations above public ones, I have no choice.
- I... I'll make up for it!
- Well, go make it up...
- A policeman told me yesterady that the appointment letter isn't valid. - Why?
- Because you'll need to notarize it.
- Alright.
- Your signature, please.
- Dima, sign it.
To be honest, I don't even know why I get insurance for my possessions.
What about fires?
It would be a shame if such possessions were to burn down with no compensation.
Maybe we should insure our car too?
Did you buy a car?
As you wish. Insurance for personal cars covers death, accidents involving collision or acts of God.
- What about theft?
- Well, not theft.
Mr. Ivanovich, I'm not yet rich enough to pay for acts of God...
- And where do you keep it?
- Come here!
Beige... not a garish color.
Don't you have a garage?
Not at the moment.
I keep trying, but it's not at all easy.
The space is still only a promise, so no garage yet.
But I already got a lock...
It's Japanese. No one can fool it.
Yes, no doubt it's hard...
Not even with a master key.
This calls for a blowtorch...
Cutting with those is such a hassle...
Please...
- So long.
- Goodbye.
Well done, dear...
- Want a ride?
- I'm going the other way.
Suite yourself!
Anyone who doesn't own a car dreams of buying one.
And anyone with a car wishes he could sell it, and refrains from doing so only because "then you won't have a car!".
Man, more so than any other living creature, loves creating unnecessary difficulties for himself.
This is precisely the way to explain the wish to have your own car.
The thought that 5,000 Rubals, just thrown away on fancy wheels, could poison any happy soul.
- Mom...
- You're here!
I still don't understand what sort of business trips an insurance salesman has.
What are you waiting for?
Dinner's ready. Wash your hands.
What's making your briefcase so heavy?
Mom, it has all the stuff
I need for my work.
You're scary to look at, you've become so thin...
These trips are suspicious... I wrote the newspaper to say milk should be delivered...
Oh - Karchnoy won the chess tournament, but I was rooting for Tal.
He lost by half a point...
Don't mock your mother!
- Welcome back!
- Thanks.
Eat, and don't slouch.
These trips look suspicious to others besides me.
Who else?
Dumas' last book was a cookbook.
You're eating onion soup by the great author Dumas-senior.
- It's good... - These trips look suspicious to Luba. And she's right.
- She doesn't wish to marry a loser.
- Did she tell you that?
What is it with you?
No, not now. He's only just came back.
No, I think not.
That night, Maxim Podberozivokov was moving in an unknown direction.
From across this big city, in an even more unknown direction,
Yuri Detochkin was advancing.
They were walking towards fate.
They were growing closer.
Every investigator must have a hobby, to which he devotes his free time, left when he's not pursuing criminals.
For instance, Sherlock Holmes played the violin,
For Maxim Podberozivokov, it was amateur acting.
...the development of the popular art of amateur acting is moving forward with seven league steps. Finally, new times are breathing down the neck of the likes of us, the collectives of amateur performance. We are being expanded, with the creation of popular theater, by forming a select team out of local groups.
Today is a festive day for us.
We're creating a new popular theater!
I hope it will be a sturdy organism... a solid...
- Comrade Detochkin! Sit down!
- What for?... Hello, Sir.
Pardon...
...between these hospitable walls of our art house we find all the conditions for people of various professions to get acquainted with Melpomene (Muse of Tragedy) who was, as you know... a Muse...
Our own community theater, you see, consists of two collectives of comrades.
Policemen, and, well... chauffeurs.
- I recognized you.
- But it isn't me...
Sure it's you...
You said: "A who is to judge?"
I've never said any such thing about any judges...
You did, you did...
Wasn't it you who played Chatskov?
Oh... It was.
I completely forgot...
And now the two of us will be acting in the same play.
- I'm very glad!
- Me too!
Some say, that these popular theaters will soon replace, and rightly so, professional theater!
And they are right!
When I worked in the theater... and I was... Well, nevermind.
And obviously, an actor who isn't being paid will act with more inspiration!
And besides, an actor should work somewhere...
You see, it's just not appropriate for him to spend all his days in the theater, loafing about!
I mean, how much better Yermolova could have been acting, if by day... you see... by day she worked... at the sanding machine.
The calling of the community theater comes with many responsibilities.
Oh, we played them all in our collectives...
It's best to forget...
Is it not time, my friends, for us to take a swing at our own,
William... you see, well, Shakespeare.
Let's swing away!
Here, an "Alpinist" transistor radio.
Careful, please.
- Pardon, who's Dima? - I'm Dima.
- I'm here for Oleg Nikolayovich.
- Which Oleg Nikolayovich?
- Your pal Oleg Nikolayovich. - I'm listening.
- Sign it out, please.
- There you go.
- How many speeds on this?
- Three: 78, 35 and 43. Cashier's over there...
I require a voice tape recorder.
Either American or German made...
Here's a great one.
Made in the motherland.
Motherland-made won't do, thanks.
- A foreign one's hard to find...
- I understand! How much?
- What is it, Sir?
- I'm looking.
What is this, a zoo?
Here's a TV, go and look.
- Fifty.
- Fifty??
- Get a grip, man!
- It takes finding, transport...
- Italian? - Yeah.
- It'll have to be resereved...
- Leave me your number.
- OK.
- "Belomor" cigarettes, please.
- No Belomor. - What, then...?
- Well, then some Droog cigarettes, please.
- Here, 30 Kopeks, please.
Taxi! Taxi!
Please, Sir! I beg you!
I'm late! Is this your car?
- No.
- But you're the driver?
No, no.
- Then what are you doing?
- I'm trying to steal it, but you're in the way.
Then please, steal me along with it,
I'm late for my train!
- You're really late?
- Yes.
- Get in. - Thank you!
- Mind you, you're an accomplice now!
Very good...
To the Kurski station!
There!
I did warn you...
Hold him! There he is!
We got him! Hold the thief!
Hold him! Don't let go.
Oh, you little thief...
I'm no thief! I'm late for a train!
Look, there's my ticket!
He came prepared! Look how cautious he is, ah?
Police!
Police!
Finally! Quick! We caught the little crook!
He tried to steal my car!
I beg you, hurry.
Hold him!
- Who's the owner? - I am!
I mean, we. We caught the thief.
I'm not a thief! I'm late for a train and he took away my ticket!
- Your papers?
- Here's the ticket.
- And yours. - What for?
- For the car.
- We'll clear this up somewhere else.
Is there a witness? - Me! Why? What happened?
I'm not the thief! He got away.
Unfortunately, I can't remember his face...
- I'm late for the train! Actually,
I'm too late already. - Hold him!
"Shakespeare"
Drama
- Yours? - No! God forbid!
- Yours? - No...
Yes! I am a witnsess! Me!
I look better in profile...
Well, let me start at the very beginning...
I didn't get any Belomor delivered this morning. "Oh well", I said to myself.
I'm tired of saying "No Belomor!" all day long...
Maybe you could try to be brief?
Young man, in your profession you should not be hasty.
"Belomor" is a lead for this investigation! This very person, the one who broke into your car, first asked for Belomors, and then bought Droog cigarettes.
Thirty Kopeks, with the little dog on the pack.
Then I thought:
"Why is he nervous? Why?"
Wait! Stop! What do you keep thinking to yourself?
Every actor must have his lines memorized perfectly.
There's no need to run around the stage.
Act with your head!
And no need to swear, either, or I'll take you off the field... the, ah... rehearsal.
- I don't swear, I...
- Recess!
About this part, Yevgeni Alexandrovich:
"Let go, for God's sake!"
Oh, let it go...
It's recess...
- What am I to him, a child?
- Oh, don't get upset... - Smoke?
- What are you smoking?
- Droog cigarettes.
Yes... Droog cigarettes...
With the little dog... 30 Kopeks...
Usually I smoke Belomor, but they didn't have any.
Out of Belomor, you're right, so he bought Droog.
- "He" who?
- The criminal.
What criminal?
A modern one. Cultured. I might even call him a new type of criminal.
- What did crooks use to forget at crime scenes? - What?
Hats, cigarette butts, and now...
Shakespeare!
Don't be alarmed.
No blood stains here!
- So you're, what, an investigator?
- Yes, I handle car theft cases. - Theft?...
No fingerprints.
The criminal works with gloves on.
- But this does not interest you...
- No... it's very interesting!
You see, there's no library stamp, no...
I said, there's no library stamp, or an owner's name.
You know how some people write their name on their books?
I know, but I don't do it.
It's a secret, but there's a "crew" in the city, stealing personal vehicles.
Four vehicles stolen from the same area in the past year.
Three!
Oh, even you've heard.
Yes, three.
They failed to steal the forth.
But this will all end soon.
- And how's that? - We caught a member of the crew. - Who?
A respectable person. An engineer.
The wife - a doctor. Two kids.
Only recently got an apartment, and this is what he's up to!
- What does he look like?
- A small fellow.
- Kinda round?
- Yes...
- And... you arrested him?
- Oh, no need for such harsh measures.
He planned to escape to a holiday resort, but I now he can't leave the city.
What if he's not an accomplice, and you've robbed such a respectable person of his vacation time?
My gut tells me he's innocent.
But a full inquiry is still a matter of a few days.
I already know the identifying marks of the crew's leader...
Tall, wears a raincoat, a hat and carries a briefcase.
And most importantly, he's round-shouldered.
And how do you plan to catch the leader?
Comrades! The second half please!
We'd like a metal trap, please.
For a large animal.
- Going for a fox, a wolf?
- A bear. - A wolf. She's kidding...
Could you tell me how it works?
You place the bait here.
- You have bait?
- Yes, yes.
The predator smells the bait, sneaks up... and he's caught!
- Lovely!
- Sign it out!
- Going well, no?
- Excellent! Now bring the ice cream...
Sima! You're not in the forest!
Guys, don't seperate! (also 'stand out')
Join the Collective!
Go on!
Semitsvetov!
Dima!
- You've got a blonde!
- Sorta beige!
I love night rides!
Guys, when I drink
I don't get behind the wheel!
Give us a ride, Dima!
Give us a ride, DI-MA!
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!
The police invented a test tube where you go... *pfff*...
You blow and it tells them if you've been drinking.
And if you have - they take your license, right?
- I'll go anyway!
- Sima dear, this isn't the beach!
- Don't lie on it! It's been polished!
- There you go...
- Say, I am totally loaded!
- Yes!
I need to put myself in a horizontal position.
- Who is it?
- Luba, it's me!
What is it?
What happened?
- You see, Luba... Somebody put bear traps all over the place! - Oh, lord!
Poor me... So unlucky...
I was so unlucky...
The criminal attempted to steal the same car twice.
I don't think it's coincidental.
I think he wanted your car specifically.
- Makes sense... I came to the same conclusion. - But why?
Still, setting a bear trap for a human being is not justified!
You couldn't save us from the bandit, we had to try self-defense.
Why does he cling to your car specifically?
- You're asking me?
- Who else?
Do you not suspect any of your acquaintances?
They are perfectly decent people.
Well, perhaps somebody is jealous of you?
- Of what?
- Strange questions, Comrade Inv.
Check with medical clinics to see if they had anyone with this kind of leg injury.
Well, let's put your car under surveillance.
- No, thank you... No need.
- We're installing a shed tomorrow.
Yes?
Oh, Yuri Ivanovich.
"Can't come"?? Careful, the director will call for a penalty kick!
Oh, your leg hurts? Well, then stay in bed, of course...
I'll tell him.
Feel better!
- Whose leg?
- This leg?
...Someone where there should... leg.
- Well, then, give a call.
- When?
When your car is stolen.
Dima! They're confiscating
Topunov's summer house!
- Who's confiscating?
- What are you, stupid?
Daddy! They're confiscating
Topunov's summer house!
And rightly so!
Long overdue!
We must fight "alleged" scoundrels!
Why "scoundrel"? (dishonest, bribe taker)
The man knows how to live.
Tell me, what sort of wages allow a vice president of a knitting factory to "score" a 2-story palace!
- Simon Maximovich, it's his business.
- No, ours!
We must mercilessly fight any persons living on, shall we say, "ill-gotten gains"!
- Be quiet, dad!
- Scared you, didn't I?
Why don't I just kick you and throw you off my property?
Dad, I'm sick of your barracks-style sense of humor... Why always the kicking?
Why so arrogant, son-in-law?
Who the hell are you??
This is MY summerhouse!
Please don't argue, the workers might hear...
Let everyone hear: it's MY summerhouse!
Listed as yours... but built with my money!
- Try and prove it!
- Oh, stop it, will you?
You live your life by proxy!
- Get awa...
- Leave the doggy!
Car under your wife's name, the summerhouse under mine...
You have nothing!
You're dirt poor!
Why? Why must I live like this??
Dear god, what for? Why?
Me, a person with higher education, has to sneak around, adapt...
...and wriggle!
Why can't I live freely, openly?
- Oh, when will it end?
- Never! What do you mean, though?
Do you realize what
I could do to you over this?
Just like that!
I do...
I know.
Ah... He's scared!
Show him some mercy, daddy!
This guy must never forgot who I am!
While he's just an ordinary scoundrel!
Simon Vasil...
I probably should kick you after all!
Oh, I just gotta!
- Who is it?
- Luba, it's me!
- What happened? Another trap?
- No, this time it went... ok.
Thank god...
You're going away?
A business trip?
Right now?
At night?
Don't blame me... I have to... because, you see, business trips are a complex thing to arrange...
Luba? There's no need to get so upset...
I'll be back in a few days.
I'll write you from there, ok?
Luba? I am very upset too...
Don't you see?
- Excuse me! Hello!
- Hello.
- Our car, has a problem when turning right. - I'll take a look.
- Yes. Also, when shifting gears it makes this ticking... - I'll give a listen.
- And the front-right wheel overheats...
- I'll give it a feel.
- Yes. Also, two days ago the car smelled like gas all day... - I'll smell it.
- I think it's the...
- Open the garage, will you?
Well, where's the car?
- Comrade Commander...
- Hello! - Hello.
I see you're traveling alone. Please, could you help me start this piece of junk?
- Help start the motorcycle?
- Yes, can't do it alone. - With pleasure!
No... battery's dead!
I've asked them a thousand times to get me a new bike...
- Yes, you can't live with an old battery... - Tell me about it...
- So? On three?
- Let's give it a try!
Get on!
Ok, now give us a boost!
Come on, little boost, little boost...
- Ok, stop! I can see you're out of breath. - A bit, yeah.
- Well, now let me push you around.
- What's the point?
Listen, friend. Let's tow it with your Volga. You got a cable?
Oh, who knows what's in there...
I can't remember.
I'll have a look.
Got tow-rope!
We're good!
- It's fixed! Thank you, friend.
You saved me! - Don't mention it...
- People are friends to one another.
- That's excatly right!
I was in trouble - you helped.
If you were in trouble -
I'd help.
Together we work at a common goal: you - your way, and I mine. - Exactly!
Say, friend, is there a telegraph nearby?
Not far.
Get in, I'll escort you.
"GAS STATION"
I would like to ask for 5 days vacation due to the grave health situation...
...situation of... of... my beloved nephew. Thank you.
Oh? Oh?... Right, I see.
Writing it down...
Right!
Resting?
- Is something wrong?
- No, no... Nothing.
- Who's the owner?
- Yeah, who's the owner??
Me.
- The documents for it!
- The docum--...
I apologize.
The chase! What thriller story can do without it?
One runs, the other keeps up.
This - is the unbreakable genre rule.
A thriller without a chase, is like... life without love.
Detochkin loved children.
He had no choice.
Detochkin saw that it was over.
He felt like shutting his eyes close... but feared of hitting schoolchildren.
But the inspector also loved children, and couldn't honorably cede to Detochkin.
- You're nicked, brother!
- Oh, yeah?
From the Police, it's useless to...
What the hell? Wait up!
- You! Don't drive off! Wait!
- So, brother?
What "so?"
It's the battery again...
I did warn you that you can't live with an old battery.
- I've always feared it'll break during an important job... - Of course!
There! They couldn't just replace my motorcycle... - My sympathies!
- You didn't get lucky!
- But you did.
- Well, one of us two had to get lucky. - Right...
So what shall we do, brother?
Why did you run away from me?
Force of habit.
You chase, I run.
Me too! You run, I chase you.
Maybe lend me a hand?
We'll hook it up to your Volga, like we did the first time.
No! I've seen how you repay kindness!
Sorry. I'm going.
- Don't interfere.
- Look, the police!
Lock the garage.
- Commence!
- Up!
Down...
I've always said that this criminal is talented.
Perhaps even... more talented than me.
- That can't be!
- No, it happens...
Jesus... All in singles!
No interrupt me, or I to start from beginning.
There - 5,500!
Pardon, but why is all your money in singles? It's suspicious.
And who are you?
The public prosecutor?
I don't ask where you got the car, why there're no documents.
I can answer openly -
I stole this car.
I can tell you who from and why.
I too can tell you honestly:
I'm a pastor.
These Rubals - donations to Him.
Well, there was a bit left over...
And you believe in God?
All people believe. Some, that god exists.
Others, that he doesn't.
Neither can be proven.
Are you gonna count again?
I am!
As promised: Grundig tape recorder.
Four tracks, stereo sound...
But is it new?
- Brand new. I checked personally.
- Well, I'll take it... I remember.
- Eighty.
- What? You said fifty!
- Things have changed for me.
- Well, this is a robbery!
You don't have to. I'll sell it. in a second! So elegant...
- ...four tracks, stereo sound...
- I'll take it.
Mister, this item is sold.
Don't touch it, it's sold.
But why do you suppose he stole YOUR car?
- What's wrong?
- They caught me.
I'm a dead man.
The investigator came to see me.
They'll lock you up.
Next time don't steal...
Semion Vasiliovich!
You're in MY home!
- Jail is your home...
- Dad! Bad day for these jokes!
Inka! What shall I do??
What to do?
Start drying crackers!
Dima, don't worry!
We need to bribe him!
Bribe him?! Are you crazy?
You're crazy!
- If you give a lot, he'll take it!
- Be quiet! Calm down!
I won't allow it!
A disgrace!
Dad, why don't you go back to the marketplace with your wisdom!
I sell strawberries grown with my own two hands!
For bribery - I'll destroy not only a son-in-law, but my own daughter!
Don't worry...
In jail you'll be re-educated.
Ten years from now, you'll return a new man!
Put the birdie down!
Should have married an orphan...
Don't worry, I really do have all that money. Here, a full bag.
Do you really want to transfer that amount
- ...to that orphanage?
- Yes.
Did you grow up there?
Are these your personal savings?
Well, how shall I put it...
I, too, played a part in it.
- Hello. I'm looking for Yuri Ivanovich
Detochkin. - Please enter.
- I'm Yuri's mother.
- Nice to meet you.
I'm from the community theater.
I'm so glad Yuri's in the theater.
- I think he has skill.
- He's really talented!
- He didn't show up for rehearsal...
- Sweetheart, he's on a business trip.
I hate his business trips!
Running off at night, disappearing.
- Luba's got a point, it's not right!
- But when...?
Luba - that's his bride.
There's her photo.
He's kind of old-fashioned.
His courtship was very long.
She drives the trolleybus.
Admirable woman.
They met when he came to sell her insurance...
Tell me, what sort of business trips could an insurance agent even have?
Why does he return nervous?
- You know... - What is it you do?
- I'm an investigator.
Well you should figure this out!
When I was young, I was being courted by an investigator.
But I married a man from the Red Army.
The whole battalion came to the wedding!
We sang: "Our train flies forward, next stop - in The Commune!"
- Do you know it?
- (he recites next line)
- But when did he leave? For how long?
- Two days ago, at night.
And the strangest thing was he came to bid goodbye to Luba in some Volga.
- Well, a taxi then.
- No! He was behind the wheel!
- Can Yuri really drive a car?
- Yuri? He was a driver for 10 years.
He had an accident, got a concussion.
He lay in the hospital, I sat next to him.
The doctors advised him to stop driving for a while, and he became an insurance salesman, temporarily.
I can't wait till they're married.
I dream of a grandson. Or daughter...
What's with you?
What city did you send your employee
...Mr. Detochkin on a business trip?
I didn't send him anywhere.
You see...
Detochkin has many sickly relatives, in various cities in the Soviet Union.
I recently got a telegram...
There it is.
Yet another nephew... a beloved one, got sick. He took an unpaid vacation.
Maxim was beside himself.
Memories burned in his heart.
How cleverly Detochkin had masked his interest in the gang leader's pursuit! Hypocrite!
How he stole a car using a crane!
Sneaky liar!
Thief! Traitor!
He betrayed what's most important: friendship! No mercy for such a man...
Mom? It's me. Just got back.
I'm healthy.
Everything calm at home?
No visitors?
You've really done it with your community theater!
The was an investigator looking for you!
- En garde, Sir!
- I'm at your service...
It's my honor to attack you...
- Where've you been hiding?
- What?? I had a business trip!
And how's the nephew doing?
- What nephew?
- The beloved one!
And the wolf trap? The injured foot?
And the Droog cigarettes??
Stop improvising! There were no
"Droog" cigarettes in Shakespeare's time!
And why suddenly the past tense?
- Podberozivokov!
- Yes?
What do you keep thinking about?
Stop! Stop waving that sword!
- What a blow!
- Calm down!
- Where is he??
- He's awake!
- He's alive.
- Take five!
- How many cars did you sell?
- Four.
Suppose it's four. In perfect condition, they're worth quite a bit of money!
What made you this way?
Such a good mother, sings about trains...
- Pardon me, are you a loony?
- No. I even have a note...
Actor...
What an actor!
I've always said: real criminals, as a rule, are good actors!
I'm observant!
You stole only from people you thought were scoundrels! I knew right away.
Did you think in court they'd give you a year or two less?
Where are you hiding the money?
- Here.
- I see!
Hello! Why didn't you tell me right away?
I ask that you and your friend move to a private booth.
- Thanks, no need.
- Raichka! Lubochka!
They'll bring you fresh beer!
Just got a shipment! And some vobla fish...
- The vobla (dry salted fish) is fresh too?
- Funny guy, your friend!
So tell me... No news about the car?
- No, but soon.
- Good. Please, eat...
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's stay a bit, if that's ok.
In jail they probably won't feed me like they do here...
- What's this?
- Change of underwear, just in case.
- And these?
- Permits, receipts, documents.
- What documents? Where's the money?
- This is the money...
What? You gave the money away to orphanages?
- How much did you keep?
- I kept nothing.
Only for travel and expenses.
Yes, dear viewer. Detochkin didn't take any money.
True, he's a thief, but he's a selfless, honest human being.
They've put some accounting documents on their table.
It's the review board...
Server our "brand name" beer".
Ok.
I did not sell the first car.
I left it for the police at the station.
I put on the wind shield a long note explaining everything.
While I took a train home.
The second car... it wasn't entirely fair.
I drove it over to the police too, and again left a note, saying the owner's a scoundrel!
But they returned it to him...
Then I decided to start selling them.
I love you!
Here, it's the warrant for your arrest!
Now give it back!
Here.
- Now I shall tear it apart!
- Maxim! You mustn't!
- Yura!
- Don't you dare! You'll get in trouble!
Maxim! Fellows!
We're friends! Hey, guys!
Hey, boss! It's ok! Boss!
It's all good! Boss!
So take it!
I'm giving it to you!
Come in! Goodbye!
So long!
Friend!
Friend!
(singing: if I fall ill,
I won't go to the doctors.)
(I'll turn to my friends, and I'm not kidding either...)
Listen, friend! Don't put me away until opening night, I beg you.
I won't put you away at all!
Live free!
A role like this, comes once in a lifetime, you see?
Play opening night, and then all the shows after that!
- No need to let me play the rest.
- No! There IS a need!
- Oh, you...
- I'm off to Luba's.
Don't get hit by a car!
Why did you do it? Who asked you?
Who made you do it??
Look at yourself!
I mean... you're an idiot.
You're talking like a 3-year-old.
Why did you sit down?
Get up!
What to do? My God!
Did you think about me? No? No.
You've only ever thought of yourself!
They'll put you in jail, Yura,
- ...and they'll be right to do so.
- They will be wrong.
- Yes. - No.
- Button that...
I'll wait for you, Yura.
Five years, eight years, ten years.
- As long as it takes...
- Thank you...
Ten... that means
I'll be forty six by then.
- Yes, that's... well...
- My God!
- Who did I get involved with?!
- Who with indeed? Well?
No, I mean just look, see what you look like...
What do I look like?
My God! You've ruined my life...
Yurachka!
Yura!
- Good morning. It's me!
- Hello!
Tell me, have you heard that there was another car stolen today?
And did you look out your window today?
Hello? Hello! Say something.
You're looking out the window, are you?
And?
Why did you do that?
Since when are you stealing car from honest people?
What of your principles?
Oh, but it's Stelkin's car, and he takes bribes!
What Stelkin? This car belongs to a famous scientist! A PhD!
On moment, I'll just verify with my files.
He has files!
Pitiful bureaucrat!
THe car is Stelkin's, and he takes bribes!
It can't be!
Could I be wrong??
Take the car back to him immediately! And as for you...
I advise you to get over here, as they say, "all packed and ready"!
What about the show?
There will be no show!
Enter!
Here's the account about all the work done.
The report... about my arrest.
Good evening!
- Congratulations on the premiere!
- You too.
They got me such a funny wig!
Why would you need a wig?
You've spent your whole life "in costume".
And why do you talk about my life in some past tense?
Trial's tomorrow!
You're looking at 5 years.
I have mitigating circumstances:
I'm an honest person.
Like what? Stealing cars from criminals to sell to other criminals?
Honest indeed...
So my job had some drawbacks.
Whose doesn't?
You, for example, for a long time you failed to catch me.
It's hard to catch a person leading a double life!
- Lying and cheating everone!
- I was constantly tormented by that.
Tie the bow for me.
No good deed can go hand in hand with lying and dishonesty.
You played judge and executioner!
What gave you the right?
In all conscience, this is all a folly and a crime.
Crime...
You're in custody, where are you going?
- So you think I'm guilty too?
- Yes!
Comrades, we've got a full house!
Everyone on stage, please.
Oh, don't forget to say:
"To be or not to be?"
Still not ready?
Here, Hamlet, my handkerchief!
Wipe your forehead!
The Queen drinks to your success, Hamlet!
The third time, Laertes, stop kidding.
I ask you, attack with all your might!
- I'm afraid you think I'm a wuss.
- You think! We begin!
Let us forgive each other, honorable Hamlet.
Heaven make thee free of it!
I follow thee. Horatio!
I am dead...
Mother, adieu!
Yura, I'm here!
Stand up! Court is in session!
The trial continues.
Detochkin circumvented the law, but the law doesn't joke around.
In all his years, the judge had never before seen such a strange, paradoxical case.
The law could take Detochkin's freedom for as much as 5 years.
Detochkin isn't just a thief - but worse!
He's a bandit!
He should be tried for brigandage and breaking and entering!
This guy went after what is most sacred for us! The constitution!
It says there: "Every person has the right to own property...
...and it's protected by law."
Every man has the right to own a car, a summer home, books... money!
Comrades, nobody's canceled money yet.
From each according to their ability, to each according to their need... in cash.
Let the court note, that there are criminal charges against this witness, Mr Semitsvetov.
- Daddy! - No matter, dear, you'll find another, an honest one.
While Dima Semitsvetov's future was gradually become clearer, the future of Yuri Detochkin remained vague.
Finally, the court called the most important witness: Maxim Podberozivokov.
Distinguished memeber of the court.
First I lead this case as an investigator.
But when it turned out that the defendant was my friend,
I resigned from leading the case, and am now appearing only as a witness.
I understand, your honors, it's a complex issue:
Detochkin broke the law, but his motives were noble!
He was selling the cars, but giving the money to children.
He is, of course, guilty.
But he's not... guilty.
Please spare him, your honors.
He's a VERY good person.
And an excellent worker!
Well, you don't know, so shut up!
Free Yura Detochkin!
Quiet! I deman silence, or I'll clear this court!
The defendant - the final word is yours.
Your honors, perhpas I wasn't acting right...
...but with a pure heart.
I couldn't stand it...
I mean, people steal!... A lot!
I tried to help you, your honors.
That's why... this happened.
Let me go.
Please.
I won't do it again.
Honestly, I won't.
As we already know, audiences like thrillers.
It's pleasant, watching a story knowing how it's going to end.
This unlikely story - nobody knows where it took place,
...and whether it took place at all - is nearing its end.
Hello, Luba.
I am back.
The more adventurous among you... may remember our previous excursions into the macabre.
Our visits to haunted hills... to tinglers and to ghosts.
This time we have even a stranger tale to unfold.
Blood.
The story of a lovable group of people... who just happen to be homicidal.
No, Warren, it's mine!
How do you do?
I'd like a room with bath, please.
- Not on the street side.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Double or twins?
- Double.
For how long, miss?
Until September 6.
Would $5 a day be about right?
Is that the best you have?
We have a suite for $7.50, but we usually rent that to couples.
I'll take the double.
Number 17, Mrs. Webster.
Miss Webster.
Miss Webster.
Eddie.
No.
You.
I sort of do everything around here.
I say they ought to leave the windows open in here... so it won't be so stuffy, but they don't.
Are you married?
Married? No.
But that doesn't mean it hasn't crossed my mind.
I want some ice, please.
And maybe some glasses, too?
Just some ice.
In a flash.
Come in.
What's your name?
Jim. Jim Nesbitt.
Mine's Miriam Webster.
I know. I looked at the register.
If that's not enough, I can get some more.
There's a tip for you.
Did you know this was $100?
For a bucket of ice?
More than that.
Count it.
$2,000 altogether. Yours.
- Who do I have to murder?
- No one.
What do I have to do?
Marry me. On September 6.
Wow.
That wouldn't be so hard to take, even without this.
Very well.
One other thing.
The marriage will be annulled... immediately after the ceremony.
Annulled? You mean...
- Well, we don't have to be in too big of a...
- Do you understand that?
I understand what you're saying, but I don't understand why.
You don't have to understand.
You'll call for me at midnight on the 6th.
What kind of a deal is this?
Okay, Miriam.
What have I got to lose?
Not much.
All set for the happy event?
"Alfred S. Adrims.
1623 West Third Street."
- Do you know where that is?
- Sure.
But why way out there?
Because that's where we're going.
How are you going to get us annulled this time of night?
This is the strangest thing
I've ever been through.
- You gonna leave the keys in it?
- Who'd steal that heap?
No lights, huh?
- What do you want this time of night?
- We want to get married.
- Too late. Come back in the morning.
- Oh, please.
We've driven so far, and we have so far to go.
We'll pay. Extra.
- You sure you got the money?
- Yes.
Come on in. I'll see if he'll do it.
Wait here.
I never thought I'd get married in a dump like this.
Why can't you wait till a decent time to get married?
Once you do, you'll find there's time aplenty.
And more.
We're sorry. Aren't we, darling?
You will, won't you?
Well, this time of night, it's gonna cost you.
- Are you Alfred S. Adrims?
- Well, yeah.
Pay in advance.
And $2 extra for the music.
- It'll disturb the neighbours.
- Then play soft!
Well, let's begin.
You two stand over there.
- Where's my book, Martha?
- Where you left it last.
Let me see your papers.
You Webster? You Nesbitt?
You can stop now.
You take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
I guess so.
- Say "I do."
- I do.
You take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
Ain't you got no ring?
On her.
Take your glove off, so he can get the ring.
By the power vested in me by the State of California...
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Congratulations.
Now I get to kiss the little lady.
Get the police!
Get a doctor!
Get the police!
We interrupt this program to bring you a police bulletin.
Justice of the Peace Adrims was murdered in his home in Ventura tonight...
by a young woman whose description follows:
About 5'6", blonde, about 20 years old.
She is dressed in a beige coat, no hat...
and is believed to be driving a 1953 Chevrolet...
license IMR 1405.
Anyone knowing anything about this woman is asked to call the police.
Approach her with extreme caution as she is considered to be homicidal.
You should be asleep, Helga. It's late.
What's the matter, dear?
Is there something wrong?
Were you afraid, being in the house all alone?
What are you trying to tell me?
That you missed me?
That you're glad I'm back?
You shouldn't do that, dear.
It's very impolite.
Especially since I have something to tell you.
Adrims died tonight.
<b>Screaming!</b>
Good morning, Helga.
Did you have a nice rest?
No bad dreams, I hope.
Helga, what's the matter with you?
I only wanted to take you to the table.
You're very nervous this morning, darling.
Here's your milk.
Drink it.
You must, dear. It's good for you.
Helga, you are making me very angry.
Why are you doing that?
I know what you want.
You want me to taste it.
You think maybe I put something in it?
It's delicious.
Have some.
There. Now isn't that better?
You know, you've been very cross with me lately, Helga.
You shouldn't be angry with me.
I like you.
Would I let Warren bring me here, all the way from Denmark, if I didn't?
I think you're afraid of me, Helga.
You wouldn't want me to go away, would you? Leave you all alone?
Who would feed you, put you to bed?
You'd dry up.
You would dry up and die!
It's Miriam Webster.
She's brought you some flowers.
- Good morning, Emily.
- Good morning, Miriam.
Hello, Helga. How are you today?
I brought you some flowers.
She looks tired.
Well, she didn't sleep too well last night. She has dreams.
Warren should be here today.
That should cheer you up.
- This is his day to visit, isn't it?
- Of course. Every Thursday.
You should know that by now.
I mean, you always manage to drop by when Warren's here.
- Well, he's my brother.
- He's your half-brother.
Yes.
I don't get a chance to talk to Warren now that he's working in San Diego.
Well, I guess we're not as important as Warren.
You never come up to visit us.
Of course I do. I was here last weekend.
I forgot. You must have been feeling very generous.
Don't be silly, Emily.
You know I'm very fond of you and Helga.
But you like Warren more, don't you?
Is that why you've taken such an interest in him lately?
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
How's the flower shop?
Fine. I'm thinking of opening another one in Santa Maria.
That'll take a lot of money.
Yes, I suppose it will.
Warren bought the flower shop, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Then you have no problem.
He'll buy you another one.
I can pay for it myself.
But with Warren coming into all that money...
I'm sure he'll want you to have some.
- Emily, I...
- Helga, look.
Wasn't that nice of Miriam?
Aren't they pretty?
I'll put them in your room for you.
I'm sorry. I think I interrupted you.
It wasn't anything.
I was wondering if I could ask you a favour.
Well, of course. What is it?
I have to go into Solvang for a prescription for Helga.
Would you stay with her?
- Is something wrong, Helga?
- She doesn't want to me leave.
But I have to, dear.
You know how important this prescription is.
Karl could fix it up in no time.
Would you stay until Warren gets here?
Karl and I were thinking of going on a picnic. It's such a lovely day.
You can go this afternoon.
I wouldn't ask you, Miriam, but she needs the medicine.
Why, yes, of course.
And that will give me a chance to talk with Warren.
Thanks, Miriam.
And Helga thanks you, too.
- What does she want?
- She's just saying goodbye.
I think it's wonderful the way you understand what she's saying.
We know each other very well, don't we, Helga?
I want to see if I have the prescription.
Yes, here it is.
I know you'll miss me, dear.
I'll miss you, too.
Bye.
- Hi, Emily.
- Hello, Karl.
There you are, Johnny. If you need any help with that, just let me know.
Boy, what a great day outside.
How are you, Emily?
Emily, how are you?
- Fine.
- How's Helga getting along?
About the same. I have a prescription.
A professional call, huh?
All right, come on over to drugs.
Well, let's have it.
- Say, this is dangerous stuff.
- Is it?
Sure. That's strychnine, see?
I'll have to be very careful when I give it to her.
This won't take me but a couple of minutes to fix. You want to wait?
Fine.
You know, Miriam and I have the whole day planned out.
We're going to pack a picnic lunch and head for the woods.
Be a shame to waste such a nice day.
Karl, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you about Miriam.
- What's that?
- She can't make it today.
Why?
Something's come up, and she's got to talk to Warren.
- Disappointed?
- Well, sure I am.
I was looking forward to this.
Can I take her place?
Well, thanks anyway, Emily, but I might as well stay here.
I've got work to do, anyway.
Karl, Miriam wants you to pick her up tonight at the flower shop when you close.
I'll never understand women.
They're planning something new every minute.
- Howdy, Karl.
- Howdy.
Think you can fill this for me in a hurry?
Just as soon as I'm finished with this one, Dr. Jonas.
I guess I can wait a couple of minutes.
Always telling everybody else to slow down.
Aren't you Emily, up at Helga's place?
That's right.
Yeah. I've been meaning to go up to see her for a long time.
Never seem to have the time.
- How is old Helga?
- She's just fine.
Yeah? And I'm glad to hear it.
You know, she's a strange woman, that Helga.
She was my nurse when I had my office in Ventura.
- That was years ago.
- I didn't know that, Doc.
Yeah, sure. There you are.
As a matter of fact, she was the one that delivered Warren.
I thought you did.
What's the matter, Doc?
Dereliction of duty?
No. I was sick at the time.
No, Helga delivered him and then she quit me cold.
It was a funny thing.
Maybe she thought you were upset with her.
Maybe.
She was good friends with Warren's mother.
They were all hoping for a boy, and pleased as punch when they got one.
I wish I'd known Warren when he was younger.
Yeah. Nice fellow.
Shame when his parents died.
Helga brought him up.
Took him back to Denmark with her.
Isn't that where Warren met you, Emily?
Yes. When Helga had her stroke, he asked me to come back and take care of her.
He's been home about a year, hasn't he?
My goodness. Time certainly flies.
Seems like only a month or two.
Here you are, Emily.
- How much do I owe you?
- I'll just put it on the bill.
Thank you.
You sure you don't want to change your mind about the picnic?
No, thanks. I think I'd better stay here.
What's this now? Are you turning down a nice young girl, Karl?
You're making a mistake.
Always try to keep my eye on the couples in town. Good for business.
I didn't know you and Karl had a thing going.
We don't.
Maybe you and Warren then.
So that's it, huh?
He's a good prospect, coming into all that money.
You'd be rich.
I have to get back to Helga's. Bye.
Say hello to her for me.
Tell her I'll be in to see her one of these days.
Unusual girl, Karl.
Good looking, too. You're missing a bet.
I wonder.
Miriam?
Anybody here?
Karl, wake up.
Come on, Karl, snap out of it.
Oh, brother.
It feels like I've got two heads and both of them are killing me.
You all right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Warren, what are you doing here?
I was just driving up to Helga's.
I thought I'd stop by and see Miriam first.
What happened?
Who made the mess in the shop?
That's what I'd like to know.
Stopped by to see your sister.
- Where is Miriam? Did you see her?
- No. I just got in from San Diego.
She's probably up at the house.
- Do you have your wallet?
- Yeah.
Thought it might have been a robbery.
More like malicious damage. Look.
Somebody doesn't like you.
Seems that way.
What kind of a mind would do something like this?
More like an animal than a human being.
- Karl.
- Yeah.
You seen this?
- I read it this morning.
- Look at the drawing.
So?
I stopped for gas and saw the papers in the rack.
The picture gave me a start.
Just my imagination, I guess.
Well, this isn't. Somebody was in here.
Think I'd better get back up to the house and see if Miriam's all right.
- Yes?
- Whoever was in here might come back.
Why doesn't Miriam spend the night with you, up at the house?
- Do you really think she's in danger?
- Why take chances?
And don't tell her what happened.
There's no sense in getting her upset.
I'll stay and clean up.
And be careful yourself.
Remember, somebody smashed your photograph.
Miriam? Emily?
Hello, Warren.
- Are you all right?
- Of course. Why?
Where's Emily and Helga?
I finally put Helga to bed.
And as for Emily, I haven't seen her all day.
Warren, you're going to have to do something about her.
- What do you mean?
- She deliberately lied to me.
She said she was going to get a prescription filled for Helga and come right back.
- But she never showed up.
- I guess she took the day off.
- Yes, I guess she did.
- I'll talk to her about it.
- What do you really know about her?
- What do we really know about anybody?
Well, I don't like her, and I don't think Helga does, either.
Look, Miriam, they've been together for years. Helga needs her.
Besides, you're probably just angry because of today.
Probably.
Can you blame her for taking off once a while?
She's cooped up here all week. She gets lonely, likes to take a drive now and then.
- I guess you're right.
- What were you doing in the playroom?
Revisiting the past?
So long since I've been in here.
I don't know whether I like it or not.
Why?
Things it reminds me of.
Helga would never let me in here.
She was always trying to keep us away from each other.
That was part of the system.
Toughen me up, keep girls out of my life.
Make me more of a man.
All because of my father.
- I hardly even remember him.
- I do.
I remember everything he did to make me as hard and ruthless as he was.
Do you know that he even paid Karl to start fights with me when we were kids?
I used to watch the two of you hitting each other.
And I'd look at Father.
He'd be smiling.
Remember this?
Helga would come in here with this, all to make me strong.
I'd learn to count on my back.
I don't think I'll ever forgive Helga for that.
She was only obeying orders.
Father's orders.
Why don't we forget about it?
Can you?
Can you forget what he did to your mother?
He threw her over when you were born just because he wanted a son.
I know.
Then he married my mother and he got the boy he wanted.
Too bad he only had a few years left to enjoy me.
Then the night he and mother went to the party and got drunk.
They got in their car and started speeding and smashed into a wall.
- Warren, please.
- I'm sorry. That was a long time ago.
I shouldn't talk about it.
Besides, I should be thanking Dad right now.
In two days, I'll be 21... and that means I'll be coming into roughly $10 million.
- And that's a lot of money.
- That's a cheap price for being his son.
Well, making money was the only thing he knew how to do.
I'm glad you're not like him.
You know, if I die before my birthday, you get all the loot.
What would you do with it?
Give it away. So stay alive.
Warren, do you remember the only argument we ever had?
It was over this.
How you howled when I swiped it from you.
And you never gave it back to me, either.
Keep it. Take it home with you.
That reminds me.
I'd better be getting back.
Spend the night here and then we can have breakfast in the morning.
All right. I'm a little tired for driving, anyway.
The bed's made up. I'll leave a note for Emily and she can wake us both early.
Don't bother. I'm a light sleeper.
Happy birthday, Warren... two days in advance.
Good night.
Emily, what're you doing in my room?
Emily, what do you want?
If you don't get out of here,
I'm going to call Warren.
Do you hear me?
Warren, darling, I'm back.
Did you miss me?
I worry about you, Emily.
Good morning, Miriam. Is Warren up?
I don't know.
Well, I'm cooking his breakfast now.
He asked me to wake him.
Emily, what were you doing in my room last night?
Your room? I don't understand.
You were in my room last night.
In the middle of the night. I saw you.
- Well, you must have been dreaming.
- I wasn't dreaming, Emily.
I got up to close the window and you were standing there.
You're just like Helga.
Both of you keep having nightmares.
What about yesterday?
Was that a nightmare?
You left the house and never came back.
I did, didn't I?
I apologise, Miriam.
I just decided I wanted to take a drive.
And did you just decide that you wanted to come into my room?
You better see a doctor, dear.
You're imagining things.
Look, Emily, I've had just about enough of this.
I'm going to talk to Warren and we can get somebody else to take care of Helga.
No, you can't.
- Where are you going?
- To see Warren.
- Not until he's had his breakfast.
- I'll take it to him.
No, it's my duty. I'm his wife.
- I don't believe you.
- Ask him.
- I will.
- Miriam... if you stay in this house one more minute, I'm going to kill you.
- Miss Miriam Webster?
- Yes?
My name is Lieutenant Miller,
Ventura Plainclothes Division.
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
- Why? Is someone in trouble?
- No, miss. Just routine.
Mind telling me where you were the night before last?
The night before last?
I was at a movie.
- Alone?
- No. With a friend.
The name, please.
Karl Anderson.
He owns the drugstore at the corner.
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Will you excuse me a minute, miss?
Are you sure that's not the one?
Nope. That's not her.
Okay. Thanks.
- I'm sorry to trouble you, miss.
- Wait a minute.
What's this all about?
Well, we had a murder down in Ventura the other day.
A girl killed a Justice of the Peace.
- What has that got to do with me?
- She used the name Miriam Webster.
- What?
- Probably just a coincidence.
Lots of Miriam Websters in Southern California.
Here's my card, miss.
In case you find out anyone's been using your name. Give me a call.
- Hello, Karl.
- Hi.
Did that police car just pull away from here?
- Yes.
- What did they want?
A Justice of the Peace was murdered in Ventura.
I know. I read it in the paper.
Yeah, well, that's what they wanted.
So what's that got to do with you?
The girl who killed him used my name.
The detective asked me to call him if I found out anything.
- The police don't think you had anything...
- I don't know what they think, Karl.
I'm sorry.
It's just that so much is happening that I don't understand.
Last night Emily came into my room.
- What for?
- I don't know.
When I asked her about it this morning, she denied it, said I was dreaming.
And then she threatened to kill me unless I left the house.
Where was Emily yesterday afternoon?
She said she was out driving. Why?
Someone was in here yesterday while you were gone.
A wedding wreath was destroyed and Warren's picture was smashed.
Who would do such a thing?
I cleaned up here last night and found this.
That's the prescription I filled for Emily yesterday.
And whoever was in here last night dropped it.
Emily.
I'm going to call the police.
No.
Why?
Warren and Emily are married.
Married? I don't believe it.
Well, that's what she told me.
I don't know whether it's true or not.
Well, we're going to find out.
The police are still seeking the woman who murdered Alfred S. Adrims...
Justice of the Peace, in Ventura.
The cold-blooded murder occurred September 6.
A woman giving the name of Miriam Webster...
disappeared right after the killing.
Captain Dawson of the Ventura police stated this morning...
they have a lead and is confident of the apprehension of the homicidal maniac.
You remember Adrims, don't you, Helga?
When I was a kid, he used to come up here.
You gave him money.
He used to give me a quarter and say it was my share for being a good little boy.
I never liked him.
Why did you give him money, Helga?
I forgot you can't answer, can you?
You sorry we came back from Denmark?
This place hold unpleasant memories for you?
Do you want to go back?
Maybe you will someday.
You always wanted me to get my father's money, didn't you?
You made sure of it.
That's why we're here, isn't it?
Well, one more day.
We'll have a birthday party.
You, Emily and me.
It's Miriam and Karl.
- Hello, Warren.
- Miriam, Karl.
Why did you leave so early this morning?
I thought we were having breakfast together.
- Well, I had to...
- Emily's upstairs. I'll get her.
Just a minute, Warren.
We'd like to talk to you alone.
Why? What's the matter?
- Are you and Emily married?
- Who told you that?
She did.
We were married in Denmark.
We were going to keep it a secret awhile.
She doesn't think you like her, won't accept her.
You know Emily threatened to kill Miriam this morning?
I don't believe that.
I'm going to get Emily.
- Warren.
- Yes?
We think that Emily murdered Alfred Adrims.
That's a rotten, filthy thing to say, Karl.
Miriam, is that what you think?
I don't know, Warren.
Please listen to Karl.
I filled a prescription for Emily yesterday.
I found the bottle last night in Miriam's shop. How did it get there?
Somebody else could have put it there.
You saw that shop last night, Warren.
The wedding wreath was destroyed by whoever was in there.
And that little toy groom was ripped apart.
A similar pattern as the knifing of Adrims in Ventura.
The drawing of the girl in the newspaper looked like Emily.
A lot of women look like that.
Would a lot of women use the name Miriam Webster?
There must be some explanation.
- Do you have a photograph of Emily?
- Why?
If she's innocent, it'll be simple to prove.
I think so.
This isn't very good.
I took it just after we were married.
I'll drive down to Ventura tonight after I close up.
- Let me go with you.
- No. I'd rather go alone.
Please, darling, it's better that way.
Then we'll know for sure.
That's right. Then you'll both know how wrong you are.
I hope he's right.
Goodbye, Helga.
Bye, Helga.
You closing early, Karl?
Yeah, I'm driving to Ventura, Doc.
I hate to bother you, but I need some sleeping pills for a patient.
It won't take you a minute.
Sure. A couple of minutes won't make any difference.
If you need anything else, Doc.
The store might be closed tomorrow.
- Any trouble, Karl?
- Well, I don't know.
It was a brutal murder, wasn't it?
Always shocks me to read something like that.
But nowadays people seem to hate more.
Is there any way to tell?
- What? Tell what, Karl?
- Well, if a person's homicidal.
There you are.
No. That's what makes them so dangerous.
They can change from being your friend into your murderer in a second's time.
- Anyone in mind, Karl?
- Just asking.
We all hate to a certain extent.
You'd be surprised at the murderous daydreams... that some sweet old ladies indulge in.
But it's only when hate is dammed up that it breaks out in murder.
Try to imagine an infant... enraged over some slight frustration... like having his toy taken away.
Then think of him with the strength and imagination of an adult.
He would kill.
In some ways, the person with homicidal tendencies... has never developed emotionally beyond that point.
In other words then, Doc... anybody could kill that didn't have an outlet for their hate.
You must have somebody in mind, Karl.
Who is it?
Thanks, Karl. Sorry to have bothered you.
That's all right, Doc.
Thank you very much.
Hi. Are you ready to leave?
I'd feel a lot better if you came with me.
Darling, we've discussed that. I'd rather not.
- Why?
- I just can't.
Warren's my brother and I don't want to be there.
You go on without me. I'll be all right.
Look, don't go out.
And after I leave, close up and lock the doors.
Stop worrying about me.
Warren might have told Emily of our suspicions.
If we're right, she might come after you.
Look, when you hear something, you'll phone, won't you?
Yeah, sure.
Good. Now, stop worrying. Go on.
Lock the door.
Howdy.
What took you so long?
I called you this morning.
Everybody's in a hurry.
For 20 years a knife stays dull, and in 20 minutes it's got to be sharp.
How much for this?
- What kind of knife is this?
- How much?
Well, it's a long trip out here. $2.
I'll tell you what.
I'll sharpen every knife you got in your house for $3.
Just this.
- You'd save money.
- I said just this.
What kind of knife you said this was?
Never saw one before.
It's a surgical knife.
Doctors use it.
What do you use it for?
Various things.
There you are.
Sharp enough to whittle wood.
Anything else I can do?
Be careful with that, young lady!
You may cut yourself!
It's always so lonely when Warren leaves.
Isn't it?
It's too bright in here.
Don't you think so, Helga?
What we want is quiet.
No one to disturb us.
It's a pity you talk too much, Helga.
Before, you couldn't talk at all.
Well, at least you won't scream... the way Warren did when he was a little boy.
Out here in the woods no one could hear him scream! Could they?
I never liked your eyes, Helga.
They see too much.
- Afternoon, Emily.
- Dr. Jonas.
This is quite a surprise.
I'm on my way to a house call nearby... so I thought I'd make up for lost time and pay Helga a visit.
- Where is she?
- In there.
Yes.
Hello, Helga. My, it's been many years.
I was sorry to hear about your illness.
You don't look bad, though.
Probably outlive all of us.
I've been meaning to visit you for a whole year... ever since you got back from Denmark.
But with one thing and another...
Anyway, I'm here now, for what it's worth.
Tell you one thing, Helga... you've done a good job raising Warren.
He's a fine young fellow.
You should be very proud.
My, you do a lot of reading, Emily.
Books, magazines.
Dr. Jonas, you'll lose my place.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a sucker for murder mysteries, myself.
Chew them up by the carload.
How about you, Emily?
You go in for that kind?
No. They don't interest me.
- No. Love stories, I guess.
- Once in a while.
I imagine it gets kind of lonely out here.
Reading probably helps pass the time.
Trouble is, you read too much, you get headaches.
Bothered much by headaches, Emily?
I'm sorry, Dr. Jonas, but it's time for Helga's nap.
She hasn't been too well lately, and she needs her rest.
Yes, of course.
Well, it's time for me to leave anyhow.
You get plenty of rest, Helga, and do just what Emily tells you.
And I'll be in to see you again real soon.
Helga will like that. Won't you, dear?
And now we'll go upstairs.
You need your rest.
Something you're trying to say, Helga?
Anything I can do?
She doesn't want you to leave, Doctor.
Your visit excited her.
Yes, of course.
Well, next time I'll stay longer.
That's a promise.
Emily.
Yes?
Your telephone. It's off the hook.
I always do that when Helga takes her nap.
The ringing bothers her.
Something you want, Doctor?
No, I guess not.
Helga!
Now!
Mrs. Adrims left for New York this morning.
The jeweller who sold Miriam Webster the wedding ring is on a fishing trip.
So, that leaves only one witness... the bellboy, to identify the photograph you have.
We'll see him right now.
Jim Nesbitt. Where is he?
He doesn't come on until 8:00.
- Where does he live?
- A rooming house on Fourth Street.
We'll wait.
- Has Jim done anything wrong?
- Not lately.
Say, do you have a telephone here that I could use?
- Yes, sir. Right there.
- Thank you.
Long distance, please.
I'd like to call Solvang, California.
The number is Solvang 499.
Yes?
Yes, Karl, I'm all right.
The Ventura Hotel.
All right, dear.
Hello, Warren.
Have you heard anything yet?
Karl just phoned.
They're waiting at the hotel for Jim Nesbitt.
- When will he be there?
- About 8:00.
I shouldn't have let Karl go.
Do you think Emily is a cold-blooded murderess?
Miriam, answer me.
I don't know, Warren.
Should've never let him have her photograph.
It's better to know for sure, isn't it?
Karl?
Yes.
All right.
Jim Nesbitt positively identified Emily... as the killer of Alfred Adrims.
My God.
The police are leaving Ventura now.
They'll be here as soon as they can.
Helga's all alone in the house with Emily.
I've got to get there right away.
But Karl said to wait here for them.
It'll take them over an hour.
I've got to leave now.
- I'll go with you.
- I don't want to take any chances.
- You're not going there alone.
- Will you listen to me, please?
Warren, I'm going with you.
You wait in the car.
I don't want you to go inside.
Warren, please don't go in there.
- I can take care of myself.
- Please let me go with you.
It'll be safer here, Miriam.
Wait in the car.
This is the fright break.
Do you hear that sound?
It's the sound of a heartbeat.
A frightened, terrified heart.
Is it beating faster than your heart or slower?
This heart is going to beat for another 25 seconds...
to allow anyone to leave this theatre...
who is too frightened to see the end of the picture.
Ten seconds more and we go into the house.
It's now or never.
Five, four. You're a brave audience.
Two, one.
Warren?
Helga!
Emily, it's you!
Warren!
I'm right here, Miriam.
Know me?
Now?
Warren.
Of course. I've always been Warren.
When the police get here, they'll find that Emily has murdered you.
I tried to stop her.
She attacked me. She tried to kill me.
Emily was hopelessly insane.
She escaped.
The police will search for her but they won't find her.
She's gone... for good.
When I left Helga's, I was concerned.
So I decided to stop by on my way home.
Warren must have been completely insane.
Warren was playing for high stakes... the fortune left by his father to his son.
The masquerade was apparently started by Warren's mother at birth... and continued by Helga... and later by Warren himself.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
The entire estate of Warren's father was to go to his son... on his 21st birthday.
Providing there was a son.
Otherwise, the estate would revert to Miriam Webster... his oldest daughter by a former marriage.
The will was signed in Ventura,
California.
This is the birth certificate of Warren Webster... born three months after the will was signed.
The sex was entered as male.
It was recorded and signed by Alfred Adrims... county clerk, Ventura.
Helga Swenson actually delivered a girl.
She and Adrims must have been paid handsomely by Warren's mother... to falsify the records and keep up the deception.
Warren's parents died a few years later.
The father went to his death thinking he had a son.
Then Helga took Warren to Denmark.
What happened there we don't know.
But last year, Helga had a stroke... and Warren returned to the States with her.
In order for Warren to continue the masquerade successfully... he had to get rid of three people.
The two who knew of the deception:
Alfred Adrims, who had become a Justice of the Peace... and Helga, who had become a burden to him.
And then Miriam... the real heiress to the estate.
And so, Warren created Emily... a homicidal maniac who did his killing for him.
Well, that's just about it.
I won't keep you any longer.
You're now a very rich young woman,
Miss Webster. Good luck.
Thank you.
Karl, now that I'm rich, it won't make any difference, will it?
Yes, it will, Miriam.
I think I'm going to love you more.
- Morning, Kelly.
- Sergeant.
Aren't two homicides in a week enough for you, Tanner?
- Wait till you see this.
- What makes it different?
Leikman's son.
- The Leikman?
- The Leikman.
Oh, Sergeant Joe Leland, Robbie Loughren.
- You the new guy? Welcome.
- Thank you.
- Anyone been in or out of here?
- No, just our men.
Good. Let's keep it that way. Where is it?
Second floor.
Landlady found him 20 minutes ago.
Let's go.
I hear you're the best detective in town.
- How bad is it?
- I don't know, Sergeant.
I just got here a few minutes before you did.
Careful.
My God.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- You're not.
You're gonna tense your muscles and get out the notebook.
Male Caucasian lying nude on floor.
Penis cut off.
Lying on floor of living room.
Side of skull smashed in.
Cuts on face and chest.
Fingers shredded.
Index and thumb of right hand missing.
- Hi, Joe.
- Doc.
- Hi, Sarge.
- Schoenstein.
Take pictures of that thing. Then fish it up, put it where nobody will kick it around.
What kind of work is this for a nice Jewish boy?
- Anything yet, Curran?
- Not so far.
- How about you fellas? Find anything?
- Zero.
- Mercidis?
- Yeah?
Take a walk and look in all the garbage cans.
- What are we looking for?
- A couple of fingers and/or a knife.
Nestor, you try the same thing on the roof, will you?
- This is Robbie Loughren. Nestor, Mercidis.
- Hi.
What do you suppose that is?
- Salt?
- Sand.
Put some of it in here.
I want a lab report on that.
Get me a lab report on everything in this medicine cabinet, too.
Also those semen stains on the sheets.
Weights. Barbell.
Mineral oil.
- Take this along with the other stuff.
- All right.
Robbie, check those clothes.
Anything you find in those pockets, bring downtown with you.
Stay with it, Max.
Well, Doc?
Junior there was a homosexual.
Looks like he was a leader.
What did you find?
Mutilations were caused by some kind of knife.
- What killed him?
- The blows on the head.
He was struck five, six times, maybe more.
Lovers' quarrel.
This is the way they settled it.
Takes all kinds, Doctor.
They don't disturb you?
- I got my own bag.
- 20 years, they still disturb the hell out of me.
It's an interesting comment.
When can I get the lab report?
- Late this evening or early tomorrow.
- OK.
Sergeant, I got a girl outside. Lives upstairs.
Landlady said she saw a lot of Leikman.
OK. Thanks, Doc.
Miss Linjack?
Sergeant Joe Leland.
- What can I do for you?
- We'd like to ask you a few questions.
- What is it?
- It's about Mr Leikman.
Teddy? Did something happen to Teddy?
He's dead.
Dead?
- You've been out all night?
- Yes.
Tell me, what happened?
- Somebody killed him.
- Killed him?
No, you don't wanna go in there.
- Would you like to help us?
- I don't know anything.
What was your relationship to Mr Leikman?
He needed someone to take out to parties, so it would look all right.
- What did you get out of it?
- I knew he was gay, but he was civilised.
And he had a bit of wit, which is more than I can say for most people.
Do you know if he had any other friends of a similar persuasion?
- His roommate.
- Roommate? Did you say roommate?
Teddy took in a roommate last week.
What made you sure he was a roommate?
I came down to Teddy's apartment to find out what time we were going out and another man came to the door.
I told Teddy I was sorry to disturb him, and he said it was just his roommate.
- What was his name?
- Teddy didn't say.
Can you describe this roommate?
He was an unsavoury character.
Medium build.
Long sideburns, like an actor.
- Colour hair?
- Black.
Age, approximately?
Late 20s, 30. It's hard to tell.
Robbie, get out a John Doe. Wanted for questioning in connection with a homicide.
Send it to state and county police.
He may be on the road.
Anything else you can remember,
Miss Linjack? Anything at all?
No.
You don't seem to be feeling much grief over the death of your friend Teddy.
If I am, I'm not showing it.
That's clear, isn't it?
We have a sketch artist downtown.
You could help with your description.
- Would you mind?
- May I change my clothes?
Of course.
Officer Tanner will stay with you.
- Thank you, I can get there on my own.
- Officer Tanner will stay with you.
Cop-hater.
- I like her.
- What's there to like?
I like the way she stuck up for her friend Teddy.
I think I also like her because she's a cop-hater.
All right. Out of my way.
Get outta here. Out of my way.
Who's in charge here?
- Oh. It's you.
- I was only following your orders.
It's all right. I'll take responsibility.
Only people with official business are allowed, Mr Councilman. How'd you get by?
Listen, I have a badge from the sheriff.
- It doesn't work here.
- No one's ever stopped me before.
Mr Davis, every time you give everything you know to the papers, it's not helpful.
Do you know the rising rate of crime here?
Do you know the statistics?
Some of us want to do something.
Do you...
You picked a lousy spot for a campaign speech.
- I'm going in.
- No, you're not.
Kelly, show Mr Councilman outside. If he gives you any trouble, run him downtown.
You bastard.
I'm gonna talk to the mayor about you.
- Hey. Captain Farrell wants to see you.
- Figures.
- Name?
- Sidney.
- You ever been arrested before?
- No.
- You live in the neighbourhood?
- Yes.
- You like to play ball?
- Yeah.
Well, you can't do much ball-playing in jail.
Want me to tell your mother and father about this?
Know a cop when you see one?
You got me a good customer.
Listen, tell the judge
I asked you for 50 instead of 25.
I don't wanna ruin my reputation.
Sure. Sure.
You, what's your name?
- Do you want to see me?
- Yeah.
Was this Davis thing necessary?
Do we have to play patsy for every bum who runs for re-election?
- Was it necessary?
- No, it wasn't necessary.
Why don't you go down and tell him you're sorry?
Would you like to have my badge first?
You're dealing with the murder of the son of one of the most successful men in this city.
Headquarters will shake up this whole department.
You got everybody's ass in a sling.
Mine included.
You have to take it from those bastards.
I don't.
I know. I know.
Nothing matters to you.
Nothing but your goddamn dignity.
Well, you can take your dignity out for a walk.
- Is that all, Captain?
- Yeah. Just get the hell out of here.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
- Who are you looking for?
- The hostess, I presume.
Karen, it's for you. Somebody interesting.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi.
- Can I get you a drink?
- Oh, I know what he likes.
Come on.
- Mike, that's Joe Leland.
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Karen's talked a lot about you, Joe.
- That so?
What's she saying?
She's married to a man who's a cop?
Yes. She also said you're the brightest man she ever knew.
I read about Leikman's son.
It's quite a thing, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah. It's quite a thing.
- There.
- Thank you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Here, let me take your hat.
- No, it's all right.
That fella over there's gonna make a speech about the benefits of LSD.
Don't you want to hear what he has to say?
I think I'll pass.
Did you want to talk to me about something?
I did, yeah.
Well, we can go someplace.
No.
Another time.
Say, would you keep an eye on these, please, buddy? Thank you.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
Karen Widener.
Joe Leland.
- I haven't seen you around here before.
- I haven't been around.
I'm in sociology.
How nice for sociology.
- Who are you? Why do you sound so tough?
- I am tough.
- Who are you?
- I'm with the cops.
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm taking a night course in criminology.
You're kidding.
Thank you.
Well.
- I take it you didn't like the play.
- I didn't like the play.
- I never saw anything so meaningful.
- He's a phoney.
- Do you know anything about plays?
- A little bit, yes.
- Well, who are your favourite playwrights?
- How about O'Casey and Shaw?
Well, what do you know about O'Casey?
Mr O'Casey writes about the joys of life, not the futility of it all.
What do you do, Mr Leland?
He's with the cops.
- You're kidding.
- That's what I said.
Well, I always said a little learning in a policeman is a dangerous thing.
Where are you going?
I'm going home because you and your friends give me a pain in the ass.
Wow.
- Hello.
- Hi.
What's your problem?
Heart trouble.
Would you like to explain that?
Well, there's this man I know.
Are you in love with him?
I don't know.
But he's the only real man I've ever met.
I bet you tell that to all the cops.
How many girls have you brought up here?
Couple of thousand.
No, I mean seriously.
How many have you had right here on this couch?
We haven't had a fight all evening.
Yep. I noticed.
That's probably because for a minute you forgot that I was a fascist cop.
Why do you wanna be a cop?
Cos my old man was a cop.
His old man was a cop.
Everybody in my family was a cop.
That's why.
Why do you wanna be a cop?
Because it's the most useful and constructive thing I can do. Don't you understand?
I understand. Don't bite my head off.
What about you?
- I mean, I don't know anything about you.
- What do you wanna know?
Well, first it's your family. What about them?
There isn't any.
What do you mean, there isn't any?
Well, I was the proverbial baby left on the doorstep.
Don't look so sad. It isn't that tragic.
Were you adopted?
If you're not taken by the time you're three, they don't pick you up too easily.
But I lived in a few foster homes, you know.
Best thing about it was I had a room of my own.
The state requires you have a room of your own.
I said, don't look so sad.
It isn't such a bad life.
No scars?
No, I just go to my psychiatrist twice a week now.
You don't approve of that?
Not particularly. I happen to feel people should try to work out their own problems.
Well, that's manly of you.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Ever been married?
- Engaged?
- No.
Many guys?
Yes.
And on my terms.
Not theirs.
Yeah.
I've been to the post a few times myself.
I was beginning to think that nobody else in the world would ever interest me again.
Let's not talk about those things, Joe.
Let's just enjoy each other.
I don't want to be this way with you.
Why not?
I want this to be different.
It will be.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- How did it go?
Oh, fine. I think I got my associate professorship. Me. Imagine.
- I think it's wonderful. Just great.
- Yeah?
Did you give any thought to what we talked about?
- Oh, I don't know, Joe.
- What do you mean?
You either love me or you don't love me.
Oh, I love you, but it... itjust isn't that simple, you know.
You keep talking in riddles all the time.
What's to keep us apart?
Well, I've been around and you've been around.
We're both kinda set in our ways and everything.
Sure, but that's why we ought to do something about it, while there's still time.
Are you wacky enough to take on me?
Try me.
Yeah, baby!
- You know something?
- What?
If I don't marry you, I'm crazy.
What did you say?
I said, if I don't marry you, I'm crazy.
All right.
- Hi. How's the bridegroom?
- Tired. What else?
- Shut up, you silly son of a...
- I didn't mean to.
- What's that?
- Wait till you hear this.
- You don't think I meant to do it?
- You didn't? Stupid...
Harmon. Harmon, you're a stupid jerk.
- What is it?
- Well, he did it this time.
- He killed one.
- I couldn't help it.
I yelled for them to stop.
You know what it's like there.
- Doesn't give you licence to shoot a man.
- I didn't mean to shoot.
- Didn't mean to!
- The gun went off.
- Wait till those civil rights bastards get this.
- I didn't mean to.
- Who cares? You put us all in the crapper.
- I heard it on the radio. Just great.
- In my office. Tanner, you his partner?
- Yeah.
Let's go. Come on.
Shut the door.
All right, Tanner.
Tell us what happened.
We were following these guys.
They were speeding.
Jack kept the siren going.
We cut 'em off.
Jack took his revolver out, walked over to the car and leaned in.
There was a shot.
The car lurched.
That's all I know.
I didn't know what he could've been doing in there. He reached for the glove compartment.
He could've been reaching for anything.
There were five of them - drunk.
Well, you can't have it both ways.
It was an accident or you panicked.
Which way was it?
- It was an accident.
- An accident.
You walked over to the car and you leaned in.
Show me what happened.
I'm the man in the car. Come on. Show me.
How close was your revolver to him?
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember.
You said the car lurched.
Was it before or after, did you say?
- Well, I...
- Never mind.
Tanner, didn't you just say that he walked over to the car, gun drawn, leaned in the car, there was a shot and then the car lurched? Isn't that what you said?
It could've been before.
Harmon, if I get you through this, it'll be for the department, not for you.
"If you get him through this"?
Shut up, Joe, and get outta here.
If the civil rights group doesn't take care of you and if the department doesn't take care of you, you keep your eye on me, Mr Harmon.
Go to the papers.
Tell 'em they're trying to whitewash Harmon.
I can't do that to the department.
The department?
I've watched the way this thing eats you up.
The way Farrell tries to twist you around.
Darling, why do you take it? I mean, you could go anywhere. You could do anything.
It's what I do best.
It's my life, and it's worth something.
I know it's tough for somebody on the outside to understand.
You know, I remember once I saw my old man climb to the top of a bridge to keep some poor sick soul from jumping off.
And then he cried like a baby after the guy went over the side.
Some life I gave you.
Out all day on the chase, then I bring it all home to you.
Yeah, you got some deal, you did.
I got a very good deal.
You give so much and get so little.
No, you lie back and relax.
You let me make love to you this time.
Central to car 215 of the 19th precinct.
Proceed to number 330 East 71st Street.
Penthouse apartment A.
A for Arthur. A cardiac case.
- Joe?
- Yeah.
- I gotta talk to you.
- What is it this time?
They're gonna bust me.
- Still on the junk, huh?
- No. Honest, Joe.
Don't "honest" me, sweetheart.
You need a pop right now.
- Who's handling the beef?
- Some hardhead named Callahan.
I wanna see Christmas.
I haven't seen Christmas in two years.
I'll see. I'll see about it.
- Cute kid.
- Yeah, cute kid.
She's a whore, she's a pusher, she's an addict, and she's 19 years old.
This whole town is crawling with kids like her. Same age. All going the same route.
Part of the Great Society.
- Joe, you sore at me?
- No, I'm not sore.
I liked you from the minute your old man brought you into my office.
You know, you could make it.
You could make it big.
- But you've never been able to...
- Kiss ass.
I don't get this loner thing.
Your old man was never that way.
You know, with Karen you were more of a human being.
She was such a good influence on you.
I wish you'd never split up with her.
Oh, Jilly, let's have a beer.
You know, you've solved two homicides this week.
Your promotion was all set.
And then this Davis thing.
Oh, screw it, will you, Tom? Leave it alone.
Joe, what's gonna happen?
You're not getting any younger.
I don't know what's gonna happen to me.
Maybe the same thing that happened to my old man. I'll wind up on the scrapheap.
But you could make it all the way to the top.
Don't make bets on it.
You know, promotion for lieutenancy comes up this month. You know that, don't you?
Jeez, I'd hate to see Curran get it.
He's sucking up to 'em all the time.
Joe, do you think you could crack this Leikman thing?
Hard to say. We got a few leads, but I don't know where they'll take us.
Do you think you could crack it in 48 hours, huh?
That's a nice phrase.
A nice ring to it.
That youngster was just here.
Her name's Sharon Henesy. She's being rousted by a cop named Callahan.
Will you see if you can get him to ease off?
Sure. Sure. Fine.
Oh, Joe, by the way, the newspaper boys have been calling. They wanna speak to you.
You know, the Davis thing. Could you see them in the station tomorrow morning?
You're gonna be there, aren't you, Tom?
- I think it's better you speak to them alone.
- No, it's all right. Thanks, Tom.
- What's between you and Davis?
- He really went after you.
- Davis says you have nothing.
- How would he know?
There's more to police than a badge.
- Stay out of this, will you, Dave?
- What was Davis doing here yesterday?
- He was buffing.
- Buffing, did you say?
A buff is a guy who hangs around the police?
Correct.
- You disapprove of buffing?
- Not at all. We have them all the time.
They go out for sandwiches, run errands, make themselves useful.
- Can we quote you?
- It's why you're here.
- Do you send Davis out for coffee?
- Uh-uh.
We tried once. He screwed it up.
Got a Danish instead of a doughnut, coffee black instead of cream.
He was murder. I'll see you.
Thanks a lot, Leland.
What's the progress on the Leikman case?
Oh, I expect we'll get a break in 48 hours.
- Quote you on that?
- Be my guest.
- What made you say 48 hours?
- It sounded good, didn't it?
- Oy, veh is mir,
- Here's a sketch of the suspect.
- Nestor, you know where gay boys hang out?
- Yeah, I know.
All right. Come on, get out of here!
All right, come on!
Let's go! Get outta there!
Line up there. Come on. Get out.
Make a straight line. Get over there.
- Come on. Get outta there.
- Get over that way!
Don't hurt your shins.
All right, baby, come on.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- All right. Come on.
All right, you first.
You, come here. Come on.
- You!
- Get over there.
You're a young one, aren't you?
You're off to a good start.
- You know this man?
- No.
- What?
- No!
- Did you ever know Theodore Leikman Jr?
- Leikman?
- Yeah. One of your kind.
- No, I never knew him.
- Don't worry. No one's gonna hurt you.
- You're not gonna tell my parents?
- Did you know him?
- No!
Take it easy. They're not murderers.
I know what I'm doing.
I'll handle it. You, come here.
You!
- Tell him to get his hands off me.
- You're a wise one, huh?
- You think you can push me around?
- What are you doing here?
- I was just takin' a walk.
- Oh, just takin' a walk, huh?
Curran, we've seen him around before, haven't we?
Yeah. I've seen him with some young ones.
Contributing to the delinquency of minors.
Have you ever met this man?
- No.
- Look at it!
- Did you know Theodore Leikman Jr?
- Answer him.
No. I never knew him.
- OK. Go on.
- Wait. I wanna book him.
For what? Go on.
Yeah, go on.
I want to see you a second.
Nestor, you're a miserable son of a bitch.
Yes, sir.
- A half gallon of mineral oil.
- Maybe he had constipation.
- Not Leikman.
- Maybe he used it to oil his pal.
It's too thin.
You need something thick like Vaseline.
- How do you know?
- Men and women use Vaseline.
- I wouldn't know.
- Neither would I.
- Congratulations.
- Some people like to drink it.
You keep that up, you're gonna be a suspect.
19th squad, detectives.
Mercidis speaking.
- Yeah, hold on. Sarge.
- Yeah.
Leland.
I'm calling from school. I just wanna say what a stinking thing I think this is with Davis.
OK.
- Well, is there anything I can do?
- No.
- Are you gonna be all right?
- I'll handle it.
OK.
Good luck, Joe.
Let's check out all the Ys, body-beautiful places, weightlifting joints, and gyms.
What for?
They make their bodies shiny by using this stuff.
I think Teddy used to like to look at these.
Maybe he went where they hang out.
Maybe that's where he met his roommate.
- He's not gonna drop that, is he?
- We never drop anything.
Listen, did Theodore Leikman Jr ever come here?
Yes, he did, the little crumb.
Hallelujah. Did you ever see anybody with him who looks like this?
Oh, yes. The strange one.
- Well, what's his name?
- Tesla. Felix Tesla.
- Tesla. Felix Tesla.
- Maybe he's from out of town.
And maybe he's in Mexico by now.
Sand.
Know what I think? We hit the beaches.
Check every hotel where they might stay.
- Central to Sergeant Leland.
- Sergeant Leland to Central.
Curran and Schoenstein report their investigations at the Half Moon Hotel regarding the attempt to arrest Felix Tesla for homicide is negative.
He is known there but not seen lately.
Over and out.
Listen, maybe you better talk to 'em this time.
Maybe you'll appeal to 'em more than I do.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?
Police officers.
Did you ever have a roomer by the name of Felix Tesla?
- What about him?
- Well, have you seen him recently?
- Have you?
- This morning. He went out for breakfast.
- Did he come back?
- He's up in his room.
- Go around back, Robbie.
- OK.
- Now, quietly, who else is in the house?
- No one else. Just me.
Where's his room?
Number three. It's up the stairs.
Don't be foolish. Stay out of it.
Sarge, Sarge, he's heading for the beach!
All right. Cool it.
- Here's our man now.
- What's his name?
- Look this way.
- All right, cool it, move back.
Come on!
Get close, Joe, you're part of the story.
- Get the hell out of here. Get out of the way.
- Come on, Joe, give us a break.
Come on.
- Did you inform him of his rights?
- I did.
Boys, take him inside and start talking to him. You, go with him.
I got something to show you.
Kelly, give me that yellow sheet on the suspect.
Get a load of this. "Arrested Toronto, assault and battery, robbery."
"Sentenced two years. Sentence suspended, condition to military service."
"Dishonourably discharged, Canadian army."
"Felonious assault - bottle."
"Felonious assault - knife."
He's been a pretty busy boy.
Joe, we gotta get that confession now.
If you can crack this, you can make Davis eat turd.
And you can get your promotion.
Lift your head up.
Lift your head up.
I said, lift your head up!
Now, take a look at this picture of Teddy.
Look at it!
Look at it!
- That's what you did to him.
- You think you're not gonna talk?
We'll take you down the cellar.
You know what we do in the cellar?
Felix, just tell us what you used on him.
Just tell us that.
What did you do with the knife?
What did you do with the knife, you fag?
Muscles isn't saying anything. I'll fix that.
- Hey, fag. Fag!
- All right.
All right, all right. Everybody out.
Come on, everybody out.
You too, Nestor. Out.
Want some coffee?
Pretty rough, huh?
You're from Toronto, eh?
Is that Circus Bar still open up there?
Oh, yes, Felix, I've been around a long time.
I know all the places. But you know what I say? I believe in live and let live.
Look, Felix, I know it's rough, but it doesn't have to be.
Tell me about Teddy.
What kind of a man was he?
Come on, tell me.
I mean, we don't know too much about him, but I do know he wasn't a very nice man.
And I can understand something happening to a man like that.
You met him over at the health club, didn't you? Became quite friendly.
And then he asked you to come and live with him, didn't he?
It wasn't easy living with Teddy, was it?
He wasn't nice, was he?
He wasn't nice.
Am I wrong? Was he nice?
- He was a bitch.
- A bitch.
Nothing was good enough for him.
Nobody was good enough for him.
He laughed at everybody.
He laughed at me.
He was educated.
Him with his education.
- Tell me about his body.
- What do you mean?
I mean what you liked about his body.
- It was nice.
- Nice.
How nice?
What kind of nice?
- It was like a girl's.
- You mean soft?
No, no, no.
We say the words. Soft, like a girl.
It was soft. Soft like a girl's.
Felix.
- Listen to me, Felix. He teased you, didn't he?
- Yes.
- He called you names, didn't he?
- Yes.
- What kind of names did he call you?
- Bull. Stud. Names like that.
- He said you were stupid, didn't he?
- Yes.
- He laughed at you. And you hated him.
- Oh, I hated him.
I hated him.
Felix, tell me about Friday night.
What did you fight about?
- He wanted me to leave.
- And you wanted to stay?
Until I found ajob.
But he wanted me to leave right away.
I had those few dollars saved.
I didn't want to spend it.
I didn't have to, but he wanted me to go out.
- So you left?
- Just to calm down.
Then you came back and argued, didn't you?
He called you more names, didn't he?
But he went too far and you hit him.
And you kept hitting him until you broke his skull, didn't you? Isn't that so?
Face it, Felix. Face it.
Say it. You'll feel better for it.
You can't walk around the rest of your life with a thing like that on your head.
You cut him and then you threw his fingers and the knife off the Queensboro Bridge.
You did it, Felix. You killed him.
You crushed his skull, didn't you?
- Didn't you?
- I hit him.
Louder! Say it louder!
I killed him!
I killed him!
- Think it'll stick?
- Why not?
I'll buy this one. I'd like to see
Davis's face when he reads the papers.
You got the confession.
It's still got to stick in court.
Is there any doubt how it's gonna go in court?
Would you like to bet on the chances of that fag?
Boy, three homicides in one week.
That ought to shake 'em up at headquarters.
These pictures were taken as Sergeant Leland arrived.
Leland is known as one of the most colourful plain-clothes men in Manhattan.
His battle with Davis is well publicised.
The information coming in about Tesla is that he is a Canadian.
His record included dishonourable discharge from the army and felonious assaults.
Joe.
...son of the department store owner, occurred in his apartment at 5 East 72nd Street.
The violent and savage nature of his death brought speculation on his life and his background.
What a gorgeous little circus.
Everybody out to fry the little fag.
Including me.
I was even caught up in the fever.
They said on the news that it was a terrific piece of work you did.
It wasn't terrific.
It was routine.
Then why are you so upset?
Because he's a psychotic and they're gonna burn him, that's why I'm upset.
- They have a court psychiatrist, don't they?
- Sure, they've got one.
But he's a frontrunner like the rest of those bums down there.
Joe, what can I do?
Why did you come here?
I came here to ball.
Ain't that what you do the best?
Well, ain't it?
Hello.
Oh, hi, Joe. Hi. This is Matt Henderson.
We went to school together.
We're just sitting here chatting, catching up on old times and everything.
Matt, this is my husband, Joe Leland.
- Hi.
- You wannajoin us?
No, I've got something to do. See you.
Better comb your hair.
You're gonna get your picture taken.
- Give you much trouble, Joe?
- No comment.
- How long did it take to nail him?
- I said, no comment. There.
Hey, kid, where did he pick you up?
I've missed you.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Karen.
I work with people every day.
That's my business.
Now, there's something wrong. What is it?
Nothing wrong.
There's someone else, isn't there?
No, no. No.
No one.
Who is it, Karen?
- Now, who is it?
- Well, it...
It's just somebody from school.
You want a divorce?
No.
- Get him on the phone.
- What do you mean?
Get him on the phone and tell him you're no longer going to see him. That's what I mean.
- You think this is gonna solve everything?
- Call him.
Jerry?
It's Karen.
I don't want to see you any more.
Yes, he's here, but that hasn't anything to do with it. It's what I want.
I'm sor... I'm sorry.
What the hell's the matter with you?
So it's on again.
If you love this guy, why the hell don't you marry him?
It wasn't him.
It was another man.
- I didn't hear you. What did you say?
- I said it was another man.
- What the hell?
- You can't talk to me like a criminal.
I have a right to be with anybody I want to.
Oh, God.
I can't act like this with you. I mean...
I just can't.
What's the matter?
You know what's the matter with me.
You've known it for a long time.
No, I don't know what you mean.
There's something wrong with me.
I wanted it to be all right.
Everything seemed so right.
And then the bottom dropped out.
You know what I was like when I married you.
You asked me once if... if I'd ever been married or engaged.
I couldn't sustain a relationship.
I was scared to death of that.
Do you know what sex was like for me?
I'd walk down the street or go into a bar or anything.
Meet somebody. Anybody.
Someone I never knew before.
And I'd have an affair with them.
It was the only way I could do it.
You're the only one ever made me feel like a woman.
The man in the bar.
I never saw him before.
Telephone call?
A phoney number.
I know all the clinical reasons for it.
I want to destroy the only family I ever had.
I don't like myself very much.
Could you believe that, in spite of it all,
I love you?
There's one thing I've always known.
You're the only chance I have.
Oh, don't look away from me, Joe.
Don't look away from me.
Well, you balled me.
You feel better?
Don't I always with you?
Glad to be of service.
Joe, do you have to go?
I mean, why don't we have one of those lazy days together we used to?
I mean, it's Sunday today.
I don't have to go to school.
I've got some work to do.
We can't do this any more.
I mean, either we have to forget each other or try it again.
No, Karen, it would cost me too much to try it again.
It would cost me too much.
- Is that all you've got on it?
- Yes, sir.
- OK. Take it to the desk for a 61, will you?
- Right.
- Joe, Farrell wants to see you.
- What the hell does he want?
- He wants to see you.
- Another dirty job for us?
I don't know what he wants.
He never tells me anything. Joe, he's in there.
- Hey, man.
- Hi.
Joe.
- What kind of cockamamie thing is this?
- Congratulations, Lieutenant.
I told you I'd do it for you, didn't I?
- I oughta rap you in the mouth.
- I tried to talk 'em out of it.
Can you imagine me taking orders from you?
Come on, Joe. I'll buy you a drink.
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Good luck, Lieutenant.
Well, you made it. Anything can happen if you get your name in the papers often enough.
- What'll it be? Scotch or beer?
- A little of each.
Joe, why don't you call Karen and tell her to come over, huh?
You walk through this door a Christian soul.
In the name of God, the Father Almighty, who created you.
In the name of Jesus Christ, the son of the living God, who suffered for you.
In the name of the Holy Spirit who has been poured forth upon you.
In the name of the glorious and holy mother of God, the Virgin Mary.
In the name of St Joseph, her illustrious spouse.
In the name of the angels and archangels.
In the name of the thrones and the dominations.
In the name of the principalities and powers.
In the name of the holy virgins and of all the saints of God.
We can move in on that heroin business today.
All right, make your buy. Move in quick.
Those people can be dangerous.
- OK. Come on, let's go.
- What else?
The hookers are beginning to come out on Third Avenue again.
- They gotta make a living.
- The irate citizens are starting to complain.
Well, scare 'em a little bit.
Maybe they'll go back uptown.
That thing with the missing little Shoftel girl is blowing up.
- No word yet, huh?
- No, nothing.
- You check everybody in the apartment?
- Yeah, we did.
Who are the people missing?
Anybody missing?
Boarder. Handyman.
Boarder, handyman.
Yeah. You concentrate on the handyman. The boarder's made a few trips from time to time.
The handyman never left the place, so it doesn't fit into pattern.
- You stick with the handyman.
- Right.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm Norma Maclver.
What are you doing in this den of iniquity?
I heard a statement your commissioner made today.
Hs said that this organisation exists for the protection of the community.
That's generally true, yes. Sit down.
Well, I don't believe that this organisation does always protect the community.
It's an interesting statement, if you'd like to explain it to me.
My husband's death.
Your husband's death?
Who was your husband?
Do you remember the case of the man who fell from the roof of the racetrack?
I was on vacation, but I remember. Wasn't there a coroner's report and an autopsy?
- Yes, there was.
- What was the verdict?
Suicide.
And I take it you didn't believe the verdict.
Look, my husband did notjump from the roof of a racetrack in the middle of the afternoon in front of thousands of people.
No, you wouldn't be expected to believe that.
There's some sort of conspiracy.
I don't know what it is, but there is.
Why would you say there's a conspiracy?
Why would you say a thing like that anyway?
- The way people are frightened of the case.
- Who's frightened?
The coroner.
- Why would he be frightened?
- He didn't invite me to the inquest.
When I saw him he said it was suicide and there was no need to investigate further.
- Who else?
- Private detectives.
I hire them, they get into the case a little and they drop it.
- Anything else?
- His office. The file cabinets were emptied.
- What else?
- His notebook.
When the police returned it, there were pages torn out.
- You've gone into this pretty thoroughly.
- Yes, I have.
I'm supposed to forget it. People tell me it's not gonna make a difference, it's not gonna bring him back.
But I'm not gonna forget it.
- What was your husband's name?
- Colin.
C-o-l-i-n?
And the names of the private detectives?
First there was a man called Bloom, then a man called Carter.
- Willie Carter?
- Yes.
I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.
- No need to thank me.
I'm going to come up with nothing.
But maybe I'll clear the mystery of coroners and private detectives who are frightened.
You'll hear from me.
What was that all about?
That was something very interesting, Dave.
Remember Colin Maclver who went off the racetrack roof?
Yes.
Get a report on that, will you? And draw up a sheet on him and one on his wife.
- Her name's Norma.
- OK.
Dave, who was on that detail?
I think it was Curran. Yeah, Curran.
What kind of fella was Maclver?
There's a difference of opinion on that.
Some thought he was quiet and reserved, but he drove a very expensive sports car and had a doll-like wife.
Anybody got any ideas why he'd want to turn himself off?
Does anybody know what's on somebody else's mind?
That's true.
- What shape is his estate in?
- He left about 300,000.
- That's a lot of bread. What did he do?
- CPA.
- Not bad for a certified public accountant.
- He was clever.
That's an understatement.
I see in the inventory here he had $900 in his wallet, so that rules out robbery.
He jumped.
- How do you know?
- That was the report.
- Anybody see him jump?
- No.
Well, then how can we be so sure?
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
If he was pushed, somebody would have noticed it.
Not necessarily. There was a lot of excitement while the race was going on.
No, not necessarily.
Another thing.
It says here the man died at 3:35 and his wife wasn't informed until eight that night. What took you so long to tell her?
I don't know.
One of the other men called her.
- What about the notebook?
- Notebook?
Yeah, a little black notebook.
We returned it to his wife.
You wouldn't have had any reason to tear out any pages out of that book, would you?
Why would I tear any pages out?
- I don't know. That's all.
- That's all?
Yeah. I'll see you later.
- What was that?
- Shoftel girl.
Found her in a vacant lot, raped and murdered. Mother and fatherjust left.
- Picked up a suspect.
- About time.
Yeah, Robbie's questioning him now.
- What's he like?
- 68-year-old man.
- The handyman, huh?
- Yeah. Frightened to death.
Threw up three times in the car coming over.
Where else did you take her? I got three witnesses that saw. Where did you take her?
- Where did you take her?
- Nowhere.
All right. Let's go over it again.
You took her to the candy store, you bought her some caramel corn. Where after that?
His answers are falling all over themselves.
I'll have him in a few minutes.
Why is he sitting without his clothes on?
Makes them easier to handle.
Stripping 'em makes them vulnerable.
I got the idea from the newsreels of German concentration camps.
Dave, take him in the other room, get him his clothes, will you?
You too, son. You can go with him.
You son of a bitch. What kind of a department do you think we're running here?
All right, all right.
Don't blow your cool.
If I ever blow my cool, buster,
I'll kick your ass right out of this building.
I'm gonna get my promotion too, Lieutenant.
You're gonna get a promotion?
- You've been on the force two years.
- So what?
My old man was on the force 25 years and he never got a promotion. That's what.
You can afford to play it big now.
I'm gonna get promoted the same way you've been, and the only way is with results.
What looks good to headquarters.
It's the only way you got ahead.
I'm gonna get the same thing.
Get out, Robbie.
Get out!
Where do you think you would have been if they hadn't fried that little fag?
Don't press your luck, baby. Get out of here.
Why don't you send the bastard back to pounding the pavement?
- He asked some questions I couldn't answer.
- Well, we did it the hard way. Why can't he?
They don't do it the hard way these days,
Captain. It's unfashionable.
- What's that?
- Agitators.
- What are you booking them on?
- We found something to book them on.
You think this is gonna solve the problem?
- You know it will make it worse.
- I have people to answer to.
- I know the people you've got to answer to.
- Yeah, that bunch there, they're swell.
Yeah, they throw Molotov cocktails in our cars every night.
That's not hard to understand.
They do not like living in garbage cans.
And we know why the garbage cans exist, don't we?
Ghetto-type housing is the most profitable kind of housing.
- Joe, that's none of our business.
- Correct.
Our business is to sit on the lid of the garbage cans.
One of these days, if somebody doesn't do something about them, you'll see an explosion tear this nation right down the middle.
You never did realise the responsibilities of this job, did you?
Aren't you ever a little sick about the responsibilities?
You'll find out.
Joe, I got a pension coming up in a few months, and you know who's gonna be the new head of this district. It's all set. I'm telling you.
But there are just some things about this job that you've got to learn to do.
You know, Joe, I feel sorry for you, getting your brains beat in all the time.
This Maclver thing.
Yeah. This Maclver thing.
I know some people who'd pay you to forget it.
That's interesting. And who are these people who would pay for it?
I'll see that you get it.
Who are they?
Curran, one day you're gonna get your ass in a sling for running around with these kind of people and taking from them.
I'm doing all right. Check, please.
I'll have you brought up on charges.
You know that.
- Go ahead. It's your word against mine.
- I'll have you busted.
Have me busted.
If you have me busted, you'll have to bust half the people in the department for being on the take.
You know, Joe, you think you're better than the rest of us.
Wake up.
This was the last photograph that was taken of him.
Do you know whether or not he was going to meet anyone at the racetrack that day?
No, not that I know of.
How was he with women?
I think he knew a lot of women.
Do you think he saw any of these women while he was married to you?
- No.
- How do you know?
I know.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Karen.
Norma Maclver, Karen Leland.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
I'm having lunch with some members of the board.
They're convinced half the staff are communists.
- Would you like to join us?
- No, thank you.
Well, it was nice to see you.
I didn't know you were married.
We're separated.
What a lovely-looking woman.
Yeah, she's lovely.
- Colin had lots of friends?
- Only one close friend. Dr Roberts.
- What kind of a doctor?
- A psychiatrist.
- Was Colin a patient of his?
- No. They liked each other.
He lives next to us at the beach.
- Shall we go?
- OK.
Hello.
Lieutenant Leland, Police Department.
I'm Wendell Roberts. Come on in.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
I recognised you from your pictures in the papers.
- I didn't know I was that famous.
- Oh, yeah.
The case of the mutilated homosexual was a hell of a thing.
- Did you want to speak to Wendell?
- Yes, I did.
- Alone?
- That's what I had in mind, yes.
I'll be on my way. I'm over at Wendell's as much as my own place.
How nice for the two of you.
I'll be around if you want me.
- How about a drink? What would you like?
- Bourbon.
Say, you've got a lot of plaques here.
You make a speech, you get a plaque.
Tell me something, Doctor.
You a bachelor?
I know you are.
Semi, anyway.
How did you know that?
Your wife came to me for treatment.
Didn't you know that?
No, I didn't know that.
Thank you.
Did you treat Colin Maclver?
No.
In your conversations with him, did you ever get an inkling he might want to take his life?
No.
- Did he ever talk to you about his business?
- No, never.
I don't believe you, Doctor.
I don't care what you believe.
- The case is closed.
- I've reopened it.
- Why?
- Why not?
Cheers.
Cheers.
She's an interesting girl, isn't she? She's far more vulnerable than you might imagine.
And your investigation, constantly opening up old wounds, isn't going to help any.
There were papers on Maclver's body, Doctor.
One of them had your name on it regarding a business deal.
I had nothing to do with Maclver's business affairs.
That was a fishing expedition, Doctor.
Why should you be upset if I mention you might have had a business deal with him?
You're an interesting man.
Narrow, but interesting.
I always felt that about you.
What does that mean? As if I give a damn.
Your relationship with your wife. One of the most remarkable women I've ever met.
You could have handled that more intelligently, if I may say so.
A different kind of man could have understood her problem.
Yeah, maybe a different man would've understood.
But I'm not civilized enough to look the other way when my wife's screwing other men.
It's childish, isn't it?
But you know something?
- You're full of crap.
- You don't like psychiatrists much, do you?
- They make people adjust to a sick world.
- It is sick.
- Getting sicker.
- What do you suggest?
I think each person knows what's important to him. He should compromise for nobody.
- I'm telling you to drop the Maclver case.
- Why?
It can only harm any number of people, including yourself.
I'll tell you something. If you got anything to say to me, you'd better tell me it damn quick.
I'll find out the answers to your enigmas.
- Well, good luck.
- I'll see you again.
My pleasure.
Hey, that's a pretty good job.
Thanks. I'm a mess.
Well, I wouldn't say so. Not exactly.
What did you talk about?
You, mostly.
- What did he say about me?
- He told me to lay off you.
That's none of his business.
Did he tell you my unwholesome background?
- Your police record?
- You know about that?
He didn't have to tell me.
You know about the drug thing?
Yep.
- I'd like to tell you about it.
- You needn't.
- Well, it was one of those things I had to try.
- Why?
Curiosity, I don't know.
I didn't like it and I stopped.
Why are you telling me all of this?
I guess I care about what you think.
Norma, I'm trying to find out some things about your husband's business.
Aside from the office, was there any other place he kept papers?
- Yes, there's a room in the house.
- Anybody know about this room?
No. I never told anyone after they broke into the office.
What's the matter?
- Where's your telephone?
- Over there.
What does "Rainbow" mean?
Rainbow? I don't know.
My husband never talked about business.
It's Leland. Give me Schoenstein.
Dave, go to your apartment. I'll be there with some things I want you to see.
What does "Rainbow" mean?
- Wish to hell I knew.
- It's on nearly every one of these pages.
I tried to add up the figures.
They don't balance.
Did you get a load of the names in here?
The biggest names in town.
Forms for corporations.
Why so many, Joe?
How about you go down to the Hall of Records?
Check out who pays their taxes, who were the attorneys who filed for them.
- Should only take you a couple of days.
- OK.
I'm bushed. I'm going home.
- Good night, Rachael.
- Good night, Joe.
Can I fix you something to eat before you go?
No, I'm full.
That stuffed derma was beautiful.
Thanks. You want me to fix you something to take home?
- No, sweetheart. Good night.
- Good night, dear.
- David, how about you?
- Nothing.
- Not even a glass tea?
- Not even a glass tea.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
- Cos it's no trouble.
- No trouble.
Curran.
Now you want to talk about it?
What are they afraid of?
They forced me to kill two men. Where are the missing pages from the notebook?
- Tell me about it.
- Joe.
If I tell you, I'm dead.
Hello.
Hello.
Great hours you're keeping these days.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Is it that girl in the restaurant?
She was eating you up with her eyes,
I could see that.
Hey, is it something serious?
You know,
I've been lying here all night long trying to... trying to think up a speech about why we should get together again.
It doesn't work.
Yeah, it'd be pretty hard to make that work.
You know...
What I always thought was the most important thing in the world was to be valuable, you know.
I mean, not necessarily important, just valuable.
I mean, you know, to have people be pleased when I did my job well, whatever it was.
And to have them be grateful I was around.
And I think I managed that pretty well,
I mean...
I'm good with the students, Joe, I really am.
But that's not all that's important.
God, what's the matter with me?
Why can't I grow up?
Why is that thrill so important?
That deep, dirty thrill.
We know the reasons, Karen.
But knowing isn't enough, is it, Karen?
- Yeah.
- Joe. I got the emmis on Rainbow, Joe.
The stockholders are all on the Borough Planning Commission.
OK, I'll be there.
I've got to go.
What happened in that garage? Why did they try to kill you? What's all that about?
Some important people in the neighbourhood got their necks stuck out.
I'm gonna chop 'em off.
Will the department let you do that?
- We'll see.
- Joe.
Take good care of yourself.
What is it, Joe?
I just discovered something else about this guy Maclver.
He had a strange sense of humour. Rainbow means an organisation that covers the town.
- What are you talking about?
- The Borough Planning Commission.
You know how it's formed.
A couple of political payoffs.
An ex-mayor, a councilman, a representative of business, somebody for the religious community.
Rainbow. Covers the town.
- Why are they selling land back and forth?
- To make prices rise. Don't you understand?
The board recommends to the city which land should be bought for new housing, hospitals, slum-clearance projects.
They're selling land. They buy it, and sell it to each other's corporations, raising the price.
You got it. That's why there are no hospitals being built and the old slums still stand.
By the time they fill their pockets, there ain't enough money to build a birdhouse.
The most respected names in the borough are here.
They're the ones talking about how the town needs improving.
Naturally.
Dave, I've been waiting a long time to get those bastards. A long time.
And they judge other people's morals.
The thing we have to find is the link between this and Maclver's death.
Hey, maybe he wanted to pull out and they didn't want him to.
Maybe.
- What's this?
- The lox came fresh this morning.
- Not now, honey.
- The bagels'll get stale.
- Rachael, please. This is important, will you?
- You have to eat.
- Wait till evening, will you?
- Will you look how he looks?
Now she's gonna cry.
Did you notice how many times
Dr Roberts is mentioned?
Now, he must be on the board of at least ten organisations.
Dave, we're sitting on something pretty dangerous.
I suggest you send Rachael to her mother's for a few days.
What'll I tell her?
- Tell her you got a shiksa,
- Thanks a lot.
- Norma, it's Joe.
- Oh, hello, Joe.
- Will you do me a favour, no questions?
- What is it?
See Dr Roberts tonight, keep him busy.
Joe, if you suspect Wendell, you're mistaken.
I'll be in his office so if he comes anywhere near the building, you call me.
All right.
What time do you want me to see him?
About eight o'clock.
Joe, be careful.
Don't worry, I will.
- Dave, do me a favour, will you?
- What?
Don't leave the house.
If anybody rings the doorbell, don't answer it.
- That's just what I didn't want to hear.
- And another thing.
If you swallow your gum or run out of cigarettes, call me.
You'll hear me, and I won't need a telephone either.
Joe, will you do me a favour?
- Will you tell Rachael to go to her mother's?
- Dave!
- Yes? What?
- Joe, he's coming up.
He stopped at the building to pick up some papers. This was the first chance I had to call.
- Where are you?
- I'm downstairs. He's on his way up now.
OK.
Close the door, Doctor.
Don't turn your back.
This is ridiculous.
Do you keep tapes of all your patients?
No, only sometimes.
Sometimes there are things
I don't want even a secretary to hear.
Maclver come to you clinically?
No, he didn't.
This is something else.
I'd like to hear that something else.
Play them.
Go on, play it.
Joe, you don't want to do this.
Yes, I do. Play them.
You don't want to hear this, Joe.
What's the matter, Doctor? You afraid
I'll find out too much about Rainbow?
No, no. This is something else.
He talks about Rainbow only in passing.
You knew about Rainbow, didn't you, Doctor?
I didn't know until he made these tapes.
Proceed.
My name is Colin Maclver.
I'm 38 years old and I...
I don't know if I can do it.
You have to.
I'm making this tape to clear Dr Roberts.
He had nothing to do with Rainbow.
I used his name.
I'm making it also because I want
Dr Roberts to have something on me.
I want him to use this in any way he sees fit, in case the patterns that led to the evening that I am going to relate manifest themselves again.
Where shall I begin?
- Shall I begin with that night?
- Go ahead. The tape's running.
Now, I had a beautiful wife. I was a success.
Everybody thought it was wonderful.
All right, the party's over.
On your way. Outside.
- Sorry.
- Come on. Get outta here.
- Nice car, Dad.
- Get out, fast.
- Don't rank me, Dad. I like the car.
- Get out, right now!
Hey, don't act tough with me.
You're a faggot. A dirty queer.
You little bastard, I could kill you right now.
Get out of here.
You said there was no such thing as a bisexual.
You said there were only homosexuals without conviction.
The thought of turning involuntarily into one of them frightened me and made me sick with anger.
I went down there.
I had heard about the waterfront.
People giggle and make jokes about it.
I had had only two experiences before - once in college, once in the army.
I thought I'd gotten it out of my life, but I hadn't.
I looked at them.
Was this what I was like?
Oh, my God.
Twisted faces. Outcasts.
Lives lived in shadows.
Always prey to a million dangers.
People don't realise what we go through.
I was raised in a family that would not admit that there was such a thing as a homosexual in this world.
And here I was, and I couldn't do anything about it.
I couldn't stop.
I thought if I could have just one night,
I could get it out of my system.
Just one more time.
Excuse me, fellas.
Hello.
Hello.
What would you like to drink?
Anything.
Moss.
Can we have a couple of Scotch and waters, please? OK?
Fine.
What's the matter?
You're a shy one, aren't you?
You're a closet queen.
You're the kind that thinks he's fooling people. Forget it.
I knew you were gay the moment you walked into the bar.
How could you know?
We know each other.
Something about the way you walked.
Something about the eyes.
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your mind?
What's the matter with you?
Let go of me.
I'll call the police, do you hear?
Let go!
- Don't! Don't do that!
- Operator? Operator, I want to talk...
You bitch.
I'd killed one man, and another was about to die for something I did.
When it was announced that Tesla was executed, I should have felt something.
I was responsible now for the deaths of two men.
But I never did feel a great deal.
You see, I felt more guilty about being a homosexual than a murderer.
He jumped from the roof of the track a few weeks after he made this tape.
What do you suppose would happen if we made these things public?
You know what would happen.
You're famous for the Leikman case.
It was international news.
They'd crucify you.
Maybe they should.
I knew that poor bastard was a psychotic.
He didn't know real from unreal.
But I saw a chance for a promotion and also to get the department off the hook.
I wouldn't indulge in too much guilt.
After all, there was the rest of the department,
Tesla's lawyers, the judge, the newspapers.
Oh, you're awful good. It's easy to understand why you do such a thriving business here.
You're awful good at getting people off the hook.
Too many of us are on the hook.
That's part of the problem.
Is it?
I thought it was because we don't face responsibility.
What about Norma?
You want her to find out what Colin really was?
You want her to be haunted for the rest of her life by the lurid stories the papers'll print?
No, I don't.
No. I don't.
What about Rainbow, Doc?
Do we forget about that too?
What choice have we under the circumstances?
What choice?
Lovely plaques, Doctor.
Pretty words, too.
"Charity and compassion."
"For his very good work."
Good work.
A man committed a murder because he didn't want it known he was a homosexual.
And you're going to keep quiet about it.
There are no hospitals or houses because people are lining their pockets, and you're going to keep quiet about that.
Kids growing up in the stink.
And you have a chance to help them, regardless how small, but you're not going to do anything about it, are you?
And you?
What are you going to do?
- Here he is.
- Hey, Joe.
- Look this way, Joe.
- Thanks, Joe.
Leland, they say you accused the whole Borough Planning Commission.
- Some people think you're off your rocker.
- Tell 'em to talk to the attorney general.
- Tell 'em to talk to the attorney general.
- Hey, Leland.
Farrell wants to see you.
Joe. I...
Well...
Keep the faith, baby.
You damn fool.
You'll never win with these people.
- We'll see at the trials.
- You'll never win.
At least they'll know they were in a contest.
People don't give a damn.
Rainbow'll be back in action in six months.
Perhaps.
You know what the net result of this whole thing is going to be?
The department will get hurt.
No, Tom, I'd never hurt the department, you know that.
This'll take you off the hook.
You could have gone all the way.
You could have made chief.
No, I knew I could never make it.
Tell me one thing.
Why are you doing this?
Because I was a good cop.
I saw things that terrified me.
And I thought I was above it all.
But I wasn't.
No, I want out.
Because there are things to fight for, and I can't fight for them while I'm here.
That's why, Tom.
When I heard about it yesterday, I hated you.
I didn't believe a word of it.
Then I thought about it.
I knew it.
I knew it was all true.
What are you going to do?
Well,
I spent 20 years of my life with the department. Now I'm gonna live for myself.
Are you going back to her?
I don't know.
It's not too easy to rub out all those years in your life.
Good night, Joe.
Good night, Norma.
All cars in the 19th precinct and detectives of the 19th squad.

English
Phraxos.
Excuse me.
- Mr. Nicholas Urfe?
- Yes.
Welcome to Phraxos.
Welcome to the Lord Byron School.
How did you know I was coming today?
We Greeks, we know everything.
No, no. I just happened to be here.
I guessed.
Myrivilis. Also teacher of English.
I hope you'll call me Meli.
That's Greek for "honey".
My nickname.
Uh, you must be tired.
The school is not far from here.
- Did you have a nice journey?
- Yes.
I'm sorry you are here in such sad circumstances.
- They told you in London?
- Yes.
We are very lucky to have you on such short notice.
I wanted to get out of England.
Why did this chap,
Williamson, kill himself?
A complete mystery.
After Christmas, he was a little strange, moody, but nothing.
About a month ago, he went to Athens for the weekend.
And the next thing we hear, he's dead.
A whole bottle of Seconal.
I hope you like simple pleasures.
Nothing to do here except swim... walk, drink ouzo.
No women.
- Good.
- Good?
Good.
It's not much, I'm afraid.
It'll do.
- Was this his room?
- I'm sorry. It was the only one-
Forget it.
- What's "The Waiting Room"?
- An evening duty perhaps.
Who knows?
Uh, the headmaster would like to see you later.
I've been hearing that sentence all my life.
He is going.
We are going.
You are going.
They are going.
Now, once through, on your own.
I am going.
He is going.
We are going.
You are going.
They are going.
A post for you.
You need this more than I do.
What's wrong?
I don't love you.
Deep down.
Deep, deep down in you...
There's somebody totally different.
That's who I love.
Nicholas, meet Anne.
My quite but absolutely favourite air hostess.
- And what's Nicholas?
- Now Nicholas is one of the new elite.
Impeccable background.
His father was a bus driver.
A bus conductor, actually.
Scholarship to university.
Cracked up. Bad degree.
Huge chip on his shoulder.
- Now classless, rootless.
- And jobless.
All the symptoms of contemporary genius.
I may even publish him one day.
I may even let him.
- He deserves it.
- Are you a writer?
I've got everything a poet needs... except poems.
I've got everything an air hostess needs... except illusions.
Twin spirits.
"We shall not cease from exploration.
"And the end of all our exploring...
"Will be to arrive where we started...
"And know the place for the first time".
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I found this on the-
I chose well?
I built on the site of a medieval chapel.
Very nice. I came to return this.
You came hereto meet me.
Please, life is short.
My name is Conchis.
My name is Urfe.
From the school.
I find life long.
- Oh, tea is ready.
- How did you know-
There is a poem of the Tang Dynasty.
"Here on the frontier there are falling leaves.
"All of my neighbours are all barbarians.
"And you, you're a thousand miles away.
There are always two cups on my table".
Full of China tea?
The best darjeeling.
I believe you knew Williamson.
Oh.
My housekeeper, Maria.
My manservant, Andreas.
Please.
You did know him, didn't you?
Enjoy your tea, please.
Do you live here alone?
What some would call alone.
What was it?
Nothing.
I must go.
And you have a long walk.
Do you mind telling me now what the game is?
- The game?
- Yes.
I don't understand.
That's my line.
How did you know
I was coming over here today?
I am psychic.
I should like you to come next weekend and stay with me.
I think we have many things to discover.
- "We shall not cease from exploration".
- You read the passage.
- Wasn't it left for me to read?
- Until next weekend.
Thank you.
Tell no one over there you have met me.
Believe nothing they say.
They understand nothing.
They know nothing.
They mean nothing.
- How long have you known Conchis?
- Who?
The old nutcase who lives in the villa over on the south side.
Oh, come on.
It must have been you who told him I was going over there.
- But...
- Like Williamson.
Williamson? He never set foot out of the school.
You never met this man, Conchis?
Someone's been pulling your leg, my friend.
That villa belongs to a man from Athens - a Dr. Lambros.
- Just a minute, Meli-
- I remember now.
Yes, there was a man named Conchis, but he died years ago.
"Death is..."
Death is, like, not true.
- A lie.
- A lie.
Some people say he helped the Germans in the war.
But no one knows.
The truth-
I was admiring your gravestone the other day.
You have heard of a marriage of convenience?
There are also deaths of convenience.
- The war?
- Mm-hmm.
Aren't you taking a risk, telling me who you are?
Aren't you taking a risk coming back?
Knowing my name is Conchis is not quite the same... as knowing who I really am.
Do you like Modigliani?
Mmm, very impressive.
Bonnard.
Do you play some other instrument?
Of merely sentimental value.
These were done by some Byzantine.
Fra Angelico.
Oh. Same period.
It belonged to her.
We were once to be married.
She died during the first World War.
- I've missed you.
- Careful. You'll be in love next.
I never use four-letter words.
- Did you send out your application?
- Yes.
And you told them you're bringing your French mistress?
Of course.
How was the flight?
If one more dirty old man asks me to show him around swinging London-
But, darling, we need the money.
Honestly, if I didn't know you'd be here-
I must have a bath.
- Cigarettes?
- In my bag.
Why exactly do you carry a paperweight around?
Please put it back.
It's rather nice.
I think I'll keep it.
Please.
Another man?
It's... It's a sort of...
I never fly without it.
So...
About two years ago, I... had to have an abortion.
I wanted to kill myself.
One day I saw this in an antique shop.
It seemed to say something I needed.
Still need sometimes.
Go on.
It says... that right at the very heart of things... there's something not spoiled... un-betrayed.
Everything I'm not... and the world's not.
It's... what does an apple have?
A core?
It's the core.
- The core of what?
- Of everything.
It's the one thing
I shall never give away.
If I ever lost it,
I think I would die.
Is something wrong?
No.
It reminded you of someone.
Being psychic, Mr. Conchis?
One does not have to be that to see you are not the happiest of young men.
I am just a child of my century.
Now, I will show you something.
The ultimate reality.
Not the hammer and sickle, not the stars and stripes... not lysergic acid, not the sun... not gold, not yin and yang.
But...
the smile.
And what have you got in store for me now?
Shall we leave it to chance?
Let us see what the, uh, cards say.
The tarot.
You must cut three times.
Oh. The Hanged Man.
He stands for selfishness.
The High Priestess.
She stands for mystery and wisdom.
The Magus, or the Magician.
He stands for- for many things.
Oh. I think we need more brandy.
Who was that?
Who's just gone round there?
Questions are wasted on Andreas.
He's a mute.
- Who was it?
- Won't you sit down?
If you won't answer any of my questions... you could at least explain why.
I will explain many things if you pass the test.
Nicholas, how highly do you...
Value your life?
There's a fairly widespread impression...
Which I share, that it's not worth much.
Then you would risk death without any qualms?
Why not?
All men feel the need to risk death at least once in their life.
War is a very unscientific answer to that need.
If I had my way, all young men would go to a clinic... and throw a dice.
Numbers two to six would mean life.
Number one, death.
A painless death.
No mess, no cruelty... no destruction of innocents.
One throw of the dice.
These were issued to certain special agents during the war...
In case of interrogation.
Prussic acid.
Death is immediate.
A war in one second.
Wouldn't a corpse be rather embarrassing for you?
Not at all.
Another suicide.
If you mean what I think you mean... you go first.
I am not playing at make-believe.
Swear to me that if the number is one... you will take the pill.
Yes.
I congratulate you.
You have passed the test.
You refused to die on the throw of a loaded dice.
Many years ago, so did I.
I was an only child.
We lived in London.
I, uh...
I had the misfortune to be a musical prodigy.
No time for games or friends.
Instead...
Endless hours of practicing, practicing, practicing.
When I was 17...
In the year 1913...
We had new neighbours.
Her name was Lily.
It seemed as if we were destined.
She, too, was an only child.
She, too, was musical.
The happiest year of my life passed.
We became engaged.
There seemed no cloud on our horizon.
But a terrible cloud was forming...
In a little town called Sarajevo.
We were on the brink of the first World War.
The great majority of those who volunteered were like sheep.
They simply conformed.
I'd been brought up outside the flock.
So when Lord Kitchener pointed his finger at me...
I shook my head.
In short, Nicholas...
I decided as you decided a few minutes ago.
Of course, there was a difference.
On the table in 1914... these were real.
Not just kirsch... in coloured candy.
I tried to make Lily understand why I refused to enlist.
I poured out my feelings to her.
All the arguments, the reasons...
Why she must go with me to America.
But I was condemned.
Not by her, but by her idealism.
That look.
That last look, it will never be past.
It's in my every second till I die.
I selfishly thought there was always time on my side.
I would return.
I was young and I was wrong.
She died?
In the early hours of February 19, 1916.
There was a typhoid epidemic.
She was working in a hospital.
Poor girl.
Hmm. The dead live.
How?
By love.
No, no.
Nice work.
Ah, Nicholas.
I trust you slept well?
Very well.
It must have been the "Kleine Nachtmusik" that you and your friend provided.
You saw her?
Mr. Conchis, you don't expect me to believe-
I knew I was right the moment I saw you.
You cannot believe you are psychic.
That's normal.
Believing doesn't come into it.
I am not psychic.
I saw a girl, not a ghost.
Once bitten, twice shy.
She must like you.
Where is she?
I am not psychic.
Yours is a characteristic reaction of your century to disbelieve, to disprove.
You are like a porcupine.
When it has its spines up, it cannot eat.
If you do not eat, you will starve.
My dear Lily.
Oh, may I present Mr. Nicholas Urfe.
Miss Montgomery.
It is very warm.
Yes, it is.
Mr. Urfe is the young schoolmaster
I mentioned.
Teaching must be a most interesting profession.
Is there any news from Flanders?
Nothing of importance.
Maurice has told me of your weak heart. I am sorry.
I ventured to explain to Miss Montgomery why you were unable to volunteer.
I see. Thank you.
They also serve who only stand and teach.
Excuse me.
Been here long?
I've not been anywhere long.
I meant, uh, on the island.
Island? What island?
Excellent return of service,
Miss Montgomery.
- Come on.
- Come on where?
Which delightful old English county do you hail from?
Massachusetts?
California?
My father works for the Times.
Until two years ago, he was their American correspondent.
- I was brought up there.
- Two years ago being?
I'm surprised, Mr. Urfe, that a person of your education... is unable to subtract two from 1915.
Game and set.
Smoke? May I?
It cannot be very good for your heart.
I can pinch your bottom... or kiss you.
- Which shall it be?
- Mr. Urfe!
Do you love Maurice?
We all love him so deeply.
- We?
- His other visitors and myself.
You mean there are more ghosts?
Maurice does not like the word "ghost".
Or "actress"?
We're all actors and actresses,
Mr. Urfe.
You included.
Of course.
On the stage of the world.
Mr. Urfe is very understanding.
Understanding?
Nicholas, would you care for a cigar before you go?
- Thank you, yes.
- Would you, dear?
Your cigar, Mr. Urfe.
What is this?
What is what?
Okay.
I'll play-
I'd just enjoy it more if I knew what it was all about.
Man has been saying that for the last 10,000 years.
But the one common feature of all the gods he has said it to... is that not one has ever returned an answer.
- But why me?
- Why anyone?
Why anything?
I said I'll play, but not unless I know the rules.
Then, my friend, this world is not for you.
All right.
You win.
But you might tell me whether I'm your guest or your victim.
You are neither.
Is there any news from Flanders?
Nicholas? Nicholas?
Nicholas, wake up.
- What time is it?
Where were you last night?
I was just wandering about and I got lost.
What a shame.
Nicholas, I congratulate you.
She is charming.
She?
Anne.
Anne?
Last evening: She had just one hour before the boat went back.
What did she want?
Not forgiven.
Not forgotten.
Take it easy.
It's not the end of the world.
Just the end of the affair.
One day you'll meet someone much better.
By which you mean you think you will.
Somebody respectable and English.
On a remote Greek island?
You're running away.
That's all it is.
Look, in this country
I am the typical nowhere man- belonging nowhere, going nowhere and wanted nowhere.
Oh, Nicko, this is life, not an existentialist novel.
- We've discussed it.
- We've evaded it.
You'll miss your flight.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
That's what I can't forgive.
You're not sorry.
You are glad.
I don't love you.
Deep down.
Deep, deep down in you... there's somebody totally different.
That's who I love.
How would he behave?
- Marry you?
- Just take me with him.
I'll have to postpone my flight.
I can get back by Wednesday.
Okay.
I don't need it anymore.
Reservations, please.
Oh, my name is Nicholas Urfe.
And I have a seat to Athens... on Olympic Flight 063... for Wednesday.
I want to change it.
That's right.
Can you get me on tomorrow?
Fine.
Thank you.
She's flying the Middle Eastern route now.
She'll be in Athens the weekend after next,
Friday, 6:00, at the airport.
Thanks.
There was no one at the house.
Where are they?
You may sit down, but you must not wet my dress.
- Where are they?
- Give me your hand.
I'll read your fortune.
Your happiness line is very broken.
Bull's-eye.
And your soul line is very crooked.
I fear you are deceitful, Mr. Urfe.
What are you?
- His mistress?
- That is most rude.
Most ill-bred!
I want to be your friend.
You make it all so difficult.
I've never been in a lunatic asylum before.
How dare you!
How dare you!
Let me go!
It was only a joke.
Nicholas, it tolls for thee.
- Let it toll.
- You must go.
Come with me.
It doesn't toll for me.
Please. I'll wait here.
If that's a promise,
I want a guarantee.
Mr. Urfe, are you asking me to commit osculation?
From the Latin, osculum, meaning "mouth".
Where's Mr. Conchis?
Nicholas.
My apologies.
I was delayed on business in Athens.
Or just getting out of your costume.
So... well, sooner or later, it had to happen.
Of course Lily is no ghost.
And I am no more psychic than you are.
What are you doing to that girl?
My name is really Lambros.
I'm a psychiatrist.
This is my clinic.
This film shows her before she came under my care.
She was then at a clinic in Zurich.
This advanced type of schizophrenia... is usually considered hopeless.
And yet, look.
Here she is today.
And in great part because of you, Nicholas.
Still far from normal, God knows.
But not the terrible nothingness you saw in the clinic.
The fast developing is a contribution... of one of my most gifted students,
Dr. Soula Androutsou.
How do you do, Mr. Urfe?
You see how much Julie has improved under Dr. Lambros's care.
That is her real name - Julie Holmes.
But you must under no circumstances reveal that you know it.
Many of my colleagues find my theory highly suspect.
You see, it involves not checking...
But pandering to the patient's fantasies.
By turning monsters into play things, she escapes her condition.
Therefore, this morning's little trick.
- And all that 1915 stuff?
- Pure fantasy.
We are always trying to stimulate her invention.
We make a search for new ways to surprise and deceive.
What I can't understand is... how you could let anyone come blind into this.
I had no reason to discuss my patient with you before this... morning's episode.
Dr. Lambros fears a repetition of the Williamson affair.
So he was here.
Oh, yes.
And he fell in love with her.
I must tell you. Young female schizophrenics are often highly sexed.
He ran away with her.
Of course, we had to bring her back.
The shock could have killed her.
It killed him.
Didn't he realise she was a mental case?
Did you?
We are taking Julie to Zurich for some clinical tests.
We'll be back in about two weeks, perhaps sooner.
It'll give you time to decide if you wish to continue.
- I think I have decided.
- Hmm.
Then I must warn you.
No emotional involvement.
You see, Nicholas, you have been neither my guest nor my victim... but my colleague.
Catch me.
It's all right.
They want it to look as if we're falling in love.
Oh, for heaven sake, don't tell me you believed all that schizophrenic nonsense.
Come on.
Now listen.
They won't give us long.
First of all, I may be mad to be here, but I'm not here because I'm mad.
- Why then?
- There isn't time.
Anyway, you wouldn't believe anything I said.
- But my real name is Julie Holmes.
- I know. They told me.
Oh. I might have guessed.
Did he tell you his medical name?
Check that: Check anything about him that you can.
All I want you to realise is it's not just you who is the victim here.
We both are.
- Come away with me now then.
- We wouldn't get 50 yards.
Oh. Armed guards with Alsatians.
Of course not.
I could get away.
It's like being halfway through some fantastic book.
And now that you're part of it...
You must believe me.
- Is this how the script goes?
- The what?
You could be working for him.
- Bonjour, l'Angleterre.
- Bonjour, la France.
I thought you missed your plane.
I didn't think you would come.
Curiosity.
Just couldn't think why you'd wanna see a bastard like me again.
How are the dirty old men?
No younger and no cleaner.
And you?
Some lovely Greek peasant girl?
She gave me the weekend off.
Good. I want to do something mad.
The next time you say mad... remind me to remember that you mean it.
Hey!
Tell him we are dying of thirst.
You've got to drink.
It's an insult to refuse.
Finish it.
He's gonna get more for me.
I'll never be the same.
Just a minute.
Uh-
I told him I'd love a drink, but it's against doctor's orders.
Oh, you traitor.
Hey!
- What is it now?
- It's a cheese.
You take it.
Nicholas?
Right!
No!
- Mm.
- Now... for a long passionate kiss.
Water.
- It's freezing!
- Yee-haw!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Do you know how many men
I have slept with this year?
Fifty?
If I had slept with 50,
I'd just be an honest professional.
I suppose to you
I'm just like all the others.
I don't compare birds in the hand with birds in the bush.
But you are that sort.
- What sort?
- Just after bird.
You're not still a Catholic?
But I'm not just bird either.
Nicko?
I know what we are today... but what about tomorrow?
I have to go back.
I didn't mean that kind of tomorrow.
I know you didn't.
Still living that existentialist novel?
I've been trying to find a way to tell you.
It's a whole group of people I've met.
- But there is a girl?
- It's not as simple as that.
This thing, it's like being halfway through a book.
You can't just throw it in the dustbin.
- So you throw me instead?
- I'm trying to be honest.
Honest?
It's just like in London.
You haven't changed.
I'll always be that French girl who slept around.
A human boomerang.
Throw her away and she'll always come back for another week of duty-free sex.
- That's below the belt!
- Your natural territory.
Or so you think.
But let me tell you something.
If all I needed you for was that...
I'd have left you after the first night.
I'll walk out of my job tomorrow.
Or?
You say no, and for the last time.
- You can't just finish it like-
- Yes or no?
- Anne, if you'd only lis-
- Yes or no?
- You can't decide these things-
- Yes or no?
No.
Don't be so stupid.
Anne, let me in.
You'll never see me again.
Never!
Never again!
Anne!
Miss?
Please, I must speak to you.
We want to help you.
We arrive at Phraxos in a few minutes.
Father?
Do you remember telling me that Conchis helped the Germans during the war?
What did he do?
That beach - you see it?
That is where it started.
- Zigarette?
- Nein. Danke.
Achtung!
Because of that in your school, a great killing...
80 hostages, they say it was Conchis.
It was because of him.
Ah, Nicholas!
I told them you would return.
Oh, this is Dr. Anton Meyer from Zurich.
He is, uh, observing my methods.
Dr. Lambros has told me how valuable your assistance can be.
Anything to further medical knowledge.
How is the patient?
We feel very optimistic, provided we're all careful.
Well, you can depend on me.
Nicholas is very intelligent.
I think we can rely on his good judgment. Can't we?
Implicitly, Dr. Lambros.
You've come back!
Thank God.
- Did I ever say I wouldn't?
- No. But they did.
They said you'd gone back to England.
They told me you'd gone to Switzerland.
I've just met one of the doctors who treated you there.
Anton? He's no more a doctor than I am.
Did you check the name Lambros?
I knew I'd forgotten something.
You did.
Then you know everything
I've said is true.
Here. I wanna talk to you.
Isn't it time you stop making a fool of me?
It's my profession.
I'm an actress.
I studied in America.
But nothing happened for me, so I came to Europe.
I got one or two small parts in French pictures.
And then I had this offer to do a film on location in Greece.
You don't have to tell me the producer's name.
And the director was Anton.
We spent a week here on tests.
My dear Lily.
May I present Mr. Nicholas Urfe.
Miss Montgomery.
Anton played your part.
It is very warm.
We're surely not going to talk about the weather.
Mr. Urfe is the young schoolmaster
I mentioned.
That first meeting.
What happened then?
That's just it, absolutely nothing.
I never saw a script.
All the equipment vanished, all the crew.
And then one day...
Of course we intend to make the picture... but in a completely new way.
The leading actor, whom we have already selected, will not realise he is acting.
He'll have absolutely no idea what's happening.
- But surely he must see a script.
- Ah, on the contrary... we will not write a script until we have watched his reaction... to the role we will ask you to play.
- The days of set plots are over. Finished.
- Of course.
Julie, surely at drama school they taught you to improvise.
Julie, please.
Trust me? Hmm?
It seemed fun.
You came, I improvised, they were excited by your reactions.
But I don't understand what's going on anymore.
I even think they know you've guessed what I really am.
There's still no script, still no preparation for any kind of filming.
Well, haven't you asked him,
"What happens now?"
Of course, a thousand times.
My dear Julie, be patient.
Answers kill.
In a way,
I know what he means.
Do you remember being here before?
That day you disappeared.
I'll tell you when you're warm.
I don't know.
I give up.
Julie?
Julie?
Good Lord.
Did he have this built?
The Germans.
They were here during the war.
Maurice only had to make this.
Wasn't I more fascinating as a ghost?
The wardrobe department.
You know he's already taken film of us.
He can't have.
I've seen it.
- You and me on the jetty together.
- But it's impossible.
The cameras and the crew all disappeared before you came.
It was shot with a telephoto lens.
It's weird.
It's what I keep on feeling.
He's some kind of voyeur, and we're his puppets... his toys.
You are frightened.
Sometimes.
And sometimes...
I love every minute of it.
Nicholas, I can't.
Not here.
It's this feeling that he sees everything.
But you can never get away.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I think I could.
At night.
Not for long, but-
- Long enough?
- Mr. Urfe, are you asking me to commit-
I'll go into details of the crime when we meet.
There's a chapel in the forest.
Follow the path, okay?
Midnight. What day?
I'll send you a sign.
Fruit from the Garden of Eden.
Nicholas, I wonder if you would help me fell a dead pine.
And, dear, it's time for your treatment.
I don't want to go.
Come, come.
You will soon see Nicholas again.
I see she's revealed one of our little tricks to you.
Which of her fantasies has she been regaling you with this afternoon?
The incredibly innocent film actress... or something less far-fetched?
Nothing quite as far-fetched as Dr. Lambros... who doesn't appear in any medical register.
Well, how could he?
My name is Dr. Maurice Conchis.
Ah. I think when I marry,
I shall pray for daughters. And you?
I'll just pray for myself.
This was handed in at the gate, sir.
Oh, and there's a letter, sir.
You know what's wrong with marriage, Meli?
It kills the fun in life.
It's the timid, little people who can't gamble... who always want to know where they are.
It's for mice, Meli, not for men.
What is it? Nicholas?
Julie?
Julie, stop mucking about.
- Did you find a boat?
- What?
This way!
Hey, hey, what's going on?
Who the hell are you?
- Enjoying yourself?
- Good. Thank you.
Traitor!
Freedom!
Take them away.
My dear Nicholas.
Has something happened?
You know damn well what's happened.
I went to the chapel.
Chapel? What for?
I am sick of your mysteries.
Sick of pretense.
You are right.
Nothing here is what it seems.
- You have entered the Metatheatre.
- The what?
A theatre with no set plot, no set dialogue and no audience.
Our play is for the actors alone.
Some Greek millionaires find their pleasure inviting famous people on their yachts.
I... I prefer less banal amusements.
Amusements?
I hoped at least you would find them entertaining.
- Where's Julie?
- Ah.
A very promising actress, is she not?
She did not feel like performing this evening.
And you're the bloody director?
Directors do not appear on the stage.
What am I, the unpaid clown of the production?
You will not go unpaid.
I assure you of that.
Fine. Well, take a look at the latest bill for your amusements.
- Who was she?
- A girl I knew.
And if it hadn't been for you and your damn game, she'd still be alive.
She loved you?
I never realised how much.
- If I...
- My dear Nicholas.
Oh, if I'd only known.
I am most profoundly sorry.
Another death to add to your collection.
Wait!
What I said before is partly true.
But it is not true that we do what we do just for fun.
The chapel was to set the scene for something that proves that.
Something that may help you come to terms with this tragedy.
I beg you to sit down.
Please.
During the war here...
I, too, was cast as the clown of a production... in the theatre of real life.
I hated my role.
But it taught me the greatest lesson life holds.
In 1941, after the fall of Greece...
they sent a small German garrison to Rhraxos.
They set up an observation post here at the villa...
And took over your school for the headquarters.
One day, I was ordered to report to the garrison commandant...
- Captain Wilhelm Dietrich Wimmel.
- Ah, Herr Conchis.
He told me I was to be mayor.
I was given no choice.
For two years, nothing happened.
It seemed we were to be spared the worst horrors of the occupation.
Then one day in 1943...
One typical, calm
Aegean summer day...
The Germans had a system.
For each German killed by the Resistance...
20 civilians had to be executed.
We, therefore, owed them 80.
You know they were from... from Crete.
We have no partisans here in Phraxos.
But they were Greeks,
Herr Bürgermeister.
One of them, who had relatives in the village, went for help.
The other two hid.
Their comrade was unfortunate enough to be captured alive.
Gut. Danke schön.
Rrodotis!
Eleutherial!
Eleutheria is the noblest word in the Greek language.
It means "freedom".
The Greek for "traitor" is prodotis.
Herr Bürgermeister,
I wish certain information... from the leader of these murderers.
And he's being obstinate.
You, as mayor, will order him to speak.
Under Occupation Law,
I'm not obliged to be-
The only law on Phraxos now, lieber Herr Conchis, is my law.
Now, speak.
If you make him talk,
I will give you 80 lives.
Wimmel told me to ask him the name of his superior...
The methods by which partisans were smuggled from one island to the other...
Why they had come to Rhraxos...
What their real mission was.
As much as I hated asking him to cooperate with the Germans...
I was certain no information he was hiding could be worth 80 lives.
Eleutherial!
Well, I could make you watch the dialogue... between my men and this animal.
- No, thank you.
- Do you think I'm a sadist?
No, I'm a realist.
My purpose is a German historical purpose.
To bring order... into the chaos of Europe.
Hmm.
Herr Bürgermeister?
Order.
We will meet tomorrow.
Herr Bürgermeister.
The responsibility for the fate of these peasants rests with you.
I will change the sentence of death to deportation... on one condition.
That is...
That you yourself carry out the execution of these three murderers.
It's forbidden for Greeks to have loaded weapons.
But I don't understand.
Well, you have 15 seconds to understand.
Ten seconds.
Eleutherial...
Eleutheria.
Fire!
You see what he had condemned me to.
Alive, I could be only one thing...
a collaborationist.
That is why Maurice Conchis had to die.
What would you have done?
- God knows.
- God never has to choose.
You and I do.
You have one death on your conscience.
I have 80.
More than 80.
No, no more, my friends.
Our activities for this year must come to an end.
Madame Catherine Fougere of the French National Theatre.
Enchantée, monsieur.
Mr. Andreas Paskalis, who has made a specialty of servants' roles.
Thank you.
Why was I cast as the traitor?
We are all cast as the traitor for one simple reason:
We have all failed to love.
The comedy is over.
I can't stand any more.
I'm never going back.
- But you knew all about it.
- I thought I did.
You weren't the only one who was told not to get emotionally involved.
I'll never be able to make you believe me now.
Try.
Try harder.
- Julie?
- I'm frightened.
Frightened?
In case you do to me what you did to Anne.
Anne? To hell with Anne.
No.
- To hell with Nicholas.
- Julie!
There is no Julie.
What?
What the hell-
All gods.
Ancient gods.
If it hadn't been for you and your damn game, she'd still be alive.
I fear you are deceitful, Mr. Urfe.
Marriage is for mice,
Meli, not men.
Why did you cast me as the traitor?
You'll never see me again.
Never.
Never again.
To hell with Anne.
Rrodotis.
And this is the latest God.
Into it, we have fed all the known facts about you.
Now we shall proceed to instant analysis.
The subject is devoid of interest.
Except as a familiar type of male parasite.
His only law is his own pleasure.
His only morality is his own good.
He is a machine for self-gratification.
Not a human being.
I recommend that he be sterilised.
- Is there no hope for him?
- He is shallow.
He is vain.
He is egocentric.
He is a liar.
There is no hope for him.
Except as an actor, of course.
This is a trial, my friend...
but you are not the prisoner.
You are the judge.
And now... we come to the case against the accused.
You are not only the judge...
You are also the executioner.
- Yes or no? Yes or no?
- Anne, if you'd just listen.
- You can't decide these things!
- Yes or no?
This isn't my room.
You are in Athens.
You have been very ill.
But I think you have recovered.
Due to your expert treatment?
Due to your excellent cooperation.
Aw, come on.
How long is this game going on?
Are you so sure it's a game?
- Well, good-bye.
- Answer one question.
What you do...
Is it for us or for yourself... because of what you did in the war?
Just once... the truth.
What is truth?
Anne!
Anne.
Anne.
Anne!
Anne!
Anne!
"We shall not cease from exploration.
And the end of all our exploring"...
"Will be to arrive where we started...
And know the place for the first time".

So what exactly is it you want?
Look, National Shoes is in business to make money.
That's right. You should think twice about this model.
Do you really think it will boost sales?
Hold on a second.
We're not losing money.
They're great shoes, but they cost too much.
And they're old-fashioned.
And another thing.
They're too durable.
If shoes don't wear out, we don't sell any.
Look, Gondo, women see shoes as accessories, like hats and handbags.
They flock to stylish designs at affordable prices.
Exactly.
Our shoes are practical.
Women's hats don't wear long.
Why should their shoes?
You're wrong.
Shoes and hats aren't the same.
A woman wears a hat on her head, but shoes carry all her weight.
1-0 for you.
Listen, you may be happy with our product line, but as director I have to ask why sales have been flat.
That's why we're here.
What are you asking me to do?
Let me be frank.
We are the directors of National Shoes.
I'm in charge of sales and operations.
You run the factory.
Ishimaru takes care of design.
Kamiya handles marketing.
Kawanishi is your right hand, and a future executive.
We're all agreed on what our problem is.
And what might that be?
Our president.
The Old Man's backward.
His dream shoe is an army boot.
But he holds enough stock to dominate the shareholder meetings.
We can't do a thing.
Show him the sample.
Look at this style, this taste.
It's a sure winner.
Ishimaru, this is a masterpiece.
And we can make them at half the cost.
Well?
What would the Old Man say?
We won't let him say anything.
He may own a lot of stock, but what if we join forces?
He holds 25%.
You three together hold 21%.
Not enough to vote him out.
Gondo... we included your holdings in our calculations.
What do you say?
Will you join us?
With your 13%, we'd have 34%.
More than enough to boot the Old Man out.
And who'd be the new president?
Well, you're certainly a candidate, but...
But since this plan was Baba's idea, he'll be the next president.
You'll be executive director.
Fair enough?
The Old Man may be old-fashioned, but at least he makes real shoes.
Yours are trash.
Listen to me.
I started as an apprentice at National Shoes when I was 16.
Aside from time in the army,
I've spent 30 years of my life there.
I know every sound and smell in that factory.
We've made many shoes.
I remember them all.
They were all good, durable shoes.
I can't put our name on garbage like this.
Listen!
This shoe wouldn't last a month.
There's no steel shank.
The insole is cardboard, glued rather than properly stitched.
The inner lining is flimsy.
You want money for this?
But the costs...
Costs are eating our profits.
- Business is business!
- I know that!
I love this business more than I can say.
Shoes are my life.
I won't do slipshod work.
So you'll keep making the Old Man's army boots?
No. He's wrong too.
He's wrong. We're wrong.
What's left?
I'll make my ideal shoes: comfortable, durable, yet stylish.
Expensive to make maybe, but profitable in the long run.
How romantic.
Only we won't let you.
If we vote with the Old Man, we can force you out.
Be my guest. The shareholders' meeting is next month.
Kawanishi, show the gentlemen the door.
Leaving already?
Pardon us, Mrs. Gondo.
Why isn't my husband seeing you out?
If you'll excuse us.
What just happened?
Nothing.
It certainly didn't look that way.
Don't worry.
You wouldn't understand.
It's business.
You always say that to keep me quiet.
What's he got up his sleeve?
You're his right-hand man.
You must know his plan.
The son of a bitch, kicking us out!
Must be pretty sure of himself.
What's he up to?
Why didn't you ask him yourself?
Don't be a wiseass.
You may not know his scheme, but help us stop him and we'll make you a director.
Please don't tempt me.
You want to be his flunky forever?
Think it over.
Jun, that's enough!
They're furious.
Will we be all right?
Wait and see.
A new round of feuding?
Sure looks like it.
They want to kick me out, but I've taken measures.
They'd have to be pretty serious.
What measures?
I don't want to say until everything's in place.
Then I'll do them all in.
Jun really takes after you.
You both love blood sport.
Jun!
Oh, Shinichi, it's you.
- I'm the sheriff this time.
Jun, is it your turn to be the outlaw?
Well, don't run.
Hide and then ambush the sheriff.
A man must kill or be killed.
Now go. And don't lose.
- You get worse by the day.
- What do you mean?
Your attitude.
Success isn't worth losing your humanity.
A woman can't understand.
This isn't about wanting to become president.
I just want to make shoes my way.
Yes, it is.
Osaka Hotel?
Did you call Osaka?
One moment.
Hello?
Room 310, please.
Gondo calling.
Hello. It's me.
How'd it go? All settled?
How much?
Within my limit?
Great work!
Good. Settle the deal.
And quickly.
Call me again when it's done.
I'll send the deposit tonight.
I'm counting on you.
I want you to go to Osaka.
Book a flight.
Use the phone upstairs.
I'm waiting for a call.
Is everything all right?
Something about this scares me.
Hello. Yes, it's me.
It's all set?
Great, thanks.
Just a moment.
Well?
Kawanishi's off at 10:00 with a check for 50 million.
Time for a toast.
I kept you two in the dark, but now I can talk about it.
My share isn't 13%.
I've bought 15% more over the last three years, and just now on the phone,
I bought another 19%.
That's 47%.
Even with the Old Man, they only have 46%.
It was a risky move, but National Shoes is mine.
But where did you get that kind of money?
I borrowed against everything, including this house.
It was hard work raising 50 million.
One yen less and Osaka would have refused.
Now I don't even own the clothes on my back.
I've bet my entire fortune.
But wait a minute.
This is just the deposit, isn't it?
That's usually one third.
Where's the other 100 million?
If I gain control of the company,
I'll get the rest.
In shock?
Have a drink.
Excuse me. 
Have you seen my boy, Shinichi?
He and Jun are outside.
What is it?
I brought this for him.
I'll call Jun.
Aoki, drive Kawanishi to the airport.
My flight's at 10:00.
Yes, this is Gondo.
What?
You've kidnapped my son?
What kind of joke is this?
It's not a joke. 
Listen. 
I have your son. 
If you do as I say, 
I'll let him live. 
Get 30 million yen. 
Thirty million?
No consecutive serial numbers. 
- One thousand 10,000-yen notes... 
- Wait a second!
- One thousand...
- 10,000-yen notes. 
Three thousand 5,000-yen notes, 
and five thousand 1,000-yen notes. 
Total: 30 million yen. 
Thirty million!
Have it ready by tomorrow. 
I'll have more details then. 
If you love your son, 
don't call the police. 
No, of course not.
So long, Mr. Gondo. 
Thirty million yen?
Just hurry and pay it!
Get Jun back!
Calm down!
I'll get him back, no matter what it costs.
I can raise more money later.
I'll call the police.
Fool!
You'll put Jun in danger.
- Kingo!
- Don't worry! It'll be all right!
Mom, did you call me?
Jun!
What's the matter, Mom?
What's going on?
What kind of sick joke is this?
Jun, where's Shinichi?
Don't know. I hid like you said, but he never came.
Some sheriff!
Wait, Shinichi was wearing
Jun's outfit.
Even I got them mixed up.
Shinichi!
Call the police.
No, you can't!
What'll happen to Shinichi?
The kidnapper will realize he has the wrong kid.
A chauffeur can't pay a ransom.
He'll let him go.
But I won't let him get away with this.
- Is that the police?
- No.
A department store delivery.
Odd at this hour.
What the hell's taking them so long?
Aoki, don't worry yourself to death.
Any way you look at it,
Shinichi has to be safe.
Kingo, it's the police.
Madam, would you mind
closing all the drapes? 
I'm Chief Inspector Tokura.
From the streets below, if he has a telescope, the kidnapper can see this entire room.
Any other phones in the house?
- One upstairs.
- Are they listed?
- Just this one.
The phone's over there, guys.
We'll install a listening device to record his calls.
But, Inspector,
I doubt he'll call again when he realizes he has the wrong child.
He may still think he has your son.
Broadcast the mistake on radio and TV.
If we do, he'll know you contacted us.
So?
He warned you he'd kill the boy if you did.
That's when he thought it was my son.
He has to return a child whose father can't pay.
You may think so, but he may not.
Kidnapping cases are difficult.
The hostage is his protection.
On our way here the chief told us,
"Save the child first, then catch the kidnapper."
We must be especially careful in this case.
The highest ransom ever demanded was two million, with most in the range of 200,000 to 300,000.
Thirty million is an extraordinary sum.
The kidnapper's extreme.
He may be mentally disturbed.
Are you the boy's father?
He's a widower.
It's his only child too.
Will you get my boy back?
We'll do everything we can.
What will you do next?
Wait for his next move.
It's all we can do.
I know how hard it is just to wait, but it's safest for the boy.
All set.
Have the phone company trace all incoming calls.
This way, please.
- Where's your son, Mrs. Gondo?
- In the dining room.
Taguchi, ask him everything about the kidnapping.
No, wait.
Nakao, you do it.
Taguchi might frighten the boy.
Taguchi, you talk to the father.
Do you have a recent picture?
Yes. I'll get it.
I should drive Mr. Kawanishi to the airport soon.
You're in no shape to drive.
Kawanishi, take a cab.
Wait. It may be the kidnapper.
Upstairs phone.
Keep him talking.
We may be able to trace him.
Go ahead.
Hello. Gondo speaking.
Hello. Gondo speaking. 
I got the wrong boy. 
But before you start
celebrating, listen: 
I don't care whose boy it is. 
You're still paying. 
You can't be serious. 
Why me? 
Don't ask questions. 
It's simple: 
Pay the 30 million or the boy dies. 
This is absurd! 
Exactly. It's absurd. 
Taking the wrong boy
was a lucky break. 
Did you know, Mr. Gondo, 
that it's only extortion
when you threaten
a person or his kin? 
In other words, 
this doesn't count. 
But you have to pay anyway. 
You're a fool to pay, 
but pay you must. 
Who says I'll pay? 
I absolutely will not! 
You will. 
You won't let him die. 
You don't have the guts, Mr. Gondo. 
He's a monster.
Smartest crook I ever saw.
Kidnap any child off the street, then pick a millionaire to squeeze.
And he's right:
It wouldn't be extortion, or even kidnapping for ransom.
Just simple kidnapping.
He'd get five years at most.
This is no joke.
I won't let him laugh at me like this.
Inspector, he's not just after my money.
He wants to humiliate me, see me suffer, make me throw away my hard-earned money!
He wants to make a laughingstock out of me.
I'll say this loud and clear:
I won't let him. I won't pay.
I'll spell it out next time he calls.
No ransom! Never!
Ow! Mom, that hurts.
Put Jun to bed.
I'm not sleepy.
I'll wait for Shinichi.
He understands very well what's happened.
He feels responsible for it.
I feel the same way.
No one's responsible.
The man is a maniac!
But Shinichi was kidnapped in your son's place. That's why I...
So you think he should pay the ransom?
You know the position
Mr. Gondo is in.
But he was willing to pay for his own son.
He said he could raise more money later.
How? From where?
He's mortgaged everything.
He couldn't raise more money to save his own life.
Giving 30 million to a madman...
That's enough!
- Let's go to bed.
- But I...
You don't have to sleep.
Just go to your room.
Inspector.
Can you guarantee the boy's safety if Mr. Gondo pays?
The boy may already be dead, or he may be killed afterwards.
Then what's the sense in paying?
That's true.
But if he's alive, paying may make the difference.
We can only hope it does.
And what would the kidnapper do if he isn't paid?
Would he actually kill the boy?
He seems intelligent, from the way he talks.
Killing a child is a capital offense.
I doubt he'd risk death just because he wasn't paid.
But as Mr. Gondo pointed out, he seems obsessed.
His cynical logic betrays a sick mind.
We must believe he'll carry it through:
If he's paid, he'll return the child.
If not, I'm afraid he'll kill the child as threatened.
This is a vicious case.
I'll ask the chief to deploy the special investigation unit.
See what you can find out here.
Mr. Gondo, please alert us before answering this phone.
What about me?
Am I still going to Osaka?
If I am, I'd better hurry.
Why are you hesitating?
What's there to think about?
Pay the ransom and we're ruined.
It's that simple.
Go.
I'm going, no matter who's calling.
All right, go.
Kawanishi, wait!
Inspector!
Keep him talking longer this time.
Upstairs phone, okay?
Hello. This is Gondo.
The boy's fine. 
I'll let him talk to you. 
Daddy? Are you there? 
Shinichi!
Whether he lives or dies
depends on you. 
Think it over carefully. 
Good night, Mr. Gondo. 
He got away again.
Please save my son!
Asking you to pay that kind of money...
Until I heard his voice,
I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
But now I'm begging you.
Once he's safe, the police will get your money back.
If you could just lend it to me for now,
I'll do everything you want until the day I die.
I'll make Shinichi work too.
Anything you want.
Stop it! Get up!
Damn it, stand up!
Please save Shinichi!
Stand up!
Please, stop it!
I want to pay, but I can't.
You don't understand.
I'm going, all right?
Wait.
Get up.
Please get up.
He won't let your son die.
I'll ask on your behalf.
Put your mind at ease.
It'll be all right.
Isn't Shinichi back yet?
Postpone Osaka until tomorrow.
I said we'll wait!
Then I'll return this for the time being.
Excuse me. I'm tired.
Pardon me, but could you
keep the curtains closed? 
Oh, sorry.
You all slept here?
No, the Bos'n and I...
Bos'n?
Bos'n is head of the detective squad.
In Yokohama, much of our work is connected with the harbor.
"Bos'n" fits him perfectly.
He's a real slave driver.
He dragged me out all last night.
You're the one who dragged me out.
Sneaking over walls, hiding until morning, not knowing if we're detectives or thieves.
Last night the chief set up a special investigation.
We can use the whole prefectural police force.
Also, though the kidnapper claims it isn't extortion, he's driven you into a corner.
He's exploiting your suffering, and that's "kidnapping for gain."
It's a maximum of 15 years' imprisonment.
His being in prison won't stop me from going under.
His deadline is today.
I thought it over all night.
This is my decision.
The boy's father wants me to lend him the money.
He says once his boy's safe, you'll get my money back.
But even if you guarantee me that,
I won't pay the ransom.
I'd get it back too late.
Without that money now,
I'll lose everything.
Please understand me.
This is who I am.
My work is a part of me.
I'd be as good as dead without it.
You may think it's heartless, but I refuse to pay.
That's not true. 
I know he'll pay.
Just stop it.
I won't... no, I can't pay, no matter what you say.
I told you why last night, yet still you persist.
Listen: You know what'll happen if I pay?
I'll be penniless... no, worse.
I'll be saddled with debt and forced out of the firm.
You'll be all right.
You can start over.
You don't know the first thing about poverty.
From the day you were born you've had big houses and cars, servants tending to your every whim.
Your whole life has been luxury.
Maybe I could start over, but you... never!
Yes, I could.
I don't care about luxury.
It's all you've ever known.
That's why you can tell me to pay 30 million yen.
It means nothing to you.
You're spoiled.
It's not that.
Don't you feel anything for poor Aoki?
Of course! It takes all my strength not to cave in to his begging.
I'd pay in a second if I could.
But I can't sacrifice everything for him.
There's you, and Jun, and my own survival.
This is ridiculous!
There are plenty of people richer than I am. Why me?
And at a time like this!
It would be suicide to pay.
Why should I?
I know.
But there's no other choice.
Aoki has nobody to ask but you.
I'm asking too.
So is Jun.
Enough! Nobody has the right to ask this of me.
That's final.
I'm not paying any ransom.
Kawanishi, you're just in time.
Take this check and get to Osaka.
Well, I've been thinking it over.
- What?
- About that check.
Whether I should take it or not.
You said there was nothing to think about!
Well, I was confused.
But just hear me out.
If I go to Osaka and close this deal, you'll take over
National Shoes.
But you'd be hated by the public for sacrificing a child!
You'd be ruined.
No one would buy your shoes.
That's enough!
You're not paid to think!
Stop arguing and go.
Please think this through.
Think how
Mrs. Gondo must feel.
After all, wasn't her dowry the basis of your fortune?
She has a say in this, and she wants you to pay.
And destroy myself?
I know how much this money means to you.
But a human life means more.
We're talking about a helpless child...
"Human life"?
"Helpless child"?
I've never heard such words from your lips.
What happened to the cold-blooded businessman?
When were you reborn?
What happened after you left last night?
Nothing happened. I just...
If my takeover succeeds, you'll be made a director.
Knowing that, you were ready to go last night, arguing with Reiko, bad-mouthing the cops, even pestering me.
Yet today...
You want to sabotage my takeover, don't you?
No. I just...
Answer me! If I pay the ransom, the deal goes up in smoke.
That's what you want!
What are you up to?
Shall I answer for you?
If this deal fails, so do l, and three men stand to celebrate.
Bastard, you sold me out to those three, didn't you?
Yes.
- You told them about Osaka?
- Everything.
Worthless scum!
Maybe I am.
But let me have my say.
You weakened last night... enough to pay the ransom.
What would happen to me then?
If I stake my life on you, I have nothing.
You'd be selling out your Ioyal servant of 10 years.
What I did was self-defense.
Get out!
I'll go.
But you'll be the next to hear those very words.
Baba and the Old Man are talking as we speak.
But I still have this, so I can still kick you all out.
I wonder.
Maybe the kidnapper's right.
You don't have the guts to let him die.
Get out!
Mr. Gondo.
I know it's late to be saying this... but you have the right to protect your own livelihood.
It's our duty to help you.
We want to save the child, but not by sacrificing you.
Still, we hope you'll do one thing:
When the kidnapper calls, say you'll pay.
You only have to say the words.
Just ask him when and where.
We'll take it from there.
Forgive me, boss.
I didn't realize how unreasonable my request was.
Please don't worry about Shinichi.
I think the kidnapper was just bluffing.
No human being could kill an innocent child.
Anyway, Shinichi is a clever boy.
I'm sure he'll find a chance to escape.
Where's Mr. Gondo?
Mr. Gondo! 
Phone! Hurry! 
Hello. This is Gondo.
Mr. Gondo, you're not
up to any tricks, are you? 
What do you mean?
Curtains closed in broad daylight. 
A first time. 
- You can see us?
- Quite well. 
You're on a hilltop. 
It's hot as hell down here. 
An inferno. 
Feels like 105 degrees. 
But you must be nice and cool
with your air-conditioning. 
I understand the closed windows, 
but why the drapes? 
What are you up to? 
Nothing.
Nothing? 
People always say that
when they're up to something. 
Then I'll open the drapes and prove it to you.
Good. I can see you now. 
Your wife, the chauffeur. 
Just the three of you? 
That's right.
Well, then, let's continue. 
Have you decided to pay, 
Mr. Gondo? 
I have no choice.
I'll pay.
And is the money ready? 
It will be by evening.
But only if the boy's unharmed.
- You heard him. 
- No, I want to see him.
- And if I refuse? 
- I won't pay. That's final.
Sounds fishy. 
Well, I'll think it over, 
Mr. Gondo. 
Stay there!
Be careful!
The kidnapper's watching.
Damn.
Just a little longer and I could've traced it.
Thank you, Mr. Gondo.
By saying you'd pay, you bought us more time.
Your demand was also very helpful.
If he accepts it, we can formulate a plan.
Bank of Tokyo?
This is Gondo of National Shoes.
The branch manager, please.
Yes, hello.
This is short notice.
Send over 30 million yen in cash.
No new bills, and no consecutive numbers.
Sorry to trouble you, but I need one thousand 10,000 notes, three thousand 5,000 notes, and five thousand 1,000 notes.
Yes, right away.
Thank you.
That's enough.
Don't say anything.
I don't know what to say.
Enough.
Leave me alone.
- What is it?
- Mom's crying.
Hello. This is Gondo. 
Mr. Gondo, you're not
up to any tricks, are you? 
I hear a coin dropping.
Check all the pay phones in this area.
The kidnapper's right.
One case holds 15 million yen.
What a sight, eh?
Hello. This is Gondo. 
Got the money? 
Yes, but... 
I accept your condition. 
You'll see the boy first. 
- When? 
- Tomorrow. 
We'll swap the boy
for the money. 
Where? 
Calm down and listen carefully. 
Get two briefcases, 
less than 2. 75 inches thick. 
The money should just barely fit. 
Close them tight but don't lock them: 
I want ready access. 
Take them on tomorrow's
Kodama No. 2 express train. 
Understood? That's all. 
- Where am I going? 
Get on and you'll see, 
Mr. Gondo. 
Bos'n,
I doubt he's dumb enough to make the exchange on the train.
Will he try a station?
That's risky, too.
I wouldn't try it if I were him.
Two briefcases under 2.75 inches thick.
What's that all about?
"Get on and you'll see."
Shit.
By the way, Bos'n... where should we hide these in the cases?
That's not a job for amateurs.
I'll call a specialist.
What do you need?
We want to find him with these briefcases.
We intentionally chose an unusual style.
They're so conspicuous, he'll have to get rid of them.
He'll have to bury them, sink them, or burn them.
If the powder in this capsule gets wet, it gives off a putrid smell.
The powder in this pouch emits a pink smoke when burnt.
It's not much to go on, but it just might give us a lead.
Reiko!
Would you find my old tool kit for me?
How long to record just the 1,000-yen notes?
At ten a minute, that's 5,000 in 500 minutes.
That's eight hours, 20 minutes.
Ten hours with breaks.
Isn't that a waste of time?
I never notice serial numbers.
We can't neglect any possible means of finding him.
When the boy's back safely,
I'll flush that rat out.
I'd burn him alive.
Fifteen years maximum?
To hell with that!
The capsule should go here, and the pouch goes there.
In the old days, shoemakers made cases too.
My training as an apprentice comes in handy once again.
It's like I'm starting over already.
He's really something.
I waste no love on the rich, since I grew up poor.
At first I despised him, but now...
Excuse me.
THE BO Y'S NOT ON THE TRAIN
This isn't a pleasure trip.
Railway Telephone Service
paging Mr. Kingo Gondo
of National Shoes. 
Please take your call
in the buffet car phone booth. 
- It's the kidnapper.
- What do we do?
The next stop is Atami.
Will they do the switch there?
Go get some coffee.
I'm Mr. Gondo.
Coffee.
We just passed Kozu.
Perfect. 
Listen carefully. 
You'll cross
the Sakawa River in two minutes. 
You'll see him
at the foot of the bridge. 
Coffee.
The boy's at the foot of the next bridge.
I'm to toss the money at the other side.
These windows don't open.
He said the washroom windows open 2.75 inches.
Son of a bitch!
That explains it!
There's no stop until Atami.
He'll get away clean.
The bastard thought of everything.
A real monster.
An emergency stop would endanger the boy.
He's got us from every angle.
There must be two of them: one with the kid, one to grab the money.
We'll get a glimpse.
Which side is the boy on?
- The left.
- You'll toss the cases from here?
Yes, from the washroom window.
We'll confirm it's the boy from here.
You all split up to take pictures.
Still photos on the left,
8mm in the front and rear.
The bridge is coming up.
Get a good look at the boy.
I only know him from photos.
It could be a switch.
Don't worry. I'm trading my life for that boy.
I won't make a mistake.
Shinichi!
Are you sure?
We can't rest until we find that kidnapper.
For Mr. Gondo's sake, be bloodhounds.
Can you see inside the living room?
This is the best view so far.
He may live around here.
But would he use a phone this close to home?
Let's try the next one.
The kidnapper's right.
That house gets on your nerves.
As if it's looking down at us.
CLEVER KIDNAPPER
USES EXPRESS TRAIN
RANSOM FOR DRIVER'S SON
IS 30 MILLION YEN
SHOE EXEC THROWS ENTIRE
FORTUNE OUT THE WINDOW
ALL POLICE UNITS MOBILIZED
Police say money was not
the kidnapper's only motive. 
His phone calls
have a taunting tone, 
suggesting extraordinary
hatred for Mr. Gondo. 
The kidnapper wanted
not only to steal money, 
but also to torment and ridicule
Mr. Gondo in the process. 
Yet Gondo's sacrifice
has not gone unnoticed. 
Words of sympathy have grown
into national acclaim for him. 
How will the kidnapper
react to this? 
If he's listening, 
I'll tell him this: 
Mr. Gondo is having
the last laugh! 
We learned from Shinichi that a woman held him.
Unfortunately, hats hid the faces of both the man and the woman, making identification impossible.
But their movements may provide important clues.
Watch carefully.
Well?
Any idea who they may be?
Don't hesitate to say if you have any idea.
Delivery boys, milkmen, gardeners, junk collectors, salesmen.
Try to remember everyone who's come through here.
This kind of thing might come to you suddenly.
Take your time.
Bos'n, the 8mm films are well shot, but not much help yet.
The figure is blurred in the photos, but they're helpful.
Look at this.
This is the accomplice.
See this tiny figure here?
That's a farmer leading a cow.
He gave us some useful information.
He saw a man with two briefcases run into the shadows here and then drive off.
We checked the area and found skid marks.
It seems he ran into a concrete railing, leaving behind paint scrapings.
By having them checked, we determined the following:
The car was a gray '59 Toyopet Crown.
This is the car you rode in, isn't it?
Yes.
- Can we go?
- Sure.
Shinichi, try harder to remember everything.
You were at a house with a view of the sea and Mt. Fuji?
What road did the car take from there to the river?
- I don't remember.
- Try harder, damn it!
What did you see from the car window?
Lots of things.
That's not good enough!
I'm asking you to try harder.
What did you see?
- I can't...
- Shinichi!
Aoki, stop this.
When you remember, kiddo, come tell us, okay?
Mr. Aoki, we know how you feel.
We feel the same way.
We're desperate to capture the culprit and return the money.
We owe Mr. Gondo at least that much.
Guests, sir. 
Anyway, Mr. Aoki, go easier on the boy.
Excuse me.
Shinichi's already recalled some key information.
They covered his face with gauze soaked in ether.
He went to a house with a view of Mt. Fuji and the sea.
Well, that's all for today.
Oh, one more thing.
We've received a mountain of mail.
Mr. Gondo went through a horrible experience, but everyone admires him.
That lifts our spirits a bit too.
You're a hero, and the public is very sympathetic, but what about
National Shoes?
A battle for ownership won't be pretty.
We hear your position is shaky.
Is that true?
Frankly, we're worried.
Sympathy costs nothing, but we've invested real money.
We have no sympathy for you.
As your principal creditors, we've reached a decision together.
We're returning the interest you sent yesterday to postpone paying us the principal.
Pay us in full when it falls due.
If you don't, we'll seize your collateral property.
Public opinion aside, Mr. Gondo, you can't pay a kidnapper and leave us footing the bill.
The Gondo residence is visible from Nishi Ward and parts of Naka Ward.
There are some places where changes in elevation, trees, or large structures block the view.
Those locations are shown with hatch lines.
The Gondo living room can be seen clearly with an ordinary telescope from any point within this circle.
It can also be seen from the inside of seven phone booths within this perimeter.
Those are indicated by these X marks.
Three of those seven allow a good view even when using a telescope while on the phone.
Those are indicated by these circled X marks.
We believe the suspect used one of these phones.
He also complained that it was very hot.
He called a little before 9:00 a.m.
We checked which booths receive
the most direct sunlight at that hour. 
Of these three,  this one is shaded in the morning.
So it is safe to assume that the suspect used one of the other two.
The recorded conversations suggest he was looking through the telescope while on the phone.
So we can narrow down his place of residence to this vicinity.
Judging from his voice, he's a young male.
But with the boy he wore a mask and dark glasses.
Not much to go on there.
Next we have a report on the railway phone.
You can only call the express train from Tokyo, Osaka or Nagoya.
The call is relayed by microwave, but with a long delay, so it was easy to trace the origin of the call.
Yurakucho 2-6,
Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo. 
A tobacco shop
near the train station. 
But the old lady at the shop had bad eyes and even worse hearing.
It was hopeless.
We asked around at all the shops in the vicinity, but no one could recall a man placing a call at the tobacco shop at that hour.
Next.
The boy mentioned
Mt. Fuji and the sea.
Any leads?
We had him draw a picture.
The call with the boy was a direct-dial local call.
Places with a view
of Mt. Fuji and the sea
where you can call Yokohama
without an operator
include Zushi, Fujisawa, 
Chigasaki and part of Kamakura. 
The sun in the picture appears to be setting.
This appears all along the coast.
Next, the ether.
It's not easy to trace back to a source.
Pharmacies don't carry it.
Hospitals and larger clinics buy it wholesale.
There is also industrial-grade ether, used in welding.
So it's too early to say the suspect is a doctor, pharmacist, or medical student.
Industrial-grade ether is used
in building ships, railroad cars
and automobiles, 
as well as in small iron works and repair shops.
That's all.
Next, the car.
The farmer said it had white plates, so it's privately owned.
Crooks generally don't use a family car, so I checked on stolen vehicles.
This month,
18 Toyopets were stolen.
However, 12 were recovered before the kidnapping.
That leaves six. Only one is gray, like our paint sample.
It was stolen the day before the kidnapping.
The license number... is Kanagawa SO3059.
Since the plates
may have been changed, 
Vehicle Theft is checking
all gray '59 Toyopets on the road. 
That's all.
Good.
Next, the 1000-yen notes.
We compiled a list of serial numbers
for tobacco shops, cafeterias, 
cafés and movie theaters. 
Goodwill for Mr. Gondo makes the owners eager to help, but none of the notes have turned up yet.
Next, reports from the public.
We've received
1,305 reports of sightings, only a few of which are from cranks.
All reported seeing men with boys of Shinichi's age, but many of the sightings occurred before he was kidnapped or after he was recovered.
And he was seen at the same time in places far removed from each other.
We're trying to corroborate the reports.
One promising report we received today was from a turnpike toll collector.
About 7:00 p.m. the night of the kidnapping, a man in dark glasses drove up.
A boy was sleeping under a blanket in the back seat.
The car was dark.
He couldn't see the boy's face, but he did notice a toy rifle and a cowboy hat.
The man was headed
toward Fujisawa. 
This is our best lead so far.
We're now reexamining all reports from that area.
Next, the railway connection.
The Kodama train's infrastructure
is not that different
from other express trains. 
The suspect is very familiar
with the system, 
but that doesn't necessarily mean
that he's a railroad man. 
We nonetheless ran a check
on all employees
with connections
to express trains who were absent during the kidnapping or had quit just prior to it, and those living in view of the Gondo home.
There were very few.
I'll have a final report tomorrow.
That's all.
Next, grudges or other motives.
I met today with the National Shoes executives.
What a bunch of assholes.
A grudge?
Inspector, you think we were behind the kidnapping?
Think we set it all up to get rid of Gondo?
That's absurd. We went that night to join forces with him.
On bended knee even.
- He almost did us in.
We had no idea of his plans until Kawanishi informed us.
Serves him right.
He was secretly buying stock to take over the company.
Then this incident comes along and ruins him.
I'd call it divine retribution.
It's not that I doubt you, but you've known
Mr. Gondo a long time.
I just wondered if there was anyone who might have held a grudge against him.
Where should we start?
We couldn't even name them all.
One more question.
The kidnapping occurred just after you left his home.
Did you notice anything near the gate?
A car, for instance, or a suspicious person?
Look here! He'd just thrown us out.
We weren't admiring the view.
They were no help.
But at the factory...
Mr. Gondo has a sharp temper for sure, but he also cares a lot about the work.
He's an excellent boss if you do a good job.
I doubt anyone here holds a grudge against him, except maybe the front office.
Here's what I think:
Nobody holds a grudge against Mr. Gondo... except the big shots.
They'd give the kidnapper a medal!
Taguchi, calm down.
Now for the results of this meeting.
Inspector Tokura.
So far, this case seems impossible to break.
But the criminal must be in these details.
Follow every lead through to the bitter end.
It may be fruitless, but when you're discouraged... think of what
Mr. Gondo's going through.
Take the boy tomorrow for a drive along the shore.
Cover every mile until you find this view.
If you can jog his memory, you may find the hideout.
It's Vehicle Theft.
Tokura speaking.
That's great news.
We'll be right there.
Don't touch anything.
They found the car.
Abandoned on a highway.
Call the crime-scene unit.
Have more men bunk at the station, with the rest on call.
It's spattered with mud, but there's been no rain lately.
It's actually dust combined with splashed water.
What's this?
- What's wrong?
- Everybody listen to this.
Hello. This is Gondo. 
The boy's fine. 
I'll let him talk to you. 
Daddy? Are you there? 
Hear that trolley?
So?
A trolley passes by the hideout.
Three lines pass through Zushi,
Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Kamakura: the JR, Odayaku and Enoshima lines.
Each has a distinctive sound. Maybe a specialist could tell which it is.
I'll be back.
Enoshima Rail?
You're sure?
You bet your boots.
I live right next to the tracks.
That sound isn't a pantograph trolley.
It's an old-style, single-pole trolley.
Only the Enoshima line uses those old lines nowadays.
Plus, their line has a lot of curves, and they use short rails with lots of joints.
Also, the wheelbase is narrow, so it goes... instead of...
Thank you very much.
Is Mr. Aoki in?
I'm sorry. He's out.
Is he at your husband's office?
No.
Where is he?
He took Shinichi for a drive.
He wants to jog Shinichi's memory to help find the kidnapper.
He just won't let up, will he?
Give him a break.
He feels he has to do something.
You're sure he let you out here?
- From which way?
- That way.
Watch carefully out the back as we go.
Tell me if you remember anything.
Now what?
We can't do anything without the boy.
My guess is Aoki will go to the Sakawa River.
Take the Tokaido Highway.
Daddy!
What?
Remember something?
I peed over there.
We're looking for Aoki. Once we have the boy, we'll head for the shore.
Hold on. 
I just got word from the lab. 
There's a lot of fish blood
and oil on the stolen car. 
They also found
mackerel scales and bonito. 
That's what was splashed
on the hood of the car. 
He drove through a lot of fish offal. 
It must've been at a fish market. 
The Koshigoe market
is the only one near that trolley. 
Take a look over there. 
We'll handle Aoki. 
Got it.
Around here we mainly catch bonito and mackerel.
But that's not enough to fill local demand, so we have other kinds trucked in from Tokyo.
Thanks. By the way, where does the Enoshima trolley run?
Under that bluff.
Does the view from there...
Iook anything like this?
Let's see.
You should be able to see
Enoshima Island from there.
But if you go further right, to the hill near the station... that cape is in front of Enoshima, with a view just like this.
You saw Enoshima Island, right?
You must have.
But we didn't come this way.
Bos'n, I feel we're getting closer.
Let's go up that hill.
Try not to look like a cop.
I'm not the problem.
You, on the other hand, would need plastic surgery.
Daddy!
I saw this tunnel!
What?
You passed by here?
From which direction?
That way.
Shinichi, is this the spot?
Hey, look at that.
Enoshima doesn't look like an island from here.
Let's head back.
They must have Aoki by now.
We'll wait at the fish market.
If the boy shows us the way, with any luck we'll raid the hideout tonight.
You got your pistol?
Of course. I'm not going after a madman with my bare hands.
Let's look around on foot.
That car!
That's Gondo's car.
Don't be stupid.
Stop playing detective.
When I pulled the car up this morning, Mr. Gondo said,
"Aoki, all we have now is time.
We're not going to the factory anymore."
He was smiling, but I know how he felt inside.
The directors are horrible men, but in the end it's all my fault.
That's why...
But walking around here with the boy is madness.
What if the kidnapper saw him?
Imagine the consequences.
Bos'n, he's gone!
Daddy!
Here it is!
Uncle and Auntie are sleeping.
Take the boy away.
They're dead.
Thanks for coming, everybody.
- Why the press conference?
- Yeah, what'd you find?
Inspector Tokura will fill you in.
However, we ask you not to print what you hear today.
Earlier today, two accomplices, one male, one female, were found dead.
Both from heroin overdose.
- An accidental overdose?
- I'll explain.
Their arms were covered with needle marks.
Both were long-term addicts.
It's unlikely that experienced addicts would misjudge the dosage.
Dealers, furthermore, don't sell heroin that pure.
Both died in bed, their heads resting on pillows.
Next to the pillows we found two empty packets, two syringes, and a cup of water, maybe to dissolve the heroin.
In addition, we found two unopened packets of heroin.
So they obtained four packets,
They took two right away and saved two for later.
These facts don't suggest suicide.
So then why did they die?
The heroin was unusually pure.
We analyzed the unused samples.
They were over 90% pure.
When heroin is smuggled in, its purity ranges from 70% to 95%.
Dealers cut it with glucose and hydrochloric procaine, down to a purity as low as 30%.
So a one-gram package contains only 0.3 grams of pure heroin.
What happens to an addict who takes heroin three times more pure?
An ingenious murder.
There's corroborating evidence.
We found a notepad in their room.
The top page bore impressions from scribblings made on the page above it.
Please observe.
It's been reconstructed and enlarged in this slide.
The agony of withdrawal can be clearly seen.
"Get us more dope.
Bring it fast.
If you don't, we'll spend the money.
We won't do what you say anymore."
Clearly, they tried to blackmail him.
- That's why he killed them?
- We're not 100% certain, but it certainly looks that way.
Was there money around?
We found 2,500 of Mr. Gondo's 1,000-yen notes.
The serial numbers matched.
The kidnapper may have figured that out too.
He gave them a share but made them wait to spend it.
We can gather that from the letter.
Have you identified the accomplices?
Caretakers of the villa.
We learned that from the villa's owner.
So you're close?
No, we're back to square one.
Of course,
Narcotics is doing its best.
They may provide us with valuable information, but the accomplices' deaths are a terrible blow to the investigation.
The thread leading back to the kidnapper has been cut.
That's why I'm asking you:
Don't print a word of this.
Why not?
The kidnapper has yet to confirm that they're dead.
We know this because if he had returned to the villa, he wouldn't have left 2.5 million yen in evidence lying around.
As far as he knows, they may still be alive.
If we nurse that doubt within him, how will he react?
If he is the killer, he'll probably try to kill them again.
If there's no report of their deaths in the papers, he won't be able to stay put.
He'll surely return to the scene to check.
- And you'll nab him then?
- That's right.
Even if we keep quiet, won't their deaths be impossible to hide?
The neighbors will talk.
That's not a problem.
It's a new development with few houses.
It's also the off-season, so hardly anybody's there.
Drug addicts are cautious.
They kept to themselves and had no visitors.
But will our keeping quiet really convince the kidnapper?
Well, that's why
I have another favor to ask.
I'd like you to run a story today saying one of the 1,000-yen notes was spent.
Of course you can say it's our announcement.
I know it's a lot to ask.
I'm asking your cooperation for Mr. Gondo's sake too.
Did you know he was dismissed from National Shoes and kicked out as factory manager?
That's terrible.
They seem to have no sense of public opinion.
At the next shareholder meeting, he'll be voted out completely.
In place of an article reporting the deaths, shall we slam
National Shoes?
Why not? Let's give 'em a good thrashing!
GONDO FORCED OUT
PUBLIC OPINION IGNORED
WOMEN START BO YCOTT
OF NATIONAL SHOES
RISING TIDE
OF SYMPATHY AND ANGER
1,000-YEN NOTE
FROM RANSOM FOUND
30 MILLION IN RANSOM
IN BRIEFCASES LIKE THIS
We've recovered 2.5 million from the accomplices.
We can hand it over at the station, if it's not too much trouble.
We're sorry that it's so little.
No, it's a great help now.
We believe the kidnapper hasn't spent any yet.
We hope to recover it all intact.
The twist is that he's harder to catch if he doesn't spend it.
Kingo, 
Mr. Kawanishi is here. 
Kawanishi?
What does he want?
He has some kind of request.
- We'll be leaving then...
- No, stay. Send him in.
Please, help yourself.
Sorry I haven't been in touch.
Well, look who's here!
I must thank both of you.
You've made Mr. Gondo a hero.
That was a great help.
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't be so cold.
I was your right-hand man for over ten years.
Did you think I would stand by while they booted you out?
I risked my own position to try to keep you on.
But the Old Man's stubborn, and the executive director's a viper.
It was a hard-fought battle.
Fortunately, public opinion's on your side, so I convinced them to keep you on.
Get out!
Tell this to your new masters:
You can't trot me out to ease the public's anger.
I refuse to be an ornament, an executive without power.
I won't be your puppet.
Can you afford to bluff like that?
You're going too far.
Right now you have nothing but debts.
It may be a position in name only, but your credit will be intact.
Get out!
I'm still the man I've always been, even more so.
But you're nothing, not even a human being.
Excuse me.
I'd like you to see something.
What is it?
It's nothing much, but the last picture seemed to be of some help.
Shinichi drew it.
He says it's the kidnapper.
Dark glasses and a mask.
Not much to go on.
What's this?
A handkerchief.
He always wore it.
Mom!
Look at the pretty pink smoke from that chimney.
You lit the incinerator around 9:00 a.m., right?
Yes, every day I burn the trash from the day before.
What do you burn?
Dirty stuff, junk that you can't disinfect.
They're always bringing stuff that won't burn, damn it!
- Who is?
- Handymen and janitors.
Anyone else?
Sometimes hospital nurses and attendants.
Anyone like that come by today?
Come to think of it, a man brought a cardboard box.
- How big?
- Like this.
- Anyone you know?
- No.
An intern maybe.
A young medical intern?
Sure looked that way.
Too young to be a regular doctor.
"Burn this, pops," he said.
Doctors don't call people "pops."
- Anyone else?
Who'd wanna come to a place like this?
Now why'd they bring...
You can't burn tin!
Do you know what department that intern is in?
How would I know?
But he was headed toward Internal Medicine.
Thanks a lot.
According to Bos'n's report, his name is Ginjiro Takeuchi.
An intern.
He took three days off during the kidnapping.
He lives in a studio apartment at 4-278 Sengen-cho in Nishi Ward.
Sunrise Apartments, No. 12.
His room faces north, right at the Gondo residence.
One of the two phones that we suspect the kidnapper used is right next to his apartment.
The male and female accomplices had been examined at his hospital.
Takeuchi wrote up their charts.
Both had pulmonary edema, a result of their drug addiction.
So we have two addicts suffering from pulmonary edema, as well as from withdrawal.
An injection of pure heroin would cause death from shock.
As their intern, he would have known that.
We may conclude that he is the kidnapper.
But we can't arrest him.
Here's why:
If we arrest him now, he'll only get 15 years.
Mr. Gondo, on the other hand... is serving a life sentence of debt for paying the ransom.
We won't let that happen.
A criminal like this deserves capital punishment.
What's more, it's clear he killed his accomplices.
But if we arrest him now, we'll have no material evidence to prove it.
There's only one way to bring this vicious criminal to justice:
Leave him at large to reenact his crime.
But how?
By giving him this.
Please lower the blinds.
GIVE US MORE DOPE.
WE'LL TALK IF YOU DON'T.
A perfect forgery.
You Mr. Takeuchi?
He'll make his move today.
First, he'll go buy the heroin.
Then he'll try to kill them tonight.
There's no way to predict anything else: where he'll go, how he'll get the drugs.
We can only know that by keeping him in our sights.
Listen carefully:
Don't let him notice you, but don't lose him.
Bos'n, Nakao, Arai and I will head to the hideout as soon as we hear he's obtained the drugs.
I'll give orders from the car radio.
Is he waiting for a dealer?
Just killing time, I'd say. 
He's walked up and down
this street for two hours. 
If the same people keep tailing him, 
he may catch on. 
Inspector!
Yes. Tokura here.
He went into a florist's. 
A florist's?
Have someone buy some flowers.
I'm afraid none of us fits the part. Wait...
What?
One carnation?
Yes. One red carnation. 
Is today Mother's Day?
Earlier, the suspect spoke on a pay phone.
He was told how to find the dealer.
The red carnation must be a sign.
Watch for anybody
approaching the suspect. 
Watch how the money and dope change hands.
Inspector Tokura! 
Tokura speaking.
- He changed his course. 
- What?
He got out at "Dope Alley. '
So he didn't actually buy any in the club?
We're sure he did, but... 
Okay, we're turning back.
Don't lose him!
What are you staring at?
This ain't a picture show.
Get the hell out!
This ain't no place for the likes of you.
Lotta strangers snoopin' around tonight. Be careful.
What are you, a cop?
We don't know any of you.
Get out.
Get out, I said!
Bos'n, I don't understand what he's up to.
He should be taking the dope straight to the hideout.
And why go to the junkies if he hasn't got it yet?
They don't have any pure heroin.
- Inspector! 
- Tokura here.
He picked up a junkie
and took her to a flophouse. 
KOGANE-CHO INN
I've got it!
He'll use her as a guinea pig.
She's in withdrawal, and he can test it on her.
- He left the area. 
- And the girl?
Just a minute. 
Two men went to check. 
Where to now?
The hideout?
Wait a minute. The girl's a clue to what he'll do next.
He's headed
toward the Isezaki district. 
What? We're there right now.
From which side?
Facing Yoshida Bridge, 
the left side. 
- Stop here.
- It's a no-parking zone.
It doesn't matter.
I've just received word: 
The girl's dead. 
Syringe in her hand. 
Death by overdose. 
He's coming.
We found him.
I'm cutting off the radio.
The guy's a real prize.
To the hideout.
Excuse me, you can't stop here.
It's 12:15 a.m. 
Hey, I brought the stuff.
Takeuchi, you're gonna hang!
We've recovered another 27,480,000 yen.
All that's missing is the 20,000 he spent on heroin.
We wanted to let you know as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Were we too late?
Have a seat.
Please.
No, please. You're free to use them until the auction.
SEIZED PROPERTY
GINJIRO TAKEUCHI
GETS DEATH SENTENCE
Thank you for coming.
He refused to talk with the prison chaplain.
He insisted on speaking to you instead.
Mr. Gondo, thanks for coming.
You seem well.
What are you doing now?
Making shoes again.
It's a small company, but the owner gives me free rein.
I'm working hard to rival National Shoes.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm going to die, but I'm not afraid, so stop looking at me so pitifully.
That's why I refused to see the chaplain.
He'd tell me to repent and pray for mercy.
Why should I waste my time?
I'd rather be told the cruel truth than be fed gentle lies.
Speaking of which, you must be glad I'm going to die.
Aren't you?
Why do you say such things?
Why do you think we have to hate each other?
I don't know.
I'm not interested in self-analysis.
But I do know my room was so cold in winter and so hot in summer
I couldn't sleep.
From my tiny room, your house looked like heaven.
Day by day I came to hate you more.
It gave me a reason for living.
Besides, it's amusing to make fortunate men taste the same misery as the unfortunate.
Were you really so unfortunate?
You want my life story?
Forget it.
I won't share my tales of woe to earn your sympathy.
I'm just glad my mom died last year, so I won't be sickened by her pathetic slobbering.
Then why exactly did you call me here?
I couldn't stand having you think
I died crying and afraid.
You think I'm shaking out of fear, but I'm not!
It's just a physiological reaction from being in solitary too long.
Just leaving the cell makes me shake.
I'm not afraid of death.
I don't care if I go to hell.
My life has been hell since the day I was born.
But if I had to go to heaven, then I'd really start to tremble.

- I must go.
- Already?
Stay a bit longer.
I'd be confined to barracks.
- Aren't I worth it?
- I have to go.
See you.
Let's go to the Green Parrot!
- I'd rather go home to bed.
- How about Pigalle?
- But where in Pigalle?
- Let's go at once.
- I'll get a taxi.
- Get two!
- I'm going home.
- Me, too.
- Why not come for the ride?
-  I'm fed up. Come on. Let's go.
- Good night.
- Good night .
The most gorgeous nudes in Paris!
The most gorgeous nudes in Paris!
They're nice, stupid.
- Isn't that like ours?
- No.
The most gorgeous nudes in Paris!
Good evening ladies.
I'm Marcel and this is my friend, Albert.
Albert, let me introduce...
No? I'll try again.
I'm Marcel and this is my friend, Albert. Albert, meet...
Where are your manners?
What's your name?
Well, a little bird might tell me.
Francoise? Sophie?
Louise? Susanne?
Jeanne?
I knew it· Albert, her name is Jeanne.
Don't I get a reward?
Leave us alone!
It did the trick. She answered!
But go easy.
And what's your name?
Ask your little bird!
A true Parisian girl!
Witty and everything.
Please be polite.
Be polite.
May we see you home?
- You're doing it.
- We don't mean any harm.
Take the number of my car.
My passport.
Look, I'm a householder.
Come on. Get in.
What's the harm?
We'll treat you to a nice dinner!
Don't mess up now.
Be polite. 
Then off to bed!
- Is that you?
- Yes, it's me.
Don't judge by the face?
How about it?
- Hold on.
- Everything above board.
- Think they'll buy it?
- Sure, but go easy.
- All right. We'll get in.
- Bravo!
Ladies...
But we can get out quick!
No Fear!
Go on! Here we go!
What is it?
What?
- Your car.
- Where are we going?
Don't worry about it.
You there, what's your name?
Jacqueline.
Jacqueline. What's the difference between a flying pan and a chamber pot?
Don't know?
Then, I would hate to eat at your place!
That kills me.
That must be warm.
Give me another one.
My name isn't Jeanne.
- It's Jane.
- Oh, yes, Jeanne.
Not J.E.A.N.N.E., but J.A.N.E.
Why?
Ask my mother.
I hate seeing it written as Jeanne.
The, I'll watch my spelling when I write to you.
Listen...
You do make me laugh,
Monsieur Marcel.
Monsieur Marcel is so funny.
Why Monsieur Marcel?
Call me just Marcel!
You don't mind?
Not at all.
No need for formality!
Should we tell all
Jacqueline?
If the mood takes you. 
Now, we're all good friends.
All this Madame La Baronne and Madame La Duchesse stuff...
...turns me off.
So it's Albert and Jacqueline.
Marcel and Jane.
Let's drink to that!
To our smart little Parisians!!
To the eternal feminine!
You.
Drink up, Jane!
No more after this.
So you say.
You you.
There we go.
D'you drink?
Excuse me.
I have to go somewhere.
Where's the ladies' room?
At the back and to the right.
All this drink!
It has to go somewhere.
That's life.
Now the Farondale!
Stand up for the Farondale.
Take your partners.
Stop. Stop. Finished.
And now anatomically daring as ever...
...that bewitching...
...teasing threat...
...to domestic bliss...
We give you... Dolly Bell!!
Stop that!
Damn it!
Don't be like that!
- You're a pain!
- I got carried away.
- Don't do it again!
- Drink and make up!
Take it easy, will you?
- That does it!
- I didn't mean to.
- What do you take me for?
- It slipped out.
Let's go, Jacqueline.
He was only kidding.
Hands off, then!
- Friends again?
- All right. If you behave.
Here's a big kiss.
And another one.
See that?
What?
The guy with the motorbike.
Waiter!
We'll wear it.
Waiter!
Charge all this to me.
Drop me off here.
- Don't be silly.
- You'll get picked up.
- Yes, you will.
- No I won't, I live across the street.
I'm tired.
Boo!
Goodbye.
See you tomorrow, Jane.
- Til tomorrow.
- Goodnight gentlemen.
- A bit stuck up, isn't she?
- She's waiting for a true love.
Where are we going?
- Albert's place.
- I don't want to.
- Just for some champagne.
- Come on. You'll upset Albert.
- I'm getting crazy.
- I'm a psychologist. Get out.
I can manage myself.
One of you is enough.
- Can he leave us alone?
- Let him be. He's harmless.
What do you want, both of you?
What are you doing you idiot?
Go easy, Marcel. Easy.
Up already?
It's half past seven.
We're late.
I'll make coffee.
Did you sleep here?
Yes.
If anyone asks, tell them I did.
Hurry up, Ginette.
We'll be late.
- You don't look so hot.
- I'm tired.
Let's go. Quick.
Doing good, Madame Louise?
- Good morning ladies.
- Good morning.
- Is he in a good mood?
- I don't know. I just got here.
You're late on your first day!?
-Is Mr...
- We opened at 8am.
Come with me, please.
Take off your coat, young lady.
Hello. Hello.
Sit down.
It's five past nine.
- I was just about to tell you...
- Say no more.
At my age, I take pleasure in reprimanding little girls.
You arrive late on the first day in my employment.
But I won't insist.
Other less audacious girls, less modern miss, no doubt...
...might have been troubled at being even a minute late.
As for you...
...as I said, I won't insist.
If I note the time...
...it is because it marks your entry into life, my child.
You work now.
You can only depend yourself.
You are now a woman and a charming one.
Allow me to congratulate you and to present you with a flower.
The flower you once threw me...
Are you ambitious, my dear?
Yes.
Is it your dearest wish to succeed?
Oh, yes.
I'm glad to hear it. Then,
I'll tell you our terms of employment.
Any items broken...
...light bulbs, sockets, fluorescent tubes, or whatever...
...will be replaced at your expense.
I permit no exception.
You must show deference to Madame Louise, the cashier.
In your dealings with sales representatives and delivery men...
...you will be courteous, but distant...
...distant, my dear child.
As to domestic appliances...
...vacuum cleaners, refrigerator, hot plates...
...all types of record player, etc...
...an inventory must be taken each evening before closing.
- Hello ladies.
- Hello Manou.
I'll deliver your order this afternoon.
- Without faults?
- Without faults.
Well, see you later.
Hey!!
- What?
- Come here Manoush.
- It's always for that.
- Like hell!.
My work brings me here.
Twice a day?
- Don't tease him, Rita.
- He's a nice boy.
Very nice.
Listen...
- No whispering.
- Cut it out, please!
Not at all, honestly.
Goodbye Manou.
Goodbye Manou.
Goodbye.
Seventeen minutes to twelve.
- In 17 minutes, we can go.
- It's a long time, 17 minutes.
- Jacqueline...
- Hmm...
...what do you want out of life?
Love!
Don't forget money.
I'm ambitious.
And you, Ginette?
A man. And mind your own buusiness.
- And you, Jane?
- Same as Ginette.
How about Madame Louise?
Like Jane, I say love; true, constant, lasting love.
Do men expect as much of us?
Don't talk about them.
- Let's go.
- Where?
Feeding time!
It's too early.
Mr. Belin might see us.
Ginette...
Ginette, I'm afraid.
Don't ask why.
I won't tell you.
See you later.
Not eating with us?
Henri is introducing me to his parents.
So it's the big day!
Will you be at the zoo later?
No time.
Henri's invited us all out tonight.
Maybe to the Music Hall. You free?
- I can't go.
- I can. Jacqueline?
And you, Jacqueline?
Me, too.
There's no free table.
- Yes there is over there.
- It's next to Rita.
- It's my friends.
- Don't you like them?
Oh yes. They are nice.
Hamburger and fries.
Steak and fries...
I'll have the radishes and a steak.
- Me too.
- Me too.
- Chateaubriand for you?
- No. We ordered fish.
Chateaubriand for you?
Listen to me my dear Margerite.
Watch your diction when you talk to Dad.
Don't you have a more suitable blouse?
It's my best.
Act as if you knew a bit about music and the arts.
Talk about Michaelangelo, for example...
- That's it... Michaelangelo.
- Ok.
Hamburger.
Better say your father is an foreman.
Foreman.
Try to appear up on wines and cuisine.
He's a gourmet. Dad always has the Surprise for dessert.
- So order that.
- A Surprise.
Mom's a bit old fashioned about marriage. She has illusions.
Something you didn't talk about in her day.
So watch it.
- Ok.
- Get the idea?
Yes, yes...
Here they are.
Don't forget the Surprise... and Michaelangelo.
- You know who he was?
- He was a Renaissance painter.
Painter, sculptor, architect, poet...
Italian of the 16th century.
Known for his breadth of vision!
Noted for St Peter's in Rome, the Sistine Chapel, Moses
David, The Creation of the world... and so on. Stand up.
Mom!
I hope you haven't been waiting long.
I would have worn it under my glove, but it was too big.
Mom, Dad, this is Rita.
- Miss.
- Miss.
Is that your first name?
Yes, Sir.
- Are you Spanish?
- No, Madam.
A nickname, no doubt.
Yes, Madam.
Ready to order?
- Just an omelet.
- With truffles.
- Not tinned are they?
- In this establishment...
I'm in the business.
For dessert, today's special?
No. I'll have the Surprise.
We're out.
Now what?
I'm meeting Andre at the monkey house.
- Look inside!
- They are priceless.
Careful. Careful.
You'll fall.
They could do with a wash.
- Dirty beasts!
- They feed off corpses.
- That's harmless enough.
- You think so.
I don't bury them. Come on.
Let's go and find Andre.
Hyenas.
Andre!
I love you.
Hello Ginette. 
Hello Jacqueline.
Aren't they cute?
Aren't they beautiful?
- I've got bananas for them.
- Give me one.
- Look.
- That one.
Take it.
A little one for each.
- He's like the pope.
- A little one for each.
Ah look at the big one.
- Hello Papa.
- Now who does he remind me of?
Take.
Look at them!
It's a kagu.
It's very rare. Listen.
The kagu, peculiar to New Caledonia...
...much hunted for its plumage is almost extinct.
Despite the wing development...
...the bird is poor in flight...
...but can run very fast.
Its cry resembles the bark of a dog.
It doesn't look very rare.
- A let down.
- What they spend money on!
What a scene.
Oh, look, a... rat!
- It's a sand fox, silly!
- Look at the rat.
Little one. Little one.
- Don't look around.
- It's him.
He's here watching you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Sure.
That one doesn' look so good.
They've all got baths.
- That one's shedding his skin.
- He's crumbled.
This one bites...
I hope the glass is good and strong.
I'll protect you, darling.
Cmon let's go on.
- What a smell!
- Disgusting.
What's up dumpy?
- He looks fierce.
- Could you go in there, Andre?
The keepers do, don't they?
- You wouldn't look so happy.
- I've seen worse.
Assasin.
Careful.
That's a dangerous animal.
You're talking rubbish.
Hello.
Great big darling pussycat.
He's a darling, a darling a darling, a darling...
Madame Louise!
Hello Manou.
- I've got your bulbs.
- More of these bulbs?
- How are things?
- Things are ok.
- Business good?
- Ok.
Can you sign here please?
Thank you.
Here you are.
Madame Louise, won't you show us your fetish?
Oh, no.
Be a sport, Mom Louise.
Go on.
Satisfy our curiousity.
No. I'm waiting for a special occasion.
- Right now, we're just bored.
- What is it anyway?
No. It's not a fetish, it's a souvenir.
- A pressed flower?
- A letter?
- A man's sock?
- I'm not saying anything.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Good bye.
- Good bye.
I'll wait for you in the porch opposite.
- What is it?
- Come with me.
Come out with me tonight?
- No.
- Why not?
No means no.
That's all I've heard today.
I do like you.
But you love someone else, right?
- Yes.
- Who is he?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
We've never spoken.
How come you love him?
It's difficult to explain, but that's how it is.
I just do.
He's been following me around...
...but hasn't dared approach me.
What a jerk!
Any worse than you?
Being shy doesn't mean you're stupid.
Will you please come,
Madame Ginette?
Think she's having it off with the boss?
That old ape!
Don't be silly.
She goes off alone every evening.
So she's up to something.
Don't you know what?
It's none of my business.
- She must have a boyfriend.
- Why shouldn't she?
It's a mystery.
Like Madame Louise's fetish.
It's not the same.
If she had someone, she would be happy.
She seems so disillusioned with life.
How naive you are!
Didn't your ears burn?
- What?
- Rita was wondering...
...where you go in the evenings.
- Is it any of her business?
- I meant no offense.
Miss Jacqueline, one minute, please.
What's got into him today?
He's subjecting us all to an examination of conscience.
Sales must increase in proportion to production.
That's why
I have sales girls...
...who are more than sales girls, my dear.
He's here!
- Can you knock?
- He's here!
- Who?
- The motorcyclist!
- He's gone.
- Where to?
Looked in and took off.
- Embrace, repeat.
- Abbraccio. - No!
Is Venice nice, Madame Louise?
I can hardly remember anymore.
- Madame Louise...
- Yes?
You wanted a special occasion to show your fetish.
Please do it as a favor to me.
- No but...
- Wait.
Perhaps, it'll bring me luck.
A special occasion for me.
- You won't tell anyone.
- Of course I won't.
I wonder if I should though.
It's very special thing, you know.
You don't want to?
I didn't say that.
Don't rush me.
I do it because you're in love.
I hope it'll bring you happiness.
You are too young to have heard of Weidman.
A sadist...
...who robbed and killed women.
At 6 am on June 16th, 1939, he was guillotined at Versailles.
I was just a girl then.
He was so pale and handsome.
Crowds came to watch, even climbing the trees.
When the blade fell...
...the body jerked convulsively.
Women cried out, but...
...I rushed to soak my hanky in the blood.
Excuse me...
Do you know the time, please?
- Five to seven.
- Thank you.
You can go, Sylvie.
Hold on... first call my wife and say I'm having dinner with...
Leplatin, the scrap merchant.
And be on the dot at nine tomorrow morning.
Cheese, butter, cream...
Will that be all?
- Yes for today.
- Checkout!
- That's 12.50 madam.
- May I go, Monsieur Henri?
Two minutes.
I have you now, cursed woman!
- Are you in love with your fiancée?
- Of course I am.
How did he manage that?
He's well read, good family, different from the rest.
Besides he loves me.
He loves me.
Pray we don't get a customer.
Wake up! It's seven.
- Already seven?
- You bet it's seven.
Have a nice evening,
Madame Louise.
- What are we going to do?
- I have to go.
Where to?
- Never mind where.
- Where?
Wouldn't you like to know?
More mystery.
I see enough of you during the day at work.
In the evening 
I want to stay alone.
- We were only teasing.
- Sure. I see you.
You're even worse outside than at work.
I'm in a hurry. Ciao Bambini.
See you tomorrow.
- So?
- So, let's go.
- Look at all the cars.
- Yes, it's awful.
They won't be able to move soon.
Does your boyfriend's invitation still hold?
Yes. Eight thirty at the box office.
I'll go and change.
Bye.
Have you seen?
Let's go quick.
You, you, you, you.
When at home, I should fear.
You, you you, you.
Your voice is all I hear.
You, you, you, you.
Beneath the laurels just the two of us.
You, you you,
My whole being yearns for you.
You, you you, you.
Should my heart be cold as snow?
You, you you, you.
Your gentleness soon melts my woe.
In those depths where dreams lie.
Happiness will never die.
Because of you.
Come into my arms.
You, you you, you.
- Who is he?
- Miguel Santos.
- Never heard of him.
- Don't you know anything?
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Miguel is quite overcome.
I assure you.
Let me now present
Charlie Boston and his cadets...
...offering you an electrifying rhythm with dynamism. Charlie Boston and his Cadets.
I'm absolutely delighted to be with you again here...
After our triumphant
American tour.
Let me introduce my cadets.
Here, for you, is Town Girl!
I can't do it.
What's the matter?
What's wrong my dear?
- They're here.
- Who?
The girls I work with.
- What can I do?
- Calm down. What is it?
What's up with her?
Why is she blubbering?
People she knows are here.
Hurry and get ready.
You're on in three minutes.
You can do it. 
I like singing here, but I can't...
Why?
I couldn't bear them knowing.
They'll never stop ragging me.
You just don't know...
It's a real hell.
Being with them all day from nine to seven.
And I live at Jane's.
It's the only respite I get.
I love singing, really...
...but if they see me,
I'm finished.
That's all very well but just get yourself ready. Move it now.
No real artist ever missed her cue.
Oh women...!
- He's a hot stuff, Charlie Boston.
- Don't be common, please.
Now my dear friends, if I may describe you all as our happy family here...
...let me introduce the celebrited Italian singer...
...Angela Torini!
With music by Ffanco Baldoni and lyrics in French by Claude Avenue.
"As Soon As You Left."
As soon as you left me alone,
I never thought of anything but finding you again.
I wandered the night.
Seeking your light.
Heavy was the burden of the grief I bore.
An order of love.
One love to last for evermore.
I tried all I knew 
But I couldn't forget.
Searching in hidden corners.
Should you come back my love, to me.
Your faithful hound I will be.
You my lord in mastery.
One love to last for evermore.
One love to last for evermore.
One love to last for evermore.
- Hey...
- What?
That's Ginette!
From work?
I can't believe it.
It's fantastic.
Well, well...
Good evening.
Can you let me pass that's my child?
- Allow me to congratulate you.
- No. It was awful.
Not at all. Not at all.
- Will you dine with me?
- Leave me alone!
See?
What did I say?
I'm sure none of them recognized you.
If they did...
...I'll die.
- I don't think so.
- Finally see.
They'll come rushing.
Come on.
She said nothing, so we shouldn't butt in.
- Oh yeah?
- Let's be respectful.
Don't be so sensitive!
She'll never know we recognized her.
Come on. It'll be fun.
She wasn't so bad.
Where's Ginette?
There there Ginette!
- Don't be so grim.
- There's no need.
You were really good.
Let's celebrate.
By doing what?
- It's almost ten.
- So what...
I have an idea!
You look just fine.
You put on weight in a sedentary job.
You're big, not fat.
No! I'm not.
I'm fat.
Come on.
The place is packed with girls.
I'm going to get a towel.
Relaxing, isn't it?
Plenty of choice!
What a choice.
Hello miss.
What did I tell you?
Oh look there!
Look who's here!
- Where?
- There.
- Who?
- Look.
- It's those same girls.
- That's really fantastic.
Let's go and say hello.
- So we meet again?
- We seem to meet everywhere.
That's luck.
It's not my fault.
- Hello miss.
- Hello.
Won't you introduce us?
Ginette.
Ginette, Albert.
Very Honoured, Honore de Balzac!
Pleased to meet you.
Rita, Marcel.
You're Rita?
- Henri, Marcel and Albert.
- Honoured to meet you.
Well, what are you all doing tonight?
What are you doing tonight?
- We're with this gentlemen.
- Don' worry.
We won't take them away.
Enjoying yourself?
Coming in?
- No. I just got out.
- You're too young to be lazy.
Come on Jane!!
No, I said no.
I'll settle for Albert, then.
Come on, Albert.
Listen?
Agreed?
Let's go.
In with her!
What did you do that for?
All of them in now!
Look what you did to me!
Bastard.
Bastards!
Leave them alone. It's...
That's not allowed!
Not allowed...
Attention, help!
Shut up!
You silly boy!
That's enough!
- You... imagine we'd let you off?
- Get away!!
Go on be nice.
- You fool!!
- You making trouble too?
You shut up!
- No I didn't say you could go.
- Are you hurt me.
Did I hurt you?
I didn't mean to, darling.
I'll kiss and make it better.
Stay in the water.
- That's enough.
- There Ginette will you help?
Leave her alone.
Can't one have fun?
My apologies, lady.
I didn't know we offended you.
Excuse me.
Look she floats.
- Leave her alone.
- Mind your own business.
- Take it easy.
- I'll bust him one!
Leave her I said.
Otherwise I'll hurt you.
Don't tell me what to do.
I didn't touch anyone.
I'm a respectable, hard working citizen!
Not everyone can say the same.
Thank you, Sir.
No need for thanks.
My name is Andre.
I'm Jacqueline.
Jacqueline Duberg.
Andre La Pierre.
Thanks a lot.
- You scared them away.
- Thank you.
Listen, thanks mister.
- Ginette, Mr Andre.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you
- Jane.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
Rita.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
Henri.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
Are you happy?
Yes, Andre.
Do you love me?
You're rushing things.
After all, we only met last night.
What?
After all, we only met last night.
Why were you following me?
- Because I like you.
- I saw you everywhere.
Are you so shy?
I'm waiting for a special occasion.
And you?
- Do you love me?
- Of course.
Or I wouldn't have followed you.
- That proves nothing.
- It wasn't easy...
...following someone.
It's complicated. It takes time.
I did it because I love you.
Can I tell you something?
A second.
If you want to.
I want to tell you.
It got me worried...
...wondering what you wanted...
...where you found the time.
- Don't you work?
- Yes.
I'm mechanic.
I start a new job next week.
I saw you everywhere.
I didn't dare hope...
For what?
...that you were following me...
...because you loved me.
I adore your neck.
- Why especially?
- It's so long and slender.
The way you hold it, too.
You're delicate and graceful.
That's what I love.
And so serious.
Not like all these brainless girls.
Shall we start?
- Careful, don't hurt yourself.
- Not at all.
But, stop it!
Watch this.
That's not so funny.
I'm surprised at you.
Excuse me.
You sometimes forget you're with a girl.
Do you truly love me?
Truly.
Do you trust me?
Yes.
Yes, but...
- What?
- It's complicated.
I was following you...
We were looking for each other...
...but suppose love wasn't the reason.
I don't understand.
Suppose for instance...
I don't know how to put it.
- You don't love me.
- It's not that.
I think you maybe are too trustful of people who follow you.
You tell ME that.
I'm not as stupid as you think.
What would you have wanted with me?
I have nothing.
No money. Nothing.
So?
What else is there?
Love.
Shall we go?
Impressive, isn't it?
These great trees.
The sky seen through them...
...the silence...
You can't help thinking of the creator.
Let's go there.
- It's all thorns.
- There's a path.
It's not very nice.
I love mysterious places.
- André.
- What?
Is that how you love me?
If I read you right, you needn't worry.
Oh, my stocking.
I'm cold.
THE END
Hello?
Hi Kit, this is Libby Mannering.
Hi Lib.
What are you doing tonight?
Hmm, nothing, what did you have in mind?
My mother and father are going away.
How lucky can you get?
Overnight, they'll be gone till tomorrow.
Are they leaving you alone?
Well no, they're getting a babysitter for Tess, my sister.
Don't they trust you?
Well sure they do, but you know how parents are.
Listen can you come for dinner and then spend the night?
I don't know about all night, my father's awfully peculiar.
Oh, so is mine.
But I can handle him.
Try it Kit, we'll have a lot of fun.
Okay, I'll ask him and call you right back.
Hello?
Lib?
Hi Kit, can you come?
Just for dinner, I can't stay overnight.
Did you tell your father my parents were going away overnight?
Yeah I goofed.
That's why he said no.
Well maybe if I talked to him.
I'm very persuasive.
You don't know my father.
But at least I can come for dinner.
He'll drive me over, how do we get there?
You live out in the wilderness.
It's not that bad, it's easy really.
You go about 15 miles past the gas station on Elm, then you turn right on Tompkin Street, you keep going right until you pass the railroad tracks, and then you turn left and go for about six miles.
You come to a red barn, and you pass...
Tess, Tess!
Oh you little fool.
You're supposed to be sick.
You come in the house this minute, do you hear me?
How can you play outside with the thermometer in your mouth?
You little idiot, wait until
I tell Mommy you went outside.
Don't tell her.
Stop talking.
You can't take anybody's temperature while they're running around.
Don't you know that silly, now sit there.
If there's a fever, it's mine, I'll read it.
Supposing you make a mistake?
I won't, you start at the top, count back to the red line.
106, 10s, 104.
I'm normal, I'm a normal person.
Oh that's your opinion.
Mother? Mother?
Yes?
I checked Tess' temperature and she's normal.
Did you hear,
Daddy? I'm normal.
Well, that's my girl.
She thinks she should get a medal.
A medal, really? Well.
Oh have you kids seen my tobacco pouch?
You know you could lose a battleship in this place?
You really look cute, Daddy.
Cute?
Well, I'll buy that.
Libby.
Don't forget to tell
Mrs. Beale to give Tess one of these before dinner and one after.
And then she goes...
Goes straight to bed.
Big mouth!
Will you two please stop it?
Now here's the Wards' number,
Santa Barbara, 5930, and Dr. Sweeney's home number, okay?
Mm-hmm.
We're running late honey.
Oh I really think we should wait until Mrs. Beale comes.
All right.
I'll get it.
Yes?
Ms. Mary this is Mrs. Beale.
Oh hello Mrs. Beale.
Hi Kit!
Hi Libby!
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Fine, how are you?
Fine.
I want you to meet my father.
Hello Mr. Austin.
Hello dear.
Are you coming in to meet my folks?
Well I'm sorry,
I haven't the time, but please thank your mother for having Kit over, okay?
Sure.
And I'll pick you up at 11:30.
Oh, Daddy couldn't you make it 12?
Mmm-mm, 11:30's late enough.
You have to be up early tomorrow, remember?
Yeah, I'll be ready.
Good night Libby.
Good night Mr. Austin.
When he says 11:30 he means 11:30.
Well come on then, let's not waste any time.
David we can't go.
I'm sorry, but we'll just have to call the Wards and break the date.
Well for heaven's sake, why?
Mrs. Beale can't come.
Mother.
Daddy, this is Kit Austin.
Oh, hello.
Hello my name is Tess.
Hi Tess.
Hello Kit.
Oh Ms. Mannering, it was so nice of you to invite me to dinner.
Now what is all this about Mrs. Beale not coming?
Mrs. Beale is sick.
Ah...
Oh Mother, we'll be all right alone.
Well it'll be pretty awkward to break the date now honey, it's business as well as social you know, couldn't we get somebody else?
But dear I tried to get everybody before
I got Mrs. Beale.
Mother, when are you gonna realize
I'm practically grown up.
Well you know she's got a point there.
No, no, she's very responsible.
You remember how she held down the fort when your mother was ill and that was two years ago.
Well I suppose we could start back early.
Sure, we'd be back at the crack of dawn.
Don't worry Daddy, we'll be all right.
Countdown from the top, see how normal I am.
I'm very normal.
I know you're just fine.
Goodbye.
Goodbye Libby.
Oh you do have those numbers now?
Yes Mother, the
Wards and Dr. Sweeney.
Okay.
Ellie come on.
Oh all right, goodbye Kit.
Bye bye, have a good time.
Thank you.
It's so different, from our apartment I mean.
It's so big.
Come on, I wanna show you my room.
Tess, you set the table.
Libby I wanna show her my room.
You can do that later, set the table now.
Oh let her come,
Libby. Come on, Tess.
I wish I'd worn my jeans.
Oh I'll lend you a pair of mine.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
No.
Are you spoiled?
Probably.
Libby, what is that?
That's Carmen.
Go ahead, pet her.
Well, we've got a pony and ducks.
Even a tame raccoon.
My father's a frustrated country squire, I think.
Come on.
Lib, don't you ever get lonely out here?
Ah, it's funny.
I never used to be.
Until I grew up, this was just all there was.
You know, pets and bicycles and a sandwich and a glass of milk after school.
But I was never lonely.
And now?
Well now it seems like everything I want is someplace else.
You know what I mean.
Parties, the movies, even going to a friend's house for dinner, they're all someplace else.
Give your boys a roadmap?
It's not that bad.
But when I do have a date, they have to drive all the way out here, pick me up, drive back to town and drive me all the way back here.
What's the sense of making it so hard for 'em?
What's the matter Lib?
Oh, Daddy was supposed to fix this.
He probably did, but nothing he ever fixes stays fixed.
Come on Kit, help me.
I wouldn't just be lonely out here,
I'd be scared stiff.
You wanna look around some more?
There's a lot of things to see.
No, let's go back.
Kit, Kit, Kit!
Kit, it's for you, a phone call, a boY-
Maybe it's Gary.
Tess, that's not funny.
Hello Gary?
Hello?
Hello?!
Hello!
There's nobody there.
He must've hung up.
Nobody called, that's her idiot notion of a joke.
I'm sorry.
We do it all the time, call people for fun.
Yeah we do it all the time.
Wait till you hear what they say.
Pick a name, Kit.
Go ahead, close your eyes and pick a name.
Pick a name?
Any name!
Gimme the phone.
William Harrison.
One, four, one.
Nine, one.
Hello?
Hello, is Bill there?
Who is this?
This is Alice, I've been waiting for him.
Almost an hour.
Waiting for him?
Yes, at the Green Garter Club.
He promised to be on time.
Well this is Mrs. Harrison.
I'll be sure to tell him.
Oh, this is his wife?
Oh I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.
Okay it's your turn now Kit.
John Adams.
Six, one.
Hello?
Hello, is John there?
Yes, he's here.
John, it's for you.
Yes?
Hello John?
This is Alice.
I've been waiting for you, almost an hour.
Oh but I wanted to meet you Alice.
Yes I did.
But you see I already had a date.
With my wife, who also wants to use the phone.
Oh whoops, I struck out.
Give it to me!
No, you'll just get scared and hang up.
No I won't. Find me a number Lib.
Okay.
Ah, two, three, two.
Two.
One.
One.
Three.
Three.
Hello?
Mommy, is this Mommy?
No, this isn't your mother, dear.
But I told Mommy
I'd call her so she can pick me up at the movie theater on Elm Street.
Well, why don't you try again and dial very carefully honey.
But this is the wrong number, and I spent my last dime.
Could you call my mommy for me please and tell her to come get me?
Of course darling, what's her number?
Her number is OL4367.
I'll call her right now, and you wait right where you are.
I'll wait here, thank you.
Stupid.
But you gave her our number.
Well it's the only number I know.
Hello?
Your little girl called my number by mistake.
She's waiting for you at the theater on Elm Street.
Well it's so nice of you to call.
Thank you.
I'm sure Nancy was upset.
I'll pick her up right away.
And thanks again.
Now let's see if
I remember Dave.
You like your coffee strong, hot, and black, right?
Right.
Do you know that that phone is still busy?
Thank you.
Do you think anything could be wrong?
Oh honey I'd be worried if they weren't on the phone, so they're talking, so everything's perfectly normal.
Of course.
You know how kids are.
Oh...
Steve Marak.
Five, six.
Seven, nine, one.
Hello.
Hello, is Steve there?
Who is this?
Just a friend.
Look sweetie, are you sure you got the right number?
Oh, well why would Steve give me a wrong number?
Steve?
Steve!
Hold on.
Steve.
Look he's taking a bath, call him later.
In the bathtub!
Tell her you've gotta talk to him!
But it's terribly important.
Hold on.
Steve, will you rush it up?
I wanna get my things...
You ape!
You belong in a cage!
And you wanna know why I'm leaving you!
You're not jealous, you're not that normal!
You're insane!
So he doesn't wanna get out of the tub.
Well try again then!
What's his number?
Oh, I don't remember, what was his name?
It started with an M.
Mannering?
That's our name, stupid.
Oh no it was a strange name.
Well how can we find it now, you closed the book.
It started with an M.
Well, let him stay in the tub, find me somebody else Kit.
Judith?
Judith?
Steve?
Steve.
Steve?
Steve?
What happened?
I stumbled, fell against the shower door.
Are you all right?
It shook me up a little.
I thought Judith was leaving?
She left all right.
She didn't even finish packing.
We had another fight, a beaut.
I'll send her things after her.
She's gone for good.
I'm here Steve.
Don't let this hurt you.
She's not worth it.
You married a childish, empty-headed, little tramp.
But now we can make something wonderful together.
We have made it.
You know that.
Your hands are trembling.
I gotta get her things out of here as soon as possible.
I gotta get dressed.
Of course, go ahead.
I'll straighten up in here.
FIE?
What is it?
Steve?
Later.
Will you promise to come over later?
I tried to call you three times, your line was busy.
Judy must've been trying to call a cab.
I was kinda worried.
That's why I came over, your back door was open.
You know it's kinda nice being neighbors.
I can check up on you.
Your phone's off the hook, Steve.
That's funny.
Good night Amy.
Later.
Is this Mr. John Hamburger?
Yes it is.
That's fine, would you send over six with pickles and onions?
Get lost nuisance burger!
What did he say?
He said, "Get lost nuisance burger!"
You won't believe this
Libby, I swear you won't!
Donald Ileak!
Donald Ileak?
Is his brother the plumber?
I'm hungry!
Okay now I'll show you something.
Hello?
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
Will you stop bothering people?
Oh, no sense of humor.
Yes.
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
You did?
Nothing's sacred!
Operator.
Operator, I've been getting a busy signal at this number for over two hours, could you check and see if there's anything wrong with the line?
Yes Ma'am, that was OL4367?
Yes, that's right, thank you.
Hello?
Yes?
Yes Ma'am that number is busy.
I see, thank you.
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
Slick, Slick where are you?
Slick come here!
Slick!
Hey, hey, from now on when you have some business to attend to, do it at the curb.
Don't wander off!
Hey come on let's go.
Next time it's your turn.
Hey what's wrong?
Nothing, nothing.
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
Ewvv!
You pig, you got peanut butter and jelly all over this page.
That's because I put my sandwich on it.
I put it on the man in the bathtub.
You what?
The man in the bathtub remember?
He couldn't talk 'cause he was taking a bath.
I put my sandwich down then, on the phone book.
Steve, Steve Mara k!
Let's see if he's still in the tub.
Maybe he drowned!
HEY, I'm hungry, are you?
Steve.
Steve!
Steve?
I've been waiting for you.
Here, let me do that.
You shouldn't be alone, especially tonight.
Come on in.
Your shoes are all muddy, where have you been?
I had a flat, I had to change it.
Well we're gonna get those shoes right off.
Come on, let's sit down,
I'm gonna take care of you whether you like or not.
Come on, take your shoes off.
I'm giving the orders now.
I know what you need.
But first, I'm gonna give you a nice stiff drink.
I'm gonna have one too.
I'll show you what it is to be taken care of.
Let's drink to that first night we had together.
I never knew anything could be so wonderful.
Now we can drink to a whole lifetime of nights like that.
You know Judith was wrong for you.
She was too young, too young to be a wife, a companion or, ugh, anything.
I want you to relax.
We're gonna have a beautiful life.
Just being together, that's all that really matters.
We can go away, anywhere we want.
Oh I need you Steve.
Let it ring.
You need me.
Let it ring!
Yes?
I sot him!
Well talk to him!
Is this Steve?
Steve Marak?
That's right, who's this?
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
What does he say?
He's playing along, sounds exciting.
Yes, I know who you are, and I saw what you did.
Who, who is this?
He wants to know who I am.
Oh make up a name, make up a name.
Suzette.
Suzette?
Where are you calling from?
Where can I reach you?
What a swinger!
He wants a date?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Suzette?
Suzette!
Steve?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Just a business deal
I've been working on.
Look I may have to go out later, you'd better go home.
No, Steve.
I'll wait, right here.
Please, Amy, I wanna be alone till I can work this out.
Who is Suzette?
Get off my back, give me room to breathe, you don't own me yet.
I'm sorry Steve, truly I am.
I can't help worrying,
I just don't want to see you hurt again.
There's nothing to worry about.
It's just a business deal and Suzette's a part of it.
Darling if you're in trouble, I wanna help any way I can.
Amy please, go on home, I'll be over later.
Look I have money, lots of it!
It's ours now, we can go away together, please, please let me help.
Amy, trust me.
We'll be together, it'll work out that way,
I promise you, just trust me.
I trust you with all my heart.
Hello?
Hello Steve?
Hello Suzette.
Why did you hang up on me before?
I've got to see you.
As soon as possible.
See what I mean, sexy.
Hi Steve.
Suzette, I wanna meet you.
I wanna meet YOU tOO.
What a sex maniac!
He does want a date.
Anywhere you say.
Well, somewhere nice and quiet.
I know you realize how important this is to both of us.
It means everything to me Suzette, everything.
I'll meet you anywhere, at your home, at work.
I know you're smart, I know you want the same things I do.
That's all that's keeping me going, nothing matters but seeing you.
You can trust me Suzette, I promise.
Suzette?
Oh my God.
You'll be hearing from me, goodbye now.
Wait a minute, please.
I'll call you back, I promise.
Then you will meet me?
Promise?
Suzette, Suzette?
Where can I reach you?
Oh didn't he sound exciting?
Yeah and sexy.
Well why'd you hang up then?
Oh I can't meet him
Kit, you know that.
So what's the use?
Oh call him once more, please.
No, game's over.
I wonder what he looks like.
We'll never know.
That's Tess, she fell outta bed again.
Libby, Libby!
Libby
I had a bad dream, Libby.
Well, that's all right, try to forget it.
I can't, it was horrible.
Try anyway, it was just a dream.
All right, if you'll stay here until I fall asleep.
Okay.
Libby?
What?
If you did meet him, what would you do?
I don't know, go for a ride or something or just talk.
About what?
Well, whatever he wanted to.
His work, girls he's known, where he's been.
But what would you talk about?
Boys, where I've been.
Libby you haven't been anywhere.
Well I went to New
York with Daddy once.
I guess I'd lie a little bit.
Well, what if he didn't wanna just talk?
I'm not exactly a baby Kit.
I can take care of myself.
Just by talking?
Suppose that he wanted to kiss you?
Well, maybe I'd let him.
Just once, or as much as he wanted?
Well, I don't know, he sounds nice.
His voice was so deep, so exciting.
It was like he was running his hand down my back.
Real slowly...
Was it cold?
That's a silly question.
I'll tell you what would happen if you really did meet him.
He'd take one look at you and send you straight home.
Anyway he's probably married.
Oh Kit, you're so naive.
Just because a man's married...
I just wish I knew what he looked like.
Kit, if we could find out.
Tess are you asleep?
Sure I'm asleep.
We could meet him Kit, well see him I mean, without him seeing us.
I don't know what you mean.
Well we know where he lives,
I could take Mommy's car.
I've got my learner's permit.
Libby Mannering!
You wouldn't dare!
I will if you will.
We could park near his house and see him.
You're not leaving me alone, Lib.
Ah, well I thought you were asleep.
I was.
I can't leave Tess, Kit.
Well I'd stay with her.
No, she's my responsibility.
I just couldn't leave her.
Well our problem is about the same, Tom, trying to convert to computers without violating the union contracts.
Well I'm seeing Roy
Miller next week to go over some of the figures.
David?
David there's no answer at home.
Well there must be.
But I've tried three times in the last 10 minutes the phone rings but there's no answer.
And you're sure you've got the right number?
Well of course I had the operator check it.
Well maybe they've got the TV turned way up.
The phone's in the same room, they'd hear it if they were there.
Now calm down honey, maybe they're out saying good night to Carmen.
That's our goat.
Or taking a look at the moon or they're up in their room playing records.
Now relax, what could be wrong?
I don't know, I just wish we hadn't left them alone.
Number one, we don't get out of the car.
Number two, we stay just 10 minutes.
Well if that's all we're gonna do, what did you put on your best dress for?
And all that make-up?
Just in case!
Suppose he doesn't come out?
It doesn't matter, now remember, nobody gets out of this car, is that understood?
There it is Lib, stop!
Lib turn out the lights.
Be quiet!
It kinda looks like him, doesn't it?
Like he sounds I mean.
Sort of mysterious.
Oh Lib there's no reason for him to come out.
He's probably in bed by now.
Well, maybe he's got a dog.
He might have to take it for a walk.
Oh this is silly Lib, let's go home please.
We just got here.
He's probably sitting there, reading, or watching TV.
If I honk I bet he'd hear it!
Well don't!
Look we can come back in the daytime, let's go home now, please!
If we don't see him tonight, we never will.
Oh Lib, you said you wouldn't get out of the car.
I'm just gonna walk past his house.
Oh Lib please don't go!
Lib, come back Lib!
Please, Libby!
Go get her Kit, make her come back!
Oh that's all right Tess, nothing to worry about.
She's gone Kit, I can't see her.
You little tramp!
Throwing yourself at him, chasing him.
I don't even know him!
Get outta here!
You're a liar, I heard you on the telephone.
Now get outta here!
Please, we didn't mean to cause any trouble, it was just a game.
I know what kind of a game, with a man over twice your age.
Now get outta here!
Somebody's coming!
Mrs. Marak please, you don't understand!
You little tramp!
They caught Libby, get back Tess, quick!
Please, let me explain!
Get outta here, go!
Look, just a minute, if you ever try to see him or call him again...
I won't, I promise I won't!
You'd better promise, now get in there!
Go on!
Oh no, no please don't take that.
Go on home!
Look honey.
You're too young.
Get out!
I met your little business deal, Steve.
Suzette.
What did she tell you?
She lied of course.
Another childish, empty-headed, little tramp.
Your taste is sickening.
She even lied about her name.
Ellie Mannering.
Keep it, as a souvenir.
Just a reminder that this is your last Suzette.
And it is your last one, get that through your head right now.
Look I don't need you to plan my life or to give me orders, you wanna crack a whip, get yourself a dog.
Oh but the orders are just starting.
We're gonna get married, go away and do exactly what you said, be together.
You're crowding me again Amy.
I got things to do.
Sure you have things to do.
With Suzette.
I heard you on the phone with her.
I listened in the bedroom.
I also know what happened here tonight t0 Judith.
It's a simple choice, Steve.
Life with me or no life at all.
You're blackmailing me into marrying you.
You must want it awful bad, the ring with the Mrs. in front of your name.
But only with you.
What you're saying is I have no choice.
None at all.
Very simple, all I have to do is pick up the phone and call the police.
Well Amy, maybe it'll work.
Who knows, you might be just what I needed.
How about a drink huh? I can use one.
It'll work.
Maybe not at first, but it will work.
A little ice.
Steve.
Yeah?
Please try to understand.
I had to do it this way.
What'll we drink to?
How about uh, to us?
Okay, to us.
Steve...
Oh I told you we shouldn't have come.
Who was she, Lib?
Mrs. Mara k.
I've just got to get it from her.
What Lib?
She took Mommy's registration card.
Maybe if we went back, but explained it was all a joke?
Oh we're in enough trouble.
If you go back I'm getting out of this car now.
Hello, Sgt. Harris.
Oh Sgt. Harris, this is David Mannering.
The Mr. Mannering in Oakland Hills?
Yes that's right, on Woodbridge Road.
I've been calling my house for almost an hour now my children are there alone and there's no answer.
Well where are you calling from?
Well I'm in Santa Barbara,
90 miles from the house.
Could the phone be out of order?
No, no I had the operator check the number.
I wonder if you could send a car out there?
Well yes, but could they just be asleep?
Well of course they might be asleep or playing outside, but
I'd certainly appreciate it if you'd check.
I'll send a car out right away, Mr. Mannering.
Oh thank you
Sergeant, thank you.
Yes we'll be at
Santa Barbara 5930.
And will you call us back here?
5930, yes sir.
Thank you very much.
David let's go home, now.
Well look honey, everything's probably fine.
There's no point in leaving now, not until we hear from the police.
You're gonna catch it when
Mommy and Daddy get home!
Tess Mannering if you say one word, just one word!
She won't have to, they'll know we were out in the car.
Oh Libby what are we gonna do.
Oh I wish I knew.
You're gonna catch it!
I know one thing, you're going to bed, now!
But suppose I have another bad dream!
That's your problem.
You're gonna catch it anyway.
And you better take all that stuff off your face too!
Oh Lib if my dad finds out he'll never let me come here again.
You know how strict he is.
If my parents find out, that's the end of the car.
And I'll be grounded for years.
Libby you've got to get it, you've just got to!
Well I wanted to go back, but who chickened out?
Yeah but who got us into this mess?
And remember, we'd just stay five minutes, and nobody gets out of the car.
Then you got out!
How did I know his wife would be there?
I told you he was probably married.
Shouldn't have gotten out in the first place.
Hello?
Is Mr. Mannering there?
No he's not.
Is Mrs. Mannering there?
Are you Mrs. Mannering?
No, she's gone too.
This is his daughter.
Well when will your parents be back?
Not till tomorrow morning, can I take a message?
No, just tell them
Mr. Jackson called, it's a business matter.
Good night.
Tess, Tess?
Did you take that pill?
Libby?
What?
How are you gonna get the registration card?
I don't know, maybe I can call Mrs. Marak in the morning.
Get up before my parents come home.
You've got to Libby!
I know, I know, stop worrying.
Tess?
Oh where is she?
Tess?
Tess, are you hiding in there?
Kit, Tess is gone!
Gone where?
I don't know, come on, we've gotta find her.
Oh Libby do we have to go outside?
She's not in the house.
Now he's gone.
Tess?
Tess!
Tess, are you out there?
Come in the house this minute.
Come on.
Libby she wouldn't go this far.
That idiot would go anywhere.
Oh that little fool.
Oh when I get my hands on her.
Tess?
Tess!
Oh I bet she's in here.
Tess.
Tess Mannering what are you doing in here?
I couldn't sleep, I had another bad dream.
Well why didn't you tell me.
It's my problem, you said so.
Anyway Gypsy couldn't sleep either.
Oh Libby, let's go back.
Another thing, I was locked in, couldn't open the door.
On Libby!
Relax, relax, relax.
Well, no wonder your folks couldn't find you, have you been out here all night?
No we went out in Mommy's car.
Yes, with Gypsy.
That's our pony.
Okay, come on, let's get back to the house.
You're gonna have to phone your parents, they're worried stiff, come on honey.
Come on.
Come on little lady, ah.
How long have you been out there?
Okay honey, Okay-
But you gave your mother a very bad time.
Let me talk to her David.
Libby?
Hello mother.
I'm sorry you were worried.
We were just out back.
We didn't hear the phone.
Yes I know dear but you should never have gone out.
How's Tess, did she take her pills?
Yeah she's fine.
Well you get right to bed, you understand?
Yes mother, we will.
Right away, I promise.
We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Good night, dear.
Goodbye.
They were upset.
I don't blame 'em.
Okay now.
No more wandering around outside tonight huh?
As for you.
You get to bed.
Lib do you think they believed you?
I mean about just being out back?
Why shouldn't they?
Oh oh, that's my father.
I'm going to bed like he told me to.
Lib we've got to stick to our story.
But suppose I can't get the registration back?
Whether you do or not, we never left here.
I can't let my father find out, you know that.
He won't, don't worry.
Promise Lib, never to tell?
Sure Kit.
Say it, say you promise.
Say it!
I promise!
Hello Lib.
Hello Mr. Austin.
I gather you two gave
Mr. and Ms. Mannering quite a scare?
We were just out back, Daddy.
At this hour?
I don't think you used very good judgment.
Come along, Kit.
And Lib I suggest you lock up and tuck yourself in.
I will Mr. Austin.
Bye Lib, call you tomorrow.
Good night Mr.
Austin, bye Kit.
BYE bye.
Good night Lib.
Bye.
BYE bye.
Was Mr. Austin mad?
Well, not exactly mad.
Just kind of, well, grim.
Lib, when are Mommy and Daddy coming home?
In the morning.
What?
In the morning.
What time?
Uh, about nine or 10.
Lib will you sleep with me tonight?
Oh Tess, you're such a baby.
Please, I'll do you a favor some clay.
Okay.
What'd you say?
I said okay!
Goodie!
Can we leave the light on?
Tess, what are you afraid of?
I'll be right here.
Move over.
Move over!
And that winds up the late scores, sports fans.
It's still anybody's pennant, anybody's ballgame you might say.
Uh just a moment ladies and gentlemen.
Here is a special bulletin.
The body of an unidentified woman was found earlier tonight in the wooded area adjoining Oakland Hills.
That's not far from here.
The victim, described by police as young and attractive, was brutally, sadistically murdered.
According to Chief of
Detectives John Halliday.
Police were directed to the dead woman's shallow grave by
Linda Carson, 22, of Abaum Grove Township.
While searching for her dog in the woods near Oakland Hills, at approximately 8:30 tonight,
Ms. Carson saw a man lurking suspiciously among the trees.
According to Chief
Halliday, Ms. Carson saw what the man was doing.
Digging a shallow trench in the rocky ground.
Prompted by what she described as a hunch,
Ms. Carson reported the incident to the police.
According to Ms.
Carson's description, the murderer was tall, dark-haired, about 40 years of age.
To repeat.
What's the matter with you kid?
Oh that's horrible.
You've been shaking like a leaf ever since we left the Mannerings.
Might as well level with me kid.
What have you been up to tonight?
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
What did you say?
Nothing Daddy.
Lib, Lib!
You didn't let Spot in.
He's all right.
He doesn't mind sleeping outside.
He isn't sleeping, he's barking.
Well then you go to sleep.
I can't, he's keeping me awake.
Well then let him in.
Okay.
Spot?
Spot
Spot. Spot!
Who are you?
Tess, Tess Mannering.
Where's Suzette?
You're Steve aren't you?
That's right, where's Suzette?
Come on in, she's upstairs.
She's sleeping?
Well she was till Spot woke us.
Wait, I'll get her.
Lib, wake up Lib!
He's downstairs.
Who, Spot?
No, Steve!
What do you mean?
I mean Steve, he's downstairs.
Tess, if this is a joke.
It's not, he's downstairs waiting for you.
Suzette!
What do I tell him?
Don't ask me.
Thanks.
I wonder how he found us.
I don't know.
The registration.
I bet he got it from his wife.
He probably knew how much trouble we'd be in without it.
No, now you stay here.
Can't I look at him from the top of the stairs?
Well, all right.
Steve?
Steve, are you in here?
Steve?
Steve, where are you?
Mr. Marak are you out there?
You're not Suzette.
You're just a kid.
Where is she?
Mr. Marak, I pretended to be Suzette.
I'm Libby Mannering.
You pretended?
It was a game, we called people on the telephone just for fun.
Steve?
This is Suzette, I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
It was just a game.
You said you saw what
I did, what did you see?
Nothing, nothing.
That was just part of the game.
But you knew who I was, knew my name, how did you find that?
Well in the telephone book.
We just picked any name.
I put peanut butter and jelly on it, that's how we found it.
We called lots of other people too.
We said the same thing to all of them.
I'm really sorry Mr. Marak, we shouldn't have done it.
But I tried to explain to your wife that it was just a joke.
Did she give you the registration card?
You know what I should do?
Tell your parents.
Oh no, no please, please don't do that.
You must want this awful bad huh?
Oh I sure do.
You don't know what a mess
I'll be in if I don't get it.
My wife was pretty upset.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right,
I calmed her down.
Well there's no use making a federal case out of a silly prank, hmm?
Here.
Oh, just one thing, don't use the phone for fun and games anymore.
Good night, and thank you.
Hello?
Libby?
Kit, you'll never guess.
I told you everything would be all right.
You see, all your worrying was for nothing.
I hate to say I told you so.
I've got it, Mommy's registration card.
No he brought it here.
Steve Marak was there?
Mm-hmm!
He didn't want us to get in any trouble.
Oh thank goodness, is he still there?
No he's gone, but he sure had me scared.
I would've been scared too, what did he look like?
Well he was kinda tall.
He had brown hair.
He was older than we thought, about 40.
Oh Libby this is real weird.
Wait till I tell you, a woman was murdered tonight,
I heard it on the radio, some girl saw the man who did it, she saw the murderer
Libby, and he was tall, had dark hair and middle-aged.
I saw what you did, and I know who you are.
And look it happened at 8:30, just when we started calling, isn't that a weird coincidence?
I mean kooky!
Oh it's my dad, I have to hang up.
Kit?
Kit?
This is the operator.
Operator, give me the police, okay?
Tess, get UP!
Tess, where are you?
Tess!
Tess, where are you?
Tess!
Libby hide, he's coming after you!
Tess, get out of the house, run for help!
Oh Tess!
Tess, where are you?
Tess, Tess?
Here I am Libby...
The car!
Get to the car!
Libby, Libby, Libby...
She's lucky you called this in time Mr. Austin.
She's lucky my daughter finally told me the truth.
I wasn't scared, really scared I mean.
But Daddy's gonna be mad.
That man broke our window and pulled out the telephone.
You're such an idiot.
They can fix the window.
But we're not gonna be using the phone for a long, long time.
Sorry, you have reached a disconnected number.
Soon this poor villa will be smothered.
To think there were woods here once.
That'll all be houses.
Yes, there's nowhere to run.
That's right. Good day, Excellency.
Goodbye.
Ah, here you are, dad.
I was looking for you upstairs.
I thought you were already way out at sea.
Not yet, father.
Isn't it customary to wear a sailor's cap with the yacht's name on it?
No father, it isn't.
How long will you be away?
Four or five days.
Well, I suppose I'll spend the weekend alone.
I'll rest. I should have grown used to it by now.
Used to what, father?
To rest-not only from my diplomatic duties but as a father.
- Why do you say such things?
- It's the truth.
Allow me at least this much: after 30 years of never telling the truth,
I might as well speak truthfully to my own daughter now.
Any more truths to tell me?
You know it.
That one I would beg you to spare me; goodbye, father.
My darling daughter, that guy - he'll never marry you.
Up to now, I didn't want to marry him.
It's all the same difference.
Goodbye dear.
Good morning.
Have you been waiting long? I'm sorry...
Hurry up, Alvaro. It's late.
I'll wait for you here, right?
- Where are you going now?
- To the café. I'm thirsty.
While a man you haven't seen for a month has been waiting half an hour for you?
I feel as if I'd rather not see him today.
But we rushed all the way here...
I see... goodbye cruise.
It's harrowing having to be apart.
Really.
It's difficult keeping a relationship going, while one is here and the other there.
But it's easy too.
Understand?
Whereas when somebody's there facing you... that's all you get.
Understand?
Let's go back, c'mon.
Anna! I'll be right down!
Well, hello!
Should I give you my profile?
Well? What's wrong with me?
Your friend is downstairs, waiting.
Let her wait.
How are you?
Awful.
Why?
Why, why, why, why, eh?
Why, eh? Why, why...
Eh, this one has to starve for a while yet.
Move, you filthy animal.
It's as smooth as oil.
I don't know why, but I hate all comparisons involving oil.
'Morning.
Good morning.
Look.
0h, God...
Did you sleep well?
So-so.
Last night I went to bed thinking
I would be able to reflect upon so many different things, and then I fell asleep.
I had no idea one could sleep so well on one of these things.
They rock you.
I slept very badly indeed.
Hello. Ciao.
Good morning.
Sunbathe, instead.
Shall we go for a swim?
Not here. It's frightening.
0nce the Aeolian islands were many volcanoes.
Twelve years ago when we came here together, you came up with the exact same remark.
Think of that!
What's the name of this one?
This should be Basiluzzo.
Basiluzzo... it sounds like the name of a fish.
That one over there is Lisca Bianca.
How boring.
Why all of this fuss over a swim?
Careful.
Mario, woman overboard!
Stop...
Stop...
Raimondo?
I'm right here, Patrizia.
Why have we stopped?
And you, won't you come for a swim
Patrizia.
I had a dream I was swimming.
Think of that!
- Lady Patrizia.
- Do you like scuba diving?
I simply loath it, yet I must conform, what can you do?
I'd like to know whoever said that man originally inhabited the sea!
Patrizia, if you give me your yacht's flag,
I'll go and take the island in your name.
Well!
Islands...
I don't get them...
...surrounded by nothing but water... poor things...
Cosimo... come...
- Mario, prepare the dinghy.
- Right away, Mr. Corrado.
Sandro, where are you going?
Ask her.
- Working on luxury boats it's harder.
- Why?
The owners have no set plans.
Take last night, for instance.
We sailed all night long.
I didn't get any sleep.
Still I prefer it...
Shark! ...
Shark! .
Keep still, miss...
Stay right where you are.
Don't anyone move!
Claudia,
Claudia wait for me.
Go away!
Come.
Hold on.
What's happening?
There's a shark around here.
Stay right where you are.
Who's going anywhere?
How did you know it was there?
Did it touch you?
I would have died, with its horrible face and awful teeth.
Have some cognac, Anna.
It's nothing, let's go...
It's all over now.
- I'd like to change now. I'm cold.
- Sure.
Summer is really over.
I wonder where this shark went.
Well, what is it?
Which shall I wear?
This one, or this?
This one.
This one is divine.
Why don't you try it on?
It looks better on you.
- Keep it.
- 0h, no.
The whole shark thing was a lie, you know.
- A lie?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Because.
But now don't think about it.
It's over.
I don't need to know why you behave this way.
It's Sandro,
I suppose.
Are you feeling better now, at least?
C'mon, let's go.
Aren't you going ashore?
Are you calling those rocks a shore?
And you, were you still swimming around?
Don't you know there's a shark in these waters?
A shark?
You mean to tell me I might have been killed.
Ah well!
0h well... well... ah yes...
What is it Raimondo?
You want me?
At this time?
See you.
No, Claudia, stay... there's no spark.
Is this better?
Are you happy?
Tell the truth, you're a little disappointed.
Not at all.
Quite the opposite.
What sort of a face do you think
Raimondo has?
A rather corrupt one,
I'd say.
Not at all.
He's a child.
Now, don't start that, Patrizia.
I'd rather be corrupt, unless you happen to love children.
I don't love anyone, and you know it.
I know, I know.
And to think that if there ever was a woman created for every kind of deceit and vice, of betrayal and debauchery, she's the very one. And you know what?
She's faithful.
A faithfulness born from a sort of laziness.
How amusing!
The only amusement I know besides my dog.
Let's go ashore.
There should be some ancient ruins up there.
Let's go see.
- Giulia do you remember?
- Yes.
No, it's better if you sleep.
You say: "How beautiful" no matter what you're looking at: the sea, a child, a cat.
Your sensitive little heart races at nothing.
But if something is beautiful, why shouldn't I say so?
How likable!
Who are you talking about?
- The shark.
- Still?
How wonderful.
Corrado, would you like one?
This is Patrizia's way to share our company.
You know,
I find you very pleasant.
More than the shark?
Ah, there is no comparison.
Won't you come with me to take a look at those ruins then?
It could be something to do.
But no, we'd better stay here.
Sandro... A month is too long a time.
I had grown used to being alone.
It's the usual uneasiness.
Then you'll get over it.
I felt it a little more this time.
It'll take a little more to go away, then.
Instead I think we should talk about it.
0r are you convinced that even between us we're unable to understand one another?
We'll have so much time to talk.
We're getting married.
What's more time than a lifetime?
Under these circumstances getting married would mean nothing.
Aren't we already acting as if we were married?
Giulia and Corrado, aren't they living as though they were married?
Why should we be here talking, arguing?
Believe me Anna, words are becoming less and less necessary, they create misunderstandings.
I care for you Anna, isn't this enough?
No.
It isn't enough,
I'd like to spend some time alone.
But if you just said that one month...
To be alone longer: two months, a year, three years!
I know it's absurd.
I'm distraught. The idea of losing you, makes me want to die... and yet...
I don't feel you anymore.
Even yesterday, at my place, you didn't feel me any more?
You always need to vilify everything.
The weather's changing.
Please Giulia, there's no need to be so literal all the time.
I can see it by myself that the weather is changing.
We should leave now.
The sea is getting rough.
And Anna?
I don't know.
I thought I heard a boat.
- You hear it?
- Yes.
Sandro!
Where's Anna?
She was here.
- Isn't she onboard?
- I wouldn't know, miss.
Patrizia.
Is Anna there?
No.
She's not here.
This is one of those typical
'Anna behaviors' that drives me mad.
This island is so beautiful, isn't it?
Did you find her?
Sandro!
Nothing?
Have you noticed?
- Have you noticed how he treats me?
- Who?
Corrado.
Today he's done nothing but belittle me.
Giulia!
Sandro!
Sandro!
Nothing...
Not even a trace.
Guys, let's choose a practical approach.
You go to the nearest island, there must be a police station, the coast guard or whatever the hell might be, and report Anna as missing.
I'll stay here 'cause,
'cause I don't know...
I feel something might happen.
Anyway I don't feel I could leave.
Well then, let's go.
There's no point in wasting more time.
How long will it take to get there and back?
If the station is at Panarea, a couple of hours.
But if we have to go to Lipari, it will take much longer.
- It also depends on the sea.
- 0f course... the sea...
I'm staying with Sandro.
Why?
And if it rains?
Well if it rains,
I'll buy an umbrella.
I'm not leaving.
Claudia, I understand you, but we're already staying behind.
And I'll say this too... your presence here - and please don't mind my saying so
- Might get in the way.
Darn it, we forgot to ask them to leave us some light.
Ah, here's a lantern at least.
I think she's still alive.
Even this morning... that story of the shark... it wasn't true.
- Why did you wait 'til now to tell us?
- I don't know...
I didn't think it would make any difference... she was laughing...
Right... what we need to understand is why she made up this shark charade.
What was she trying to achieve?
- Perhaps we'd better ask him.
- Me?
Why?
Did you quarrel?
I don't mean to pry, but it's very important.
0h, the usual arguments...
The only thing, if I remember correctly, is that she wanted to be alone.
And how's that?
What is this?
What are you doing?
Are you the owner?
No.
The owners are in Australia.
I was in Australia too... for 30 years.
My nephew... those were the times!
Where did you come from?
- You weren't around while we were searching.
- From Panarea.
From Panarea.
Then it was you today.
I saw a rowboat go by around two.
It must have been four or five o'clock.
- This afternoon.
- No, this morning.
Why? What happened?
What happened?
Nothing... nothing...
Why don't you tell him?
A girl from our party has disappeared.
Disappeared how?
Drowned?
No. She's disappeared, and we don't know how.
And it's all my fault... why don't you say this too?
It's what you're thinking.
You should have made more of an effort trying to understand
Anna's thoughts, rather than being so concerned with mine.
Did you look behind the house?
She might have fallen from these cliffs.
'Cause last month the same thing happened to a lamb of mine.
I looked for it all day, and only at nightfall I heard it bleating.
It must have been...
Come Claudia, come back inside.
How are you?
Feeling any better?
About last night...
I'm sorry.
You love Anna very much.
Yes, very.
Did she ever talk to you about me?
Seldom.
But always tenderly.
And still... she acted as though our love, yours, her father's, mine, in a manner of speaking, was nothing to her, meant nothing to her.
Sometimes I wonder what it is
I could have done... to prevent all of this from happening.
Whose boat is that?
What boat?
A moment ago.
Didn't you hear?
There are so many boats around here during the summer.
Why did you get up so early?
Do you call 5 in the morning early?
Bartolo!
What then?
Nothing, nothing.
Nothing.
Why are you looking at me this way Marshal?
We're not there yet, you know.
I hope they're not the ones to find her.
That would mean she's dead.
Listen Patrizia... apparently there's a current that heads straight from here to another island. I don't know which, but this is another clue.
The Marshal said he'll send one of his men there... you never know...
Would you mind if...
Would you mind if I ask
Raimondo to go with him?
I don't see why.
I think you should be the one to go there.
Yes. Yes, perhaps that would be better...
Sandro really astonishes me.
- He seems so self-possessed.
- Self-possessed?
I don't think so...
He was up all night.
- What's that?
- An ancient vase.
There's a city buried under here.
There's plenty of this stuff.
And of course here he comes.
- Let me see it.
- Go on, from which period is it?
Corrado, why don't we ask if we may have it.
Right, so you can plant one of your geraniums in it.
- Weren't you supposed to leave?
- No, it's useless!
What a shame!
It figures.
Look,
Anna's father is here.
I looked into Anna's suitcase and...
Yes... it's Anna's... she gave it to me yesterday...
I found it in my bag...
I didn't want to...
But I had nothing else to wear this morning... I'm sorry.
I found these in her suitcase.
This is a good sign, don't you think?
Someone who reads the Bible, wouldn't do anything rash, it must mean she believes in God.
So we can rule out the suicide hypothesis, right?
Thank you, anyway.
Brigadier... come,
I have important news.
What news?
They've stopped a suspicious boat a few miles from here.
The crew is in Milazzo, waiting to be questioned.
We must go there and see.
Right, we must.
Did you hear?
We're in the hands of God.
I agree.
But I think we should go to Milazzo!
Forgive my earnestness, and try to understand,
I am the one closest to your daughter.
Even if you were, right now my daughter needs me more.
And you, what are you going to do?
What should we do? We really don't know.
We'll go visit the Montaldos.
I'll get my bag.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
- I'll join you at the Montaldos then.
- Fine.
I think this is the best solution.
Ettore should be there already.
- I'm going to scour all of those other islands.
- What?
I can't leave unless I've been there, to every single one of them.
But aren't you tired?
I can hardly stand.
I am here, Patrizia,
I'm always here.
Claudia is not coming with us.
Will you take care of her bag?
I've heard you're having trouble at home, is that so?
Yes, my sister has been ill for a year... and my father too.
So, that's why you're a smuggler... you need money. I can help you,
I can see that you get State benefits, if you want to.
But first, let's take care of a few formalities.
A few questions and then we're all off to lunch.
Your partner told me that you dropped the net three times.
Yes, yes, three times.
Get the others in here.
Here!
We're nearly there. They're starting to contradict one another. I'm sorry.
Your partner told me you couldn't fish 'cause the sea was rough.
Is that right?
- And what about the other boat?
- What boat?
Careful, my men saw it and they saw you throwing the crates overboard.
Well then.
What's the story?
I wasn't feeling well...
I'm confused...
I don't know anything.
What is he saying?
- What are you saying?
- Please...
What does Anna have to do with all of this?
Stay here, calm down.
I'm ready to forget everything: the cigarettes, the smuggling, as long as you tell me if you brought the girl somewhere...
What did you say?
This is the guy who built the villa.
He would have never thought it would end up being used this way.
Lieutenant, do you know this F.Z. who wrote the article in the paper?
- Francesco Zuria, the correspondent.
- Where could I find him?
And if I were to offer a reward in exchange for any information...
Well... Zuria is in Messina.
You can try.
- Would you like me to call him?
- No, no thank you. Don't bother.
Do you have any orders, Sir?
May I return to Lipari?
Yes. Where did you put the case of cigarettes?
- In the storeroom.
- Fine.
At your command.
Sergeant...
Excuse me... Sergeant...
When did you get here?
Two hours ago.
And the young lady who was with you, where is she?
I don't know.
She said she had a train to catch.
Where are you going?
To the Montaldos?
I'll go with you.
Did you read this?
They're asking anyone who might know something to get in touch.
Yes, I even thought to go there myself and have a word...
- Yes, you must go.
- When will I see you, then?
I know it's complicated.
But if you carry on this way it becomes even more so.
Please don't look so sullen...
And don't wait for the train...
I beg you, leave.
Milazzo.
Watch your hands, please.
I'd really want to know what is there to be said now?
Go on, speak.
Sandro, I don't want you with me,
I don't want to see you.
Do you hear me?
- Why did you come?
- I couldn't help it.
As you'll have to, this sacrifice is better if made right now.
Sacrifice! I have no intention of sacrificing myself - it's idiocy sacrificing oneself...
Why? For whom?
I would understand your qualms if Anna were here. But she's not.
Sandro!
Sorry,
I don't mean to sound jaded.
But wouldn't it be much better to look at things for what they are?
To me they're exactly the same as three days ago when we first met.
Just three days ago, can you imagine?
And you and Anna...
No, no, no, they're not the same.
And yet how can it be that it takes so little to change, to forget?
It takes even less.
But it's sad.
It's terribly sad.
And I am not used to it.
I'm not prepared for it.
To feel this way.
I've never felt so confused in my whole life.
Sandro, why don't you help me?
I think the only way we can help each other is by staying together.
No.
I'm sure that's not it.
Stay there, stay there and get off at the next stop.
And you?
Me... me... me... let me be!
I don't mean to intrude, but as this is a Palermo-bound train, would you happen to be traveling to that destination?
No.
- To Tindari, then?
- No.
- Sant'Agata di Miniatello.
- No.
- It must be Cefalù, then.
- How did you know?
Through an acquaintance.
I work for a Cefalù's family, but I'm not from there.
I am telling you.
This acquaintance of mine knows you, and has told me lots about you.
And who is it?
Does he work in Cefalù?
- Yes, she's a gardener.
- Impossible.
The gardener at the villa where I work is a man.
It must have been them talking.
And what did they tell you about me?
0h, lots and lots.
They told me you're a well-brought- Up girl, that you mind your business, this sort of thing.
We have a radio just like this one.
- No, not like this one.
- Why not like this one?
Because this one was made in China.
These small radios are handy for sure.
Especially, I don't know... going for a walk...
Which comes first for you?
Music or love?
Music of course.
A fiancée you've gotta look for, but a radio can be bought.
Ah no, love for me.
I am a man and I know about this kind of thing.
Love first, then music.
- No, Claudia, listen.
- Sandro please... do it for me... promise you won't look for me...
- You must stop looking for me...
- But why Claudia? Why?
Listen, even if you send me away, I...
Claudia, Claudia I don't want to wait anymore...
Later it might never happen... come away with me...
Claudia...
Zuria.
Which one of you is Zuria?
What do I know?
He might be inside.
I called you, officer,
'cause the situation seemed to be getting out of hand, and your presence might become necessary...
- They're breaking everything...
- Pardon me, are you Mr. Zuria?
That's me all right.
- May I ask you a question?
- Lf you can wait. I am busy now.
I was looking for a notions shop and noticed these men following me.
I've never seen anything like it... so many men!
Easy to believe, the way you dress...
I went all over the world dressed this way.
0h, not like this, though.
My skirt came unstitched, that's why I was looking for a notions shop.
How old are you?
Nineteen. I'm married.
My name is Gloria Perkins and for the past year I've been a writer.
I write while in a trance and I'm usually in touch with the dead,
Tolstoy, for instance, or Shakespeare.
But I am also interested in working in the movies.
And how did they welcome you in Palermo?
In Palermo
I was with my husband.
Right now I'm on my way to Capri to write on tourism.
Exactly the same thing happened in Palermo.
Miss, if you want to go back to your hotel,
- We're here to escort you.
- 0h, yes.
0ut, away, out, out.
It's a disgrace.
What are you doing here, move.
For a woman!
How disgusting.
Like her?
- Fifty thousand!
- No!
Why all of this racket then?
It's all a ruse to be noticed.
And even if only one gets hooked up, she's all right for a while.
Ah well, if fifty thou weren't a month's worth of my wages, that's one of those whims
I would have indulged, I assure you.
So what did you want to talk about?
I read your article on that girl's disappearance. I am her boyfriend.
Would you mind telling me the whole story about this disappearance without omitting any detail?
Look, I wouldn't be here if I had any clues.
And I see you don't have any either.
0n the contrary,
I've received several calls.
In one they said she had been spotted in a car in Rome, another at the port talking to foreign sailors.
And if she sailed away in secret?
- Does it still happen?
- What do I know?
Somebody said they'd seen her at a chemist in Troina...
Actually the chemist himself says that a girl fitting the description, went into his store in Troina to buy a tranquilizer.
- Is this place far?
- About fifty kilometers from here.
If you'd like,
I can get the name of this chemist.
Yes... yes why not.
But you must write it in your paper no later than tomorrow morning.
Yours is one of Palermo's newspapers, isn't it?
I mean, does it have a lot of readers?
Yes, but the whole thing is stale now... it's stale... has lost its appeal, the editor won't print it.
No, no, no.
You should really do this for me.
Please, don't take it badly, but why should I do you a favor?
Let's say it's business, then.
To help you round up your salary.
- I went to every single one of those islands.
- It must have been exhausting.
Useless, more than anything else.
I can't stand it anymore.
- Agreed, until tomorrow.
- Goodbye.
How can you talk business in this heat?
When you're past fifty, my darling, you only feel the cold.
And what is this?
It's Claudia, Anna's friend...
You haven't met my husband, have you?
Ah, fine.
Imagine that she's just back from...
- Incidentally, did you call him?
- Sandro?
Didn't he say he would have joined us here?
This really shouldn't have happened.
And how can I negotiate, when all the data's missing...
I feel it's good news he hasn't been in touch. I bet he's found her.
When you consider that in Italy there's a disappearance rate of 40 thousand people a year, that is almost enough to fill
San Siro's stadium.
I don't know this Sandro.
What's he like?
Maybe he's done away with her.
Good Lord, we're making a joke of something like this.
We ought to be ashamed of ourselves.
Coming?
Princess, this villa - why don't you sell it?
I'd make it into a lovely clinic for nervous disorders.
It's already a little like that.
Goffredo is the princess' grandson.
He's 17, think of that!
And a painter.
Anyone can hold a brush.
Just buy the paint and get down to it.
Even Titian started this same way.
- So, what's your style? Abstract?
- No.
- And what do you feel when you're painting?
- A shudder.
Are you ready?
'Cause I'm not.
All we needed was this dinner...
All these people's vitality irritates me.
- How does it look?
- Divine.
- You're just saying that to flatter me.
- Why, is that a compliment?
No.
You look like somebody else.
Shall we?
I'm going down.
He wants to show me his paintings.
And won't let me go.
The poor thing must have a crush.
Please come along...
Why should I?
Well, you can't leave me alone with him.
He could... well, I don't know... didn't you see his eyes?
We're coming.
Giulia, what am I coming for?
Claudia, come see.
A nude.
If I'm not mistaken they're all nudes.
You're good.
But why paint only women?
No landscape is as lovely as a woman.
And how do you get your models?
0h, they're a dime a dozen.
I thought models were a thing of the past, didn't you, Claudia?
Um?
What?
It's strange how women enjoy showing themselves.
Seems almost in their nature.
How can they pose that way.
I couldn't.
Why don't you try?
- Try.
- Me?
Are you crazy, Goffredo?
He's crazy.
Not really.
Don't you ever sketch men?
Why don't you answer?
Why don't you try?
I'd make you a beautiful portrait.
Why are you so particular about me?
Ask Claudia, she's so much more beautiful than me.
But it's you I want.
You appeal to me more.
Appeal to you more?
Giulia!
If Corrado looks for me, you can tell him I'm here.
And tell him that my little heart is racing, racing.
And right now this is the only thing I care about. Clear?
Couldn't be clearer.
What more do I have to do now to be left alone?
Nothing, you just need to shut the door, Giulia.
He wasn't at the hotel, and he probably wasn't in Milazzo, either.
The doorman said he asked to rent a car.
I'm going to change.
See you later. Hi.
We'll try to find him tomorrow anyway.
He must be in Milazzo or thereabouts.
Shall we go Claudia?
I'm not coming.
Why did you change then?
Get a car to fetch him, it must be 150 km.
Fine we'll get him, then.
Giulia is like 0scar Wilde.
Give her all the luxuries and she will manage without the little necessities.
That's it, you really cannot do without quoting those weird names...
He does it even during our meetings with the administration.
- Who?
- Corrado.
Forgive me but I can't remember everything that goes on.
What do you mean?
You even said she bought a tranquilizer.
It's no use acting as if you don't remember a thing.
A girl answering the description
of the missing person
entered my drug store on the
afternoon of...
She came in and out she went.
With him. But he won't tell you that.
If you think I didn't notice.
Why would I have called the paper if we had an understanding?
That's what I would like to know.
That makes the two of us. Actually, three including the gentleman here.
Mrs. Amalia, would you also like to know, why I called the paper about the missing person that showed up here two days ago, and disappeared again?
Disappeared?
Who? When?
That makes four.
Anyone else?
Listen.
You should be more precise.
That girl, did she or did she not come into your store?
Yes.
And was she blonde or brunette?
- Brunette.
- Blonde.
What was she wearing?
That I don't remember.
Some pale color, I believe.
Him, he doesn't notice the clothing he notices what's underneath.
Has anyone else inquired after this girl?
- No... no I don't think so.
- Thank you.
Any news?
Well, plenty of contradictions... yes, a few clues.
Listen, in the paper they forgot to mention that when the girl left, she took a bus for Noto.
The bus leaves from the square.
I remember because I wanted to watch her walk way.
Beautiful girl, really.
Beautiful legs.
Do you smoke?
You're from Rome, aren't you?
I knew it.
I'm from Viterbo.
He was doing his military service there, and you know...
I'm not happy here.
How long have you been married?
Three months.
Back inside, you.
Thanks, thanks a lot for your help.
The very picture of marital bliss.
Tell Lady Patrizia we'll go on with our search, and that Miss Claudia will get in touch one way or the other.
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
What is this place called?
Noto.
And where will we look for Anna?
In a hotel. Apparently, there's only one.
The 'Trinacria'.
Could this be Noto?
Let's ask.
Is anybody in?
Hear the echo...
Why is it empty?
Who knows.
I wonder why they built it at all.
There's another one there.
That's not a town.
That's a cemetery.
My God, how dreary.
Let's go.
Let's go.
My love... mine... mine... mine...
Claudia, it's late.
We must go.
Sandro, perhaps it's better if you were to go alone.
Are you joking?
Don't think I'm trying to get away with the awkwardness, the difficulty this meeting might cause.
That's not it, it's just that these things can be discussed more easily without my being present.
Try to understand my position.
It might seem as if I were trying to influence you, twist your arm.
And it makes me uneasy.
What can I do for you, Miss?
- I'd like a can of paint.
- Which color?
- Navy blue.
- Right away.
Claudia.
What's happening?
0h, Sandro, I'm so ashamed... so ashamed. Did you see that?
I was trying to hide. I feel so measly.
I hate myself.
Does it make you feel better talking this way?
No.
So why do you do it?
Because what I'm doing is ugly.
Because if you were to tell me right now 'Claudia I love you',
I'd believe you.
I'd believe you.
Claudia...
No, don't say anything or
I would make you swear and tell me so many things...
And it's not right... it cannot be right.
It's absurd.
Great. And all the better if it is absurd.
It means we can't do anything about it.
Do you understand me?
I'm sorry, but we don't need it anymore.
0h, that's all right - don't worry.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
To think that you must have told
Anna these same things
I don't know how many times...
Let's say I did: I was in earnest with her as I am now with you.
I've never met a woman like you who needs to see everything clearly.
Come, let's take a walk.
Up here it really is beautiful.
Imagine,
I have never been up here.
Please feel free to stay.
I'm going back down.
Such imagination.
Such movement.
They were concerned with the architectural settings.
Such extraordinary freedom.
I really must go ahead and leave Ettore.
I'd like to work on design again.
- I used to have ideas of my own, you know.
- Why did you stop?
Why, why, why?
Because it isn't easy to admit that a red floor suits a certain room, when you're thinking exactly the opposite.
But the lady wants it red.
Because there is always a lady... or a man... and so...
0nce, I was asked to make the estimate for the construction of a school.
It took me a day and a half.
I earned four million lira.
So I went on giving estimates of other people's projects.
Why are you looking at me this way?
Because I am convinced you could make really beautiful things.
I don't know,
I really don't know about that.
Who needs beautiful things nowadays
Claudia. How long will they last?
All of this was built to last centuries.
Today, ten, twenty years at the most, and then? Well...
Claudia, shall we get married?
What do you mean, shall we get married?
Let's get married, you and I.
Answer me.
Answer.
How should I answer?
No.
Not now, anyway...
I don't know...
I wasn't even thinking about it.
At a time like this...
But why are you asking me?
You're looking at me as though
I'd said something crazy.
Are you sure you want to marry me?
Really sure?
That you want to marry me?
Am I not asking you?
Why aren't things less complicated.
You say that I'd like to see things clearly.
I'd like to see things clearly and instead...
They're answering, hear them?
Where from?
From that tower over there.
No, no, of you I will never let go
no, no, forever you'll be mine...
Are you ready?
Yes.
Why have I fallen in love with you so?
Come, come quickly.
Yes, yes... Where is it, where is it... yes.
Yes, yes,
I will always hate you
No, no,
of you I will never let go
The sweetest pining I will feel
Ciao, see you later.
My kisses
shall get you back to me...
No, no, you can't leave me in a hotel room alone.
Come down, when you're ready.
I'll be downstairs or in the piazza.
Fine. But first you must tell me that going out without me is like missing a limb.
Go ahead and visit the city all alone, you'll limp.
Tell me you want to embrace my shadow running along the walls.
And then you must tell me...
...you must tell me you love me.
You know.
Why should I tell you?
That's right.
Why?
I'll see you later.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Is anyone in charge of this place?
A guard? A curator?
He must be in the church.
- Any museums around here?
- What do I know.
It says from 9:30 to 12:30.
It's ten now.
- Fine way of welcoming tourists.
- Tourists. What tourists?
Last year we got a few French, they went to the beach to swim with the 'jeep'.
- With what?
- With a 'jeep'.
With the bikinis!
And so?
We let them know that they'd better move on, leave...
I'm sorry,
I didn't...
You did it deliberately.
Deliberately? Why would I?
No! Really.
Don't!
- How old are you?
- Twenty-three.
Twenty-three.
I have been twenty-three too, and I was in so many fights you can't even imagine.
Play, play...
Forgive me, Miss, if I interfere... but I've heard...
Here news get around...
That girl you're looking for.
Why don't you look for her at the youth hostel in Pergusa?
Almost all of the girls from out of town end up staying there.
I was coming down to join you.
Why back so soon? Shall we go?
Sandro, what's wrong?
Nothing, forgive me.
- No Sandro, please.
- Why not?
I don't know why.
What's gotten into you?
Wait a moment, please.
Just a moment.
I feel as though I don't know you.
Aren't you happy?
You get to have a new fling!
What are you saying?
I was joking, c'mon.
I can never joke with you.
Now, though, you gotta tell me why you don't want to.
0h, Sandro!
I want all that you want, but...
But?
Did the landlady tell you about this hostel near by?
Yes, she started to, but I didn't feel like listening to her.
If we were to listen to all the rumors...
Yes, it's true, but...
We haven't been in touch with anybody, not even Anna's father.
We should have phoned, sent a cable...
Let's be fair, he must be feeling very lonely...
Right,
I don't doubt that for a moment, but we are the last two people that should be near him right now.
And then, phone... where?
Where is he?
As you wish... let's leave here though.
Go pack your bag.
Good evening.
Good evening.
- Show them to the reception desk.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Wait for me.
Marquise.
Concierge, who is that little doll?
She just came in,
I wouldn't know.
Claudia,
Claudia.
I'm looking for the others and here I find you.
How are you?
Could we find a quieter spot?
Quieter?
Yes, of course.
You seem well.
Here's Sandro.
Why don't you go up and change.
Did you get a good room?
Not really, apparently.
You should have told Ettore.
He always manages to get what he wants.
Is Ettore still angry with me?
0f course not.
And then you know, he would forgive you anything, as long as you admit that he's the better driver.
How can you wander through this bedlam?
You've always said people irritate you.
You mustn't always take me literally.
I'm really quite used to it.
First my mother, then my husband.
Both full of energies.
- Your mother?
- Yes, I too had a mother.
With a touch of Austrian blood in her, but I had one.
My childhood was like a merry-go-round: now here, now there.
Mine instead was a very sensible one.
What do you mean
'sensible'?
It means without any money.
Til later then.
Til later.
Please.
Come in.
You may leave them drawn.
As you wish, madam.
Would you like anything else?
- Nothing.
- Pardon me.
Thank you, thank you.
- Everything all right? Good night.
- Evening.
They might as well have used a machine.
Come in...
Please, put this one over here.
And that there.
- This is for you.
- Thank you.
Listen.
Try not to get too involved tomorrow.
Aren't you going to change?
But didn't you say you wanted to let your job with Ettore go?
Yes, yes, that's what I said.
It's freezing.
Sandro.
Yes.
I'm not coming down.
Why not?
I'm too sleepy.
You must learn to shake sleep off.
Have you learned?
0f course,
I learned as a boy.
I never slept, and I had friends that slept even less.
Whoever went to bed first had to pay a fine.
We didn't do anything wrong, but once the movies were over, we'd go to a café and talk, then we'd sit on a bench and listen to a drunkard, we'd watch the billboards go up, or the sheep go by, we'd run to the general markets...
0r we'd wake up other friends or a girl by calling under her windows.
Say, are you really so sleepy?
What time are you getting up tomorrow morning?
Late.
Late?
Very late.
Do you know that as a boy
I wanted to be a diplomat?
Can you imagine, me a diplomat?
It's strange but I never thought
I might get rich.
I saw myself in a rented room... a man of genius.
Instead, I have two houses, one in Rome, another in Milan.
As for genius, it's a bad habit I never caught.
What do you think?
I see it differently.
However, it's better if we continue this conversation another time.
Do you mind switching out that light there?
Good night, love.
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
Tell me again.
I don't love you.
I deserve that.
It's not true.
I love you.
At the bar.
Ask him to come here.
Ettore.
Finally!
How are you?
Come,
I'll introduce you to some friends.
Yes, I'll take a look around and then I'll join you.
Say. From tomorrow morning you're back at my disposal, clear?
If you don't give me some figures, how can I go on?
See you.
Patrizia. Patrizia.
Where is Ettore?
He must be asleep.
Would you see if Sandro is with him?
He's not in his room...
Forgive me, but -
Ettore.
What is it?
I was looking for Sandro.
And you look for him here?
Ask Claudia.
But of course.
Patrizia,
I'm afraid.
You're telling me!
I have nightmares at night.
No.
I'm afraid Anna has come back.
I can feel it, that they're together.
What has gotten into you?
We would have had word.
Sandro must be in the garden getting some fresh air, watching the sun rise.
It would be amusing to find out he's really a sentimentalist.
Listen, try not to dwell on that idea, please...
Go and get some sleep.
0nly a few days ago, only at the thought that Anna might be dead,
I felt I could have died too.
Now I won't even cry.
I am afraid she might be alive!
Everything is becoming so hideously simple.
Even to get rid of a pain.
0ne should never wish to fall into melodramatic undertones.
You're right.
Why should I cry?
I'm tired of being this way.
Dear.
Won't you leave me a souvenir.
Just a small souvenir.
Bring out Elizabeth Selwyn.
Bring out the witch! Bring out the witch!
Bring her out! Bring her out!
Witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Jeth row! Jeth row!
Jeth row!
Jethrow Keane, hast thou consorted with the witch, Elizabeth Selwyn?
No.
Burn the witch!
No! No!
Please!
No!
No! No! No! No! No!
Help her, O Lucifer, help her.
Elizabeth Selwyn...
...on this third day of March, in the year of our Lord, 1692...
...we, the people of Whitewood,
Massachusetts, condemn thee as a witch.
May the flames cleanse thy soul of its evil.
Of its lust for blood that made thee bring about the death of Abigail Adams.
Help her, Lucifer, help her!
I have made my pact with thee,
O Lucifer. Hear me!
Hear me!
I will do thy bidding for all eternity.
For all eternity shall I practise the ritual of Black Mass.
- Lucifer.
- For eternity shall I sacrifice unto thee.
I can feel my soul taking me to thy service.
O Lucifer, listen to thy servant.
Grant her this pact for all eternity, and I with her, and if we fail thee but once, you may do with our souls what you will.
Make this city an example of thy vengeance.
Curse it.
- Curse it for all eternity.
- Curse?
And let me be the instrument of thy curse.
Hear me, O Lucifer.
Hear me!
She's making a curse.
Curse?
Burn her! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn! Burn her!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
"Burn, witch! Burn, witch!
Burn, burn, burn!"
So shouted the people of Whitewood when they burnt Elizabeth Selwyn in 1692.
Little is known today of the actual practices of witchcraft in 17th century New England.
Superstition, fear and jealousy drove the puritans to accuse their friends and relatives of consorting with the Devil.
Parading around huge bonfires, repeating vindictive chants, they consigned the poor creatures to the flames.
Their tortured souls cried out in agony as the flames mounted higher and higher.
"Burn, witch! Burn, witch! Burn, burn!"
- Dig that crazy beat.
- Shh!
That will be all for today.
Tomorrow will be my concluding lecture on witchcraft in 17th century New England.
I shall bring along some illustrations, which I'm sure will interest you all.
I'll bring the matches.
Maitland!
Since you chose to attend these lectures,
I had hope that it was in the spirit of scientific curiosity about the subject.
That'll be all.
- How could you?
- He takes it all so darn serious.
He's got you all hypnotised!
- Oh, Miss Barlow?
- Yes, Professor?
- Can I see you for a moment?
- Yes.
What about our date?
- Look, urn...
- I'll meet you.
I'll wait for you outside.
Yes, Professor.
Rather a difficult young man, that.
You're more than an attraction to him than my poor efforts.
I've been reading through your papers, Miss Barlow.
They show a very sound appreciation of the subject.
I want to go to New England to do my senior paper.
Mm-hm. They're really quite good, you know.
Well, I'm not quite satisfied with them yet.
I feel like I need some first-hand research.
I wanna get the atmosphere.
Find out how widespread witchcraft really was, what the witches were really like.
- That might take a little time.
- Well, I have the time.
My brother and I were gonna spend our vacation with our cousins.
What I'd really like to do is to get a room in the smallest, oldest town in New England I can find.
Check through all the town hall records.
Recheck the libraries.
Talk to the puritan descendants.
Make a really thorough investigation.
Your brother is a Professor of science.
I hardly think he'd be interested in witchcraft.
Then I go alone.
You don't think he'd object to that?
You leave Richard to me.
He's picking me up here for lunch.
Hello, Bill.
- Professor Barlow.
- Nan here?
She's in there with him.
I don't like her getting mixed up in this witchcraft business.
Why not?
It's only part of her history course.
- Professor Barlow?
- Yes?
Before you go in there, could I have a word with you?
- Yes, sure.
- Well, it's about Nan and me.
Oh.
If you're really serious about this,
I happen to know the town in New England.
It's the identical place where the events occurred that I mentioned today, Whitewood.
It's quite a small place.
It's a little bit off the beaten track.
- So maybe these directions will help you.
- Thank you.
I think you might very well find what you're looking for there.
I happen to know the woman who owns the inn at Whitewood.
Her name is Mrs Newless.
So you just tell her I sent you.
Raven's Inn, Whitewood.
What's Whitewood?
Now, Dick, don't be too upset, but I'm gonna change my plans for the vacation.
- Change of plans?
- Yes.
I'm going to a place called Whitewood for a week or so to do some research.
Oh, are you?
And what about cousin Sue?
She's expecting you for her birthday party on the 17th.
She'll never forgive you.
I can still easily make it by then.
This is important.
My term paper's got to be good.
It could mean a scholarship.
- I've made all the arrangements.
- Dick, you'll have a good time without me.
My mind's made up.
I'm going to Whitewood.
But surely any good encyclopaedia will give you all the nonsense you wanna know.
Witchcraft is not nonsense, Barlow.
I'm sorry, Driscoll.
Witchcraft, black magic, sorcery, to me it's nothing but fairy-tale mumbo-jumbo.
I'm a scientist, Driscoll.
I believe what I can see, what I can feel and touch.
"The basis of fairy tales is reality.
The basis of reality is fairy tales."
As a scientist, you should be familiar with that quotation.
I don't believe somebody in Chicago can die of a heart attack, because some woman in New Orleans sticks a pin in a wax doll!
Maybe you don't, but practitioners of voodoo claim otherwise.
- Dick, you're just being difficult.
- No.
When I look into a microscope, I see the bacteria, swimming, fighting, existing.
That's real! These witches, they were persecuted and burned in the 17th century.
Were real too, but they weren't witches.
They were pitiful human beings.
Victims of hysteria.
There are many eminent scholars who have documentary proof of the actual practice of witchcraft.
Yes, but how effective was this practice?
Did any of these eminent scholars ever meet a real practising witch?
Did you ever meet a witch, Driscoll?
Perhaps.
Oh, come on. You're a historian.
No witch ever survived a burning at the stake for all their pacts with the Devil.
In 1692 Elizabeth Selwyn went to the stake.
She was buried in a churchyard in New England.
- And yet three years later...
- Yes.
And yet three years later a new wave of blood sacrifices broke out in the village that condemned her.
The daughters of the elders who had condemned her were found murdered with every last drop of blood drained from their bodies, and afterwards people came forward to testify they had seen Elizabeth Selwyn.
Stop! This'd be more effective at midnight with howling winds and crashing thunder.
And even then it wouldn't frighten anyone.
Dick!
I'm sorry Professor Driscoll.
It's all right, Miss Barlow.
You won't be the first person to have scoffed at the subject.
Honey, when you get to, urn, where is it?
- Whitewood.
- Ah, yes, Whitewood.
Well, send me a picture postcard of the witch.
If possible, autographed.
Now, uh, let's have some lunch, eh?
I'm sorry, I have a date.
Nan, darling, I still don't see why you have to go up to this Whitewood place.
Huh? I thought we were gonna have some time together during this vacation.
You know I wanna be with you.
It's just this is important.
Look, what the heck can you find that hasn't been found before?
I don't know.
It's just that maybe, hidden in some attic or buried in some old antique shop, there's something that might give a new outlook on the subject.
Oh, what new outlook can there be?
You're a science student.
You know how important research is.
But this isn't about anything real.
This is just superstitious people burning silly old women.
But suppose the women weren't silly.
Suppose they really had a pact with the Devil.
A pact that could have supernatural power.
Oh, come on. What kind of power?
I don't know.
Oh, look, it's no use, Bill.
We've both tried our hardest to talk her out of going.
Do you think she will find anything worthwhile?
I think we have to respect her desire to find something new, even if we don't agree with the subject.
Agree with it?
I've never heard so much nonsense as that guy Driscoll talks in all my life.
Well, here I am, all packed.
Oh. I suppose nothing I can say will stop you from going, huh?
Yeah, well, I'll, uh,
I'll put this in the car.
I still hoped you'd change your mind, Nan.
Don't worry, darling. I'll be back as quick as I can, and I'll write.
Well, don't forget me altogether, huh?
I won't. Give Sue my love, and don't forget we have a date at our party.
Bye, darling.
Uh, excuse me.
Can you help me? I seem to be lost.
Sure, if I can.
- I'm looking for the Wamport Road.
- Wamport Road?
Hardly anyone uses that any more.
Well, my friend gave me the directions.
Uh, "take road 28A, turn onto the Wamport Road,
"bear left at the fork through to Whitewood."
- Whitewood?
- Am I that far away?
No, ma'am. Not far.
Not many God-fearing folks visit Whitewood nowadays. If I were you, I...
If, if you'll excuse me.
I'm in a hurry. Which way is it?
Well, follow this road about two miles, you come to a fork.
There'll be a sign: Wamport Road.
Turn left, keep straight, there'll be Whitewood.
Thank you very much.
Does that sign say "Wamport Road"?
Wamport Road? Yes.
Oh, good. I was afraid I missed it.
- Is it Whitewood you seek?
- Yes.
I, too. Uh, would I be imposing if...?
No, of course not. Get in.
Thank you.
You'd think the Highway Commission would do something about these roads.
Watch out. Here comes another bump.
What is your mission in Whitewood?
Mission? Well, I'm going there to do some research on witchcraft.
Professor Driscoll gave us very interesting lectures on the subject.
I'm going there to get some original source material.
- Do you know Whitewood?
- I've known it for many years.
- Do you go there often?
- Fairly often.
Oh, then you must know the Raven's Inn.
- I shall be resting there.
- Oh, so shall l.
Oh, my name's Nan Barlow.
My name's Jethrow Keane.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
It's just like a picture out of a history book.
I feel as though I were in the 17th century.
Why hasn't Whitewood been written about?
It's off the beaten path.
Few tourists come here.
For Whitewood time stands still.
Look at that church.
Must have been beautiful.
What a shame they let it get so run down.
- Straight on?
- Yes, follow the road around.
Ah, there it is.
What a lovely old building.
17th century at least.
How picturesque can you get?
Right by the graveyard.
Yes. It has not been used for more than 200 years.
- Any witches buried there?
- There are, indeed.
All in a section of unconsecrated ground.
Spooky, isn't it?
Well, keep your fingers crossed for me, Mr Keane.
I hope Mrs Newless has that room.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Are you Mrs Newless?
- No.
- Oh, I'm Nan Barlow.
I was told I might find a room here.
I was recommended by a friend,
Professor Driscoll.
Perhaps you know him.
That will be all, Lottie.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Unfortunately, Lottie cannot talk.
I've often told her not to answer the bell.
Poor thing.
Then you're Mrs Newless.
I am. May I help you?
Yes, I'd like to have a room here for two weeks.
The hotel is quite full.
Oh, the guests are never about at this time of day.
Well, I'm a student of Professor Drisc0ll's.
He told me if I mentioned his name,
I'd have no trouble.
Well, there is a room
I could let you have.
It's just off the lobby.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Mrs Newless, that plaque.
Is it true that Elizabeth Selwyn was really burnt here for being a witch?
She was.
And do you believe she was a witch?
Come along.
I'll show you to your room.
I hope you will be comfortable.
Yes, it is a nice room.
The previous occupants have always found it most agreeable.
Well, if there's anything you should need, just ring the bell for me at the desk.
Thank you.
Oh!
It's been so many months.
I have counted the days till this holiday.
So have the others.
It wasn't easy for some of my guests to get here.
Many had to travel vast distances.
I was lucky.
The last few miles were enchanting.
Miss Barlow is very good company.
You must be tired, Jethrow.
Your room is ready.
And the festivities?
I am prepared.
Oh, Mrs Newless.
I thought I'd have a short look around town.
I won't be gone long.
I think you'll find the church interesting.
Unfortunately, it no longer has a congregation.
He will be pleased.
I'm told this was once a house of worship.
It is still a house of worship.
I am the reverend of this church.
As long as the breath of life is within me, this house shall remain God's house.
Must have been a beautiful building.
For me, it is still beautiful.
I'm sorry. What a shame that people have let it fall into such a state.
Strangers rarely come to Whitewood.
Who are you?
I'm Nan Barlow.
I'm staying at the Raven's Inn.
Why have you come to Whitewood?
Well, because I'm interested in witchcraft.
Young woman, leave Whitewood.
Leave Whitewood tonight.
For 300 years the Devil has harboured over this city, made it his own.
The people in it are his.
Evil has triumphed over good here.
Look at my church.
I have no parish.
No one worships here.
His is the power.
- What power?
- Leave Whitewood.
Leave Whitewood tonight.
I beg of you!
- What power?
- Leave before it is too late!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Please excuse the mess.
We haven't been open long.
- You have some very interesting things here.
- Yes, they belong to my grandmother.
When she died,
I came back to sort things out.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Then you don't live here?
No. My family have lived here for generations, but I've been back a few weeks.
- Would you like to have a look around?
- Thank you.
I didn't mean to frighten you when I came in.
It's just that all the people I've met here have acted like I'm a person from another world.
They don't see many strangers here.
And I had the most, well, unusual experience with the reverend.
He barred my way from the church.
And he talked to me about a curse.
And he warned me to leave Whitewood.
Can you explain that?
No, I can't.
Does he often act that way?
- He's my grandfather.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's all right.
It's happened before with strangers.
The lack of parishioners, the loss of his sight has made him bitter and suspicious.
I'm afraid what with him and the town,
I was very scared.
When I saw your lights
I made a dash for them.
I'm glad you did.
Do you have any books or pamphlets on witchcraft?
- You do, don't you? A friend of mine...
- We have a collection gathering dust.
But why on earth would you be interested in...?
- I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
- That's all right.
I'm studying it in college, and I've come here to write my term paper.
Just wait. I'll see what I can find.
That's Elizabeth Selwyn.
Burned as a witch, March 3rd, 1692.
Yes, I know.
I saw the plaque in the lobby of the hotel.
- You're staying at the Raven's Inn?
- Yes.
It was recommended to rne by a friend, Professor Driscoll.
- Alan Driscoll?
- Yes. Do you know him?
No, but my grandfather speaks of him.
His family come from here.
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Here. I think this'll do for a start.
What a lovely locket. May I see it?
- I believe it's quite old.
- Oh, it is. You're very lucky.
I'm even more lucky to have found this.
"A Treatise on Devil Worship in New England".
This must be a very rare book.
I'm afraid I couldn't afford to buy it.
You can borrow it if you like.
Oh, could I? That would be wonderful.
I promise I'll bring it back in a few days.
- You're very welcome, Miss...?
- Barlow. Nan Barlow.
Nan Barlow.
- Thank you very much. Good night.
- Night.
Mrs Newless!
- Mrs Newless?
- Yes, Miss Barlow?
L- |- I've heard some strange noises in my room.
Oh, possibly the water in the pipes.
This is a very old inn.
No, it seemed to be coming from the cellar underneath.
I hardly think so, Miss Barlow.
The cellars do not extend beneath your room.
But then why is there a trap door in the floor?
The ground was filled in many years ago to strengthen the foundations.
- But I'm sure...
- If you insist, I will come and see.
I don't hear anything.
Well, just a few minutes ago...
- Never mind. I'm sorry.
- You're welcome.
But you can see, there is no ring in the trap door because there is no reason to lift it.
There is nothing underneath but earth.
Come in.
Oh, hello, Lottie. Come in.
Oh, I don't need any more towels.
I haven't used mine.
They're quite clean.
Lottie... I've told you before not to bother the guests.
Miss Barlow, I thought you might care to join the others.
I will as soon as I finish my notes.
I'll put some clothes on and join them.
"A Treatise on Devil Worship in New England".
Well, do you find this interesting?
Well, it's fascinating.
The things I've learnt.
I bet you don't know the half of it.
And you live right here on a spot where the witches were actually burnt.
Listen to this.
"On Candlemas Eve,
February 1st, in the year 1692,
"a coven of witches... " a coven, that's 13, some men, some women,
"whose power came from the Devil
"gathered beneath the Raven's Inn
"to perform a black mass in the honour of Lucifer.
"The witch, Elizabeth Selwyn, later to be burnt at the stake,
"marked a young girl for sacrifice
"by obtaining an object of value belonging to her, with which to call her.
"And leaving in its place a dead bird and a sprig of Woodbine.
"The witches sacrificed her on the altar,
"and drank her blood at the hour of 13."
What's the hour of 13?
Well, personally I have never heard a clock strike more than 12.
- Now, how about joining the dancing?
- In a little while, I promise.
Oh, by the way,
I seem to have misplaced my locket.
I remember having it in my room, and now it's disappeared.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll ask Lottie.
Well, I-I'm not saying it was stolen.
It's just I remember having it on the dresser, and now it's gone.
I would appreciate it.
Of course.
I'll look into it immediately.
Lottie, I have warned you too often about annoying our guests.
If you disobey me again,
I shall turn you out.
And if I turn you out, there will be no place for you anywhere.
You do understand, Lottie, don't you?
Ah, Miss Barlow.
I'm afraid Lottie is nowhere to be found.
I will enquire about your locket first thing in the morning.
Oh, thank you.
Where is everybody?
Most of the other guests have gone to the services.
Services? On the 1st of February?
Candlemas Eve.
The night when the witches mock the rituals of the church.
Are you all right, Miss Barlow?
Yes, quite, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night, Miss Barlow.
Mrs Newless!
Mrs Newless! Mrs Newless!
Quiet.
No! No!
No! Let go of me!
Help! No!
Let me go! No!
No! Take your hand off me!
Let me go!
No! No! No!
Let go of me! No!
Six, seven...
No! No, Mrs Newless, no!
No! No! No!
I am Elizabeth Selwyn.
No! No!
- No!
- Let go of me! Let go!
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday, dear Susie
# Happy birthday to you #
Mmm, yummy.
Delicious.
Dick, have you got any idea what's happened to Nan?
I'm sure she'll show up.
She's probably met a good-looking he-witch.
Bringing him, but his broomstick blew a gasket.
It's not like Nan to be late for anything.
Aren't you a bit worried about her?
She'll be here.
I'm sure she'll make it.
That's probably her now.
You answer the door. I'll put a record on for some dancing.
All right.
- Hi, Dick.
- Bill.
What's the matter?
Expecting somebody else?
Oh, yes, Nan.
Come in, come in.
Nan? Isn't she here yet?
We made a date to meet here before she left for Whitewood.
Well, she probably got held up.
Look, look, give me your coat.
Nan was never late for anything in her life.
Relax. Take it easy.
Enjoy the party. She'll be here.
Dick...
Dick, I haven't had a letter from Nan in over two weeks now.
She's probably been too busy working on her paper.
Oh, no. There's something wrong,
I know it.
- Will you do something for me?
- Mm-hm.
Ring up Whitewood, will ya?
Ask 'em, ask 'em if she's left.
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.
OK.
Hello. Long distance.
I'd like to speak with a Miss Nan Barlow at the Raven's Inn, Whitewood.
No, I don't have a phone number.
What, didn't she give you the phone number?
Why, no, but that's my sister.
They say there's no such place as the Raven's Inn.
But that's crazy.
She's staying there.
Give me the police.
She left in such a hurry, she must have forgotten to return it to you, Miss Russell.
She seemed such a nice girl, too.
Wouldn't have thought she was the sort who'd forget.
We cannot always judge by our first impressions, can we?
I'm not usually wrong about the people I lend my books to.
Well, perhaps you'll be more careful in future.
- Thank you for letting me have it.
- Remember me to your grandfather.
Lottie! Get out of the way, you clumsy creature.
- Can I help you?
- We're from the Sheriff's office.
We had a call this evening.
A missing person report for some college kid named Nan Barlow.
The party calling said her last known whereabouts was the Raven's Inn.
Nan Barlow. That's strange.
Yes, I met her.
When did you last see her?
About two weeks ago.
She came to my shop, and borrowed this book.
It's quite valuable, and not hearing from her,
I decided to come and get it.
Mrs Newless had it.
- May I?
- Yes.
"A Treatise on Devil Worship"?
I must put this in the report.
Peculiar things some of these college kids do nowadays.
Well, thanks for your help.
Come on, Charlie.
Hello?
Yeah.
It's the police.
Yeah.
OK, thanks.
Thank you.
Well?
The police sent a car out to the Raven's Inn.
Nan checked out two weeks ago.
- I don't get it.
- Well, neither do I.
Look, these are Nan's books and papers.
Go through them. See if you can find anything which might give us a lead.
I'm gonna pay a visit to a colleague of mine.
Oh, Lord of Light, accept this sacrifice.
- Why, Barlow.
- May I come in?
Well, yes, of course. Please do.
Can I take your coat?
I tried to phone you last night, but I guess you weren't in.
No... No, I wasn't.
Would you care to go in the study?
- Sit yourself down.
- Thanks.
You take a drink?
Brown soda.
- Ice?
- Please.
- Now what's on your mind?
- Well, Nan's missing.
And she has been since the day after she arrived at Whitewood.
Really? You quite sure?
It's what the police said.
- What are they doing about it?
- Carrying out a routine check.
I don't suppose they can much more until they've got something definite to go on.
I would have thought there was a great deal more.
What? As far as they're concerned, she disappeared two weeks ago, and no one in the village seems to know anything about it.
- What have you come to see me for?
- I thought you might have some ideas.
- Why did you send her to Whitewood?
- It was the best place for her research.
- You suggested she stay at the Raven's Inn.
- It's the only inn there is.
With an unlisted phone number.
The inn has its own clientele, it doesn't need to advertise.
- How do you know it so well?
- Because I was born in Whitewood.
I see. Then you'd have every reason to believe she'd be perfectly safe in going there.
I've no reason to suppose she wouldn't be.
Nan struck me as being perfectly capable of taking care of herself.
I grant you that, but why hasn't she come back, or let us know?
I can understand your anxiety, but I'm quite sure there's nothing for you to worry about.
She's probably got absorbed on the subject, and gone off someplace.
I wish that all my class had her application.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna find out where this application led her.
I'm going to retrace every step Nan took.
I'm either gonna find Nan, or know what happened to her!
- I can't stop you from going.
- No.
- You're not afraid?
- Afraid? Why?
If anything did happen to your sister, and somebody went to find out about it...
- The same thing might happen to them?
- Possible.
You seem to think something happened to my sister?
No. You are jumping to conclusions.
Really? I shall find her.
- Professor Driscoll?
- Yes.
I don't like to disturb you, but may I see you?
Of course. Please come in.
- Good luck in Whitewood.
- Thanks.
I'm sorry, but did you say he was going to Whitewood?
Yes, he is.
It's silly to be surprised, but I've just come from Whitewood.
Really? It's quite a coincidence.
My family happens to come from Whitewood. I was born there.
- Yes, I know.
- Please sit down.
Thank you.
- Care for a drink?
- No, thank you.
I think you know my grandfather, the Reverend Russell.
Russell? Oh, yes, of course I do.
How long have you been living in Whitewood?
Since my grandmother died a few weeks ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, now how can I help you?
I've come about a pupil of yours? Barlow.
- Nan Barlow?
- Yes.
She came to Whitewood two weeks ago.
I met her and liked her.
She told me that she was a student in one of your classes.
That you recommended that she stay at the Raven's Inn.
It's quite right, I did.
That's what I've come to see you about.
On the day after she arrived, she disappeared.
- Oh?
- Later the police came asking questions.
The family were worried.
I thought you might have their address.
Why do you want her family's address?
Because I have something of hers
I want to return.
Leave it with me, and I'll make sure they get it safely.
I don't want to trouble you.
If you just give me their address...
As you wish.
Her address is Dorchester Street.
225. She lives with her brother.
He's a colleague of mine.
You just met him.
He was leaving when you arrived.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a lot of work to do.
I'm rather a busy man at the moment.
- Thank you for your help.
- Not at all. I hope it achieves something.
- Remember me to your grandfather.
- Yes, of course. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Miss Russell.
Yeah, it's Nan's locket, all right.
As far as I know, it's unique.
I gave it to her.
Where did you get it?
The servant at the inn gave it to me.
It was strange.
I don't think she wanted Mrs Newless to know I had it.
- Mrs Newless?
- She runs the inn.
Oh. Why did you come here,
Miss... Miss Russell?
I found this.
It's Professor Drisc0ll's notepaper.
I found it in a book I lent your sister on her first evening in Whitewood.
When she didn't return it,
I went to the hotel.
- What was the book?
- An old book. A book about witchcraft.
Do you believe in it, Miss Russell?
I don't know. Sometimes I think
I almost live with it.
Live with it?
It's an obsession of my grandfather's.
Up till now I didn't take him seriously.
He's an old man.
But now I'm beginning to wonder if what he says isn't true.
What does he say?
That there's something evil about the village.
And on a certain night the inhabitants leave the streets, close their doors and stay behind them.
That on these nights the dead come to life.
Nights like Candlemas Eve?
What do you know about Candlemas Eve?
It's in one of Nan's books.
I don't believe it!
Things like this don't happen today.
In Whitewood I wonder.
I'm going to Whitewood tomorrow after classes. I can give you a lift.
Thank you, but I must get back.
I can't leave my grandfather alone.
He's blind.
May I come and see you when I arrive?
I'd... I'd like to have a talk with him.
Please do. It's the house next to the church. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you to the door.
- Would you be going to Whitewood?
- Yes.
Would you take me along with you?
It's a dark night for walking.
You're the Reverend Russell's granddaughter, aren't you?
- Yes, how did you know?
- I know a great deal about Whitewood.
- Have you ever been there?
- Now and then.
- I've never seen you.
- To see me is a special privilege.
It's reserved for a chosen few.
What does that mean?
We'll soon be at Whitewood now.
This is as far as I go. You will...
She's pretty, too.
Yes, she is. Very pretty.
A living descendant of those who were cursed.
It somehow seems to make it better.
Another day.
And tomorrow...
The Witches' Sabbath.
Which way to Wamport Road?
Straight ahead. Fork in the road.
You see a sign, turn left.
- You heading for Whitewood?
- I am.
- Many people head this way?
- Not many.
Is this the only way in and out of the town?
In this direction, yep.
You wouldn't remember by any chance a pretty girl in a convertible about a month ago?
The Barlow girl. Read about her in the papers. Never seen her again.
- I told the police.
- Thanks.
Could you tell me the way to Whitewood, please?
Another one. Straight ahead.
Fork in the road. See a sign,
"Wamport Road", turn left as you ride in.
All right, thanks.
Let me warn you, young fellow.
They don't like strangers in Whitewood.
OK. Fine. Thanks very much.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'd like a room, please.
The inn is closing.
Well, I'll only be here a few days.
But the inn is closing.
- When?
- In two days.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay until then.
If you insist.
And could I... could I have the same room my, my sister had?
- It's still available, isn't it?
- Yes, it's available.
Mrs Newless, you told the police that my sister checked out.
You are mistaken, Mr Barlow.
I told them that on the morning of February 2nd,
I went to her room and found it empty.
Her bed not slept in.
Her luggage and car gone.
And her bill unpaid.
Well, you can put the charges on mine.
- When was the last time you saw her?
- On the evening of February 1st.
It was shortly before midnight.
She'd been in the lobby dancing with some of the guests.
She seemed to be enjoying herself.
Did any particular guest pay special attention to her?
Not that I noticed.
Your sister kept very much to herself.
You know why she came to Whitewood?
It is not my habit to enquire into people's private business.
Would the fact that she was investigating witchcraft antagonised anyone in the village.
Hardly. There have been other students here, you know.
Besides, your sister was a very agreeable and likeable young woman.
Well, have you any idea where she might have gone?
- None.
- Thank you.
Now, may I see the room?
As you wish. It is this way.
If you should need anything, and I am not at the desk, you have only to ring the bell.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- I'm so glad you've come.
I saw your car outside the Raven's Inn earlier.
I wondered what had happened to you.
I've been talking with Mrs Newless, and then I took a walk around the village.
Find out anything?
Everyone here seems to be afraid of something.
Then you don't think it's just my imagination?
I don't know. Who's to say where imagination ends and truth begins?
It's nothing tangible. It's...
Just the way they look at you.
I felt it too.
May I see the... the book that Nan borrowed?
Yes, I put a marker between the pages where she must have stopped reading.
Sit down, and I'll tell my grandfather you're here.
Thank you.
I warned you, Lottie.
Grandfather, this is Mr Barlow.
How do you do, sir?
God be with you.
Shall we sit where we'll be more comfortable?
Here's your chair, Grandfather.
You must be tired.
I am. Really tired.
I have little strength left these days for the fight.
Won't you sit down?
I'll make some coffee.
Fight against what, Mr Russell?
Against the evil that besets this village.
The people are creatures of the Devil.
They know no other God.
You mean they worship Satan here? Today?
Satanism was never stronger than at the present time.
For 200 years the people of Whitewood have carried out rituals that mock the Church's teaching.
I find it very hard to believe, sir.
Do not doubt, my son.
It is real enough.
For years I struggled against the witches.
Their master took away my sight.
It seems incredible.
I have tried to convince others.
They too found it unbelievable.
But I know these people have a pact with the Devil.
To worship him and do his works.
In return he gives them eternal life.
- Eternal life?
- Aye.
And to seal this bargain they must sacrifice a young girl on two nights of the year.
When are these nights, sir?
Candlemas Eve and the Witches' Sabbath.
Candlemas Eve.
That's, that's February the 1st.
- And when is the Witches' Sabbath?
- Tonight.
Now you know why I came to see you.
I had no idea it was so late.
May I... may I have a rain check on the coffee?
I'd like to have a few words with Mrs Newless again.
- Of course.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- I'll see you to the door.
God be with us.
Miss Russell, do you think that Nan's disappearance is connected in some way with these... witches' ceremonies?
Yes.
Well, I'd... I'd like to come back later, if I may.
- Please do. And my name is Pat.
- And mine's Richard.
I think I feel better now you're here.
Well, I'm... I'm gonna stay until I find out what's happened to Nan.
Take care.
Now drink your coffee before it gets cold.
You must not see that young man again tonight.
- Why not?
- The Devil comes in many disguises.
I'll get you a spoon.
Grandfather, there's a bird in the drawer.
It's got an arrow through it.
Go and look on the front door.
- It's a sprig of Woodbine.
- Shut the door! Shut the door quickly!
- Grandfather, what does it mean?
- Now, listen, my darling.
This is their sign. The witches' sign.
- What can we do?
- We must leave here.
Leave here immediately.
I'll start the car.
Somethings wrong.
They've wrecked the car.
Barlow! Phone Barlow!
Hello? Hello?
Hello. I want the Raven's Inn.
Yes? Mrs Newless.
Mr Barlow?
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Hello?
Dick, I'm in terrible danger.
We've got to leave Whitewood at once.
Danger? But from what?
'We've got to leave...'
- Pat? Patricia!
- 'Please help me!'
Pat!
Patricia! Pat!
Pat!
Patricia!
Mr Russell, are you there?
Mr Russell.
What's happened, Mr Russell?
The witches...
The witches... have Patricia.
Destroy them.
- Mr Russell, how?
- The shadow of the cross.
Use the cross.
I adjure thee, O creatures of salt by the living God.
Mr Russell.
Maitland! Maitland, what, what's happened?
Pat! Patricia!
Hello? Hello, operator?
Damn!
Pat!
We've been waiting for you.
Dick, these are the dead who killed Nan!
Barlow!
Please help me!
Come on, Pat! Hurry up!
Quick! This way!
Dick!
Dick!
No!
- Pat!
- Dick!
Maitland! Get to a cross! A cross!
A shadow of a cross!
Dick! Dick, he's moving!
Lift the cross!
Quick!
O creatures of salt,
I adjure thee by the living God.
Back from the cross!
Come nearer, Bill.
- Get the shadow over them!
- It comes nearer.
We dare not fail.
We must finish the sacrifice.
- Dick!
- Pat!
Wait. Wait for the hour of 13.
Pat, are you all right?
I think so.
Bill!
I have a score to settle with Mrs Newless.
You stay here.
the day of the dead is celebrated in
Mexico in a unique way, because...
...Mexicans have a rooted sense of the dead. they make toys, bread and sugar
...skulls. they place an offering at their homes with flowers... and food, so they can eat and drink. the worship of the dead...
...comes from the natives, but during the 16th and 17th...
...centuries, their customs and believes were mixed with those...
...of christianity, so their rites and practices are a combination of...
...both cultures up to this day.
MACARIO
For whom is that candle?
For your goodmother, Rosa.
May she rest in peace.
She was always very kind with us.
And there won't be a candle for my dad?
No, my child. thanks God your father is alive. this is only for the dead.
At Mr. Narciso's they're mounting a big offering...
As usual... they're so pretentious, even with the dead...
..we aren't. this is what we eat, this is what our dead eat.
Are you back, Macario?
Yes, I'm back.
Please give these flower to your woman, for your offering. thank you.
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day, Macario. dad is coming!
What did you bring to us?
Later, later.
I brought nice things. children, what are you doing? dad, dad!
- Give me one, give me one.
- Easy, easy...
I brought lots of things for everybody. the baby first. there you are.
Me, me.
- A little bird.
- It's so nice!
- Is it to eat?
- Not at all.
Look, it's so nice.
Our Father, who art in heaven, we thank you...
...for our food today. May we have it tomorrow.
In the name of the Father...
...and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
I have finished, mom. that's not true. His mouth is full yet!
I want more.
- I want more.
- So do l. can I have more?
- Me too.
- Give me more.
- Please give some more?
Eh, look! come here, it's so beautiful!
Lots of food! the dead are going to eat everything?
If I die, can I come to eat here?
No, only rich dead people eat here.
Ours eat at our offering. then, I'd better not come!
Mom, can we go out to see the market?
Yes my children, you can go, but behave...
...I'll be with you in a moment.
Mom, if they don't behave, can I beat them?
No, you can't.
Good morning, chona.
Good morning. It's 3 real.
And why is that much? they sent many lace shirts from
Mr. Ramiro. It's more expensive.
You always find a way to overcharge.
We'll hear Mme. Eulalia.
Hey, tell her not to forget my dead's tip.
Mme. Eulalia was saying that dead people are not pretext for money.
Ask her anyway.
- Good morning.
- Hi Macario. come in, the sir is here.
How do you do, Macario?
Wait a moment.
Because dead is giving us a lot of work today.
So many candles, uh?
And you see, they're not enough for today. dead are more than these.
Aren't you going to buy yours? they're cheaper for you.
No, thank you. that's too bad,
Macario.
We've got to be nicer with the dead...
...because we spend more time dead than alive.
Anyway, we all are born to die.
What do we earn here?
A bust, and sometimes, no even that.
Lots of work...
...many troubles.
When we're born, we're carrying our death in the liver...
...or in the stomach...
...or here...
...in the heart, that one day will beat no more.
It can also be outside...
...sitting under a tree...
...that hasn't grown yet...
...but that will fall on you when you're old.
When we're born, we're carrying our death in the liver...
...or in the stomach...
...or here, in the heart...
...that one day will beat no more.
It can also be outside...
...sitting under a tree...
...that hasn 't grown yet...
...but that will fall on you when you're old. dad, look at my skull. dad, I also want one. can you buy me the big one?
I also want one, dad.
I want many!
I will buy them for you. they gave me my dead's tip.
Wait for me at the cloister. I'm going to deliver the firewood.
I prefer a sponge cake.
- I want this one.
- I prefer this one.
- You want to many things.
- I prefer this one. choose whatever you want.
- Good morning.
- How do you do, Macario?
Hey, Mr. Alfredo...
...it's very late and I haven't got my bread yet!
My dead are waiting since very early.
It's delayed, please excuse us.
But here we have a very special order from Mr. Ramiro.
Bet not from Mr. Ramiro!
He's got his own oven, so he has tasty home bread.
But his oven draws bad...
...so he brought six turkeys to be cooked.
He has important guests.
So my bread won't be ready!
It'll be ready later. Honest.
O.K.
What do you think of our turkeys, my friend?
Our? Are they yours too?
You'll see...
...those of us working with Mr.
Ramiro, eat the same as him.
We have very important guests today. dou you know who's coming? canon cristino
Alatriste.
Who is that one?
Everybody knows him!
He's...er..
Be careful, you're going to throw the juice.
Get it in!
Are going to give us the wood for free?
What happens to him? He didn't even ask for a dead's tip.
Be careful!
Be very careful not to drop them because you'll have to pay. don't finish them. Leave me one. Leave one for me!
What happens, Macario?
Nothing. Go back to sleep.
Macario...
Macario, won't you eat anything?
Kids have already eaten your part.
But I reserved just a little when
I noticed you weren't having lunch.
If you don't go, they'll eat it as well.
Let them eat it!
Aren't you hungry?
Hungry?
Hungry?
It's the way I've been all my life.
Like you. Like my children.
My only thought were to eat.
We've been starving all of our lives.
You saw those turkeys yesterday.
I won't be starving slowly anymore.
I'm going to die at once.
I won't eat anything until I can...
...eat a turkey by myself.
...without sharing it.
Not staying hungry to let others eat.
Although the others...
...be my children.
I want to eat by myself.
All for me...
All of it, and if not,
I will never eat.
I want to be full...
...not hungry...
...with the turkey's flavor in my mouth...
...not wanting another piece.
Give the kids what you reserved for me...
...because I'll never eat again.
Here you are,
Macario come on Macario. take it.
Give it to the children.
- First me.
- Me! the younger first.
You wait here.
Hasn't chona told you that I like skirts?
Look at this! this is impossible!
I ran out of starch....
...and at the moment I had no money to buy more. don't expect to pay for them like this. take them away and bring them back properly.
Mariquita, the last one...
...will go and see...
...if they live or die, to run away!
She's dead!
Run!
Mariquita, the last one...
...will go and see...
...if they live or die, to run away!
He's warm.
You turn around, and run this way...
...and you see Milano eating parsley...
...he's not here, he's in his place...
...the rose is coming up and the carnation is fading away...
She's dead!
Macario! take this.
You said you wanted just for yourself.
I understand, Macario.
I have also wanted something for myself.
So I won't need to share it.
Not even with you.
But go away right now.
Because if the children see it, they will want their part, won't they? come on... come on, Macario... take it now.
Hey friend... the turkey you're about to eat looks so good.
Are you going to invite me?
I'm not your friend.
And I'm not going to share it.
Hey my friend...
...that animal looks so tasty...
Let's make a deal.
If you give me one leg, nothing else...
...I'll give you my silver spurs.
What do I want a spur for?
I don't have a horse.
Well...
...I can give you some other thing... can you see the buttons on my trousers? they are made of gold.
If you give me a slice of the breast...
...just a slice of the breast...
I'll give you these coins.
And what am I going to do with them?
If I went to exchange them, they'd cut my hand for thief.
A guy like me doesn't pay with gold coins.
Go away, leave me alone!
Well Macario, this deal is going to be a lot better.
If you give me a wing...
...just a single wing...
I'll give you this whole forest.
All these trees will be yours...
...What do you say?
What would I gain if
I were the owner?
I'd have to cut, carry and sell the wood, as I do today.
Besides, you cannot give me this forest, because it's not yours...
It's from God, our Lord.
Hey man, do some charity for me.
You, sir...
...want a piece?...
Just a bite...
...if you want to share it.
Why sir?
Why?
You're not interested on this bite.
You're interested in a gesture...
...an action...
...you know that I hadn't wanted anything for me alone in my whole life. then this desire...
...for you is a dead animal.
It's just an excuse to behave well.
It's everything for me.
All the hunger of my life.
All that I have given. All that I haven't received.
Forgive me.
I know that you can forgive me if you want.
I don't want to share it with you. I don't want to.
But if you really want a bite...
Friend, all that turkey is just for you?
I'm very hungry.
I've been hungry for quite a long time.
It's been thousands of years since I last ate. can you share a bite with me?
I knew that this couldn't be true...
It was too much to ask.
I'm going to share it with you.
I'm going to cut it in the middle.
Pick the one that you prefer. thank you very much.
Some water?
No, thanks.
Very tasty!
I can say that your wife cooks great. does it bug you if we talk?
I speak so rarely to men.
Rarely.
We meet an instant and there's really nothing to say nor time to spend... can I ask you something?
Why did you invite me?
Because you were very hungry.
It was quite clear.
More than l, ever. that's why you invited me?
Well, yes.
Mainly because of that.
And the first one who asked you...
Why didn't you invite him? that one? Of course not!
He wanted to fool me.
Above all, if I didn't invite my children nor my wife. do you think that some spurs or some coins...
...worth more than my family's satisfaction?
But, you know...
...the second one?
Why didn't you invite him?
He's the owner of everything that exists...
...of you...of everything.
He only wanted a gesture from me.
After inviting him, I'd have run full of repentance...
...to invite my family, and
I had eaten almost nothing.
And to me, why did you invite me?
You said that mainly because of my hunger...
...or is it there any other reason? the truth...
...when I saw you I thought I wouldn't have time even for a bite.
When you show yourself, there's no time for anything. then I estimate that if I gave you a half and we ate at the same time...
...while you ate, I'd ate too.
You have invited me...
I've been in the company of you...
...and I have even laughed a little.
So I'm indebted to you and
I'm going to reward you.
I'm going to pay for your invitation at such a price as you never dreamed of.
Now empty you container.
Give it to me.
Macario, this water can cure any illness.
As long as I have no reason to impede the health of the sick.
I give it to you.
And think that no man has got the power I deliver in your hands.
Watch the way you use it.
If you visit a sick man, I'll always be by his side.
When I'd be at the foot of his bed, give him a drop.
A single drop of the water I'm giving you.
Because that'll be enough to cure him.
But if I'm at the top end... try nothing. He'll die.
You don't believe me, do you?
It's all right.
I'll make that very soon... today, you'll have the chance to believe me. today?
And be careful. don't spill a single drop, because
I'll never give you more.
And remember...
If you see me at the foot of the sick...
...with a drop you'll give him health.
...and if I'm at the top end... try nothing. that person belongs to me.
See you later, Macario.
We may not talk again, but we'll see us often.
And remember.
Use my gift wisely.
And be worthy of my friendship. there he is!
Oh my God, he's cold. touch him!
Please cover him!
- He's already cold. Save him please.
- Oh my God.
My son...
Son.
My son...
I saw him walking straight.
As if he were conducted. and although I shouted, and ran...
Poor mother.
My son. talk to me son. talk to me. talk to me.
We ought to get vulture broth...
...it's very good for this!
No way! that's only good for rabies.
Macario's coming!
- Parents can predict things.
- Yes, of course.
He'll be able to close his eyes.
Yes. Oh my God.
- dad!
- dad!
My brother fell on the pit
Go out!
- I told you to go out!
- No Macario!
Leave me alone with him!
Wait for me outside.
Please don't move.
Stay there.
Mom, my dad's back!
Are you going to serve the food?
Waait for me at the cloister. I'm going to deliver the firewood to the bakery.
So here's the woman of the healer. they have told me. things that people make up.
When there's a gossip...
Is it true that he only touched him and he cured him? there are people that have those gifts.
But I haven't met any of them. tell your husband to cure
Mme. Eulalia. She's so ill.
She doesn't even shout nor tell off.
She's really sick.
I'll bring you the dirty clothes in a moment.
Macario, now we know that you have healing gifts... tell me, is it true that you cured your son?
- things people tell.
- But why do they tell them? there's all the wood.
You keep to yourself, don't you?...
Mother, if you save Eulalia...
...I promise you a gold medal.
And look, well...
I promise you the medal...
...and a little gold crown, a little one, for your son...
...but save her.
In the name of the Father...
Macario, someone's coming.
You're Macario, aren't you?
- to serve God.
- do you know me?
- You're Mr. Ramiro.
- I'm rich, Macario.
My wife is ill. I don't believe stories, but the doctor has done all he could...
My wife is covered with suckers...
...a hundred leeches sucked her blood, but she stays the same. they say you can cure and
I don't believe it.
Is it true that you can cure?
It is true that I can sometimes cure... come with me to see her...
If you cure her, I'm going to give you whatever you want.
O.K. Wait for me there.
I need to be alone with her, Mr. Ramiro.
Alone?
It's the only way that
I can do something.
I have to object as a doctor that this man obstructs the work of science.
Please doctor, come this way.
Mr. Ramiro!
I can cure your wife.
How much are you going to charge me?
How much do you think her life worth?
Well...
...I'll give you...
...I'll give you... ten gold ounces. that's the value of her life for you?
I pay one ounce to the doctor.
But I'm going to cure her.
And how much do you want?
I want...
One hundred ounces.
One hundred ounces!
It's all right.
I'll give them to you.
But when she's completely cured. do you hear me?
What time is it?
It's..It's the dawn, sweet heart.
Why are you awake?
I'm very sleepy.
You cured her!
I told you I would.
Well...
I've got to pay. Of course.
We've said...
...it was pretty expensive...
Give me ten ounces. that'll be enough.
I don't want your enmity, but your gratitude. take it. Here's your money.
What are you doing, my husband?
You haven't slept all night long.
I'm planning business.
Hey...do you remember who else is sick among our friends?...
...besides the ones
I'm going to name...
Mr. Manuel centeno de la Barrera,
Mr. Josè Luis torres Salazar....
...count Francisco de Valderrama.
Our Father, who art in heaven...
...thank you very much for our food today.
May we have it tomorrow...
...the same!
In the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
How nice to see you.
Please come in...
I hope your father is not seriously ill.
He's not my father. He's my grandfather. He feels very ill.
But...
...you think he can be cured, of course.
You praised your doctor so much that...
Yes, but there's a limit.
Of course, it is possible.
Let's get him in. thank you.
Boys!
Be careful.
He took my job away, and now you have it!
What is his size?
He needs to be alone.
Please.
What are you doing here? Who are you?
Who the hell has got me in here?
Why isn't here anyone from my house?
Where the hell is everybody?
Why do you look at me with such a stupid face?
Get out of here! Get out right away!
MAcARlO dO HlS BUSlNESS HERE. dON RAMlRO'S GUEStHOUSE.
Ladies and gentlemen, open your eyes...
...and listen carefully
...pain, discomfort and groans are over...
...discomfort and groan....
... they come quickly in carriages...
...because everybody is in a rush...
...if they want a place to be cured by Macario...
... to be cured by Macario.
He 's cured many rich people, but at God's willing...
...money worth nothing....
...rich people also die, rich people also die.
Thhe doctor and the carpenter win...
Thhe widow cries afflicted, she 's going to lose all her money...
...she 's going to lose all her money.
Macario doesn 't allow it, because he 's an honest man...
He gives it back to the widow, and it's well done
...it's well done.
Look at Macario's wealth.
He's won my boss.
Well, not that much, but you can see the change.
How much would he paid?
Of course, he cures only rich people! that's not true. Macario cures everybody.
And he charges whatever they want to pay. My grandfather had only a pig...
-...and that's all he paid.
- that's true...
...I gave him only a dozen eggs...
I would have given him the hen, but he didn't want her.
He accepted my goat. I didn't have another, and he ate it in barbecue.
But you can see
I'm good as new!
Not that new! thank you boys. the one in the corner.
So Macario cures miraculously.
He's a sorcerer, isn't he?
He's not a sorcerer.
It happens that Holy
Virgin guides him...
...tells him how to cure.
No Virgin at all. It's the archangel Gabriel.
You think Holy Virgin would bother to come? that's what archangels are for...to help her.
I haven't smell incense when Macario passes by.
Furthermore, the opposite.
And what's the smell? Sulphur?
He smells like a person, like sweat.
Very funny, isn't it?
- the last rites.
- the extreme unction.
Who is going to die? those rites are for an old lady that came ill yesterday.
But Macario has already told her that she's a hopeless case.
So he also knows who's going to die and who doesn't.
He does.
- He's very wise, isn't he?
- Fortune-teller!
- Who are those men in black?
- they've been sent by the Holy Office. the lnquisition!
Mon, mom!
She's not here. Let's go!
Mom, mom.... dad, dad! dad, dad... dad... this is abundance.
So many things!
You've been thinking well, very well...
You've got to have a stock.
I didn't think about it. It was Macario.
Very well done. Well done.
You never know, and since
God is helping you.
Yes. I hope it's God.
Of course it's God. Who else?
Mom, mom!
I'm here.
Mom, we didn't find my dad, nor anybody. Help us find him.
Yes children.
Let's go.
- I'll be back soon, chona.
- Go on, don't worry about me.
I prefer the other house because we didn't get lost there.
Where are you, my woman!
- Where is everybody?
- Here.
- Why do you hide?
- We don't hide, we got lost. dad, dad! take it. I'm going to see the sick.
I'm so afraid! Let's go with mom!
- I'm afraid.
- We'd better go with mom and dad.
Let's go.
Mom, I'm so afraid!
Mom!
I'm not opposed that you arrest him and take him to the city.
But Macario has brought wealth and health to town...
...there will be a riot to defend him!
We can wait and ask for forces.
How big can that riot be? the whole town!
It may be the whole country, we'd crush it!
Beating and killing people?
It seems that you don't agree the Holy Office.
No, no, never...
It's only that he's just been accused, and he can be innocent. that man out of hell is guilty with no doubt.
Out of hell? Maybe...
But the church never had so many candles...
...and alms as today.
Well, if you need to arrest him, it would be wise to do it in secret. catch him carefully, by surprise, to avoid a slaughter.
Wife!
Wife!
Keep this.
But keep it safe.
What is it?
It's our family health.
Macario.
Why you have you never told me who taught you how to cure?
Where do you get the water from? All of this...
...the house, so many things.
I'm afraid, Macario.
You watch your children...
...and do the house work.
Everything else is your husband's.
Macario...
Why don't we go back to the other house?
MAcARlO dld BUSlNESS HERE
Easy!
Why are you doing this to us?
So you'll learn what's the authority.
You two keep on searching.
Get out!
Open it!
But sir, what have we done?
You are sorcerers, blasphemers and heretics. come on.
But sir, why do break it? Here's the key.
Law doesn't need keys. come on, open it!
Break those bottles.
It doesn't seem sane what you're saying, Macario.
Remember that if you're discovered lying by this court...
We can get the truth by means of torture.
I swear sir that I have told the whole truth.
When did you start to cure the sick?
I have already said so, sir. the first one was my son...
How did you know how to cure him?
When you walk on the mountain, you learn many things.
If we went to the mountain with you, would we learn to cure too?
It would depend on you and not me what you learn, sir.
Isn't it the devil who taught you how to cure, Macario?
No, sir, it's not the devil.
I'd say that it was
God, our lord.
And maybe even the
Holy Virgin.
And how could you know who is going to die and who isn't?
You learnt that on the mountain too?
I'd say that I learnt that with the sick themselves.
When you practice, there's no possible mistake.
Where do you notice it? In the eyes?
In the feet and in the head, sir.
Officer! the prisoner must wait outside!
We're going to deliberate.
If this man is a charlatan...
...the punishment will only be to cut his tongue...
...and pillory him for one week.
But if he has a pact with the devil...
...the torment and he'll be burnt at the stake. that's why I believe it's very important to clearly define...
...if he's a charlatan or a sorcerer. there's a test that has come to my mind...
A test?
- What is it about?
- It's very easy.
Some of our prisoners are ill, aren't they? true. the blasphemous
Jewish is dying.
Well, let's put all the sick in a cell...
...and we'll put in there a healthy one as well.
A soldier or the executioner...
...the executioner is very healthy.
And Macario should tell us what is going to happen. that way we'll know if he's either a charlatan or a sorcerer.
Very good idea.
Excellent, isn't it?
We can also include the condemned person that will be executed tomorrow. that's true.
Give the instructions.
- Are here all the sick?
- All of them.
Well, I have reserved these two beds.
One is for the condemned person.
Get him here.
You are going to be on the other. don't make me lie here!
I want nothing with sorcerers. come on, don't be stupid.
What can he do to you?
If I knew, I wouldn't be afraid.
Please leave me in my job.
I only know how to torture and hang people, and I do that well.
If you want it, I can fill the sorcerer's ears with lead...
...but I don't want to be lying here, alone with him
Stop your sobbing! take that hood out an lie down!
Let them know that everything is ready.
I'm sweating...
...and my heart is beating as if it were to explode!
Please don't do this to me!
Shut up and obey!
You're shaking, sweating and you're pale... that's good. You look sicker than the other.
Have mercy on me!
If you're keep on like this, you'll have a reason to cry.
He's asked to be alone with the sick.
It's the only way his wisdom comes out.
We'll please him. Let's leave him alone.
Not this one?
Nor this one that looks so bad?
Not anyone?
Anyone what?
Anyone what? this one!
I will.
Me, what? What about me?
Sirs, I can tell you, sirs.
Well Macario, we're waiting for your diagnosis.
- We'll see the surprise!
- Let's see.
Everybody is going to live, but one.
I've already said so! charlatan!
Of course the dying one will die.
Everyone will live, except that one.
See who he's chosen.
You'll lose your tongue, Macario.
We won't need to burn him.
Even the condemned person will live? tell the dying one to get up!
He's dead! His heart stopped beating. this is heavy!
I bring a pardon from
His Excellency. the condemned person will only be in prison for life.
A pardon.
He's given a pardon so he can pray from his cell...
...for the health of the son of
His Excellency the Viceroy...
...who is very ill.
Out of hell! truly from hell!
He is a sorcerer with no doubt.
He knew it exactly.
And the dying one was pretending to avoid torment.
He was healthy.
It's strange.
It's a miracle, sir.
Miraculously, the
Holy Virgin!
I trust the power of the Holy Office. the works of the devil are false. that's what they are, hoaxes.
My husband...
I'm impressed. they have told me about a miraculous man with powers over life and dead.
You too, my wife?
It's too much!
I would have believe from a peasant, but..
I'm a mother and l see my son dying.
My lady, Viceroys can't have anything to do with devil's sorcerers.
Our prestige is jeopardized.
I don't care about prestige!
I care about my son's life.
We must bring that man.
He won't come. then I'll look for him to his cell wit my son in my arms...
...and will see how prestige is endangered more.
Oh my God!
Macario.
Macario, why are you in chains? this cell...
How did you manage to get in and see me?
I took what we had hidden...
...and I've given to these people.
And our children? they are at chona's.
Because...
...the soldiers broke into our house...
...they destroyed everything...
...they spilled your medicine...
It doesn't matter any more. they are going to do the same to you?
Well, you see...
...you mustn't believe that they'll burn me...
...that won't be true....
...nor that I'll be tormented.
It is sure that it won't happen.
No, Macario, no.
Macario, come with me. the
Viceroy's son is very ill.
You'll have the chance to cure him.
If you cure him, you'll be very lucky.
You can be the doctor at the court.
How am I going to cure him if l don't have any more medicine?
You spilled it.
If that boy could be saved...
...there's no medicine
You'll find a way. Follow me!
Macario...
...our health you said,
I brought it with me.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Where is the ill boy, sir? can't you hear the mother's sobbing? come on, get in at once!
Excuse me, sir...
...I've got to see him alone.
As you wish.
But remember, you'll be pardoned if you save him. torment and fire if he dies.
My friend...
...this cannot be...
...you can't take this one away...
...don't you know that I'll be tortured and burnt if you take him?
What are you doing there?
Go to the other side!
I ask it remembering that turkey.
Go to the other side...
Let him live...
But you got me into this.
I didn't ask for it!
I can do nothing. It's a Supreme Order. think on my children when they see me burning.
And think on me!
...Still alive, but burning and screaming!
Let me cure him.
Please, my friend.
You have called me friend.
..show me that you are.
Let me cure him.
Let him live.
Open the door, please.
Is the boy cured?
Open the door!
Help me!
Help me!
How do you do, Macario?
You're just in time.
And as usual, I'm ready to help you.
See how mistaken you were about your guest.
If I were the invited one, nothing would have happened to you. come, and I'll show you how to be a winner. come on, hurry up!
I've already told you that
I don't want your help!
Go away, leave me alone,
I've had enough!
And besides you!
It's again you, my lord... don't leave them reach me, my lord.
It's you who pull them, Macario.
Your deeds follow you... don't run anymore and face them. think about saving your part that doesn't die. think about you. think about your deeds.
Weight them and judge them.
I've got to run, my lord.
I've got to run.
Welcome to my cavern, Macario.
Hide me. they're going to reach me.
Why did you betray me?
I haven't betrayed you...
And I'm with you more than ever. this is a place that no man has seen yet. there are things here that you should learn. come.
Look Macario. this is mankind...
You can see lives burning quietly...
Sometimes the winds of war or the winds of plague blow...
...and lives extinguish by milliards randomly... the high ones...
...the small ones...
...the right ones...
...the twisted ones.
Now there is peace.
Look at them burning.
Each one is made of different wax.
Each one is unique. they last depending on the material the flame is burning... can you see this stub of a candle? this is the life of the Viceroy's son.
You can see it here. A life.
You can see how fragile, how delightful and how brief it is.
Like a butterfly from eternity.
And you've been playing and trading with this...
...and you never understood the significance of the gift I gave you.
Look at this flame! the Viceroy's son is dead now.
Why did you do that?
It was the time. there's a supreme order.
..there are laws. there are many things that you don't understand.
And what about my candle?
Where is my candle?
I want to see it.
- It's extinguishing!
- Yes.
Aren't you going to do anything?
Are you going to let it extinguish? there's an order,
Macario.
But you can! there are many candles extinguished! don't let it extinguish.
Everything has its end and its place.
We can't do nothing. don't touch it!
I know what you're going to do.
It's in vain, Macario. Who do you what to escape from? From me? From you? come back!
It's the moment to rest and be judged.
A story ends, and another one starts.
When the deeds of mankind finish...
It's because the judgement is going to begin.
Macario, don't run anymore.
What for?
Macario, Macario, Macario!
Macario!
He's never back this late.
Always at sunset.
He went out so happily today.
Macario!
Macario!
Macario!
Macario!
He's here!
He's sleeping.
Macario.
Macario.
You were like a child.
With your whim.
I am so glad. to have given you that whim.
Life wasn't easy, Macario.
But it was good to have lived it together.
Macario...
I'm going to make our children to be like you.
Good men.
He couldn't even finish his turkey. the End. translated by:

La cabina, S.A.
This is the Radio Tabernacle
to ask this question:
Have we an anti-Satan missile?
While we've been conquering
polio and space...
... what have we done about the devil?
Darling?
You downstairs?
I'll be right down.
- Mother!
- Don't shout, love.
I'm right here.
I don't know why I don't keep this in my room.
I simply adore it.
- Well, you better wash it first.
- Really?
I don't think too much washing is good for Lowestoft.
In cool water. I'll do it.
- I have to get my breakfast things.
- Oh, I'll get them. You start on down.
- Go on now, darling. Go ahead.
- Did you leave me a note?
- What?
- One of your little love notes.
Like you used to.
Well, yes, but I don't want you reading it until I've left.
Go ahead. Start down.
Is that new shaving stuff?
- Marvellous scent.
- Guaranteed to make me irresistible.
You better get a move on.
- The radio says traffic's fierce already.
- Okay.
Oh, you go ahead. I don't have patience for that contraption.
I don't blame you. I'll be glad when I don't have to use it anymore.
It's really gonna be hot today.
It's warm right now.
American or Russian...
The expected death toll from
highway accidents as well as
swimming and boating mishaps
may well exceed
last year's record high.
They always sound so sort of pleased.
- What?
- Drive very, very carefully, love.
I always do.
"Careful" Malcolm they call me.
"Un-Headstrong" Hilyard.
I do wish you could try to cut down on your smoking.
I'll try.
Who are your guests going to be this weekend?
- Peggy and Paul?
- Oh, just the three of us.
I'm cook, Paul's butler and Peggy gets to be waited on.
We'll miss you.
Perhaps we can go up together in the fall.
I should be through with this wretched thing by then.
Although I keep dreaming that maybe the stock market will go zooming up, and we can go to Paris.
London and Paris.
All this war talk in the papers, maybe we should go into armament stocks again.
It seems such a terrible way to make money though, don't you think?
You're gonna be all right now?
Nellie's available?
I'll call Nellie if I need her, you if I need you, ice company if I need ice, the coal company if I need coal, and the happiness people if I need happiness.
Yes, dear, I'll be fine.
I squeezed some fresh orange juice for you.
I'll get something to eat on the road.
I read an article about blood sugar and hot days.
Orange juice is highly recommended.
How about that other article you read last month, that it's actually healthier to keep your blood-sugar level low?
What?
No, I'm kidding, darling.
Though your health hints do sort of overlap sometimes.
Tease me all you want, but drink it.
That's a good boy.
I'll be back by...
Oh, lunchtime, Tuesday.
Maybe right after lunch.
Such a large suitcase for one small weekend?
Why not? I don't have to pay excess baggage to the car.
Oh, Lowestoft, cool and pure
Passion remote and beauty secure
Who wrote that?
Come to think of it, it's a line of mine.
That's getting old, forgetting your own work.
- What?
- I was just wondering who wrote a bit of verse and then remembered it was I.
Darling, you really had better get started, or it'll just be traffic, traffic, traffic.
Goodbye.
- Give my love to Peggy and Paul.
- I will.
Have a good time, love.
Now, what the hell's the matter with you? lt'll be all right in a minute.
I suppose all the electricity
in the neighbourhood is off.
I'm sure people are calling up
like mad.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I never felt so idiotic in my life.
Happy weekend!
The movement to the mountains,
lakes and beaches continues.
Everybody is heading
for the great outdoors.
Here in the city,
the nude, decapitated body of a
woman has been found in a cistern...
Dear workmen, wherever you are, please hurry and fix everything.
Please?
I'm really being absurd.
My mind has me dying of thirst.
Really.
Oh, my.
Well...
...this is what it's for.
How many times I've passed
bells ringing.
Just walked on.
Well, I never will again.
At least not for several days.
I'm here in my own house,
a few feet from cars and people.
Or is this panic?
Hello!
Well, I'm not going to stay here half the morning.
I don't care how much racket I make.
How does that poem go?
Here in this city
This busy place
Here in Cleveland, Paris,
Des Moines, Babylon
We have conquered fear
Have we not?
We have not.
Without light...
...this would really be a tomb.
Really be a tomb.
Save the batteries.
Nellie, is that you?
Whoever is out there,
I am trapped in here.
You see, I broke my hip last April, and we had an elevator...
Hello?
Hello?
In here!
In front. In the elevator.
Whoever it is, I will build a small shrine to you.
Hello!
I was afraid I'd be trapped in this miserable cage till my son gets back Tuesday.
Why won't you answer me?
Answer me!
Oh, boy.
Graven images!
Repent!
Help!
Repent!
Help! Help!
- Help!
- Repent!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Help! Help!
- Repent! Repent!
Help!
Repent!
Where does he get that toaster?
An old wino?
A 40, $50 toaster.
A bottle of good wine, cigarettes in his pockets?
An old wino?
Lady and gentlemen, do you have some business with Mr. Paul?
On account of the holiday, he will be closing earlier today.
Step up or step out.
I wonder where he's going.
- Don't you wonder where he's going?
- Yeah.
He must have found something real good, all right.
Don't you think?
Yeah.
Turn.
Turn.
Turn.
Turn.
Turn.
We'll save you, dear.
Reach.
Ring, somebody.
Nellie...
Nellie, please.
Call...
...me...
...up!
Malcolm, love...
...call me up.
He's dialling.
It's getting ready to ring.
Now!
Malcolm, baby...
Call me up.
Call.
What the hell?
What?
What? Who?
What the hell?
Two bucks?
Who'd be giving me two bucks?
Oh, my God.
Old "Repent, Repent, Repent."
What are you doing down there on your knees? You praying at my door?
You gave me two bucks a while back, and I says it's a loan, and you says, like, you didn't think you'd ever get it back.
- Well, you did.
- Yeah.
Repent, repent, repent.
Yeah, I remember you.
I told you my name.
It's George L. Brady Jr.
Yeah, well, it's early as hell, honey.
What time is it?
It's 12:04.
Saturday. All day.
You can keep it.
- Why?
- Well, I thought maybe
I could tell you about something.
We can make money.
- I don't work with nobody no more.
- No, nothing like that!
- So come on in.
- Yeah?
What's the deal?
There's this house, and she's stuck in an elevator, the lady, till probably Tuesday, she says.
I need somebody with a suitcase to help me out.
We could do real good, clean out the whole house probably.
You had two bucks, you could've got a suitcase.
Oh, there's a lot of wine.
There's a room full.
Wine, huh?
Yeah.
And you want somebody to keep you away from the wine long enough?
- Yeah.
- Nursemaid, huh?
Me?
What kind of stuff in that house?
Oh, everything.
It's three stories high, a private elevator, and you could see the things all around.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I thought maybe, you and me, we could take a trip.
- You wanna have a piece of toast?
- No, I don't eat much.
Maybe that's the trouble.
Oh, okay.
Hands off in the morning or you'll repent for real sure.
Alouette, gentille alouette
Alouette, je te plumerai
I'll write a poem in my head.
Oh, I haven't written anything but letters in so long.
Oh! I have worshiped thee,
False god
For thou art false, electricity
Ye gods, what a rhyme.
Kilowatt is his name
And we did burn incense to his power
But lo, one day
Our god Kilowatt left us
Could we then go back
To the gods of our childhood?
To reindeer, Santa Claus?
Almost, almost got it.
Almost...
...almost...
...almost got it.
Wow!
Wow!
Wow, honey,
I never saw nothing like this, not even in magazines, not even in advertisements.
How much you think it's worth, like, this spoon?
Not even in advertisements.
I'm right in the sun, and I'm sticky and sweaty. What's happening?
Must have been some kind of alarm bell.
How about we go look in some windows?
Two minutes.
What's that, now?
It's a cup, like for babies, but it's...
I think it's a gold one.
I heard of silver ones, but a gold one!
"Baby Malcolm Cornelius Hilyard.
Weight 7 pounds, 3 ounces."
- Gold.
- Let's go look what's upstairs.
What's the matter?
George is your name?
George. Yeah. George. I told you,
George L. Brady Jr.
The L is for Luckman, that's my mother. German.
George, this is big.
This thing you found us here is big, real important, and I'll always be grateful, but let's not lose it out of being greedy.
- What do you mean?
- Suppose somebody comes,
- you could handle him?
- I don't want no other man.
I just don't.
Okay, George.
Let's look at the rest of the house.
You just can't make up your mind, can you?
Repent one minute, slobber the next.
Slobber, slobber.
Here's the...
A lot of wine.
Close that door. Close it.
Close that door!
My whole future is at stake!
Close it yourself.
Get out!
You want some other man here instead of me, go on, get out!
Call your butler, why don't you, and have him escort me to the door.
Stop her.
Take it off the hook or something.
Help! Help! Please help.
1132 Lenko.
Emergency. Help!
This is Mrs. Hilyard.
I am trapped, address is 1132 Lenko!
Help! Help! Please.
I am trapped in small, private elevator.
1132 Lenko Street.
1132 Lenko Street.
Help! Please help. I...
This is my house.
My son's and mine.
I broke my hip a few months ago, and I am somewhat incapacitated.
I need help.
Haven't you ever needed help?
Perfume?
Isn't that perfume? A woman?
Are you a woman?
Listen.
Hello.
My name is Hilyard.
I am Mrs. Hilyard.
What's your name?
Won't you answer me?
Please answer me.
Let me alone! Leave me alone!
Somebody! Run! Somebody!
Arriba.
Did you think you could keep this to yourselves?
An old wino and a fat hustler?
What is this?
What are you doing here?
Oh! I cut my rear. I think I'm cut bad.
If you're cut in your rear, muchacha, you ain't cut near nothing delicate.
I'm bleeding all over my dress, all over the floor. I think
I'm bleeding to death.
I think I cut a main vessel. I gotta find a place to stop the bleeding.
Now, you better tell me what you're doing here with these things on your faces.
What are you afraid of?
Afraid of being identified, dad.
She see you, the lady in the elevator?
Oh, no, no, she didn't see me.
Hey, how about this big old flop-flop!
We really got ahold of something super!
- I can't see good with this thing on.
- Leave that on your head.
Randall's always talking about holding up a bank money truck or something.
- Keep the mask on.
- Okay.
This is so you won't be recognized either, wino.
I know who you are.
You followed me here.
This is my place I found, now, you leave here.
What's happening?
On your knees, dad.
Hey, cut it out. Cut it out.
Cut it out, cut it out.
"Cut it out."
It is hot in here.
What did you do to him?
Is he alive? What did you do?
Oh, his breath is moving.
He ain't dead.
Hey, look at that tub!
Look at the size of that tub.
There's room for two.
Three. Four, maybe.
A ball.
Elaine.
I...
I did tell you, leave your shirt on?
Okay, load her up.
Let's get to work.
Oh, you're hard. I never... I never seen people as hard as you people.
Somebody taking a bath?
You're our pickup truck, our little old pickup truck.
I ain't toting for you.
Pickup trucks, they don't answer back.
Elaine.
- You come out and carry too.
- Drop down dead.
Wait a minute. Please listen.
Take it all. You can have anything you want.
Take anything you want, take anything you want, but in the name of humanity, help me get out of this horrible cage.
Couldn't you let me out of this cage?
Please. Please.
Please!
What...? Who...?
What monsters.
Do your stealing and get out.
Steal and get out.
What sort of creatures are you?
Oh, even animals would have more simple compassion than you.
What? You're something holier than thou?
You're something...?
You ain't no animal?
I am a human being.
A thinking, feeling creature.
Well, me, I'm an animal.
Right now I am all animal.
A lot of time I can't even make animal.
A lot of time I'm just what they call "inmate."
Animal is better.
What do you mean, inmate? Asylum?
You're from some asylum?
Asylum?
Oh, no, you don't.
Reformatory, work farm.
I been inside every way there is to be inside.
I been some kind of inside since I was 9 years old.
Oh, I see.
You're one of the many bits of offal produced by the welfare state.
You're what so much of my tax dollars goes for the care and feeding of.
Well, I don't know from "offal."
But yeah.
Yeah.
And I sure do wanna thank you, ma'am, for all them tax dollars.
The food is lousy though.
Hey, you got another load of stuff?
We're piling it on the back porch.
Yeah, come on up.
The world must have ended.
Someone on one side or the other
must have pushed the button,
dropped the bomb.
Ladies and gentlemen...
... here before us stands...
... the man of tomorrow.
We made us cities and towns and
thought we had beat the jungle back,
not knowing we had built
the jungle in.
I suppose every hospital room's
a jungle...
... every neat little room where
somebody's having his body opened...
... or lies dying.
Every marriage bed...
... love bed...
... lust bed.
Elaine.
Elaine!
Put this over your face.
That's it, hand it to me, come on.
Help me, somebody!
I missed that.
Help me!
Help!
Why hast thou blinded me?
Oh, God!
Blind!
- Why hast thou blinded me?
- He thinks he's blind.
- Oh, God, Lord God.
- That ain't so funny.
Who is it? Who is it?
Who's...? Who's laughing?
He has blinded me.
Am I so much guiltier than others?
You ain't blind, honey, now, take it easy.
- You ain't blind. See? See?
- What is it? Who is it?
It's Sade, it's Sade, just old fat Sade, honey.
Now, take it easy.
You're all right.
Which one of you knocked me out?
I did, pop.
Wanna fight? Come on, get your dukes up.
He just wants to go home and so do I.
Yeah, I'm tired, and I'm fed up with this thing on my head.
She can't see us up here.
Why can't we take them off?
Essie...
...lock the back door good.
Elaine's gonna take a bath.
Oh...
...we'll decide about you going home.
Gee, thanks so much.
I'll be back.
They have took everything, everything you could hock.
All the silver, all the jewellery, everything.
I could just... Just break their necks.
Who are you calling?
I told you you couldn't handle this alone.
Hello, Mr. Paul speaking.
Mr. Paul, this is Sade. Remember?
I live in that building Mr. Zimmer owns.
I'm sort of plump?
I'm onto a real hot deal,
Mr. Paul, real hot.
I'm closed now for the holiday weekend.
I'm taking my wife and her mother out now.
No, listen! There's a whole great big house here.
A private-elevator type of house, and we are being cut out.
There's silver like you've never seen.
1132 Lenko.
- Solid silver spoons, gold, everything.
- Randall, let go.
Locking us all in.
Now what?
Ouch!
Randall, you trying to boil me?
It's hot.
You get used to it.
Sure is better than an old shower, ain't it?
Guess so.
Just gonna lie here and soak.
Essie.
All right, Essie, dear.
Get a good look.
You seen my feet.
Well, come on in, dear.
Sure is a big tub, all right.
You gonna get in with her?
Sure. What the hell.
What I been thinking is...
...we wore the stockings and all...
...but she heard our voices and she sounds real smart to me.
So, what I've been thinking is, why leave her around when we go?
Kill her?
Scared?
You're both chicken, ain't you?
What they got in this state?
They got the hot hot seat?
Practically killed the wino anyway.
Just luck I didn't.
Yeah, they got the hot hot seat.
The hot hot seat.
I mean, if you don't mind that, then there's nothing to mind.
I mean, that's the worst they got.
Why don't we kill all three of them.
- What is it? What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Just dirty talk. I never heard such dirty-talking people.
I'm gonna see...
Maybe I can sneak out and get help.
Get help right back.
Dirt. Dirt everywhere.
We all ought to be punished.
- I'm so glad you feel that way.
- Right. What do you mean?
Come on. That's it. Get him wet.
That's the way.
Duck him again. Come on.
Hey, Randall, look at the red lips on him, isn't he pretty?
Don't kill me, I'm not the lady.
You're rich.
- Aren't you good?
- Hold him still, Randall.
Oh, so pretty.
We'll put a little red...
...and some mascara...
Hold still.
Oh, you're such a pretty girl.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus God.
I ain't Jesus, honey. Fact.
I just work here.
Now, pick them up, put them back.
We're going inside.
Why?
What do you want me for?
I think we're gonna kill you.
Come on.
Pick it up.
Come on, come on!
Okay, Elaine, he got her.
Hey, pop.
Can't we trust you either?
I told her not to run away. I told her.
You gonna let us keep some of this stuff, huh?
You know, I found the house.
We're gonna kill you, pop.
All of you.
You...
...and the pig.
And the human being.
A joke, right?
Well, why? What have we done?
Why us? What have we done?
You're here.
- Get dressed, Elaine.
- I am.
You're here, pop.
That's what you done.
"You're here, pop.
That's what you done."
That's what we all have done.
We're here.
Stone Age, here I come.
Hustle, baby, hustle.
Hustle, baby.
I gotta sit down.
I'm a heavy woman.
I just gotta sit down.
We're not covering our faces no more.
On account that we trust you.
Now, Mr. Wino...
...would you like to sit over here next to the other witness?
I believe you know her.
Good day, ma'am.
My name is Randall Simpson O'Connell.
Now, it's too bad that you're not gonna live to identify me.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Elaine.
Come and watch the human being be sick in a cage.
Come on and look.
Don't start nothing, I'm coming.
"Don't start nothing," she says.
Human being, don't you start nothing.
I do not want to die among laughter.
Death is...
...solemn.
You.
Mr. Randall, you let me go, huh?
I never done no harm.
The only person I hurt is myself.
You...
You're just kidding, ain't you?
You...
You ain't gonna kill nobody.
Kill the wino, Essie.
- Now?
- Now.
No, not with no praying, no cleaning of my dirty soul.
Now, wino.
Hot seat...
...here we come.
Come on, pop.
Wave to the human in the cage, pop.
He's...
...dead, just like that. That's all.
She expected bugle music.
We're going to have a party
We're going to have a party
We're going to have a party
We're gonna have a party
Oh, you missed the short subject.
But we're coming to the main feature now.
Have your met our human being?
Con permiso, Senor Doctor.
- Scalpel, doctor.
- No, thank you, doctor.
Like we always say at the Mayo Clinic...
...fingers got made before knives.
Stop right there.
I'm just a hustler.
I ain't even a user.
I'm just a hustler.
No.
No.
She'll be there when we're ready for dessert.
She doesn't want to die, that poor woman.
I don't blame her.
I don't want to die either.
I'll pay you to stop this animal orgy,
$10,000 in cash.
Ten thousand? Ten grand?
What's this?
I smell me a trick.
A foxy trick, ain't it?
We'll go downtown together
Tuesday morning, when the banks open, and I'll make arrangements.
"Arrangements," huh?
- Now, where was I?
- Randall, that's real money.
What would you do with real money?
Well, we could sit around and have kids or something.
Go away and have kids, what the hell?
Kids of yours and mine,
I wouldn't trust them with a dull kitchen knife.
They'd cut us up the minute we closed our eyes, right?
Okay.
Let's do her together.
Maybe we gonna sit in the hot seat all right, but I got relatives that can use ten G's pretty well. Let's...
Look, there ain't no ten G's.
Fox... Foxy here is just trying to stay alive till Tuesday.
- Ain't that right, Foxy?
- On that desk of hers up there,
I've seen bankbooks and like that.
Now, I wanna go and look and see if I can tell. Ten G's!
If she's got it, Randall,
I wanna try for it.
Oh, you two would believe anything.
Help! Help! Police!
Get police! Help! Help!
Get help! Get police!
Police! Help! H...!
Police! Get police! Help!
Must have just been kids.
There's nobody there.
Some crazy little firecrackers, that's all.
Kept old Foxy here alive a couple minutes more, didn't it, Foxy?
Come on, everybody.
Randall?
- Not yet.
- Now.
- I wanna do her now.
- Essie!
What are you calling Essie for?
- I'll get him, Randall. That's ten G's.
- Come back.
Come back!
You two are the original suckers.
She is smart. She is...
Die! Die! D...!
What is it? What's the joke?
She made herself two real cute little knives.
Only they bent.
I can't tell by the bankbooks up there.
But listen to this. It was on her desk upstairs. It's from her son.
It says, "Darling Mom..."
Hey, how about that.
This whole letter, he sounds real, what you might say, gay.
Is your little boy married?
What is it you're holding?
- Where did you get it?
- What am I holding?
A letter that was in the desk upstairs.
You wanna hear it?
Oh, let her die curious.
Warm them up nice, mummy.
I'll bet you had him at it till he was about 12, didn't you?
Kept him sucking.
- Okay.
- Randall.
There's something important in this letter.
Something maybe more important than ten G's, right here in this house.
What is in that letter?
There's a living room safe. Read it.
"Darling Mom.
I'll be 30 next Wednesday...
...and I won't have many more chances in life."
What? What?
"Every time I try to leave you...
...you add a room...
...or dress up the house...
...or charm me."
No.
And I thought you only had him at it till he was 12.
You still got him at it, haven't you?
How do you charm him, baby?
Read further on about the safe.
I had a holier-than-anything old crow of a grandmother.
She tried to keep me at it too.
Oh, I'd have killed her if she hadn't died.
Like she was trying to kill me.
Like you kill this what's-his-name...
- Malcolm.
- No. No.
This is his studio.
He decorated it himself.
Complete freedom to come and go.
He wanted to stay here.
Why would he write me a letter?
A letter?
We were as close as...
- He's not married, is he?
- What?
Doesn't even have a girl, does he?
He has many fine women friends.
Oh, yeah, women friends he met in the public shower rooms, I bet.
"Give me my half of what's in the living room safe."
- What safe?
- What?
"Give me my half of what's in the living room safe.
Release me from your generosity.
Release me from your beauty.
Release me from your love."
Oh, love.
Love, you could've had your half anytime you wanted it.
My half too, for that matter.
Read her the P.S. That's got what you might call buckshot in it.
- A real load in it. Read it to her.
- "P.S.
Think it over.
I'll call in a little while.
Please make it yes.
Or quite simply...
...l'll kill myself."
- You didn't kill her?
- No. Fainted.
Lying on the floor like a pile of old clothes.
Well, I'm going to look for the safe.
Elaine, how about you looking over there?
Old crow.
Old crow baby.
Randall!
Mr. Paul's out in the back.
- I saw him through the window.
- Who?
Mr. Paul, the junkman, the fence.
What's he doing here?
There are four or five of them.
They're taking the stuff out of our car.
That old wino must have tipped them off.
What?
Malcolm.
Malcolm, love.
Oh, my God.
Lakeville...
...two, five...
...seven... No.
Lakeville...
Something... Seven, fi...? Oh, no.
Operator? Operator? I can't dial.
Operator, a number out at the lake.
I've forgotten it.
It's a Lakeville number.
Malcolm C. Hilyard.
Please dial it for me.
Operator, ask information.
Can you hear me?
This is an emergency, operator.
My son may have killed himself.
Do you hear me?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I may have killed my son. Operator!
Hurry up.
Let's go. Let's go.
Help.
Police.
Police.
Police.
Police, police, police, police.
Police, police, police.
Well.
Look who almost nearly got away.
Almost nearly.
Help!
- "Help!"
- Damn you! Damn you!
She stuck me in the eyes.
I can hardly see.
Go get her. Go drag her in here, that old crow!
Are you blinded, Randall?
No, I ain't "blinded, Randall"!
What do you think I am, that old wino?
He who unleashes the terror reaps the terror.
Shut her up. Shut her up!
- He who unleashes the terror...
- Shut her up!
Knock it off.
You shut up too.
Are you blinded, Randall?
We are going into that living room and we are gonna find that safe.
Now, today ain't gonna be a total loss.
We are going in there and look!
- Okay. Let us go look.
- All right.
All right.
Essie, you look over there.
Elaine, you look that side.
- What are you going to do?
- I am gonna look too! Now, let's go.
Well, you find it?
Come on, did you find anything?
Malcolm.
Malcolm.
You're all right.
You're all right.
Malcolm, where are you going?
You're not going away again.
You...
Malcolm. That letter.
You didn't mean it.
It's just being cooped up here all these months.
Listen, we'll take a trip together.
London, Paris, Rome.
Just you and me, all the places you love.
We...
Release me from your love.
Release me from your generosity.
It's all true.
I'm a monster.
A monster.
- I'm...
- Essie!
Elaine!
Essie!
This ain't no time for jokes.
I'm hurt. I'm hurt!
I need a little help.
I admit it, I need a little help!
All right. All right.
I hear you.
I'm hurt. I'm hurt!
I admit it. I need a little help!
Hear me?
I hear you, Elaine.
- Someone...
- Essie!
- Help.
- Elaine!
Someone...
Where's the safe?
I want the safe.
- Are they dead? Are they dead?
- Gotta get help.
Murderers!
Neanderthals!
Monsters!
Monsters!
Take it easy.
Stop them! They must be arrested!
Stop them!
- Hey, can you drive?
- Sure I can drive.
What do you think?
Don't you hear me?
- Leave her alone. Don't touch her.
- Don't touch her.
- Murderers!
- Somebody call a doctor.
Get them out in back!
All right. Come on. Get out.
How many cards, paI?
Give me two.
How many are you taking?
Two for you, and the deaIer takes one.
I bet five IoveIy rubies.
I see your five, and I raise you three.
You're bIuffing.
Try me.
I'm in. What have you got?
A flush.
What do I owe you now?
To keep it simpIe...
500,000 Spanish doubIoon... and 2 1 /2 bucks cash... for your share of the map.
For this? Where'd you get this?
Three-FingerJack.
OnIy eIeven Spanish gaIIeons?
I think Three-FingerJack... is hustIing us.
I don't think so.
There's the rocks.
O.K., who goes over first?
How many times?
Once.
Your dance.
You aIways Iooked good in basic bIack.
Wrong.
ProbIems, probIems, probIems.
BIack 8 on a red 9.
Oh, thanks.
Find anything?
Yeah. A coupIe of nosy sharks.
Hey, at Ieast you had company.
Ha ha ha!
Any sign of the 1 1 gaIIeons?
No.
WeII, you must have seen something down there.
Yeah. A dead bIonde.
A dead bIonde?
Was she pretty?
She's one bIonde
I know didn't have more fun.
Coast Guard.
This is Straight Pass caIIing Coast Guard. Over.
Straight Pass, this is Coast Guard.
This is Straight Pass.
I'd Iike to report a body floating off FowIey Rocks.
Is it a hazard to navigation?
Is it a hazard to navigation?
No.Just a dead, wet bIonde... hanging around in a bIock of cement.
Over and out.
Roger, Straight Pass.
Hazard to navigation?
Ha ha ha!
These post-mortems give me gas.
And to think I had... a briIIiant future in pediatrics.
O.K.,Jerome. O.K.
She was dead before she went in-- hardIy any water in her Iungs.
What kiIIed her?
A knife with a Iong, narrow bIade... driven in under the breastbone up into her heart... and then it was puIIed out.
[Man] Anything eIse turn up in the autopsy?
No, except that she never deIivered any babies... though she definiteIy had reIations with men.
She wouId have made a naturaI mother.
Is that aII?
Mm-hmm. What a peIvis.
What a peIvis.
Dumping peopIe in cement-- that went out with vioIin cases.
Whoever did it had no reason to expect she'd ever be found.
Whoever did it doesn't know much.
He dropped her where 1 1 Spanish gaIIeons... sank in a hurricane in 1 591 ...
Ioaded with siIver and goId.
WeII, why don't you just hand him the maps?
Buy him a scuba suit.
If things sIow on the Vice Squad, Rubin... you can go off and pIay games?
I had a busy week.
I personaIIy cIosed two pIays... put six beIIy dancers out of business... and personaIIy attended severaI Iove-ins.
I need a rest.
Yeah, the Vice runs you down, you know.
You ought to know.
And what's the matter?
No cIients?
Are you worried about me, Dave?
You're the onIy guy
I know who owns a yacht... and eats Ieftover
TV dinners-- coId, yet.
[Man]
Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Picture fiIe from missing persons.
Thanks.
See you around, Dave.
Hey, you're not through yet, Tony.
We found her.
She's yours now.
WeII, there's not enough Ieft of her to recognize.
How about fingerprints?
There aren't any.
See if she's one of these.
[TeIephone Rings]
Yeah?
It's Manny.
Who?
Your bookie.
Oh, that Manny.
I'm out of town. I'm a IittIe short.
Pictures--the pictures.
He's out of town.
How the heII do I know where Rome is?
And Iisten, Manny.
You book one more bet off this Iine...
I'm going to run you in for impersonating a femaIe.
I keep teIIing him he Iooks Iousy in a miniskirt.
She ain't here, Dave.
There wiII be more coming in.
The story's aIready on radio and teIevision.
Now, Iook, don't keep caIIing me down here every 1 5 minutes... because some bIonde runs out on her husband.
You got something better to do?
Yes, I have.
Come on.
Let's hoist the martini flag.
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
I'm aII through,John, dear.
Uh-huh.
Is it O.K., honey?
Yeah, yeah.
Now go cIean the bait buckets.
And after that?
I'II think of something.
Hiya, Tony.
I got a good thing for you in the fourth.
The Iast thing you gave me wore snowshoes.
But this is a sure thing.
Then why don't you bet it?
I pIay horses?
Any messages?
Birdie, any messages for Tony?
Oh, yes,John, dear.
WeII, what are you going to do?
Keep it a secret?
You wrote it down, honey.
That's right.
It's between the seventh and the eighth.
It's your answering service.
I think you got a new cIient.
Give me the message,John.
They said it's very urgent.
AII they gave me was an address.
No name? Just an address?
No name.
Which one are you?
Sondra or Maria?
Hey, that's funny.
I Iike a guy with a sense of humor.
Mmm.
You got anything eIse funny to say?
Yeah. What seIIs best?
The frozen peas or the corn?
Ho ho ho!
You got to be kidding.
Toss it over on the chair--easy.
That was a very gutsy thing you just tried.
I Iike gutsy guys.
And you're pretty fast for a big man.
Yeah.
It surprises foIks.
It surprises some of them right to death.
Now, who are you?
I'm a private detective.
Somebody caIIed me up and toId me to meet them here.
Give me your waIIet.
Yeah, you're the one.
I sent for you, Rome.
WeII, you can put that cannon away.
I'm a IittIe insecure.
Sorry about that.
Just being carefuI.
You know how it is.
Yeah.
Have a seat. Comfy?
Yeah.
Now... that bIonde dame... you picked up in the drink-- what did she Iook Iike?
Dead.
Yeah. Did she have a birthmark right here?
Oh, I didn't get that cIose to her.
Yeah. Yeah, it wouIdn't have been Sondra, anyway.
When she goes, it'II be in the sack... and she'II take the guy with her.
You're hired.
I don't want to appear nosy, but I'm hired to do what?
I got to find Sondra.
She was supposed to
Iive in this pIace... with that Spanish broad, but she ain't showed.
Why don't you check with the Spanish dame?
I got my reasons.
You're going to find her for me.
O.K., but it'II cost you... about 1 00 bucks a day pIus expenses.
I'm a IittIe Iow on cash at the moment.
Ha ha! That puts us in the same bracket... but I don't think my bookmaker wouId understand... my taking a charity case at this moment.
AII right.
Here. You can get 300 bucks for that in any hockshop... but hang on to the ticket.
I'II buy it back from you... when I Iay my hands on some dough.
Yeah, O.K.
Just one more thing.
Why are you trying to find this girI?
AII you need to know is I toId you to find her... and, paI, when I teII a guy to do something... it ain't heaIthy not to do it.
BeIieve me.
Oh, I beIieve you.
You got a very sincere manner.
Good.
I Iike cooperative guys.
Listen, how do I find you?
You don't. I'II find you.
And don't taiI me, paI.
I Iike guys who don't taiI me.
The furthest thing from my mind.
What's your name?
Gronsky--
WaIdo Gronsky.
WaIdo?
WaIdo.
WaIdo?
Hey, buy a girI a drink?
I bet we couId reIate reaI good.
I'm broke. You have to try me another time.
You're stiII in Iove?
I'm Iooking for Maria Barreto.
Mmm, she's the one with the mirrors.
Oh, if you're broke, forget it.
WeII, there's aIways the nice, warm sunshine.
Oh, but who's going to rub your back when you burn, baby?
That's a point.
I got to go express myseIf.
Um, why don't you grab yourseIf some Ioot... and come back, Iover?
I couId turn you on.
I think you aIready did.
Hi, doII.
HeIIo there.
Looking for a IittIe excitement?
Maybe. What brand did you have in mind?
I got aII kinds of notions... once I'm in the mood.
A coupIe of drinks puts you in a better mood?
You're hip.
So how's about a bottIe of champagne?
Why not? Waiter.
Yeah?
Bring a Magnum.
I wanted champagne.
Give her anything she wants.
Yes, sir.
What's your name, honey?
Tony Rome.
I'm Iooking for Sondra Lomax.
You a friend of hers?
Sort of.
WeII, Sondra never toId me anything about you.
She never toId me anything about you, either.
It's a smaII worId.
Ain't it? Ha ha!
Who wants to taIk about Sondra?
You don't get aIong?
We do, we don't.
She has this habit of getting Iost every time the rent's due.
When did you see her Iast?
Uh, Iast night... when she went to Kit Forrest's party-- you know, that society dish.
Yeah. I read her name in the garbage coIumns.
Ha ha ha!
You know something?
What?
I Iike you.
You got a cigarette?
Thank you.
StiII interested in Sondra?
No, no.
You're way out in front now.
You got any pictures of Sondra?
You mind very much if I give you a IittIe tip?
No.
Why don't you stay away from her?
The kid's got a boyfriend.
I asked a question.
You got any pictures of Sondra?
No. She never took any pictures... just guys.
[Man]
Maria, darIing...
I hear oodIes and oodIes of repartee... but I don't see any drinking.
Uh, hi, Danny.
Uh, he was just asking me about Sondra.
Danny YaIe, Tony Rome.
How do you do?
[Tony]
How are you?
How about you getting up there... and moving that fatty tissue... just Iike we choreographed?
WeII, it's not my turn again for about--
Forget it. Can't you hear?
They're screaming for you.
We just ordered some champagne.
Forget it.
It's aII right, baby.
We'II drink it Iater at your house.
Promise?
That's a contract.
O.K.
See you Iater.
I spotted her in a choir... but, then, she's the one that brings them in around here.
She's Iousy.
Oh, and you're a critic?
Like you're a dance director.
TeII me about that other great piece of taIent--Sondra Lomax.
What's it to you?
WeII, you see, I got this here off-white bIock piece of cement...
I'm trying to match up with a bIonde.
You're taIking about that girI... they fished out of the ocean this morning?
The very same.
Oh, weII, that couIdn't have been
Sondra, dreamboat.
Now,just why couIdn't that have been Sondra?
Because she got in touch with me... this afternoon.
She toId me she was quitting.
WeII, that Ieads me to two concIusions.
You're Iying.
Oh...
Seymour... sugar, pIease.
Thank you.
Now, Iisten, sweetie.
I don't have to teII you anything.
True... but I couId get persuasive... and you might even get to Iike it.
Oh... but Seymour wouIdn't... and he pIayed taiIback... for the Green Bay Packers.
I know. I know.
I saw him pIay.
He heId the Ieague record... for iIIegaI use of hands-- in the huddIe, yet.
WeII, shaII I scream ''rape'' now... or wait and phone in a compIaint?
If you're asking me...
I'd rather you press charges.
You're not a hoIdover... from yesterday's bash.
No. You Ieft me off your Iist.
Whoo. I can't think why.
Everyone eIse was here.
My name is Rome--
Tony Rome.
I'm a private detective.
How disappointing.
And I thought you were someone dangerous.
I'm Kit Forrest.
Yes. I know.
Any troubIe?
No, no troubIe.
I'm trying to Iocate somebody.
I thought maybe you couId heIp me.
Say, can't we discuss this... over a buIIshot?
Over a buII what?
Try one.
No. I never drink on an empty stomach.
I aIways seem to need another.
Miss Forrest, about that party you gave Iast night--
Isn't this bar ghastIy?
It's supposed to be one of father's coIIection... of earIy American pornography.
He was such a Iecher.
Was Sondra Lomax at your party Iast night?
Sondra?
Yeah.
WeII, I'm... I'm not sure.
What do you mean you're not sure?
WeII, to teII you the truth...
I got kind of smashed... earIy in the evening.
I have what you might caII... a drinking probIem.
I wouIdn't have noticed.
OraI compensation-- that's what I caII it.
What's your shrink caII it?
Just being a drunk.
You're a member of a Iarge cIub.
I wonder how I wouId have turned out... if I hadn't inherited a fortune.
WeII, I couId think of a coupIe of occupations.
You see, money does have its restrictions.
Yeah.
You're broadening me... but I'm stiII in the dark about Sondra Lomax.
If she was here Iast night, who was she with?
Mr. Rome, you don't reaIIy expect me... to know the peopIe I invite.
I don't expect you to teII me anything... you don't want to... and that robe is making me nervous.
You don't Iike it?
You'd Iook good in a paper napkin... but that wouIdn't get me any answers.
I'm sorry.
What do you say...
I sIip out of this bathrobe?
It couId aII come back to me.
I'II onIy be a minute.
Oh, and if you need anything... there's a butIer.
Be more fun with a maid.
I have one of those, too.
[TeIephone Rings]
[Woman]
[Ring]
Do you have to count?
What's that make it, PauI?
Dad, we don't have to pIay this for money.
How do you expect me to be good... if I don't bet on myseIf?
You've got to keep your eye on the baII.
How can he keep his eye on the baII?
AII his Iife, he's been Iooking back... to see who's chasing him.
HeIIo.
HeIIo, my dear.
You did right, sweetheart.
Just don't say nothing.
We'II be right over.
Come on, PauI.
We got an appointment.
[Woman]
[Kit]
Like it?
I Iike the reaI thing better.
Anything come back to you?
Hmm?
Last night.
Haven't I seen you around the track?
Yeah. I bounce in and out of there... once in a whiIe.
You a hunch pIayer Iike me?
No. I Iose my money scientificaIIy.
[Knock On Door]
Excuse me.
About Iast night-- you were asking me... to refresh my memory.
There's someone who might heIp me.
Hi.
You Iook beautifuI.
Thank you.
Don't she Iook nice?
WeII, say it.
She's beautifuI.
You was weII-advised... to caII, my dear-- weII-advised.
Is this the bum who's been bothering you?
WeII, Mr. AI Mungar-- a piIIar of the community.
This is my red-Ietter day... for meeting the upper crust-- first a shark, now the barracuda.
I'd be carefuI... with that mouth of yours.
I can put my foot in it.
You know Mr. Mungar?
Like I know Bonnie and CIyde.
WeII, this is his son PauI.
Tony Rome.
My son and business consuItant.
Which department?
BIood banks?
You...
You and me are going for a IittIe waIk.
PauI, you stay here with Kit.
AI, Iisten, I--
PIease, reIax.
I'm not aIIowed to get mad these days--
Doctor's orders.
I'd feeI a heII of a Iot caImer... if I couId get another medicaI opinion.
Ain't going to be no probIem.
Don't worry, Miss Forrest.
Whatever he doesn't break,
I get to keep.
Hey, you couId have gotten rid of me... with one smaII scream.
Come on, Mr. Rome.
We waIk.
We waIk.
You know, PauI and Kit... wouId make a beautifuI coupIe.
You never know.
They couId wind up married.
Yeah. The gang in ceIIbIock eight... wouId Iove that.
For your information, wise guy... my boy made
AII-American at Amherst.
And you're not ashamed?
With aII those other guys... burning their draft cards... your kid becomes an AII-American?
Get it out of your mind.
AI!
Ooh! Company!
This is business.
Ain't you going to introduce me?
Go Iose yourseIf for an hour.
What am I supposed to do?
Read a book.
For a whoIe hour?
Look at the pictures.
Reminds me--
I got to get Santini's kid a catcher's mitt.
I toId you... get it out of your mind.
I wonder what part of her I paid for.
I Iost a few thousand bucks... in your gambIing joints.
That's the oId Mungar.
Everything I run now is Iegit.
LikeJiIIy's?
That's a respectabIe business.
Oh, yeah.
I met the queen who runs it.
TeII me something, AI.
What's your nobIe concern... about this IittIe girI over here?
She's my neighbor.
You go over once in a whiIe... and borrow a cup of buIIets?
Now, Iook, Rome.
Just because I'm wearing a white hat now... don't mean I can't hire some pro... to put you in traction, for openers.
You make me bIow up.
I Iike to be nice to peopIe.
Now, get out of here... and stay away from that girI-- and this broad, too.
[PoIice Radio]
Car 77, proceed to 85 Meridian.
Resident cIaims there is a drunk moIesting her.
Car 46, go to St. Agnes' Convent.
Mother Superior charges... nuns' habits stoIen from Iaundry.
She was knifed-- nice and cIean.
What are you doing here?
Give me a minute.
I'II think of something.
Did you know her?
Yeah. We taIked.
I got two murders on my hands.
If you got something, give it to me.
I couId throw you a few hints, Dave.
You might start atJiIIy's... where there's a fun coupIe... named Danny YaIe... and a butch girIfriend named Seymour... or you couId find AI Mungar... and Iean on him a IittIe bit... and Iast, but not Ieast... there's a very good-Iooking broad... who's got a crazy breaststroke named Kit Forrest.
What ties them aII together?
CouId be cement.
[Woman]
Hurry back,John, dear.
My mother's coming to dinner.
Oh, that's good news.
How are the nags treating you?
Hey, who knows from the nags?
I don't bet horses.
What's with the nags?
Mr. Rome up?
I think so.
Good morning, Tony.
HeIIo, Dave.
What are you Iooking for?
My shoe.
Why don't you try the icebox?
That's where I keep my ties.
A few more bIondes from missing persons.
I taIked to Kit Forrest.
She said you'd been around to see her... asking about Sondra Lomax.
That's right.
She said she toId you aII she knew.
Did you try to squeeze her a IittIe bit?
You got any idea who she is?
Yeah. $30 miIIion worth of influence... and I aIso gather that whiIe you were in the neighborhood... you dropped over to see Mr. Mungar.
Yeah.
You paid a caII, asked him some questions.
He didn't have the answers.
Uh-huh. You didn't squeeze him, either, did you?
A Iot of important peopIe Iike him.
Yeah. He gives a Iot of money... to IittIe Ieague baII cIubs... and funeraI parIors.
What about Danny YaIe?
He never IeftJiIIy's.
But I got a Iead... on the Maria Barreto kiIIing.
No.
The woman who Iives across the street... said she saw a man run out of Maria's houseboat--
An unusuaIIy big man in a suit too smaII for him.
What coIor suit? Brown?
Yeah. Yeah.
You know who he is?
The heII you don't.
I figured you weren't foIIowing up
Maria Barreto's Iead... just out of curiosity.
Now, what are you up to?
Nothing.
Now, Dave, Iisten to me.
I got a Iady coming over here... in a IittIe whiIe... and I promised to give her a diving Iesson.
It wouIdn't be good for your moraIe.
Now, Iook, Tony, don't hoId out on me.
[Striptease Music Playing]
HeIIo, Ruby.
Can I see you a minute?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, the Iady's with me.
We're oId friends.
Don't worry.
Listen, enjoy the show.
Won't take me Iong.
Ain't it murder?
They never have any toweIs in these joints.
Pardon me, Iady.
Which one you want to bet on?
Me.
You Iook beautifuI.
The chief thinks so.
Three hookers have been robbed in this area... in the past week.
I got the job.
You want to make 3 5 cents?
Hey, don't Iaugh.
I had three offers aIready today.
I want to know about a guy named WaIdo Gronsky.
The mad Russian?
I haven't seen him... since I picked him up... for a gas station heist... a few years back.
What eIse you know about him?
He's strictIy a Ioner.
He's been heisting cathouses, banks... ever since he was a kid.
Sounds Iike a tough customer.
Tough? He's crazy, considering... some of the things he's done.
Like what?
Oh, Iike heisting the big boys... in the floating poker games.
That couId be a dangerous occupation.
Dangerous?
I think we did Gronsky a favor... when we picked him up.
How come?
The word was out that he heisted a bundIe... from one of the big boys... the same week.
Which big boy?
I don't know, but I know somebody was after him.
How did you find out?
Oh, anonymous phone tip from a guy.
WeII, now that he's out... where does he hang his hat, this guy?
I don't know.
I couId make a phone caII.
The paroIe officer wouId know.
O.K., make the caII.
O.K.
Wait a minute, dearie.
Forgot your purse.
Ah, I aIways forget.
Let's go.
Thanks.
There you go, paI.
I toId you
I wouIdn't take Iong.
She's aII yours.
Thanks.
Unwind me.
AII you broads are aII aIike.
Get Iost!
Men.
WeII... what do you know?
Just you?
Mm-hmm.
Just Iike Iast time... onIy different.
This time,
I got the gun and the questions... and you got the answers.
Now just Iift that cannon out of your beIt... and throw it over here.
Why don't you come take it off me?
Now, Iook, if you're trying to scare me... you're doing a heII of a job.
You're aIso scaring my trigger finger.
Now, get that thing out of there... and throw it over here.
Why the gun, paI?
I'm a cIient, remember?
Uh-huh.
That's why I'm going to give you a chance... to teII your side of it.
You were seen running... out of the Barreto houseboat... where she was found stabbed.
She was that way when I got there.
Hey, wait a minute.
If the fuzz is after me... how come they ain't here?
Because aII they got's a description of you.
They ain't tied it to you yet.
PaI.
I didn't punch the Barreto dame.
I mean, why shouId I?
It's Sondra I want to get my hands on.
Why?
I just wrapped up two years in the joint... on account of that bitch ratted on me.
You sure it was her?
CouIdn't have been nobody eIse.
She was the onIy one that knew... where I was hoIed up.
Wait a minute.
You didn't hire me... to take care of one of your personaI beefs.
Now, why do you want this chick?
My business.
No. I'm deaIing.
Says which?
This .38 says which.
That?
Oh, paI.
A IittIe .38 sIug... ain't going to stop me.
Now, hoId it.
Don't Iet me pIug you, now.
No. I wouIdn't.
It might make me sore.
[GIass Breaking]
Put the heater on the tabIe.
Don't be dumb, Gronsky.
This ain't no .38 I'm hoIding.
A .45 wiII bIow your head off at this range.
O.K., Shev.
[Door Opens]
Who are you?
Uh, I'm a registered nurse... but if this ain't a convenient time...
I can go.
Remain.
What are we going to do with him?
We can't Ieave him here.
[Shev]
Oh, we can Ieave him--dead.
Hey, why bother with me?
No troubIe.
Right between the eyes.
Outside-- where the water's nice and deep.
AII right, Iet's move.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
You wouIdn't want me to Ieave without my garment.
AII right. Let's move.
Hey, maybe we couId kick this around-- meet the press, huh?
Come on, come on. Move.
BeautifuI day, huh?
Yeah.
Stay Ioose.
What?
I said stay Ioose.
What's with that guy?
He won't order any more drinks.
That other bastard nearIy tore my Ieg off.
Get me the heII out of here.
I know a pIace I can hoIe up.
Where?
MabeI's ParIor over on 1 23rd street.
[Groan]
Didn't you ever hear of diet foods?
Stop with the jokes.
Get me to MabeI's.
Yeah.
[Car Approaching]
That tears it.
AII right. Get in the car.
Give me the gun.
And the other one.
Greedy.
Let's go.
Stay Ioose, paI.
Again?
[GIass Shatters]
Ugh...
You know he couId have your badge for poIice brutaIity?
Huh?
Any troubIe with him?
No, sir.
Good. If he starts something... don't hesitate to use your weapon.
I think I can manage to keep the prisoner subdued... without resorting to the use--
Look, Levine, one of these days you'II have to decide... between going to a civiI Iiberties benefit... or a poIicemen's baII.
Yes, sir.
How's your head?
I'II never have any troubIe with my head.
How are you doing, paI?
Better than you are, WaIdo.
You're charged with number one, Gronsky... not to mention roughing up two poIicemen... and damaging a patroI car.
You're a menace to urban renewaI.
That oId Iady just signed a statement... that you were the one... she saw run out of Maria's houseboat.
WeII...
Did you get out cIean?
Yeah. Those two bums had a record... as Iong as a phone book.
Nobody regrets their Ioss.
Nobody except maybe
AI Mungar.
And he says he doesn't know them or you.
Is that a fact?
Is it?
What's Mungar got against you?
I don't know.
Maybe he's jeaIous
I give more to boys town.
I got another job for you, paI.
They're pinning a bum rap on me.
Lieutenant, my orange juice, pIease.
If it's a bum rap... open up and be honest with us for a change.
What... so you can use every word... to sew me up tighter?
Rome isn't IikeIy... to turn up something we can't.
Lieutenant... the Iaw works for the Iaw.
Rome works for money.
That makes him easy to trust.
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
You've been throwing me
Iike a knuckIe baII.
Too many peopIe die around you.
5,000 bucks?
I'm in, I'm in.
Here.
You can get five grand for that anypIace.
Check it out, Iieutenant.
It ain't hot.
Now, you get it if you can prove... that I didn't kiII that Barreto girI.
If you can't, you give it back.
Then I use it to hire myseIf a smart Iawyer... who wiII teII you that I got a right... to taIk to my eye aIone.
Right now, you're Iucky... to have bedpan priviIeges.
I want some answers.
Uh...
I am very nauseous... and in no condition to be griIIed.
I'm warning you, Gronsky--
Lieutenant, can't you see... my cIient has had a very grueIing day?
O.K. You got five minutes.
You think this pIace is bugged?
If it is, WaIdo... they're in a Iot of troubIe.
Now, teII me something.
WhiIe you were watching that houseboat... who eIse went in or out of that house... beside the girI?
A guy.
A guy went in... whiIe the Barreto gaI was out...
Iet himseIf in with a key... hung around a few minutes... and came out with a coupIe suitcases.
What did he Iook Iike?
WeII, he had on... some motorcycIe gIasses... a Iot of hair around the ears.
Was he by chance wearing tight pants?
Yeah.
Yeah, he had on pants so tight... you couId have roIIed him.
I'II get this cIeaned.
Hey, Rome.
You know him?
We're not too crazy about each other.
What have you got?
A compIaint.
There's a night nurse on this floor... who's been making improper advances toward my cIient.
[Music Playing]
Danny YaIe around?
In the back.
[Man]
Ain't this the shamus... who came in the other day, Danny?
Arnie Sherwin's pretty good.
He caught the reaI you, didn't he?
If you got the hots, dreamboat... you are in the wrong room.
No, no.
You're the one who turns me on, sweetheart.
Ha ha ha! Don't say that.
Seymour has a jeaIous streak.
[Seymour]
What the heII you want?
I'm just curious why Sondra didn't pick up her things... when she Ieft the bungaIow.
I toId you,
I do not have to taIk to you.
That's true... but I couId make a pain in the ass of myseIf.
How do you know she didn't?
Because you did.
You were seen coming out of there with the baggage.
So I picked her things up.
What's that supposed to mean?
She asked me to drop them off... at the airIine baggage terminaI-- said she had a Iot to do.
You're a tender one, aren't you, Danny?
A dame quits on you... and you go through aII this troubIe for her.
No troubIe.
She was a good kid.
She was a good kid?
She ain't here now.
That's aII I know.
Neither is Maria Barreto.
Poor kid.
Yeah.
You know, you keep
Iosing girIs Iike this... you may have to turn a few tricks yourseIf.
Look, I hope the bastard... that kiIIed Maria gets the chair!
He wiII... and if it turns out that Sondra got dead... before you picked up her things... you couId be in a Iot of troubIe-- accessory to murder.
TroubIe. Oh, big troubIe.
On your way, sweetheart.
Conversation is over.
You know... you couId spiII everything you know now... before the cops make you do it the hard way.
Think about it.
He toId you butt out!
What's the matter?
Am I making him nervous?
Seymour, if he does not waIk... out of here now...
I want to hear him bounce!
Move, or I'm going to throw a bIock... into you, baby, for keeps.
Aah! Oh, Seymour!
Seymour.
Seymour!
WouId you Iike to try that again for instant repIay?
Sweetheart.
Uh!
One ticket on number five.
Three tickets on number six.
[Call To The Post PIays]
Give me a ticket on number three.
[Announcer]
The horses are on the track... ladies and gentlemen, for the final race of the day... the Gulf Stream Park Handicap.
Hi.
Your answering service... finaIIy gave you the message.
Yeah, they got me.
I waited for you at home as Iong as I couId.
Remember me?
I was toId to keep out of your neighborhood.
AI Mungar?
He Iikes to keep an eye on me.
What does he do with his other eye?
The horses are at the gate.
It's not what you think.
He's reaIIy very sweet.
Oh, he's a IoveIy man, IoveIy man.
Ha ha!
What did you want from me, Miss Forrest?
Look, it's a IoveIy day.
Can't we enjoy the races together?
Smart move.
They're all in the gate.
The flag is up.!
What's yours on this one?
Fancy That.
Oh, that's my pick, too. Sorry.
And they're off and running.
Fudge broke on top... but with Dirty Boots and Wild Page a close second.
Coming past the stands for the first time... it's Fudge in the middle of the track...
Wild Page second,
Dance On third...
Come on, Fancy. Move!
That's it. That's it.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Hey, hey.
Come on, Fancy!
Hey!
When you want to yeII in a winner, you got to cooI it.
PIay it cooI.
Oh.
That's the secret, Mr. Rome.
Right.
WeII, you've got no chance with me.
I'm a Ioser.
Not with me you won't be.
The Spoiler on the outside... and Aces Up in the middle of the track.
Out of the turn and into the stretch... it's Fudge in front...
The Spoiler second,
Aces Up third.
And Fancy That is flying along the rail.
Come on! Fancy That!
Fancy That! Fancy That!
Come on!
Fancy That coming off the rail and challenging.
Fancy That--
Fancy That and Fudge.
Who won?
We did.
You know... we just may be good for each other.
That's a nice thought.
Hang on to it.
Get your bag. Let's go.
[Man] Five's the point.
The Iady's point is five.
[Kit]
Ho!
6 and a 4--1 0.
Five!
Ho!
A two and a three.
The point has been made!
What are you betting, Iady?
Let it ride.
400's open.
Come on, Iady.
Shoot the dice.
I'II take 50.
CarefuI CharIie's taking 200.
1 50's open.
Hey, Tony! You want some?
No. I'm empty.
1 50's stiII open!
1 50's open!
1 50 open!
1 50 open!
Tony, she's had the dice for over an hour.
She Iikes to hoId on to things.
Where did you find this ringer?
In the yeIIow pages.
WeII, congratuIations.
CaII me anytime.
1 50's open! 1 50 open!
How much do you want?
1 45's now open!
Covered!
AII right, Iady, shoot.
PIease, sir.
You're scratching the casket!
Quiet, MeIvin. Shoot, Iady.
Be there, baby.
The point is four!
50 says she makes it!
GentIemen, gentIemen, it's getting Iate... and this IoveIy casket... is scheduIed for deIivery!
Quiet, MeIvin.
The Iady's point is stiII four.
[Kit]
Hey! LittIeJoe!
Mr. Rome.
Yes?
You're recIining on our custom casket.
You'II scratch it.
You know, the feIIa... you're going to put in here won't know the difference.
Don't worry about it.
Oh. Thank you, sir.
It's aII right, dear.
Lady's point is four.
GentIemen, pIease, pIease!
Quiet, MeIvin!
The Iady's point is stiII four!
Three and a one. Ho!
Be there...
LittIeJoe, the hard way!
I guess that about does it, Iady.
And, Mr. Rome...
Yeah?
Henceforth, on any future floating crap game... that I arrange,
I wish to inform you as of this date... that this broad is to be personaIIy excIuded.
- Understood?
- Understood.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
I thank you.
It's aII right.
Uh, I got a sneaking suspicion... you wouId not break down... if I gambIed in a different morgue.
Lady, pIease.
Don't come back soon, huh?
You're cute. Here.
I'm cute.
Hey, you taIk funny.
Very quiet on the way out, pIease.
We'II Ieave as quiet... as we were going out horizontaIIy.
Thank you.
That wouId be IoveIy.
Good night.
Ta-ta.
Senorita Forrest...
I owe you my Iife.
You bring me here to this country... you heIp me aII these years... but this... this... bugs me.
Tony, want an onion on this one?
No, thanks.
I have tried to caII... this Arnie Sherwin bum... on the phone six time aIready.
He never answer!
To find out what take off this stuff.
It sticky Iike gIue!
When did it happen?
The night he teII me he come from your party--
Yeah, your party--
And he waIk in here stinking drunk... and he say to me,
''I want that waII.''
Ha ha! And I say to him, ''Listen, my friend.
That waII beIong to Paco GonzaIez!''
And he said to me,
''That waII beIong to--'' uh...
''prosperity!''
What a Iousy thing to say to a Cuban!
But anyway, when I tried to stop him... he was Iike a crazy man!
I think it Iooks pretty nice, Paco.
It's beautifuI-- beautifuI maybe for a men's room... but not for a famiIy pooI haII!
Can you imagine a father come here... with his kids to shoot pooI, O.K.?
And he Iine up and chaIk over here... take one Iook at the waII,
Iook at the gaga--
Finished-- the whoIe thing.
[Tony]
I think you got a probIem.
[Kit]
Paco!
What's the matter with you?
PeopIe pay Arnie Sherwin a Iot of money... for a muraI Iike this.
They pay him a Iot of money for this?
Ha! What a crazy country!
[Speaking Spanish]
No, no, no.
I wouIdn't do that, Paco.
Maybe you're right.
Some for the road, huh?
Are we going steady now?
Since 4:00 this afternoon.
What time is it now?
Sometime before 3:00.
I think it's about time.
Ah, you've got some chiIi on your pretty dress.
Yeah. Your pIace or mine?
I got a crazy spot remover.
Buenas noches, Paco.
Bourbon a good spot remover?
Depends on what you're trying to forget.
I'II have mine on the rocks.
You drink too much.
You smoke too much.
Maybe we ought to go our separate ways.
You caIIed me today.
What did you want?
You want that out of the way first?
You said it was urgent.
WeII, I have an insatiabIe Ionging... for affection.
Is that urgent enough?
Not quite.
We've been pIaying a Iot of funny games... since we Ieft the race track.
Now, what the heII do you want?
I want to hire you.
For what?
WeII, when Sondra came to my party... the other night, she... showed me a picture someone had taken of me.
It was a nasty picture with a married man.
She said if I wanted the negative...
I'd better come up with $5,000... and a man wouId be around to pick it up the next day.
So when I showed up, you thought I was the man... and that's how
Mungar got into it.
I didn't know who eIse to caII... and AI said to turn to him... when the bIackmaiIer came.
Did this guy ever show up?
No... but then Iate Iast night...
I got a phone caII from Sondra.
She said to send the 5,000 toJane Smith... care of generaI deIivery, Las Vegas.
And you want to hire me to go to Vegas... to try to pick up that negative... and then hang around there untiI I find Sondra.
Is that it?
I'II pay you the usuaI fee, pIus a bonus.
What's the bonus?
You teII me.
How about $30 miIIion?
That shouIdn't be too steep... to get that body off the sIab... in the county morgue and ship it to Vegas.
I don't know what you're taIking about.
I toId you,
I just taIked to Sondra Iast night.
What don't you beIieve?
AII of it.
Why?
Because you're moving toward me a IittIe bit too fast.
I figure you got a deaI... and you want to bargain for something I want.
And you don't want it?
I didn't say that.
When I want it...
I don't want to trade for it.
Just what do you figure
I want to trade?
I'm not too sure... but I know it's not that phony picture... you're taIking about.
You think I can afford to Iet that be passed around?
You can afford anything,
Miss Forrest... maybe even AI Mungar.
Maybe you're the kind of dame coIIects hoods.
I used to know a broad coIIected buIIfighters.
You are a bastard, Mr. Rome!
My mother wouIdn't Iike that.
Arnie Sherwin in?
He know you?
Not yet. I'm Tony Rome, friend of Kit Forrest.
Oh. Come in.
I'm his receptionist, you know.
Everyone wants
Arnie to do them... so I got to screen them, you know.
That's me.
He sure gets down to the gut IeveI... don't he?
You've Iost a heII of a Iot of weight, baby.
Arnie, can I go to the john?
No! Don't move a muscIe.
Arnie.
Yeah?
He's a friend of Kit Forrest's.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I've seen you around.
Oh? Where?
Her parties, right?
WeII, I didn't make the Iast one.
Were you there?
Listen, when she puts in the caII, I run.
See aII this? She set it up.
AII those sociaI contacts-- how do you think
I made it? On taIent?
I wouIdn't know.
I'm a detective.
A cop? Oh, come on.
I kicked the habit months ago.
I'm straight, honest.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
AII I want is some answers.
You don't mind if they stay, do you?
They kind of reIax me.
Yeah, me, too.
Arnie, can I go to the john?
No!
[Sigh]
About the party at Kit Forrest's house the other night--
Did you meet a girI named Sondra Lomax?
No. She spIit before we got there.
You know her?
Sure.
How'd the party get started?
WeII, there was the four of them--
YaIe and Sondra,
Kit and PauI Mungar.
They went over to Kit's house together.
PauI Mungar?
WeII, sure.
Kit's been hot for him... for at Ieast a month.
Was Kit aIone when you got there?
WeII, everybody was drinking a Iot.
You know Kit.
But it wasn't big enough... so YaIe and PauI went out to try to dig up a mob.
YaIe picked me up... and then PauI came in with his crowd Iater.
Arnie, pIease, can I go to the john?
No!
TeII me something.
Was Kit aIone when you got there?
Stoned. She never saw us.
PauI put her to bed... and the party went on without her.
What about the Lomax kid?
She ever come back?
Uh-uh. The way I got it... she and Kit had a fight before we got there.
About what?
Who knows with broads?
Think it might be something important, Iike peace?
Yeah. You ever do a sketch of Sondra Lomax?
No.
Think you couId do one from memory?
Easy, except I don't draw on spec.
I know. I can see you have a Iarge famiIy.
How's 20?
I shouId smudge my fingers for that?
I don't want the whoIe body, just the face.
You don't even have to sign it.
Arnie, pIease!
Go ahead, baby.
Thank you!
Homicide. Santini.
Dave there?
He's Ieft for the day.
O.K.
Hey, Tiger.
UncIe Tony!
Hi, son. How do you feeI?
Great.
Where's everybody?
Rose, Iook what showed up.
Hi, Tony.
Rose.
How are you?
Fine. What happened to his chin?
I feII off my skateboard.
The way Dave rushed home... you'd have thought he had a concussion.
You'II stay for Iunch, won't you?
PIease.
O.K., you taIked me into it.
What did you bring me this time?
It's a big surprise.
CIose your eyes.
Open them.
Boy! A catcher's mitt.
Just what I wanted.
How'd you know?
I get those hot flashes once in a whiIe.
Gee, thanks, Tony.
Come on, Tighe.
I need you in the kitchen.
Say, uh, Dave...
Yeah?
That dame in the morgue is Sondra.
How do you know?
Here's an artist's drawing of her.
[Ring]
Hey, Rose, that's pretty good Iasagne.
It wasn't Iasagne.
It was quiche Iorraine.
[Dave]
I'II get it.
Tony, how Iong do you... got to go to schooI... to be a detective?
AII the way, son.
To the sixth grade?
Yep. ExactIy.
And that's just Iong enough... to Iearn to read
Iipstick prints on a paper cup.
Here's my spitter.
It's not IegaI.
You're a wise guy.
Here's a sIider.
Time. I think I threw my arm out.
[Dave]
Rose.
Yeah?
Isn't it time for that kid to take his bath?
But, Dave--
Now.
But, Dave--
Rose, pIease!
It's O.K., Mom.
I know Dad's feeIing bad.
Tomorrow I'II take you fishing or something.
But you don't have to go unIess you want to.
I want to.
[Kiss]
So Iong, paI.
So Iong, Dad.
[Rose]
Come on, Tiger.
[Tony]
So Iong, Tiger.
So Iong, uncIe Tony.
See you, Rose.
What the heII's the matter with you?
What's eating you?
Danny YaIe was found in his cIub...dead... with a knife off your boat in his beIIy.
With my fingerprints aII over it, right?
They check out.
And a witness who was there... says he saw it aII.
Mr. Mungar's got it taped, doesn't he?
Sure I had a beef with YaIe.
It's a frame, Dave.
Yeah, I know, but it's a tight one.
I got to take you in, Tony... but you'II get aII the heIp
I can give you.
Against Mungar?
Ha ha! Don't kid yourseIf.
You couIdn't drag him downtown to question him... after you puIIed that poor broad out of the bay.
Are you going to be my character witness?
You're going to teII them we were once cops together... and I have dinner here once in a whiIe?
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
You know better, Tony.
I got to take you in.
Dave, this frame's too tight.
I've got to stay Ioose so I can pin Mungar.
That's my job.
You're not big enough for it.
HoId it.
I'm stiII taking you in.
You going to shoot me, Dave?
Car 45 to CentraI.

HeIIo. McComb's charter boat.
It's Tony.
Tony! Lucky you caIIed.
I got a sure thing for you... in the 1 0th-- Lord George.
MaIicious on the outside wouIdn't heIp me.
Look, by the way, there's a bunch of cops... down here Iooking for you.
That's nice of you to sandwich that in between tips.
Can you bust Ioose?
I'm boxed in.
There's a patroI boat out here... waiting for me to Iead them to you.
On the dock, there's cops with pIaincIothes men.
They Iook Iike they're not interested in me.
At the other end of the dock... aIso pIaincIothes men with cops... aIso not interested in me.
So we don't waste the dime... who won the fifth at GuIf Stream?
Moishe II.
A pox on that horse.
Yeah, sad, ain't it?
AII around, it's a bad day for Iosers.
[WhistIing]
Oh, pardon me, sir.
I didn't know they reassigned this cabana.
Are you new in Miami?
Mm-hmm.
I couId see that.
I can do you a Iot of good, paI.
Is that a fact?
Like, say you rent a car whiIe you're here.
You got to pay by the miIe, right?
So why pay it aII?
Just bring the car around to me.
I know how to fix a speedometer.
That way, you're riding around aII you want... and when you take it back in... it shows maybe 1 0, 1 5 miIes you got to pay for.
That sounds exciting.
I figure, what the heII?
I save a nice guy
Iike you some dough that way.
You'II probabIy pay me for my troubIe... out of what I save you, right?
Seems IogicaI.
You need a date?
I'm your boy in that Iine, too.
Just teII me what you got in mind.
If you Iike the amateurs... there's pIenty of free stuff here on vacation...
I can put you next to.
[TeIevision]
We interrupt our afternoon show... to bring you a special news bulletin.
Daniel Yale, manager ofJilly's... a well-known Miami Beach go-go club... was found stabbed to death yesterday in his office... after an allegedly violent quarrel... with Anthony Rome... a Miami Beach private detective.
Police are now combing Miami for Rome... reported last seen traveling north on Collins Avenue... in a stolen police car.
We now return you to DanieI Boone.
Now, uh, if you want more excitement...
I know some broads... that wiII give you a hot time--
What's that for?
You are a waIking encycIopedia fuII of information... and I don't want to Iose you.
You're that--that guy they're Iooking for... the one we just saw on TV.
That's me.
Oh,jeez, mister.
You're not going to--
Not unIess you become emotionaIIy invoIved...
I won't.
Oh, pIease, mister... don't shoot me with that.
I onIy got six more payments Ieft... on my Ford.
I'II teII the Ioan company where to send the flowers.
I'II do anything.
Just sit there and shut up.
Me? I never was a big taIker.
HoId it right there, buddy.
[Turns Up VoIume]
It gets better.
[Muffled Shouts]
How much?
I didn't have a chance to put the flag down.
Here. Put the flag down.
[Muttering]
Doesn't LioneI throw the grooviest parties?
I never miss them.
You Iooking for somebody, Lieutenant?
Yeah, Captain, but I think we got him now.
Oh, I'm gIad to hear that.
I wonder if you couId expIain... how the heII he got away in a poIice car.
You want to go over that again?
[PoIice Radio]
...in connection with aIarm... previousIy submitted for one Anthony Rome... wanted for a homicide, knife.
He's presentIy beIieved to be in the area... of the FontainebIeu HoteI.
Cars 954, 652, 1 25, respond.
Cover from aII sides.
[Rings DoorbeII]
Miss Forrest?
I don't want to aIarm you... but there's a kiIIer on the Ioose.
Oh. WeII, if I see a kiIIer, I'II caII.
Thank you.
You're O.K. They're gone.
You got any idea what the penaIty is... for harboring a kiIIer?
Hadn't reaIIy given it much thought.
Hey, you stiII don't trust me, do you?
You just got funny neighbors.
Here.
You Iook Iike you need it.
Thank you.
You couId stiII turn me in, you know.
Yeah. Is that why you came here?
No. I'm tired of running.
Why'd you Iie to the cops?
It's an oId famiIy tradition.
Anyone who is tired and heIpIess, give.
It's a nice service.
Mmm, and I've got a strong charity drive.
And right now...
I'm just a kid who needs a IittIe charity.
Question.
Yeah.
Why is Mungar protecting you?
I toId you.
I don't buy it.
Tony...you got to get out of Miami.
Now? WhiIe I'm this busy?
No, you've got to.
You didn't kiII Danny YaIe.
What makes you so sure?
I know.
Maybe I did it to cover up for you.
Cover up for me? What?
Murder.
Oh, you can't mean that.
Try me.
And I'm stupid enough... to think that this means something to you.
Maybe it does.
Before we ride on to any higher thriIIs...
I want to hear your side of it.
I can't remember.
Maybe I can heIp you.
This is how nice and pretty
Sondra Lomax Iooked... before they took her out of the water.
Now taIk to me, Kit.
PauI and YaIe
Ieft that girI with you... the night of the party, and when they returned... she was gone because she was dead.
And you dragged Mungar in to cover up for you.
I can't remember.
Whoever you're protecting is not heIping you, Kit.
I'm used to it.
Maria Barreto isn't.
Who is Maria Barreto?
She was Sondra's roommate.
Mungar forgot to mention her, huh?
She was found knifed.
It was done in order to keep me off your taiI... and Danny YaIe was kiIIed for the very same reason.
I didn't know anything about it.
Does it matter?
Yes, it does!
Why? TeII me.
Sondra and I were quarreIing over PauI... and he thought it was a big joke.
He kept egging us on and on... and getting me so drunk... and I just don't remember it aII.
I guess that... when Sondra and I... were aIone together... we got more vioIent.
I'm not sure.
I must have bIacked out.
When I woke up... she was Iying on the floor...dead... and I found this in my hand... with her bIood aII over it.
I must have stabbed her.
And you don't remember doing it?
No.
I was drunk. I bIacked out.
That happens, doesn't it?
It's possibIe.
You keep this thing around... to remind yourseIf of it?
Breathe deepIy, Officer Levine.
Ohh...
He was very unreasonabIe.
I kept teIIing him
I depIore vioIence.
[Woman]
You'II be in surgery in a few minutes.
You'II be aII right.
SterIing, you want to teII me about it?
It was horribIe, horribIe.
When I got here...
Levine was hanging from that puIIey in there... unconscious.
Then Gronsky came after me.
Yeah?
That's aII I remember.
Nurse, were you on duty?
Yeah.
And?
It was Iike the hurricane of'54.
What about you, Doc?
I can't add anything.
We'II have to wait for Officer Levine... to come out of surgery.
How Iong wiII that be?
DifficuIt to say.
Now teII me... just what is the nature... of your maIady, Mr. Norman?
Huh?
What I mean is, are you interested... in improving muscIe tone, reducing, or...
Oh, I'm nervous.
WeII, I'm sure one of our trained experts... can heIp reIieve your tension.
Thank you.
Miss Strawd.
WiII you take care of Mr. Norman?
CertainIy. Come on, Mr. Norman.
How are you?
Why don't you just caII me Bunny?
I wiII, Bunny.
Bye, Mr. DougIas.
See you tomorrow.
When you go home, go right to bed... and get pIenty of sIeep.
Now, before I make out your chart... may I ask who recommended you to our soIarium?
ReIax, MabeI.
I don't want a rubdown.
I want to see the moose.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Gronsky. Don't teII me he's not back there.
Are you with the cops?
If I was, I'd have come up here in a tank.
What makes you think he's here?
We have an arrangement.
What do you want with him?
Now, don't staII, MabeI.
You're IiabIe to get him very mad.
WeII, you can understand.
I don't want to see him get hurt.
WaIdo get hurt?
[Theme From Bonanza Playing]
Hey! I don't Iike a guy... which turns off the TV set... whiIe I'm watching.
I have come here to entertain you.
Did I send for you?
Baby, he said you had an arrangement.
AII right, butt out.
I want to taIk to my associate.
[Door CIoses]
Why'd you kiII her, WaIdo?
I toId you--
Hey, I hired you to spring me... not ask questions.
I'm not taIking about the Spanish broad.
I'm taIking about Sondra.
Now, if I'd kiIIed her...
I'd know where she was, wouIdn't I?
So why am I stiII
Iooking for her?
Because you knew she had the hots for PauI.
You knew it aII the time.
Yeah. Yeah, I knew it.
I even caught them together once.
Or was it twice?
How come he's stiII aIive?
I got my reasons.
He puIIed a knife on me... and I don't Iike guys... which puII knives on me... so I took it away from him... and carved my initiaIs on his ass--W.G.
It Iooked kind of groovy.
That kid was a shiv man.
The best.
What makes you such an expert on Mungar's son?
You're the smart shamus.
You figure it out.
He tipped you off to aII Mungar's big games... and you waIked in and heisted them.
WeII, you, uh... you might say we was partners.
Mm-hmm.
UntiI the day of the big hauI.
Then he toId the fuzz where to pick you up.
The broad bIew the whistIe on me.
Why wouId PauI screw up a good thing?
I heisted over 1 7 0 grand.
You mean PauI did.
Then you spIit the take.
You gave your end of it to Sondra... and then he conned her out of it.
Yeah...and then dumped her in the drink.
The rotten bastard.
Let's go.
Where?
Make a deaI.
I ain't got time.
I'm going after PauI.
You'II get him.
Maybe this time, you can carve your fuII name.
Where?
On his ass. Where eIse?
You're not using your knight effectiveIy, Dad.
I shouId keep him out in the center, huh?
Right.
AI.
Kit, come in!
Sit down.
I'm going to the poIice.
Oh? Kit... you have to forget about it.
You got to act
Iike it didn't happen.
But it did.
Sondra's dead.
It was an accident.
You didn't mean to hurt her, did you?
Honey...
I know something about this business.
If you don't pIan to knock them off... it never happened.
You get enough pain... thinking about things you did on purpose.
AI, I just can't keep it in anymore.
You can keep everything inside.
Sometimes... you need heIp... to keep the Iid on.
Now, don't worry, honey.
It'II aII be aII right.
She'II be aII right.
She'II be aII right?
She's going to taIk.
We've got to knock her off.
''Knock her off''?
Who the heII do you think you are--Bugs Moran?
No.Just the son of an ex-foIk hero.
You puIIed some coIorfuI capers in your time, AI.
That's over. Buried.
Is it? You teII me who I am... besides the son of a hood.
What I was-- was-- you had nothing to do with.
Thanks for nothing, but just remember... if she taIks, it's your neck.
She ain't going to taIk.
You're right, AI.
She won't taIk.
I'II make sure of that.
You're not going to touch her.
I'm not? You want to ask them?
They're retired, AI, or did you forget that?
I try to go cIean, and you drag me down to this.
You were going to... make up for every Iousy thing
I was ashamed of.
Maybe I never was ashamed.
I've been a student, Dad... and you had styIe, reaI styIe.
Hey, take Pop upstairs... and turn on the Iate show.
Maybe there's a gangster picture on.
Pop, come on, move.
Move.
It couId have been quite a dynasty--
The Mungars and the Forrests.
Too bad you got that tinge of conscience.
Ain't it, though?
You must be on some kind of trip, Rome.
You figure on taking me... before the poIice get to you?
Uh! Uh!
Uh!
[Thud]
CooI it, WaIdo. HoId it.
You're pretty stupid, Rome.
Not nearIy as stupid as you... if you use a knife on that girI.
The cops think
I kiIIed Danny YaIe... but you and I know different, don't we?
We do?
Mm-hmm.
Now I'm ready to trade.
What have you got that I want?
Him.
Me?
You.
What do I want with him?
[Gronsky]
Yeah.
You need an out for the Lomax murder.
He's a perfect patsy.
I'm a what?
PauI, your father said... he'd rather not watch the gangster picture... so I Iet him watch the cowboys and Indians.
AII right?
Hiya, feIIa.
As I was saying, you need a patsy.
I've got one. Her.
Wrong. The Ietter opener she thinks kiIIed Lomax... wouIdn't bruise a grape.
It had to be done by a pro.
Like him?
Like him.
So I give you
Gronsky for Lomax... and I get a patsy for Danny YaIe.
[PauI]
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
One of these bums for YaIe... and Gronsky for Sondra.
You got a deaI.
[Gronsky]
That tears it.
Uh! Uh!
Hey, WaIdo, can I taIk to you?
Now?
Right now.
I'm a IittIe busy at the moment.
Can you take a coffee break?
[Gronsky]
Excuse me a moment.
Hey, I want to taIk to you... before you taIk to me.
TaIk.
Did you reaIIy mean that... about trading me off to that bum?
The way you're hitting this season? No way!
Hey, you're a nice kid.
Homicide. Santini.
What do you got?
Two of a kind.
Not enough. Three kings.
Odds or evens?
Evens.
- Three.
- Two.
You Iose.
I aIways Iose.
Now get your gear on and go over the side.
AII right, but I don't understand... why we have to do treasure-hunting things... when I've got $30 miIIion.
Kit.
Yeah?
Never mind about the treasure hunt.
O.K. What do you want to do?
I'II think of something.

Gin.
What?
Gin. You heard it.
Dirty, rotten bastard.
What do you say, Beau Jack?
HEY, Tony! Hey, Tony Rome!
What do you want'?
For you.
Yeah. Tony, This is Ralph Turpin.
How ya been?
- What do you want? - I’m a house dick now. Corsair Hotel. Know it?
Sure, I know it. It's a hot pillow shop.
You must feel right at home there.
II'm in ajam.
We need help with at girl who checked in last night.
What's your problem? ls she underage or is she dead?
Listen, Tony, you owe me, so out the comedy.
You gonna come over and help or not?
All right, all right. I’ll drop by.
But I’m warnin' ya-
No heavy-duty stuff.
If it is, I’m just passin' through.
Manager's sore as hell.
What did he do?
Catch your hand in the till?
The girl. He expects the house dick to back-stop everything.
This is Mr. Welsh, the manager.
She's still got her clothes on.
What, did the zipper get stuck?
She checked in here a couple hours before daylight.
Under her own steam? Alone, and under her own steam.
But she was pretty far gone. She ain't underage. We didn't do nothin' wrong.
What did you call me for? We can't afford another tangle with the cops.
We already got a couple marks in their books.
Expensive clothes.
Good booze.
If she's a bum, she's good at it.
For a hundred bucks, you take her home.
And don't say where you found her.
Pass. Too tricky.
Tony, wait. You said you two were partners.
Ex-partners.
We got a divorce a year ago.
We closed the books, and it's gonna stay that way.
A report's been filed.
She's a missing person.
She ain't missin' much, baby. She's married. Name of Diana Pines.
Her father filed the report-
Rudolph Kosterman.
Kosterman Construction?
That's the one.
The big wheel from Mayport.
Oh, he's big.
Big?
He holds a mortgage on Florida.
Now, what about it, Tony?
I can't take this girl home. If I do, they'll trace me right back to here.
Now, you do owe me a favor.
I saved his life.
I could square that with a stick of gum.
Joke all you like, but that guy was taking dead aim... at the back of your head with a .45.
All right. All right. Cool it.
You get one favor, I get 200.
What? Two hundred?
Two hundred.
Okay -
Here. A hundred now... and the other hundred tomorrow?
Deal.
I'm gonna bring the car around the side exit.
After I’ve been gone 30 minutes, call Kosterman and tell him I’m bringing his daughter home.
And tell chubby here it wouldn't be healthy if he forgets the other hundred.
He'll get it. He'll get it.
If the cops don't sweat the name of this hotel out of him.
Somebody'll squeeze somethin' out of Tony... the day Georgia elects a colored governor.
Diana, where did you disappear to?
You're not hurt or anything?
Does it matter?
Don't talk like that. I’ve been so worried- Daddy! Daddy!
Just what's your connection with my wife?
She's nothing but a $200 stranger to me, that's all.
Are you Mr. Rome?
I’m Rudy Kosterman.
Do you mind coming inside for a few minutes?
Don't worry, sugar.
It's just a hangover.
I’ll get you something to make you sleep and put you to bed.
I’ll be with you in a minute.
Slut!
Now that I’ve been introduced, who are you?
Tony Rome.
Who's the woman helping Diana?
Mrs. Kosterman.
Oh, I get it. She's the mother and you're the grandmother.
She's the stepmother.
I’m the leftover from last night's party.
Oh, my name's Ann Archer.
Slut- That's just a nickname.
Only my dearest friends use it.
Pour you a drink?
Yeah, I’ll have a gin. Make it light.
What time does the hockey game start?
How long have you known Diana?
An hour. How'd she get so wet?
I thought you'd know.
There was some drinking here last night.
She got a little teed off about something and tore off in a taxi.
Well, I finally got her settled down.
She says she passed out in a hotel room.
She couldn't have gotten that drunk.
Was she alone, or did you have anything to do with her condition?
She had intimate relations with a bottle of booze. That's all I know.
What was the name of that hotel?
That's where I fit in.
The management didn't want any trouble, so they hired me to bring her home.
Hired you? Yes. I’m a private detective, Mr. Kosterman.
Now, she's home safely.
Why don't you drop the whole matter?
You know, I could call the police and make you reveal the name of the hotel.
Mr. Kosterman's a very rich man.
He has a lot of influence.
He'd have to be rich to pay the tabs for the booze she drinks.
Oh, now, just one minute, Mr. Rome.
You don't know my daughter.
She's never done anything like this before.
Now, she's in trouble. She must be.
Why would she do a thing like that?
I think a psychiatrist can give you better answers than I can, Mr. Kosterman.
My only child disappears and comes back in this condition, and I wanna know why!
I'll pay ya to find out!
Why don't you let her sleep it off, and when she feels better, talk it over.
If she's in a jam, then you can hire me.
How do we know who this fellow is- or what he is?
Lieutenant Santini of the Miami Police
Department can vouch for me.
My number's in the phone book.
Mr. Rome-
What's your problem?
Would you give me a lift into town?
I would be delighted, lady.
I don't think they have the makings of another party here. Ciao.
If you do know what's bothering Diana, you better tell me.
Rudy, I told you before, I don't know.
Tony Rome.
I never met a private detective before.
Kind of a dirty business, isn't it?
Maybe. Only thing worse is the people who hire them.
How'd you get into it?
Well, there's a compulsion among the lower classes to get money to eat once in a while.
Maybe you heard the rumor about it.
All right. So I’m rich.
Why get mad at me?
Because it's not nice manners to tell a man who's in a dirty business... that he's in a dirty business.
Where can I drop you?
The Fontainebleau.
I don't live in Miami.
I’m down here dumping a husband.
What did he do to get dumped?
He was just blah in a general way.
Money was his best feature.
And we lived in Buffalo.
Have you ever been to Buffalo?
Never. I promised myself when I was ten years old.
Why don't we stop for a drink?
About that Kosterman setup-
Ain't it a little strange... the daughter and son-in-law to be living with dad and stepmother?
I mean, don't you think it's a little too cozy?
The kids are building a new house.
It's taking longer than they thought.
It figures. lt'd take about six months to build a liquor cabinet.
How'd you get hooked up with 'em?
I met 'em at a party.
That's all I do down here- go to parties and dodge passes.
Every man you meet thinks you want to play “slap and tickle.”
Tell 'em you're not interested.
Well, that's the trouble.
Sometimes I am.
Why don't you flip a coin?
You know, it's the damnedest thing-
People like me are called F.M.s.
“F”- What?
Formerly married.
We're divorced women.
We can't claim to be the town virgins... and we can't afford to be the town tramps.
What do we do?
Well, you could hang a sign on yourself- says, “Occasionally promiscuous.”
You married?
Why not?
Up to now, I haven't found a dame who's a bookmaker.
See, I gamble.
And that wouldn't be a nice life for a lady.
Besides that, I-
I live on a boat, and I like it.
A boat? Yeah, a little item I won in a dice game.
Would you like to come up for a drink?
No. Forget it.
It would make it too easy.
For you or for me?
You're an interesting man,
Tony Rome.
But I suddenly realize
I’ve been doing all the pursuing.
Not healthy for my ego.
You can relax.
You're just suffering from a case of the divorcée blues.
What's that? It's kind of like a post-pregnancy depression.
Neither lasts.

Good evening.
How are ya?
Come in.
Sit down.
You probably want to get to bed.
Mm-hmm. That's reasonable. You give us the pin, we'll leave.
Well, I don't know how to tell you this, but I’m fresh out of pins.
That's too bad.
Well, do I get told why?
We could knock you out with a gun butt if you prefer. It's up to you.
- Or the chloroform.
- Oh, I’ll have some of this.
When.
Mr. Rome.
Mr. Rome?
I don't remember the other night.
You are Mr. Rome?
I was last night.
I went to your office.
The janitor thought you might be here.
Daddy said I should thank you.
I've been paid for it.
I am grateful, but now I want my pin back.
You want your what back?
A diamond pin.
Everybody needs a pin.
I was wearing it when I left the house, and it was gone when you brought me home.
That doesn't mean I took your pin.
I'm positive someone took it. lf l had it, I sure as hell ain't got it now.
You mean, someone came aboard and did this?
Nah. I had the boat specially built to look like this.
What has this got to do with my pin?
If you don't know, I sure don't know.
Why don't you turn it over to the police department or the insurance company?
I don't want my father to find out I lost it.
He's upset with me enough as it is.
Please, can't you find it for me?
Sweetheart, anybody could've taken that pin.
I think you must've guzzled your way through half of Miami.
I must've.
I left home with $100 in my purse, and there was only 15 when I got back.
Fifteen?
Mm-hmm.
What do you figure the value of the pin?
About 5,000.
Okay, the going rate is 10% if I find it. Deal?
All right, if you can find it.
Excuse me.
- Rome here. - This is Rudy Kosterman.
You'll never guess what happened.
Your daughter skipped out again.
You guessed it. Can you find her?
I don't know. I’ll try.
May not be easy.
Also, I want you to find out what's bothering her.
Something is.
She wouldn't talk to me about it.
Tell me about that son-in-law of yours.
Do you think he plays around?
I doubt it. He can barely farm his own land.
I’ll get back to you.
I'll tell you what.
You meet me at my office late this afternoon, about 5:00.
Will you have my pin by then?
Maybe.
I'd do just anything to get it back.
Just anything.
I appreciate what you're offering, sweetheart, but I need the money more.
I’ll see you later.
Park it.
JV”
Tony. How'd it go? Not bad.
- Good.
- N'
The hundred.
What?
The other hundred.
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Here.
Now I want the pin.
What pin?
The diamond pin.
The one that the girl wasn't wearing by the time I got here.
Look. She hit a lot of bars.
Somewhere along the line, she got rolled.
She got rolled all right- right here, for the money and the pin.
Are you callin' me a crook?
Listen, this kid was out 85 bucks.
She couldn't possibly drink that much whiskey.
She could sip that much.
Manny's Cleaning Establishment.
Manny, this is Rome.
How about the sixth at Hialeah?
[indistinct 1
Well, pox on that horse!
I’m workin' for nothin' again this week.
Tail outta here and use your own phone.
Now, how 'bout that pin?
I didn't steal no pin.
You'd steal a train if you could find a fence who'd handle it.
All right. I’ll admit-
I took 50 from her purse.
In a way, I was doing her a favor.
She'd had enough to drink.
Now, ain't we the big, fat social worker.
One of these days, Turpin, they're gonna nail you on a real solid charge.
They catch you hangin' around a school yard.
I've been waitin' to do this for a long time!
Temper, temper.
Remember, I’m your guest.
Beside that, I’m on short dough, and I’m out of shape.
Wouldn't pay for the bridge work.
Now, Ralph, the pin ain't worth that much.
Beside that, it's hot. The most you could get would be 200 bucks from a fence.
So I give you a hundred.
No sweat. So?
You're still callin' me a crook.
Nah,nah.
But you run into luck every once in a while.
You might find it layin' around.
If you do, you drop it in the mail, you get a hundred, no questions.
Okay. So I’ll look around.
Who knows?
Maybe she dropped it someplace.
Yeah. Like maybe, uh, under the rug.
You know him?
Never saw him before.
I’m sorry!
This gimpy leg of mine is always-
Why don't you get a skate?
I really am sorry, but I’ve got to go.
Oh. You never stay anymore.
You just come and go, go and come, and-
Stop it, Lorna.
It's all right, Diana. I understand.
I understand too.
What the hell. You know.
I mean, thanks for the money.
It's not enough, but, you know-
It's the best I can do.
I’d bring more if l could.
You're very generous.
Drive carefully.
Good night, Adam.
For God's sake, Lorna.
When will you learn to shut up?
That really bugs you, doesn't it?
L mean, that I can-
I can say anything I want to her.
You're gonna get sick, really sick, if you keep that up.
I don't care. I-
If I do, there's not really too much you can do about it, is there?
My face!
My face- Get your grubby hands off me!
Sam! Sam, stop it! You heard me, Sam.
Let him go! Let him go!
My brother's normally very gentle.
You must have upset him.
He didn't mention it.
He's quite formidable, as you've discovered.
He's pretty damn big too.
Nature's compensation to him, l suppose.
Why don't you keep him on a leash?
Who are you, and what are you doing here?
I came here to snap a few pictures of the place f o r Better Homes and Gardens.
Oop! Oh, my leg!
Adam! My leg!
Get eight more guys.
You could have a minyan.
Oh, Adam, my leg hurts!
Joe. Tony Rome.
Give me an up-to-date list on fences operating in Miami.
Hold it.
Just a second.
I think I got company.
I’ll call you later.
Homicide. Santini.
Dave, it's Tony.
My ex-partner just took a hit in my office.
His gun's here, and I think he used it.
Yeah. Somebody's walking around Miami with a big, fat .45 slug in him.
Sure, I know everybody knows
I hate his guts. So what?
Okay. I’ll be here waiting for you.
Tony Rome, to see Mr. Kosterman.
I’m sorry. I’m afraid it's too late.
- It's all right. Let him in!
- That's big of you.
Thanks to your daughter, there was a guy killed in my office tonight.
What's my daughter gotta do with a guy killed in your office?
He was the house dick from the hotel where I picked her up.
Oh. Well, that doesn't mean that she's involved.
She's involved.
And pretty soon, Mr. Kosterman, there are gonna be a gang of cops crawlin' all over me... wanting to know why this guy got himself croaked in my office.
Well, they can't hang you if you didn't do it.
No, but they could lift my license.
Now, you can pull some strings in this state. I’d like you to pull a few... and get the law off my back.
Who's Lorna?
Lorna?
Mm-hmm. Dame with the bottle.
That's my ex-wife.
That's Diana's mother.
Mm-hmm. Adam?
Adam Boyd. That's her present husband.
How'd you get mixed up with them?
How'd you get mixed up with them?
Oh, that's a good question.
I've asked myself that quite a few times.
You see, I started out as a bricklayer, a common bricklayer.
Twenty million dollars later, they said I had no class, so I bought some- Lorna.
I caught her with Boyd, and I kicked her out.
She landed pretty hard. She wanted
Boyd, and now she's got him.
Mm-hmm. Well, that's her problem.
My problem's a stiff layin' in my office.
All right. I’ll advance you 500.
And they'll be a bonus.
Just keep my family out of it.
I need more than money,
Mr. Kosterman. I need juice.
All right. I’ll make a few phone calls.
But I’m sure that Diana had nothing to do with it.
Maybe. Maybe not.
But if you let the cops roust me too long,
I’m gonna bring her into this thing.
You'll get a refund, but she's gonna be in it.
Mrs. Kosterman.
Did my husband hire you?
You were listening.
Did he or didn't he?
Mr. Rome, I love my husband.
I don't want to see him hurt.
Whatever you find out about Diana, please, use judgment about whether to tell it.
I usually do.
And I’ve blown a few clients doing it.
Tell me something. How did you get hooked up with someone like Mr. Kosterman?
I love him.
No offense, but, uh, seems to me you might have run some pretty fast tracks.
We met in the bar of the Columbia Towers in New York.
I was a cocktail waitress.
He was lonely, and-
I guess you could say I was a pickup.
I could. But I wasn't hustling, if that's what you mean.
And I’ve been good for him.
And how's he been for you?
The best.
This is $500.
If you find out anything upsetting about Diana, don't tell him.
First Diana hires me, then your husband hires me, now you wanna hire me.
If you had a bigger family,
I could retire.
But I can't take it.
Why not?
That would give me three clients at cross purposes. Unethical.
Do you really care?
This may come as a surprise to you, lady, it may also break my bookmaker's heart, but sometimes I do.
Then at least tell me first.
That I can do.
Mr. Rome.
Mm-hmm?
Diana's pin-
Have you any idea where it is?
I thought I did, but now I’m not too sure.
You must've found out something by now.
Are you sure you're working hard enough?
Me, working hard enough?
Do you know since I took this job, I’ve had to turn down two offers to go to bed?
And I never wanna work that hard again. Never.
Two!
Santini, please.
Dave, it's Tony. Oh, wait a minute!
Don't blow a gasket!
I’m on my way down.
Yeah, I’ll be right there.
You always come in this late?
No wonder your wife's in heat.
Come on. We've been going around for four hours with this crap, Dave.
Why don't we knock it off. Don't be such a hard-nose. Give us cooperation.
YOU know I didn't kill that bum.
Ballistics already told you the bullet in Turpin didn't come from my gun.
Why don't you check the hospitals for the guy that Turpin shot.
A guy walking around with a hole that big in him has got to go get patched up.
Look,Tony,
I just asked for a list of your clients.
A list of my clients I could write on a piece of confetti.
Yeah.
I take it I’ve been released.
Yeah.
It seems you know Rudy Kosterman.
Well, like I always said, it's nice to have influential friends.
Is it?
Your father didn't think so, at the end.
Dave, we've been friends a long time. You're upset.
I'm gonna forget you just said that- this time.
You shouldn't. You should remember it. Why?
As a warning.
All right, you sanctimonious bastard.
You want to play for keeps, we'll play for keeps.
I'll dump Kosterman, and I’ll turn over everything I’ve been holding on to to you if-
- If what?
- If you forget the word that came down.
You know Kosterman's my client. You drag him down here and bother him like you bothered me.
Okay. You made your point.
Now get out.
I'd be delighted.
It's dawn!
Mm-hmm.
You certainly pick odd hours to call on a girl. Mm-hmm.
Not that I’m complaining.
Come on in.
Coffee or a screwdriver?
Screwdriver.
Vodka or gin?
Gin.
Tell me something.
Was Diana wearing a diamond pin... the night she flew out of the Kosterman house?
I didn't notice.
All women look at other women's jewelry.
Not me. Just their men.
Miami Beach-
20 miles of sand looking for a city.
Twenty miles of pure jerks.
Florida orange juice- That's about the only thing
I’ve been enjoying since I’ve been down here.
You know, the other day, I met this big hunk of stuff out by the pool.
He started to turn me on, so we went to the bar for a drink.
You know what he orders?
Brandy and ginger ale.
Brandy and ginger ale!
Mmm.
Don't get flustered. Just testing.
Mmm.
Gin for you, vodka for me.
I’ll drink to that.
What was I talking about?
Oh. This stink-pot town.
Do you know the women outnumber the men 10 to 1?
That means you go out with guys who order brandy and ginger ale.
Brandy- Unless you want to sit in a hotel room... waiting for a picture to get crooked on the wall so you can straighten it.
Just anything to do.
You know what your trouble with men is? What?
You don't try hard enough. You gotta stay in there and punch all the time.
It's a man's town.
Admit it- you've made a few scores.
Mm-hmm. With women who want me to watch their husbands... to see if they're cheating.
Now, tell me about Diana and the party.
Oh, can't you cool this detective stuff for a while?
After all, you're not a real cop anymore.
All right, so I’ve been nosing around.
You were a cop, and so was your father... until he leaned on the wrong politician.
It broke in the papers, and he blew his brains out.
At least, that's the story I heard.
Are you finished?
No wonder you quit the force.
All right. Let's get back to Diana.
When she left the party, she must've been pretty steamed.
Just a minute.
Were you, by chance, friendly with her husband?
Don't tell me she hired you to find out how far it went between us.
How friendly were you?
Well, she walked into the bedroom, and she found us together in a clinch.
Would you like to describe the clinch?
Well, if was sort of... a leaning-over-me clinch.
Uh, how far leaning-over-me clinch?
Sort of a... flat leaning-over-me clinch.
Oh, nothing happened.
She blitzed it, walking in like that.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Some people have no manners.
Thanks for the information, baby.
Hey! What's the sudden rush?
Stick around.
You look like you need to get some sleep and relax.
Oh, I do, I do, but I’ll tend to that later.
Right now there are too many questions unanswered.
And besides, I only know a part of what Diana's problem is.
Well, what about my problem?
I intend to take care of that later.
Oh, yeah. You're gonna be my next case.
You can count on it.
By the way, if I don't get back soon, don't start without me.
Oh, Malcolm!
Thanks, Smitty. Hi, Tony. Just finished putting your boat back together.
What's the tab?
Two-forty.
Two-forty?
I asked you to fix it, not rebuild it.
Yeah. Yeah, Manny.
I’ll pay you this morning.
Yeah, I’m a little surprised myself.
I got a client.
What's the price on the Celtics?
That ain't bad.
Give me a hundred of it.
And how about the morning line on that fight up in Toronto?
I figure Turpin had you check this out before sending it to me.
When?
How did you figure that?
Because you're the guy
I caught him peddling hot jewelry to.
That's why I broke up our partnership.
What do you mean, “hot”?
The cops don't know you're a fence yet.
But I could let 'em know.
Give, or I feed you to 'em.
Turpin brought it in about 4:00 yesterday.
He said it was a family heirloom.
Some heirloom- glass!
I offered him five bucks for it.
He must be laughing like hell.
He sent it to me for a hundred dollars.
Sounds like his kind of joke.
Shame, him tapping out like that.
Yeah.
There just ain't enough sweet, miserable bums like him left... on earth anymore, the creep.
Mr. Rome!
Mr. Rome!
Are we alone?
Yeah. Why? What did you have in mind?
I'm Mrs. Schuyler. I want to hire you.
Well, I’m afraid not.
You see, I’m tied up on a case this week.
Maybe next week.
But that'll be too late!
My pussycat will be dead by then!
Your pussycat?
Someone's trying to poison her.
Well, how do you know?
From her attitude.
She-She's nervous. She's terrified.
Well, you can't bank too much on the attitude of a pussycat.
Oh! When a pussy used to be so sunny and full of fun?
With the sweetest smile.
You got a pussy that smiles?
No! That's just the point!
She's frowning now.
She knows. I tell you, she knows.
Well, I’m afraid I-l can't help you,
Mrs. Schuyler.
But- You-You could at least meet my pussy.
No, no, no. No, it's not possible.
I can't meet your pussy. No.
Why don't you try the Burns Agency?
They specialize in pussy that won't smile.
Oh? Oh- Oh, thank you, Mr. Rome.
Thank you.
Mr. Rome, have you found my pin yet?
No, but I’m close.
How can you get close lying here on a couch?
Look, sweetheart, if you don't like the way I operate, get yourself a new boy.
I'm sorry. It's just that I’m worried.
You got a cigarette?
No.
Figures.
Your mother, Lorna- how often do you bankroll her?
Oh, I work sometimes.
She needs money.
I try to give her what I can from my allowance.
You still get an allowance?
Well, Donald's still learning the business, and Daddy doesn't pay him much yet.
So he gives me a little extra.
And you slip it to Mommy.
What about Boyd?
Does he ever come up with any groceries?
He used to be a nice person.
It's just that- well, people change.
They don't always turn out the way you hope. Oh, I know.
You should see my baby pictures.
Tell me something. What insurance company handles your jewelry?
- Acme.
- This Kosterman goes big.
We're carrying close to 400,000 on his wife's jewelry, 100,000 on his daughter's.
You got an up-to-date list of all the job jewelers in Miami?
Yeah.
Uh, look, Tony, if there's anything hickey here, I’d like to know about it.
You will.
This'll take me the rest of the afternoon.
I’ll get back to you.
Uh, Tony.
You still going with that Cuban girl?
Nah, she ran off.
Left me with a $40 perfume bill.
Listen, if I’d known she was gonna smell that good, I’d have hung right in there.
Nice ride.
I can help you, sir?
Yes. You see, uh,
I’ve been to several other places, and I need somebody who's discreet.
My wife has a piece of jewelry, and, uh-
What I’m trying to say is, could you possibly remove the original stones and replace 'em with phonies?
Sure.
You don't need to be ashamed.
Many people, they need money, they don't want their friends to know.
I, uh, put glass stones in their jewelry, the good stones I sell, and nobody knows.
Very good.
It is a common thing.
This is my wife's pin.
Your-Your wife's- I- I-
You've seen this before?
No,no,no,no. Never.
That's good.
'Cause whoever worked on this pin before could be in a great deal of trouble.
Not you, of course. Nah.
Qu-Queen Jewelers?
This is Ruyter.
Is-ls Jules Langley there?
Well- Well-Well, tell him to call me right away.
It is very important. Yes.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
The gun.
Thanks. Why not? Yours is bigger than mine.
Walk.
Go on in.
You're the tour guide. Where do we go?
In there.
Mr. Langley? Here he is.
Yeah, I’ve been waiting for you, ever since the Dutchman called.
You made him very nervous.
I got that feeling, yeah.
Well, he's not nervous anymore.
Tomorrow morning he'll be a nice little Dutchman... who slipped and fell into the canal.
This way, Mr. Rome.
Mr. Rome?
Yeah.
Nimmo was supposed to tail you to the pin.
Catleg was there to back-stop him.
Oh, and they both disappeared.
Ain't that tough?
All right. Let's have the pin.
I haven't got the pin.
How about the pin?
I haven't got it!
Put him up here.
We don't seem to be getting through to you.
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, you sure are. Pin's in my office.
You're not that stupid.
You had it when you pumped the Dutchman.
Get the Dutchman out of the tub.
We'll try giving him a drink.
Yes, sir.
Uh, just in case you get noisy-

Rose? How are you? It's Tony.
Is Dave there? Fine.
Dave, did you find anybody with Turpin's slug in him yet?
Well, he's got to be someplace- a busted doctor, a private gut clinic.
Well, I got something for you, baby.
Three more stiffs- two on the floor and one in the bathtub.
Yeah. 1605 Galewood Road.
The ones on the floor I did.
No, no. Don't bother to look for me.
I’m in a motel, and I’m whipped.
I'm beat.
I’ll check in with you tomorrow. I promise.
Calm down, will you, please? I’m clean.
It's a clear case of self-defense.
And besides, remember the Kosterman juice.
Ciao.
Where- Where are we?
You're on your way home. Again.
Listen, I think we better get something straight.
Next time you decide to go out on a drunk, why don't you pick a nice, comfortable gutter?
I wasn't drunk. I got sleepy.
Uh-huh.
Bottle sleepy.
I was upset about something.
I had to see you.
If it's about Ann Archer and your husband, you can forget it.
I can take her off the market, no charge.
Home.
Nice boat.
I'm glad you think it's a nice boat.
Some people think it's a motel.
Good morning, Daddy.
Easy,baby. You all right?
Yeah? I’m all right.
Yeah. Rita, take Diana inside the house.
Please, Rita.
I don't understand what's happening to that kid of mine.
I got another little item you might have trouble understanding.
Your wife and daughter got some jewelry worth about a half a million, right?
Right.
My hunch is there ain't enough real stones in that stuff... to buy yourself a morning paper.
What are you, crazy?
Have it appraised.
Well, who could have done it?
It's one thing you can't blame on Lyndon Johnson.
Well, nobody in my family.
You think maybe it was a passing tramp?
My son-in-law?
No, he wouldn't jeopardize his future.
Nah! He's vice president of my company.
He started out as a vice president?
Yeah. Well-
What could I do? You know what he was when my daughter first met him?
An assistant tennis pro.
He wasn't even a pro. An assistant.
Then that leaves your wife or your daughter. They had no reason.
Well, people take up hobbies.
Maybe they took to betting horses.
Another nice hobby for women is men.
Rome, you're gettin' out of line.
Now wait a minute.
Before you come out swinging, let me tell you something. Nobody steals to do nice things.
You name it, and they'll steal for it- narcotics, blackmail, sex.
Nobody steals to build hospitals.
You know a guy named Catleg?
No.
Nimmo?
No.
You sure?
Nimmo? Now wait a minute.
There was a fella called Nimmo that came to a party at my house a couple of months ago.
I think he came with Ann Archer.
Well, Tony Rome.
Don't you ever sleep in a bed?
Who's Nimmo?
A fellow I met.
He bought a few drinks I paid for.
Come on. I’ll spring for a couple.
I thought you were broke.
I got a little money from Kosterman and his daughter.
You're getting interested in her?
She's all right.
Nice hair, teeth.
Some good-looking odds and ends.
If you mean her figure, she bought part of it. I’ll bet on it.
You lose. Don't get excited.
I looked, but I didn't touch.
Two beers, Smitty.
Thanks for the choice.
How long you know Nimmo?
Four or five months.
I haven't seen him lately though.
I understand you took him to the Kostermans' one night.
Did he get friendly with anybody in the family?
No. Rita chilled him.
Rita.
Yeah, so we left early.
I sure would like to find him.
I can't help you.
He used to have an apartment in town, but he moved.
He couldn't have moved to nowhere.
He's gotta have an address.
Somebody might be able to help you at the
Floradora Club. He used to go there a lot.
Floradora Club.
How 'bout you get dressed,
I take you out?
I wish I were dumb enough to believe this was a social invitation.
It is. It is. The
Floradora Club, right?
Good a place as any. Oh, I love the way I get dates.
Not my sexy legs or my charm.
Somebody's address.
When you're ready, wake me.
I’ll be right over there.
[ Band 1
Nimmo never did say what he did.
I guess he was a gangster or something shady.
He wanted to marry me at first.
You weren't very choosy, were you?
Women can't afford to be.
I learned that early.
I started out wanting to marry a man... who was handsome, rich and witty.
I got all of it.
It took me three husbands to do it.
Hello.
Hi, Miss Archer. You wanted to see me?
Matt Tully, Tony Rome.
How are ya?
Matt owns the place.
My friend here is looking for Nimmo.
He hasn't been in lately.
You know where he lives?
He's a good customer.
I don't ask questions.
You think he's from out of town?
L suppose.
Most people in Miami have a return ticket to somewhere.
Say, uh, miss.
Come here a minute.
You know a guy named Nimmo?
Yes, I think I do.
Good.
Check your files and see if there's a snapshot of him in there.
He's an old friend of mine.
All right.
Have fun, kids.
Make it while you're young.
Let's back up on Nimmo.
You said before he wanted to marry you at first. What'd you mean by that?
We were hitting it off for a while, and he suddenly stopped calling.
Some other woman, l guess.
Some other loot, I guess.
It's just as well. I’d feel like a fool saying I’d been married four times.
Yeah, sounds better if you say you're married three times.
Hey, hi, Miss Archer.
How are you?
Well, Camelot.
Camelot Joe, Tony Rome.
Hi. How are ya?
Glad to see ya.
Say, do you know where we can find Nimmo?
No. Try Georgia McKay.
She's a stripper here.
She knows Nimmo from a ways back.
She backstage now?
No, not now.
We had a convention crowd earlier.
Tully pushed her off on a big tipper.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You know where she lives?
Yeah, the, uh,
Star Crest Trailer Park.
Thanks. See ya later.
Got a weed break, huh?
Listen, uh- Uh, if you don't mind, I’ll stay here.
I’m not that high on strippers.
You're a good girl.
See ya.
Did you find a picture, sweetheart?
Please,
I can't find it in the files.
With a belt like that, I’m surprised you could even find the file.
Sorry, baby.
I owe you for that kid in there.
I said he was a good customer.
You should learn to believe people.
I do.
It's 4:30.
What time is that to get in?
I was out with a customer.
Tully sent me.
Why do you do this to me?
You know how I worry.
You're so worried.
You're half smashed.
Well, that proves something, doesn't it?
You know how I worry about you.
Irene, will you stop telling me how worried you get?
I'm beat.
You Georgia McKay?
Yeah.
I'm a police officer.
I’d like to ask you a few questions.
Police officer?
This is my roommate.
We're looking for a man named Nimmo.
Do you know him?
Nimmo!
He beat her up!
He beat up my Georgia!
Stay away from me.
Well, he beat you up, honey.
Oh, simmer down!
Nimmo's in trouble? I don't want to say anything. I don't want to get involved.
Nimmo- that no-good son of a-
Shut up!
It's late, Miss McKay. If you'd rather come downtown and talk, it's all right with me.
I get paid either way.
Nimmo hasn't been around for a while.
You can begin by telling me where he lives.
I haven't the slightest.
Where'd you go with this customer?
It's 4:30.
No bar's open that late.
Forget it, Irene. I’m beat.
You need your sleep.
She shouldn't be traipsing around at this hour with men.
Maybe it slipped her mind.
How 'bout telling me where you first met him?
We're from the same neighborhood in New York.
You shouldn't be undressing in front of him!
I do it every night in front of 300 men.
How's he any different?
Where in New York?
Queens.
His father owns a butcher shop.
My old lady lives next door.
His real name is Joe Furman.
It's all I can tell you.
You can tell me why he beat you up.
I was a little girl when I knew him back home.
I ran into him a few times down here at the club.
He asked me out.
Well, I guess he expected something different.
But you wouldn't understand.
Oh, I might. Maybe he was trying to get in the wrong ballpark.
That's her business.
Bust outta here, will you?
Shut up! He's a cop! I'll shutup when I want to.
Shut up!
Oh, lose a few pounds and shut up!
You- Oh!
Oh! Oh, honey!
Oh, honey, I didn't mean it.
Oh, baby, please come here.
Come here! Come here.
I’m sorry. I’m sorry!
Oh, sweetie, I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it.
Don't make me do things like that.
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
I didn't mean it. You want the lights on or off?
Yeah, better off.
Little Dave!
Hi, Uncle Tony.
Come on up here. How you feeling?
Fine.
That a boy. Hello, Rose.
Hi, Tony.
Hey, tiger. What do you say there?
How many times do I gotta tell you?
He don't talk.
He don't talk.
Yeah, I forgot about that.
Dave's pretty mad at ya.
I know.
He's out back, and the beer's in the usual place.
Okay. I’ll catch you later.
Good luck.
Right.
How are ya?
[ Baby crying 1
You missed a spot over there.
Thanks.
I get the word you're still mad at me.
What did you expect?
You and your Kosterman juice.
You got us all running around like errand boys, checking on things you wouldn't explain.
Did you check on Oscar and Langley?
Yeah. Yeah, I checked.
You didn't kill much.
Oscar was wanted on a couple of assault raps.
Langley had three arrests in New York.
Released for lack of evidence.
What kind of evidence?
The evidence that runs out the back door.
He booked talent for stag parties and sold jewelry on the side.
Ain't much of a loss.
You know, your self-defense plea should hold.
But not on the case of Turpin.
You're our best bet until we find out what really happened.
Why don't you drop it, Dave?
Turpin's worth no trouble at all.
Are you crazy? We find a dead body in your office. We can't ignore it.
If it was a dead archbishop, I could understand the fuss, but Turpin's a big fat zero.
Tony, you gonna tell me what's going on?
In time.
Thanks.
Meantime, check on a guy named Joe Furman, alias Nimmo.
Also on a guy named Catleg, walks with a limp.
Because I think these two guys followed me to Turpin's hotel. Why?
And I think they later caught up with him in my office.
If that's true, one of them is walking around with a slug in him out of Turpin's gun.
Okay, I’ll check out the names.
But, Tony, tell me- what's going on?
Will you stop worrying?
I’d never leave you holding the greasy end of the stick, now would I?
I don't know. Would ya?
Rudy, I keep telling you this vice president of yours... wants us to finish the top floor this week.
That's what you said at the start, remember? One floor a week. No, no.
How many days did it rain this week?
Two days. That's why-
Two. The only way we're gonna finish this week... is to go into Saturday and Sunday, right?
Well, I thought you said- Will you stop thinking and start listening?
Go ask the bookkeeper how much it'll cost to keep all the men on overtime for the weekend.
Huh? Go ahead. Go with him.
Okay.
What do you want?
I need a word with you.
Well, hurry it up.
Rita's gonna call for me in a couple minutes. Listen to me.
Two hours after I brought your little girl home without the pin, Langley knew about it.
That means the tip had to come from somebody in your family.
If you're gonna dig up a lot of dirt,
I just as soon you let the whole thing drop.
I don't think the insurance company would be that polite.
What's your wife's maiden name?
That's none of your damn business.
Look. Rita didn't do it if that's what you're thinking.
If she wanted more money, all she has to do is ask me for it.
Those jewels are worth about a half million dollars, Mr. Kosterman.
Even if she asked for that much?
She'd get it.
No questions?
Good-bye, Rome.
Look out! Look out! f Gunshots j
Rudy! Rudy! It's all right.
It's all right, Rita.
It's just my arm.
That's all. It's just my arm.
The bullet is out.
The bone isn't broken.
There's nothing to worry about.
Thank you.
It's a superficial wound. He'll be fine.
Thank God.
See,honey?
I told you he was too tough to die.
When can I see him? They'll let you know soon enough.
Mrs. Kosterman, what's your maiden name?
The desk would like to know in order to fill out the surgical release forms.
It's Rita Neilson.
Are you sure he's all right?
Positively.
Whatever happened to that fella Nimmo?
Nimmo?
Nimmo.
I don't know anybody by that name.
Yes, you do, Rita.
He came to the house once.
We didn't like him.
Maybe that's it. You don't like him well enough to remember him.
Can't you see she's upset?
Stop bothering her.
Don't be a hero, buster.
I checked your war record.
He went AWOL when they handed him a rifle at basic training.
Hey, you and your clients.
Well, you gotta admit
I bring you a lot of customers.
However, this one is still alive.
You got a make on the guy who shot him?
Yeah, Catleg.
The guy I told you about with the limp.
He was driving a 1967 gold Pontiac four-door sedan.
Here's the license number. We'll run it through Motor Vehicles.
Rented or stolen is my guess.
Lieutenant?
Yeah.
Here's the bullet.
Get it to the crime lab.
Yes, sir.
I think you'll find when you get a make on that... that it matches the one they lifted out of Turpin.
Look. Do I get told how this ties in with Turpin?
I wish I knew. Anything on Nimmo?
Nothing local, under Nimmo or Joe Furman.
How 'bout you contact the New York Police Department?
Have 'em check out his father.
He runs a butcher shop in Queens.
I figure if they write to each other, we can get an address on him here in Miami, whether it's Nimmo or Furman, whatever name he uses.
And while you're at it, check on Mrs. Kosterman.
For what? If I knew for what, I wouldn't ask you.
All I found out about her is that her maiden name is Rita Neilson, and she used to work in a bar at the Columbia Towers.
Uh, Mr. Kosterman would like to see you.
Thanks, Doc.
Oh, almost forgot. They called me from the coroner's office.
They wanna know who's gonna bury Turpin.
They wanna know what?
Well, you and he were partners once.
Wait a minute.
You try to hit me with a murder rap, and now you expect me to pay for the bum's funeral?
Well, I hear you got lucky.
Yeah. Thanks to you.
That's one push I owe you.
The attempt on you sounds like a contract, Mr. Kosterman.
I asked to see Mr. Rome alone.
I'm Lieutenant Santini.
I said alone.
When you're finished, do you mind coming down and take a look at some mug shots?
Catleg may turn up.
Oh, I’d be thrilled.
Thanks.
Contract? What contract?
What's he talking about?
Farmed-out gun, Mr. Kosterman.
Tell me something.
You got a will, right? How does it read?
Well, now look-
Look, Rome. I don't want any people digging into my personal-
Why don't you wise up? Losing a little jewelry is one thing, but being dead's another one.
I know what you're thinking, but-
No, it must be some kind of mix-up.
They mistake me for somebody-
Will you please cut it out?
People don't shoot at other people just for the hell of it, you know.
You've been signed for.
Now how does the will read?
Well, my wife- my wife, she gets almost everything.
What do you call “almost”?
Oh, boy, you're a nosy bastard.
She gets the corporation- stocks, the bonds, the cash.
And Diana, she gets-
What the hell does Diana get?
Oh, yeah.
She gets the boat and the kennels.
And the summer place on Sea Island and a trust fund.
I'd like to wind up with the leftovers.
But I’d rather have your wife's end.
Rome, you don't really think she would do a thing like this.
I don't know. I don't know.
All I know is that she's a liar.
That's all I know so far.
No luck on Catleg.
I’m down to out-of-state felons.
I got a rundown on that car. It was reported stolen Tuesday night.
That's four days ago. He certainly wouldn't be driving around Miami all this time.
Probably stashed somewhere.
Hello? Yes, who's calling?
What? No, he's not.
Honest to God, you're hopeless. Do you know who that was on the phone?
Mm-hmm. My bookmaker.
This is supposed to be a police station.
How do you think it looks- a bookie using our main switchboard?
Not very nice. Not very nice.
Huh-huh-huh-huh.
Mr. Catleg.
Alias, alias, alias.
He's got enough names to start his own phone book.
Arson, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, but no murder charge.
That only means he's a lousy shot.
I'll get copies made, and we'll canvass all the downtown hotels and motels.
I don't know, Dave. If I were an imported gun, I wouldn't hang around Miami.
I’d jump down to maybe the Keys.
That's out of our jurisdiction.
But since you seem to be running this case-
I’ll grab a sandwich. Be back in a few minutes and get a copy of that picture.
Oh, by the way, Dave.
If that guy calls back, bet me $50 to win-
Firefly in the fifth race.
Fifty.
You're in luck.
We got a vacancy.
How nice.
Do you know him?
Why?
Five.
Not till you make me happy.
Can you make it 10? I’m thinking to make it two-fifty.
Well, he, uh, he was staying here, but he checked out early this morning.
To where?
How would I know?
You got 50 cents.
You wanna try for a buck?
Well, he registered as, uh, Fields.
John Fields.
Drove a Pontiac sedan. That's all I can think of. Mm-hmm.
Did he ever make any calls through that switchboard?
Yeah, yeah, he made one.
To whom?
That oughta cost you more.
You haven't earned this yet.
Here it is. Uh, Wednesday night.
To a Sally Bullock in, uh, Miami.
I got it. I got it. Get the number.
You won't get anybody there now.
It's a joint.
It's called the Paradise Cove.
It ain't open till night.
What did he say to this here Sally Bullock?
I don't listen in.
You should have.
You just blew yourself an extra fin.
Hi. I was beginning to think you were still hung up on that stripper.
No, she's outta my league.
Can I use your phone?
Sure. Go ahead.
Listen. You told me that, uh, Rita chilled
Nimmo at Kosterman's one night.
How big a chill?
A gale or a breeze or what?
She chilled him. No more, no less.
He must have done something. Did he insult her, throw her on the rug or what?
He said hello and struck out.
That's all I know.
Why all this harping on Nimmo?
'Cause I think he keyed this whole affair.
I don't know why, but I think he did.
Homicide.
What's the matter?
Couldn't you afford a whole dress?
Santini, please.
Where?
Oh. Thanks.
Get ready, baby. We're eating.
I’m ready.
Are you sure you told me everything you know about Nimmo?
You were pretty close to him, weren't you?
Not close close.
I’m not as wicked as you think. I’ve only had one affair since I’ve been here.
It's off-season.
Well, he was a nice young guy.
He wanted to get the hang of it before he got married.
Oh, come on.
What do ya say, Packy?
Hiya, Tony.
Say hello to Miss Archer.
How do you do?
My pleasure.
In shape?
Great.
Looking to make a comeback.
Let me see that right hand.
Not bad. Not bad.
How about a tie?
Pretty, ain't it?
Oh, it's beautiful.
I'm a little light. Can you handle it?
It usually costs a fin, but give him 10, huh?
Pretty tie.
Thanks, lady.
I wish I could afford you.
Maybe if I started a syndicate.
He was pretty good in his day. He went the whole route with LaMotta twice.
Hello, Sal. How are ya?
Manny left this for you.
Firefly had legs today.
And you've been peeking.
I already took out what you owed the joint.
Thanks a lot. Will you show Miss Archer to a table? I’ll be right there.
Miss Archer, this way, please.
Hey, Packy.
Yeah, Tony.
You remember my ex-partner Turpin?
Sure. A real crumb.
He's down at the morgue. Bury him.
Oh, uh, see he gets a nice tie.
Something with stripes.
With purple.
Hello, Lieutenant.
Why don't you come over and join us.
Do you mind if I finish my meal?
Not at all. Not at all.
Thank you.
Two martinis- one gin, one vodka.
Yes, sir.
Doubles.
Your 10.
Tony.
Yeah.
Why don't we go away on that boat of yours for a few days.
You know I can't do that. I’m too busy.
I wish I could get busy.
Get a job.
That's too busy.
Dave, this is Ann Archer. This is Lieutenant
Dave Santini of the police department.
How do you do?
Please join us.
I regret to say you're not interrupting anything.
What do you hear?
Nothing on Catleg.
But on Joe Furman, alias Nimmo, we heard from New York P.D.
They think they'll turn up a Miami address for him soon.
That's it? That's all?
That's all.
Except that your friend, Mrs.
Kosterman, was once married to him.
To him? To who him?
Furman.
Nimmo, the guy we're talking about.
I didn't know anything about it if that's what you're thinking.
It never dawned on me.
So, she's been married twice.
There's no rule against it.
If there were, I would have been stopped cold years ago.
There's nothing wrong with it. She's young, and I imagine she's attractive.
Oh, she's attractive.
She's got all the goodies, all right.
Make no mistake about it.
Vodka over here.
I'll get it.
You know anything about a joint called the Paradise Cove?
Yeah. Junkie hangout.
We made a few arrests.
Or if you're looking for some action, there's generally some pay around.
Nice place like that,
I’m sure I’m not invited.
I’m sorry.
Oh, it's all right.
I’m beginning to think my best bet in town is Packy.
I’ll drink to that.
N'
What'll it be?
I’m looking for Sally Bullock.
She ain't here tonight.
I gotta see her.
Hey, if you're that tense, why don't you try Fat Candy.
Who?
Hey, Fat Candy!
- I’ll be with you in a minute.
- Oh, no, no.
I ain't been alone that long, buddy.
Look. She's better than Sally.
Ask any of the guys.
She's Sally's pal.
She knows everything Sally knows.
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
Never mind. Never mind. Fat
Candy, come here quick!
Hold the thought.
Maybe I’ll see you later.
What can I do for you?
This gentleman here- I’d like to buy some of your time.
So buy. It's 20 for starters.
Right here.
Right here?
What are you, some kind of a nut?
There's a room out back.
I’m buying conversation, baby.
Look. If you're writing a book, mister, tail out. I got nothing new to say.
I'm looking for Sally Bullock.
Where does she live?
She moves around a lot. We all do.
I gotta find her. She don't come around much, now that she's got herself a regular.
Listen, uh, I’m new down here, see?
I made no connections yet. She said she was gonna put me on to a pusher.
What are you on- pot, acid, banana peels?
Listen. She tells me this guy handles anything.
He'd push oatmeal if there was enough loot in it.
He's my man. Where can I find him?
Where can I find him?
For another 20?
You're rough.
You sure you ain't a cop?
Do you ever know of a cop who had an extra 20?
His name's Vic Rood.
Corner apartment building,
36th and Jefferson.
Fine, baby.
If they pick me up on this, my man's gonna lean all over you.
The big one over there.
Everything's gonna be cool, sweetheart.
You got a nice smile, mister, you know that?
You sure about the other?
We got that back room empty now.
When I’m stronger.
Ah, you junkies are all alike. You get a needleful, and you never need anything else.
Yeah, crazy, baby.
I'm looking for Sally Bullock.
Not here. I don't know her.
I said I’m looking for Sally Bullock.
Where is she?
You got no right to come busting in here like this.
You're a dope peddler, not a lawyer.
No sense bruising my knuckles on you.
Now you talk to me, or I’ll break your jaw.
If that don't get us no place, we're gonna see if this thing really works.
I don't know where she lives.
I swear it.
When did she make her last buy?
I sold her some “H” a few days ago.
When is she due back here?
Soon,I guess.
Listen to me, buster.
You know exactly how much she's hooked.
And you know exactly how many caps you sold her.
And you know exactly when she's gonna run out and need more. Now tell me when exactly.
She's run out by now.
She should have showed this morning.
Good.
We'll wait for her.
What are you doing?
I'm making something to eat.
How do you like your meat?
Who is it?
It's Sally.
One minute.
Um, one minute.
We'll do it my way, okay?
You're late. I know it. I know it.
God, how I know it.
Here. Whatever that'll buy.
You got about 10 days here.
Hurry it up, will ya, Vic?
All right. Calm down.
Yeah, right.
I got needle fever, that's for sure.
Hurry it up, Vic! Take it easy,baby.
Take it easy.
Now you'd better get at this.
You got a lot of edge on.
Okay. Don't you worry about me.
Just five minutes.
Five minutes
I’ll be president of the world.
Okay?
Academy Award stuff.
You hurtin', baby?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
They stake out the airport, bus terminals and railroad stations.
Highway patrol's been on the alert.
Catleg doesn't have much chance of slipping out of town.
If he already hasn't gotten out of town.
I doubt it. Crash like that, he's bound to be pretty well banged up.
You know what I’d like to do? I’d like to scrap this week and start a brand-new one.
Cheer up. Crime lab says the bullet that hit Kosterman... and the one that went it Turpin came from the same gun.
Which lets you off the hook and puts Catleg on it.
Nimmo and Catleg were in this thing together.
You can bet me that Nimmo's the guy who Turpin shot.
We've checked out every shady doctor in town.
If this Nimmo was patched up, it was done by an unlicensed man.
That's great. All we gotta do is check out an unlicensed doctor.
Sure. It's like trying to find a stick with only one end.
New York finally sent us a local address on Nimmo.
Hit it! Hit it! We did. It was locked.
Nobody home.
Didn't you go inside? Police can't break in without a search warrant.
Only a criminal civilian can do that.
Is that so? What's his address?
Funny that you should ask.
You'll excuse the expression, but tit for tat.
His name is Rood.
He's a pusher. Jefferson Boulevard.
If you gigged him, it's a cinch he's moved out all his stock.
Maybe not.
Maybe he's the kind of guy who forgets.
Maybe he left a little of that grass in a vase.
- Wise guy.
- Thanks.

Mrs. Kosterman, don't make this job any tougher than it is.
Oh, my God.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
You're gonna do a stretch in prison if you don't cut this out.
I gather this was meant for Nimmo.
He's the only one.
He's the only one that could have hired that man to kill Rudy.
You don't believe one husband could have another killed?
You know about it?
I've quit trying to know about it.
I figured Nimmo was blackmailing you.
He threatened to tell Rudy that we were married.
Oh, now wait a minute.
Kosterman can't be that big a fathead.
Why the hell would he care if you were married before?
No, not married before. Still married.
You never bothered to get a divorce?
Oh, it sounds insane. I know it does.
When I left Nimmo, I didn't have enough money for a bus ticket, much less a lawyer.
I don't know. Time just sort of passed.
I didn't know where he was. I didn't care.
And then I met Rudy.
And he wanted to marry me.
He wanted to marry a girl like me.
I just couldn't tell him about Nimmo.
I was so afraid he'd change his mind.
I've met a lot of gamblers in my time, but, lady, you're the champ.
We were coming right down here.
I-l didn't think anybody would find out.
And nobody did.
Until Nimmo showed up that night at the party with Ann Archer.
And you were the perfect pigeon.
Great setup.
The next day he met me.
He threatened to show our marriage license to Rudy, expose me as a bigamist.
And you couldn't come up with all the cash he wanted without Kosterman asking questions, so you decided to dole out the jewelry.
The night that Diana came back without that pin, I-l just got panicked.
I called Nimmo. You were afraid that if the police found the pin, they'd then discover that the rest of the jewelry was phony.
But he must have decided he could blackmail me for a lot more... if Rudy were killed and I’d inherit everything.
Here. Wipe your face.
I'll take you home.
Diana can put you to bed.
She's probably still at Dr. Boyd's.
Dr. Boyd?
Her stepfather.
Why a doctor?
Well, he really isn't.
He used to be until they took away his license.
Now, why would they do a thing like that?
They caught him doing abortions.
Tell me something.
You think Nimmo might know Dr. Boyd?
No.
You think he might know of him?
Well, he might.
Before he was through,
Nimmo knew everything about us.
Oh, Mr. Rome, you have to find Nimmo.
I don't know how, but you've got to stop him.
Uh-huh.
If somebody hasn't already done it for me.
I’m sorry.
Why?
Really, I am.
You shouldn't have gotten mixed up with a family like ours.
This is not a family. Just a bunch of people living at the same address.
I told you he'd wind up dying anyway.
But no. You try to pull him through just to prove you're still a hotshot doctor.
Why bother to bury him, boys?
Cops will only dig him up, print him and prove that he's Joe Furman, alias Nimmo.
Put your palms down on the box.
You too.
I never heard of Nimmo.
You're leanin' on him, buddy.
He's the guy Turpin shot in my office, and then you got Turpin.
Yeah, the way I heard it, it was a hunting accident.
That's funny.
Put that gun away.
You're being ridiculous.
Maybe so, but the gun ain't.
He brought Nimmo over here to you for repairs.
That's when you found the marriage license on him.
And you realized that Rita wasn't legally married to Kosterman.
It would make Diana the only heiress.
Obviously, she'd take care of her mother and you in fine style.
And then he hired you to make
Rita a widow twice in one week.
I'd have to be insane.
That's one way to plead.
The marriage certificate, please.
Aah!
Finally found use for your foot, didn't you?
You won't get far. They'll box you in for Turpin. l doubt it.
The crime lab will prove the bullet came from your gun.
What gun? There's 10 billion gallons of water in Biscayne Bay.
If the crime lab can find that gun,
I’ll sit in the chair and pull the switch myself.
They'll top you for the attempt on
Kosterman. Witnesses, you remember?
Maybe. But the most they'll get is a reduced one to five... for assault with a deadly weapon- if they catch me.
I called downtown. They're on their way.
You kill me, you'll take the full count.
Why should I kill you?
Nobody's paying me to.
Help! Help! My back! Help me!
You're such a hotshot doctor, why don't you fix yourself?
Say, ain't this yours?
Why don't you put that thing away and lend me a smoke.
That makes sense.
You wouldn't get from here to the end of your thumb.
I’m not worried.
Why not?
I know the rules of evidence.
When you've been arrested as many times as me, it's the same as going to law school.
Catleg.
Brief him on his rights and arrest him.
You have the right to keep silent.
The Constitution-
The Constitution informs you of these rights.
You need not talk to me unless you wish to do so.
You don't have to answer any questions.
Help me!
Hey, get an ambulance for this guy, whoever he is.
He's the dirty doctor you were looking for.
Nimmo?
And call the morgue.
Tell 'em we got a buyer.
Did you find out why Turpin, Catleg and
Nimmo started shooting in your office?
I don't think they liked each other.
Thanks for everything.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
Here's the bonus I promised you.
Oh, thanks, Mr. Kosterman.
I deserve it.
Come on. See ya
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
Nice to see you up and around.
Malcolm.

- Mr. Hamilton?
- Yes?
[ Bell Clanging ]
Scarsdale is next.
[ Bell Clanging ]
[ Brakes Screeching ]
[ Engine Starts ]
Good day?
Mm-hmm.
- You?
- Very productive.
Got the roses out in back all trimmed.
Oh, letter this morning from Sally.
Sam's finished internship.
Starts practice next week.
Well, he should specialize.
That's the only thing now.
Well, maybe he just wants to get the feel of things.
Our little girl’s done all right.
[ Children Shouting, Chattering ]
Something wrong?
No.
That phone call last night?
What about it?
I heard you pacing around in the study afterward... till almost 2:00.
Just a crazy prank.
Look, Emily, it was nothing.
[ Rings ]
[ Man ]
Art? It's me again.
Arthur? Arthur!
Look, I don't know who you are, but —
- Charlie Evans.
- Stop saying that!
Charlie Evans is dead.
Now, I want you to stop this, or I'll be forced to call the police.
Art, there are two trophies on the fireplace... near the tennis team picture.
Pick up the phone and walk over to them.
Go ahead.
You know the cord will reach.
Are you there?
Yes.
In the picture, you and I are standing with our arms... around each other's shoulder.
We're both wearing the same kind of wristwatch.
- Remember, we gave them to each other after winning the doubles at Princeton?
- Yes.
Okay.
Take the doubles trophy there and turn it over.
One edge of the felt is loose.
Pull it back.
[ Charlie ]
"Fidelis eternis."
You scratched it there down in the locker room... after we won the finals.
Remember?
With your belt buckle.
I —
I had forgotten.
I didn't.
It can't be you.
Okay, now.
Listen very carefully.
- Did you get the address today?
- Yes.
Good.
You're to use the name "Wilson."
You — you can't be Charlie.
You just don't come back.
I'm alive!
More alive than I've been in the past 25 years.
You've got to come tomorrow.
Arthur, listen.
If you don't show up, that's it.
Think, for pete's sake!
What have you got now?
What?
I don't know.
Tomorrow, just past noon.
Remember:
Use the name "Wilson."
I... don't know.
- I won't call again, buddy.
- [ Line Clicks ]
- Charlie?
- [ Dial Tone ]
Charlie?
- Was it that call again?
- No.
Stop cross-examining me every time the phone rings.
Understand?
Perfectly.
I'm, uh, sorry.
[ Gulps ]
Excuse me.
You're excused.
Any fever?
No, just old faithful.
Make an appointment to see
Dr. Hogan tomorrow, hmm?
I will.
Promise?
Promise. Thank you.
Therefore... in view of the differential... between your present equity —
[ Door Buzzer Sounds ] between your present equity and the amount necessary... for... capitalization... we cannot extend the loan you require.
Should your equity —
Where?
- Uh, "Should your equity —"
- Oh, yeah.
Should your equity increase, do not hesitate to call on us... for a personal reappraisal, et cetera, et cetera.
Standard closing.
Yes, sir.

[ Steam Hissing ]
My name is, uh, Wilson.
I was told to —
I was told to come here.
Look, is this the place or isn't it?
- [ Steam Hissing ]
- [ Man ] They aren't here anymore.
I got it wrote down.
Thank you.
Move it! Let's go, let's go!
Move it down the line!
Let's go, you bunch of idiots!
Get that beef cut down!
Let's go! Move it up!
Damn you guys! Let's get that truck going and get the meat the hell outta here!
Go on! What are you gonna do?
Take all day?
[ Man #1 ] Come on, move!
Don't let those hooks fall off.
Come on, let's move it!
Okay, Toddy.
Give us another truck up here.
Tighten up with it, now.
Ah, Mr. Wilson.
- Let's go. On the truck with them.
- Surely this isn't the —
- No, sir. Please come with me.
- Let's go, Frank!
Move that truck off.
Come on, now.
Let's hook it off.
Hook on.
Move that beef off the line!
Let's go!
This is costing money, you bunch of jerks!
Come on! Go! Go!
Come on, cut it down.
Cut it! Cut it!
All right, come on!
Move out!
Keep hooking that beef up.
Cut it down. Let's go.
Would you step in, please, sir?
I'd much prefer to ride in front, if you don't mind.
I'm sorry, sir, but customers are asked to ride in the back.
Oh.
Your hat, sir.
It's only a short ride.
Thank you.
We're here, sir.
Would you take the elevator to your left, sir?
Ah, Mr. Wilson.
Will you come this way, please?
Yes.
I'm very sorry.
There'll be a short delay.
- Perhaps you'd like tea and a sandwich.
- Thank you.
All right.
Make yourself comfortable.
Here we go.
[ Door Shuts ]
[ No Audio ]
Uh, pardon me... but could you tell me the way out of this building?
Excuse me.
I was wondering if you could tell —
Excuse me.
I'm trying to find —
Excuse me. I'm trying to find my way out of the building.
I have a gentleman here who wishes to leave the building.
[ Woman ]
Yes, that would be Mr. Wilson.
Would you have him return to Mr. Ruby's office, please?
Mr. Ruby is waiting for him there.
They want you down at the end of the corridor again.
Yes. All right.
Thank you.
[ Man ]
Ah, there you are, Mr. Wilson.
Come in, please.
Would you close the door?
Please, sit down.
My name is Ruby.
I've been assigned to go over the circumstances of your death with you.
- What?
- I know this seems rather strange to you.
That's why I'm here.
You probably have a lot of questions.
Of course, the subject might appear indelicate, but most of our clients —
Now, get this straight:
I am not a client.
- Precisely, Mr. Wilson.
You are not a client yet.
- [ Door Opens ]
Let me start by explaining... the cost factor involved.
To begin with... the procedure is a rather complex one.
This seems to be your supper.
Oh, the chicken looks delicious.
No, thank you.
Yes, as I was saying, the cost runs... in the neighborhood of $30,000.
I know this seems rather high, but in addition... to the rather extensive... cosmetic renovation by way of plastic surgery for you...
CPS has to provide a fresh corpse that perfectly matches... your physical dimensions and medical specifications.
"CPS"?
Oh, Cadaver Procurement Section.
You sure you don't want this chicken?
Absolutely sure.
Oh, pity.
The next step is... the carefully planned obliteration... of identifiable portions of the cadaver... before it is found.
Features, dental structure, fingerprints.
We can't leave anything to chance.
No, I — I guess not.
Uh, would you mind if, uh —
Please.
Thank you.
Now, there is a problem — that the circumstances of your death must be simple.
Well, a simple accident, strangely enough... is costly, Mr. Wilson.
The trick lies in obliterating... just so much and no more, so that... an identification still can be made, based on... as I say, general dimensions... plus a credible sequence of events... witnesses, et cetera.
Oh, the whole thing must be very carefully staged.
We guarantee a death of this kind.
Mm, excuse me.
Delicious!
They have a wonderful way of baking cheese on it... so that it gets very crispy.
Now, there are any number of ways... you can be found.
Excuse me. I mean your body can be found.
The victim of some kind of machinery, an explosion... um, a hunting misadventure.
Oh, but I think these are somewhat too gross for you.
I had thought perhaps a hotel room fire.
Would you like me to outline the circumstances?
- No, thank you.
- Oh, good. I was —
- I was hoping you would agree —
- No!
I mean, I-I can't be sure.
Oh, well, of course, of course, of course.
We can't expect you to decide all at once.
Um, think it over.
There's so much else to be done, Mr. Wilson... but if I may say so... the question of death selection may be the most important decision in your life.
[ Door Opens ]
Ah, here are the trust instruments.
Mr. Joliffe, Mr. Brown,
Mr. Wilson.
My colleagues.
This is your, uh, revised will... drawn in accordance with the requirements of the trust... all predated, of course, to save you the trouble.
Oh, no, no.
It's standard procedure.
Uh... effective at the time of your death... the trust provides for... very liberal settlements on your wife and daughter... and more-than-sufficient funds... for your financial needs and your new identity... from sums assigned to us as your trustees.
Insurance policies... uh, annuities... uh, real estate.
If you'll, uh, sign right here.
The staging here is rather authentic, you'll see.
Of course, the drug made it easier to manipulate you... into the proper positions and attitudes.
Rest easy, Mr. Wilson.
You did not ravage our girl.
Of course, the photography is not too professional... but I think it's clear enough.
- So now it's —
- I have a message from Charlie.
Charlie?
He wanted me to tell you that rebirth is painful.
You were going to say...
"So now it's blackmail," eh, Mr. Wilson?
- What would you call it?
- Just a kind of insurance.
Isn't it easier to go forward when you know you can't go back?
But you knew that, didn't you?
The minute you hung up with Charlie after that first call.
Ah, sure you did.
You're saying...
I can never go back?
Fact is, you really don't want to go back.
Sakes, boy!
You owe yourself this thing.
Rebirth. Life again.
Begin again, all new, all different.
The way you always wanted it.
You got another chance.
Heck, nobody's gonna miss you, are they?
- My wife.
- What about her?
What are you to her now?
- We get along.
- What does that mean?
There's my daughter.
Mm-hmm.
We don't see much of her, actually.
She lives out west with her husband.
She writes now and then, uh... to let us —
What are you to her now?
Excuse an old fool prying, son... but what does it all mean?
Hmm?
It can't mean anything now, anymore.
There's nothing anymore, is there?
Anything at all?
I... expect to be president of the bank before too long.
And I have my boat in the summer.
We have friends.
Anything at all?
I guess I... never thought much about it before.
I leave Emily pretty much alone to do what she, uh —
We get along, as I said.
We hardly ever quarrel.
Not that that's any... measure of our lives.
Frankly... during the last few years, we... hardly ever... ever —
I — I don't know why I'm telling you this.
'Cause you want to.
Go on.
Ever... ever... showed much affection.
But as I said — boat.
And, uh —
So this is what happens to the dreams of youth.
Go on, son. Let it out.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Let it out.
Hmm?
It's time for a change.
Now, look.
They'll both be well taken care of.
They don't need you, and you don't need them.
You just can't help each other anymore.
Ah, look, son.
You know what I'm saying is true.
There's nothing anymore.
No, no.
What you need now is a good rest.
Now, there a few things to be worked out in the morning... but my boys will clear those up, and you needn't worry none.
- Your boys?
- Mm-hmm.
You're the head of it all?
There never was a struggle in the soul of a good man that wasn't hard.
My papa told me that... and it's sure enough true.
Believe me, son.
I know.
I believe you.
That's fine.
[ Man ] You know, Mr. Wilson, you represent something of a milestone around here.
When the bandages are removed...
I think you'll be more than pleased.
In fact, I expect you to be prancing around here like a stud bull.
Now, it's gonna take a while, so, uh... try to be patient until we get you ready for the world again.
- [ Whimpers ]
- Now, don't do that!
You can't talk because we've extracted all your teeth... and given you a complete vocal cord resection.
- [ Gasps ]
- Give the tissues time to pull together.
Now, you got a new set of permanent teeth.
In a week you won't know the difference. Thank you.
That's what hurts most right now.
Everything's different.
When the first healing's over, we'll start conditioning for muscle tone.
- Hmm?
- [ Raspy Groan ]
Yes, yes. Those too.
Fingerprints.
Mr. Wilson, even your signature.
Little thing we did with the tensor ligaments of the hand.
[ Rasping ]
The orbicularis or is started to sag, so we tightened them with ligatures.
Yeah.
Then we worked on the mandible to square up the bone.
Uh-huh.
Well, I never.
[ Chuckles ]
Holy mackerel.
I don't know how you boys do it.
Doc, it's a masterpiece.
Good work.
Easy does it.
You'll be all right, son.
Your scars and hematomas will disappear in a couple of weeks.
After several months of physical conditioning... the process will be complete.
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
Ah.
My name is Davalo.
I'm your guidance adviser.
This is about your future career.
I'm afraid I haven't thought very much about that.
Oh, yes, you have, sir.
[ Chuckles ]
- Permit me.
- [ Arthur's Voice ] I want a ball...
- a big, big red one.
- Whoops.
I'm afraid we picked this up a little too early.
Sit down. We recorded these regressions... under Pentothal and caffeine sodium benzoate.
At first, there's always a touch of the infantile... but later on, we progress to a more mature... expressional infrastructure.
Ah, here we are.
[ Davalo's Voice ]
What would you like to do most of all?
[ Arthur's Voice ]
Of anything in the whole world?
[ Davalo's Voice ]
Mm-hmm.
[ Arthur's Voice ]
Uh...
I'd like to be a tennis pro, I guess.
Yes.
That's what I'd like best of all.
[ Davalo's Voice ]
Mm-hmm.
And suppose you couldn't be?
What else would you choose?
[ Arthur's Voice ]
Uh...
I guess I'd like to paint stuff.
[ Davalo's Voice ]
Pictures?
[ Arthur's Voice ]
Pictures and things.
Well...
I think the creative wish pattern is pretty self-evident.
You mean, I —
I ought to be a painter?
Exactly!
You see, painting allows you a basic creative outlet... as well as providing an environment... in which these sublimations will have free vent.
Now, let's take a look at the program we've worked out for you.
Certificates of study.
Abroad.
Notices of first six one-man shows.
Your pictures are realistic in treatment... but deal with poetic imagery in choice of subject.
Not that I pretend to be a critic of painting.
These diplomas... from reputable universities... they — they can't be forged.
Mr. Wilson, I assure you... every item is bona fide and valid.
How-How could I even approach such a professional level? I couldn't —
Oh, very simple.
You are already established in a position of some dignity.
Oh, nothing conspicuous.
Just a solid, mildly successful sort of thing.
You will be supplied with fresh paintings periodically.
In time, you'll perfect your own style.
Surreal, primitive, impressionistic — whatever.
It will be a transition from this present work.
You see... you don't have to prove anything anymore.
You are accepted.
You will be in your own new dimension.
You're a bachelor.
Birth certificate.
The only son... of deceased parents, and so forth.
In short... you are alone in the world... absolved of all responsibility... except to your own interest.
Isn't that marvelous?
[ Man's Voice ]
Your studio is in Malibu, California.
Quite luxurious. Very private.
You'll make your own adjustment in your own way... in your own time.
Oh, you'll be self-conscious at first.
Don't worry.
[ Chuckles ]
It will wear off.
And remember —
You've got what almost every middle-aged man... in America would like to have: freedom.
Real freedom.
[ Chuckling ]
Ah, it's been a pleasure,
Mr. Wilson.
[ Woman ]
Pillow, Mr. Wilson?
Yes, thank you.
[ Woman Speaking Over P.A.,
Indistinct ]
[ Man ]
Tony! Tony?
Tony Wilson!
Hey there, you old rascal!
Slow down!
Where's the fire?
Can't wait to get back to them pretty little models, huh?
Uh-oh. I am late.
Now, if I didn't have to catch me a plane,
I'd make you buy me a drink, by God!
See you soon. Gotta run.
[ Man ]
Welcome home, Mr. Wilson.
My name is John.
I've been assigned to help you.
It's very nice.
I think you'll be quite comfortable, sir.
Do you like your studio?
- Yes.
- Perhaps you'd like to freshen up and have a drink.
Afterward, I'll try to clear up any point on which you may have curiosity.
The bath is through here.
I'll unpack these for you later.
Fine.
Um... how long will you be here, um —
John, sir.
For as long as you need me.
The company is fully aware that you may have problems at first...
- and will spare no effort to help you solve them.
- Thank you.
Yes, sir.
- John?
- Yes, sir?
I, uh —
I had a curious experience at the airport.
What was that?
Well, I was accosted by a man who called me by name.
He seemed to know me, and I'm certain I've never met him.
I suppose it was a mistake on his part.
So it would appear, sir.
What kind of people live here?
Professionals.
Some in business. Some write.
No, uh, no artists, I hope.
I think you are the only one, sir.
If I may suggest, sir... perhaps you'd like to give a small cocktail party for the immediate neighbors.
Oh, well, I, uh —
I'd better get myself used to things first.
Later on, maybe.
As you wish, sir.
That's very good, sir.
Thank you.
Wouldn't you enjoy meeting some of the people here, sir?
I told you
I'm not ready yet, John.
I'll do this in my own way and in my own time.
Of course, sir.
Hello.
Hey. Hey, wait.
I'm sorry about back there.
How about if we try it again?
Hello.
I'm Nora Marcus.
I'm... Tony Wilson.
- Walk?
- Sure.
[ Nora Laughing ]
Ocean, I love you!
You're beautiful!
Beautiful!
[ Laughing ]
All that power, and she's got all the answers.
Hey!
Got a question!
[ Sighs ]
What did you ask?
Oh, a tough one:
"Who and what is Tony Wilson?"
And what did it say?
It told me to mind my own business.
[ Nora's Voice ] That was my life.
Two boys, ages ten and twelve.
Successful and indulgent husband.
A beautiful house, complete with microwave oven... intercom, station wagon, et cetera, et cetera.
Ad infinitum.
Ad... absurdum.
And?
I made myself a cup of coffee, dressed, and left.
- That was four years ago.
- And you never went back?
I've seen them from time to time, but... it's different now.
Maybe because I'm different.
I don't expect you to understand.
I think I do.
You?
An artist?
Why should you understand?
You spent your whole life being.
You don't know anything about me, really.
Oh, yes, I do.
It's all right there in your face.
What is?
- Now you're fishing.
- No. Seriously.
This may hurt a little.
I agreed to take my chances.
Okay.
Madam Marcus will read the leaves.
What kind of a man is he?
There's grace in the line and color, but... it doesn't emerge pure.
It pushes at the edge of something still... tentative... unresolved, as if... somewhere in the man... there is still a key unturned.
That's quite an analysis.
Not really.
When you come to think of it, it sort of fits everybody, doesn't it?
It's very nice here.
The good things always happen with the rain.
When will I see you again?
I'm going to Santa Barbara tomorrow.
There's a kind of gathering.
Can I come?
It's going to be very wild.
Maybe that's part of turning the key.

- Nora, I don't know any of these people.
- I don't think I —

I came here to feel, to be.
I'm dying, and that's the world... the whole bloody world!
Nora, it's not a question of dancing.
I'm not a part of this!

- Thank you, John.
- Oh, Mr. Wilson.
- May I present Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd?
- How do you do?
This is your host, Mr. Wilson.
- Mr. Filter, Mr. Wilson.
- Pleased to meet you.
How do you do, Tony?
- Hello, Mr. Wilson.
- You have seen Tony's paintings, haven't you?
## [ Piano Jazz ]
Cheers.
Mr. Wilson, may
I present Mr. Mayberry?
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Wilson.
Peekaboo.
- Honey, please slow down.
- Never!
Never!
Come. I'm taking you to ze Casbah.
[ Nora ]
Not ze Casbah!
As soon as these people leave,
I'm going to attack you.
Why, Mr. Wilson, you dirty old man!
Ah!
[ Low Chuckle ]
- I really am.
- Hmm.
I want you to know that.
I'm counting on it.
Miss Marcus, you shock me.
Tony, please ease up.
Hmm-mm.
- Why?
- Because... it's not like you.
[ Drunkenly ]
Oh, I know that.
I'm sorry.
[ Exhales ]
Guess I just needed the added strength.
Oh, that's silly.
They're all wonderful people.
Just give them a chance.
- Okay, okay.
- Give yourself a chance.
- Hmm?
- Okay.
Yes?
I promise. No more.
And I promise to behave myself.
[ Gasps ]
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I've embarrassed you.
No, you haven't.
Tony...
I think I love you.
You're beautiful!
You're —
- You're an ocean.
- Let's go back.
The sooner we get rid of those people... the sooner we can be together.
- I'm going to hold you to your promise.
- Oh, God. You're evil!
- Yes!
- God, how evil you are!
Tony?
Henry Bushman, my husband.
- Nice to know you, Wilson.
- How do you do?
- Nora, you're staggering.
- Hank, that's a dirty lie.
Watch out for this character.
He's a lawyer.
Harvard, I want you to know.
- Really? Hey, that's a coincidence.
- Hold it!
- Thank you.
- Mm, me too. In fact, me too twice.
Hollow leg again?
Oh, will you listen? At home he makes me look like a piker.
A veritable piker.
Henry, you sneaking two-face, you.
- Private joke?
- No. I'm sorry.
Come on, Nora.
Let's ditch these two sots.
- [ Gasps ] Help, Tony! Rape!
- Wait a minute. You can't do that.
No, there's no way you'll get away.
You're gonna stay right here.
But that's my woman.
Hey. Hey!
Hey, that's funny.
That's very funny.
What's funny?
Is he really a sneaky two-face?
Yes.
There's such a religious climate out here. Don't you agree?
- Oh, I love the climate.
- Yes.
I belong to a special kind of group.
Nothing subversive, I hope.
Oh, good heavens, no!
We change sects.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, no, no. Good heavens.
You thought I meant —
"Sects." S-E-C-T-S.
- Oh, sects!
- Yes.
Well, thank God!
- We change every month.
Right now, we're in Aztec.
- Mm!
Huitzilopochtli, Quetzalcoatl, virgin sacrifice and all.
- I just love your paintings, Mr. Wilson.
- ## [ Up-tempo Rock ]
How do you ever do it?
Well, you see... it all began with a big red ball... and, uh —
No, no.
You see...
I paint naked, Mrs. Filter.
- It's the only way to get at the truth.
- How interesting.
Of course. You see, in this way, my inner essence is revealed... and I am presented to the canvas... in direct relationship with my primeval state... without its sociological trappings.
- Hey, watch it, will ya?
- Oh, look!
- Take it easy, Wilson!
- I'm sorry.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- You all right, hon?
John! John?
- That'll never come out. Never!
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Excuse me. Please forgive me.
- Just look at this mess!
It's all right, ma'am.
May I?
[ John ]
Let me take that.
I'm sure it won't stain badly.
Hey! You two heard the one about the —
[ Both ]
Yes, we have.
Well, I'm — Well, I'm sorry.
I — I didn't mean to interrupt.
Seems like I'm... doing everything wrong lately.
Now, don't pout. Mama will make everything better, okay?
Perfect. Say, Hank... uh, I was thinking about school just before... and, uh, your house at Harvard... wasn't, by any chance,
Adams, was it?
- No, not exactly.
- Is anybody hungry?
Hey, I am.
Say, Hank?
Hank!
Hey, Hank. Here.
Hank, actually — actually, I'm not a Harvard alumnus either.
That is, I used to be, but I'm not anymore.
- [ Woman ] What do you mean?
Did you resign?
- Take it easy.
- Oh, that's priceless!
- No!
- I did go to Harvard, you see...
- Uh-huh. and I was an alumnus... but that was before
I became a painter... and now I'm not anymore.
Come on, Hank!
# Poor Eli's hopes we're dashing #
# Into blue obscurity #
# Resistless, our team sweeps goalward #
# With the fury of ze blast

That's wonderful!
Absolutely wonderful!
Truth is, I just stopped being an alumnus.
- Oh.
- Simple.
- Wilson!
- What?
You and I must play golf sometime.
Golf? Golf?
[ Cackling ]
Antiochus Wilson playing golf?
Huh? Now...
Arthur Hamilton —
[ Snorting Laughter ]
Looks as if our host is in orbit.
[ Laughter Continues ]
Hey, wait a minute, you guys.
[ Woman Laughing ]
- Incoming! Good-bye!
- Bye!
Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[ Tony Laughing ]
- Put him down.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Turn him around.
- Hey, Hank, listen.
Hey, Hank,
I got a nephew —
I got a nephew right — right in Harvard right now!
- You don't have a nephew.
- What?
[ Laughs ]
I don't have a nephew!
[ Scoffs ]
Okay, correct.
I don't have a nephew... but he's there, all right.
He's there, all right.
My daughter... she's married to a doctor... and maybe by this time,
I'm a grandfather.
Believe me... they'll never drag it out of me.
I'll stand right here... on my constitutional rights.
I'm not a grandfather.
I —
[ Chuckles ] Why are you all staring at me like that?
[ Laughs ]
Hey, John?
[ Laughing ]
Hey, John!
Why are they —
Hey, John. Hey, John... why are they staring at me like that?
- They know.
- [ Laughing ]
They know what?
They're like you.
What do you mean?
Reborns.
[ Breathing Accelerates ]
Oh, Lord!
[ Wailing ]
Shut up, you!
Shut up!
Shut up, damn you!
Just who the hell... do you think you are?
[ Sobbing ]
Oh, no!
Oh, my God!
[ Ringing ]
Yes?
[ Charlie ] It's me, buddy.
Now, listen to me. Arthur —
Charlie?
- Now, look, Arthur —
- Charlie.
- Arthur, listen to me!
- Is it really you?
Of course it is.
Do you realize how dangerous it is, what you're doing? Do you?
I've got to get out of here.
You don't know what they're doing to me.
Come on, now, buddy.
Calm down. Calm down.
- I've got to see you.
- That's impossible right now.
- Why?
- It just is!
You've got to get a hold of yourself, fast. You'll be sorry —
- You know what they did?
- I can't explain, but you'll be —
There's this reborn, Nora.
She's not one of them.
She works for the company.
- What?
- That's right.
An employee.
But I —
Oh, no. She was so —
Why, Charlie? Why?
Your adjustment was bound to be difficult in the first stages.
Don't you see?
The company simply provided —
An employee.
It means a lot to me personally, Arthur.
Now, I can't explain... but we're sort of tied together, you and me.
We're so close, Arthur.
Don't throw it away.
- How?
- Trust, please?
Promise to stay put until we can get someone to you.
[ Charlie's Voice Continues ]
You've got to have some help right now.
Please, will you do it?
Will you stay there?
Please!
Yes?
- I'm Mr. Wilson.
- Yes, sir.
Come in, please.
I'll tell Mrs. Hamilton you're here.
[ Emily ]
Mr. Wilson?
I'm so glad you were able to come.
- Thank you. I didn't mean to barge in.
- Oh, not at all.
It was very kind of you.
I must have sounded strange over the phone, but... you see,
Arthur never mentioned —
Well, I just met your late husband last year, shortly before —
Yes. Um, please, sit down.
Mrs. Hamilton, I'm a painter — an artist, actually.
- I admire your husband's watercolors.
- Really?
Not that he was professional... but he did have something.
He mentioned some paintings in a cupboard out in the garage.
That's the reason I —
Well, I was wondering if I might... pick one up as a memento.
I'm sorry, but the garage has been cleaned out.
You threw them away?
No.
No, not exactly.
You have a lovely place here.
Oh, thank you.
This was the study, wasn't it?
Yes, it was —
How did you know?
Your husband... talked a lot about this house, about his family.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stir up painful memories.
No. No, it's not that.
It's just that...
I never knew Arthur to do that very much.
How do you mean?
- I don't want to bore you.
- No, please.
I'd like to know.
You see...
I knew him only for a short while.
I'd really like to know.
It's not just curiosity.
We, uh —
We shared an interest in art.
The last time I saw him, I —
I did some sketches.
Now I'd like to do a painting... but all I have are lines... a face.
Posthumous portraiture, hmm?
I'm not joking, Mrs. Hamilton.
No, of course you're not.
I'm sorry. I —
You've set me quite a task.
He was a quiet man.
I think the thing I most remember him for were his silences.
It was... as if he were always listening to something inside... some voice.
He never talked about it, so I never knew what it was.
Oh, he was a good man... but he lived as if he were a stranger here.
I mean, he never let anything touch him.
He became absorbed in things — his job, mostly.
He worked hard. He... became more detached.
Always a look around his eyes as if he were... trying to say something.
I don't know what.
Protest against what he'd surrendered his life to?
I never knew what he wanted... and I don't think he ever knew.
He fought so hard for what he'd been taught to want... and when he got it, he just grew more and more confused.
The silences grew longer.
We never talked about it.
We lived our lives in a polite... celibate truce.
You see, Arthur had been dead a long, long time... before they found him in that hotel room.
Well, I... guess
I can't tell you much more.
Enough?
Yes, it is.
I really should be going.
Well, I... hope
I've been some help.
Yes, you have.
Very much.
[ Emily's Voice ]
Mr. Wilson?
You said that you wanted a memento.
It won't be a painting, I'm afraid, but it's all I have.
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.
It doesn't matter.
- I want to go back.
- Of course, sir.
No, I don't mean to California.
To the company.
Start again, all over.
Antiochus Wilson can die, can't he, John?
The company.
Is it possible?
I think so, sir.
[ Exhales ]
Begin again.
Quite honestly...
I'm not the least bit sorry... because there were certain mistakes made in my case, and —
Of course, but before we go into all that, let me ask you... whether you can recommend and sponsor a new client.
What?
Someone in your acquaintance outside... whom you feel would benefit by the company's services.
You were sponsored yourself, you know.
Oh, yes, of course.
A business associate, perhaps.
Someone down the street.
You don't have to be intimately acquainted with a man to realize... he'd be receptive to the sort of opportunity we offer.
I'm sorry. Right now,
I just can't seem to —
What I mean is, I —
I'd like to think about it.
Well, that's all we ask.
As you can imagine... our business is acquired through present clients.
It's a word-of-mouth operation, Wilson.
You don't suppose we can advertise in magazines and newspapers.
[ Chuckles ]
No, of course not.
I think you'll come up with something.
- [ Man ] Hold it. Thank you.
- [ Clicks ]
Hold your arm up, please,
Mr. Wilson.
- Excuse me. I don't understand.
- That's it.
- Is all this really necessary?
- 13 1/2. Profile.
- Turn sideways.
- Wait a moment. Is this necessary for —
- Hold it. That's it.
- [ Camera Shutter Clicking ]
- Back view.
- What is this, preliminary for surgery?
Certainly, Mr. Wilson.
A year's gone by.
A lot happens to the human body.
This one is yours, sir.
Hello, Arthur.
- Excuse me. I don't believe I know you.
- It's me, buddy.
Fidelis eternis.
Charlie?
You're Charlie?
Guess I am, old buddy.
What are you doing here?
Same as yourself: waiting.
What's the matter?
Uh, nothing. I —
It's just that it's... hard to recognize somebody and... not recognize them at the same time.
How long have you been here?
Oh, a while.
When you phoned me, you were here?
- Mm-hmm.
- Even the first time?
But you sounded... like the whole thing was something tremendous... this... rebirth, everything, even when you hadn't made a go of it.
I thought you'd have a better chance.
Good God! How long does a man have to wait to get into surgery?
Not long, usually.
I had to stay around and telephone you, if necessary... through your first adjustment, but now —
That's what you meant about our being... tied together.
Mm.
I couldn't help it, Charlie.
I had to find out where I went wrong.
The years I've spent... trying to get all the things...
I was told were important... that I was supposed to want!
Things!
Not people... or meaning.
Just... things.
And California was the same.
They... made the same decisions for me all over again... and they were the same things, really.
It's gonna be different from now on.
A new face, a new name.
I'll do the rest.
I know it's gonna be different.
I suppose you do too.
[ Buzzer Sounds ]
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Carlson, please.
Charlie. You?
- Art, I —
- Mr. Carlson, please.
Charlie...
I have the feeling you're gonna make it this time.
Sorry to disappoint the rest of you.
Perhaps tomorrow.
You don't seem to understand our problem, Mr. Wilson.
- I understand it perfectly.
- But you're not cooperating.
I've told you over and over again,
I cannot think of anyone.
- I can't believe that.
- I've been shuffled around long enough.
It's about time I had the opportunity to start living... some kind of meaningful existence.
If I did sponsor someone... wouldn't that delay my trip to surgery... in the event that I were needed from time to time... to, say, advise him?
No, that's not likely, not if the selection is a good one.
I'm sorry. I don't seem to be able to think of a single soul.
- You mean you deliberately won't.
- Have it your way.
Very well.
That'll be all, Mr. Wilson.
You can go back to the dayroom.
Processing, please.
This is Ruby.
On Wilson, 722...
I think we can go to the next stage now.
Hello, son.
Oh, sir, I —
Ah, you know, I sure hoped you'd make it, find your dream come true.
- What?
- I said, I sure hoped you'd make it... find your dream come true.
I guess I —
I guess I never had a dream.
Maybe that's it.
That — That sure might have been it.
If I did have one... it certainly wasn't...
Antiochus Wilson.
This time...
I've got to be allowed, sir, to make my own decision.
You know, son... when I began this business,
I was a young man with an idea.
I wasn't aiming to make a lot of money, helping others... helping them to find a little happiness.
Oh, heck, just not the rich.
I thought eventually —
You see, I got tremendous comfort in the thought that, in my small way...
I was waging a battle against human misery... and I was too.
Except we do have a high percentage of failures.
I guess that's to be expected... but it hurts me.
Some reborns make a go of it.
We're always working to find ways to improve the system.
Yeah, we make mistakes.
Fact is, when our clients first started coming back here...
I just wanted to chuck the whole thing, but I couldn't.
The organization was pretty big by then.
Uh-huh.
Board of directors, on a profit-sharing basis.
All those people.
You've no idea what a financial responsibility it turned into.
Tsk, tsk.
[ Chuckles ]
Heck, we make mistakes, but we admit 'em... and go forward.
I won't see it in my lifetime... but some of the younger execs like Ruby may.
Oh, you can call it wishful thinking, son... but life is built on wishes.
And you've got to just keep plugging away at 'em.
You can't give up... and you can't let the mistakes...
- jeopardize the dream.
- [ Door Opens ]
Well, here's your transportation.
- What?
- Surgery, sir.
- But I've got to talk to you.
- We're on a very tight schedule. Please.
Why, I — I didn't expect so soon that —
It's efficiency. You're lucky we got a match so quick.
Hop aboard, son.
Up there.
The doctors are waiting.
That's just so you won't fall off.
But there's things we have to talk about. I mean, my identity —
We will. We will later.
Mm-hmm.
Just relax, son.
Everything's gonna be fine. Just fine.
The thing about doing it on my own.
You see, it's so important: choice.
You've got to change.
We have to talk about it.
We will.
I'll look into it personally.
Just remember, son, we gotta keep plugging away at the dream.
The mistakes teach us how.
It wasn't wasted. Remember that.
My name is Dr. Morris, sir.
According to our records, you were reared in the Protestant faith.
Did you convert to any other during your adjustment?
No.
Good. Good.
That is, "good" in the sense that we have a certain definition.
Now, I am not suggesting that being a Protestant... is any better than being a Catholic or Jew.
As a matter of fact, I am qualified to care for you in either of those faiths as well.
I was ordained in each: rabbi, priest, and minister.
I admit it unusual.
Uh, maybe even a bit advanced.
Wait a minute.
What's happening?
Well, my good sir, when we have finished...
- you will go on to the next stage.
- I don't mean that!
Ultimately, Mr. Wilson, ultimately we'll be called... to face the Creator and render up our last account.
It happens to all of us, sir.
That's no answer! I want to know what's happening to me now!
Don't shout! Please!
No!

- Five percent at ten cc's.

[ Faint Moaning ]
You were my best work,
Mr. Wilson.
I'm sorry it all has to end like this.
All right, set him up.
I think we'll put the hemorrhage right under the left exoccipital... in the lingual gyrus.
Put that light over here.
Good.
All right.

- Relax, old friend.

[ Drill Whirring ]
[ Whirring Continues ]
[ Whirring Fades ]
No! No!
Help... help!
Are you still going into town, doctor?
You see that's how one gets greeted in the village.
Death rules here.
If I may, please give me 50 crowns.
I am sorry, but I cannot go on from here.
Sorry, I gave you a ride to this place, because I needed the money.
The inn is further ahead, after that arch.
It won't be difficult for you to find it.
Just ask for directions, it's the only inn in town.
You see this is a condemned place, a God forgotten place.
Nobody ever comes to this place.
You better come back, doctor, before it is too late.
I am looking for the inn.
Can you tell me where it is?
It's over there.
I'm looking for the inspector.
Inspector Kruger.
You are the doctor, aren't you?
In this village, we never liked doctors.
Quiet!
Dr. Eswai?
Yes!
Come. Come.
The inspector is waiting for you.
Enough!
I said I know nothing about
Irene Hollander.
I didn't know her, inspector!
You, too, know nothing, haven't seen or heard anything?
You all have the same answer!
Look, you can't fool me!
Why such reluctance?
What keeps your tongue tied?
Is it fear maybe? Fear from what?
Tell me! From what?
An amulet!
An amulet!
That's what's keeping you from talking.
It's superstition, ignorance.
But, I will get you to talk!
So that you will tell me what happened, you'll see!
You made it.
I was getting worried about you.
I left immediately, but it wasn't easy getting here, Inspector Kruger.
We are isolated from the world here, nobody ever comes to see us.
This is Mr. Keirr, the burgomeister.
Go, but wait with the others downstairs.
Have you lived here for a while,
Inspector?
I arrived here the other day.
I asked for you to come here for a very serious matter.
Take a look at this letter.
It's from Irena Hollander, a girl who worked as a housekeeper at a villa.
The villa of the Baroness Graps.
I can't resist it anymore.
I have decided to talk, to break the cycle of death... a great burden to me.
Come soon, because this time it feels like it's my turn. Irena Hollander.
That letter came to the police station... and I came here to check what was indeed true.
The girl, unfortunately, was already dead.
Impaled by the spears of a gate.
A homicide!
I still don't know.
They keep wanting me to believe that it is a curse.
But this letter makes me think about something totally different.
But it will be up to you to figure it out, doctor.
You'll have to do an autopsy.
Burgomeister, we'll continue with the interview tomorrow.
Nobody can leave!
Have you figured something out,
Inspector?
I keep hitting a wall of silence.
They are afraid, of everything.
They are afraid of my questions, it's as if they are being terrorized by something.
On the other hand, I understand their distrust towards strangers.
You are without doubt the first authority who has made it to this place.
Their only belief system is superstition.
Earlier, they were carrying a casket-
A casket? When?
When I arrived.
I think I get it now.
They are trying to prevent an autopsy on Irena Hollander!
Come with me, doctor, quickly!
Rufus, Argo! Stop!
What are you doing?
Who told you to bury her?
Wasn't I clear enough?
The doctor came for the very purpose of doing an autopsy!
It's against the law of nature to touch the dead.
Take her to the mortuary.
When can you start?
Right away.
But a qualified witness is needed.
There are guidelines
I have to follow.
I told you to move the corpse inside, immediately!
As to the witness, don't worry.
I'll send you-
Inspector! Inspector!
The burgomeister sent me!
He wants you to come back to the inn.
He couldn't keep the people you were trying to interview.
He wants to talk to you immediately!
Okay, I am coming.
Go do what you have to do.
Once you're done, come join me.
All right.
Mr. Keirr!
Mr. Keirr!
Why have they all left?
I am sorry! But there was nothing
I could do about it.
I tried to keep them here for the interrogation.
But once they found out that you had gone to the cemetery, they ran away.
Evidently you don't have much power over these people.
Well, it's not a matter of power.
Inspector, I beg you!
Stop the autopsy!
I have to solve this case!
Listen to me! You must not let the body of Irena Hollander be touched.
I was hoping that you would cooperate with me.
I see that you are siding with them, to hide the truth.
No! No, Inspector!
I made you come back, to explain to you... the village does not speak, not to cover up something... but out of fear.
I am not ashamed to admit that I am afraid... about what may happen to me... if I reveal... the secret of Villa Graps.
Villa Graps?
It sounds like an impossible story, something above the laws of nature.
It will be difficult for you to believe me.
But the death of Irena Hollander... is not due to an accident.
It is murder!
Are you Dr. Eswai?
I am Monica Schuftan.
The Inspector sent me to assist you.
I was actually looking for a physician.
I am a science student from Grottenburg.
I am the only one here who will be useful to you.
So, you are from the village?
Yes, I was born there. But I have gone since I was one year old.
I returned on the same day this girl died.
Have you ever attended an autopsy?
No, never.
That's incredible!
They slipped a coin into her heart!
Just like the legend says.
It's an old legend, which has been circulating around here for centuries.
It says that only a coin in the heart would bring peace... to those whose lives ended violently.
In spite of the autopsy, we are unable to conclude... whether we are talking about an accident or a suicide.
Oh, that coin!
Who could have slipped it into the heart of that poor girl?
And why?
Don't worry about it, Monica.
Inspector Kruger will clear up everything.
I am here now, this is where I live.
I am Mrs. Morano's guest.
I don't mean to be intrusive, but why did you come back to this village?
I came back to visit my parents' graves.
I never knew them.
They left me with a small fund, which
I lived off before going to college.
Thank you for telling me.
You have been really brave.
Thanks.
I wish you a good night, doctor.
Good night, Monica.
I already told you, doctor, not to touch the dead.
He who touches them has to pay with his life.
We had to, we had to bury that girl!
Why didn't you do that?
Stop it!
Doctor!
Doctor, the inspector went to Villa Graps because of an emergency.
He left an hour ago and left you a note in his room.
Didn't he say when he would be back?
Nobody ever makes it back from Villa Graps.
Why are you saying this?
I didn't say that. I didn't say that.
It's not true. Stay away.
Go to your room right away.
Dinner is ready.
No!
No! No! Not me! I didn't say anything,
I didn't say a thing!
Darling, what's happening to you?
At the window!
Did you see her?
Oh my God, that's terrible!
Now that she is scared, there's no more hope!
Only Ruth can do something.
Go and get her! Quickly, hurry!
You were looking for me, right?
I could feel that you needed me.
Dear Eswai...
the burgomeister revealed things to me that I find unbelievable.
I am heading to Villa Graps to meet the Baroness...
to inquire about something important.
Join me there as soon as you can.
Sincerely, Inspector Kruger.
Calm down, girl.
It won't happen to you.
The curse will not touch you.
Get her undressed.
Blood! Strengthen yourself.
Death will not touch you.
Stay away, stay far away from the Villa.
Stay far away!
Stay away!
Stay away!
I heard her.
She's here!
It's because I opened my mouth!
Don't say that, darling daughter!
I tell you, I heard her!
This will protect you.
You can never take it off.
I am done now.
No, no, go out this way.
They cannot see you.
I helped her pay her bill.
Why did you exorcise this girl?
You can help me here.
You certainly must know a lot about this village.
Why do people seek help in your magical skills?
What are they afraid of?
There is a terrible curse hovering over these people.
Be careful, you, too, are in danger.
Irena Hollander was thrown to her death.
But, by what?
Leave, doctor! Those are things that science cannot explain.
Give the inspector a warning right away.
Send him away as well.
And stop this investigation.
Inspector Kruger is at Villa Graps to wrap up the interrogation.
He is a practical and driven man.
He doesn't get influenced by imagination.
He will get to the bottom of the matter.
Where is the Villa?
I'd like to join the inspector.
Don't go, doctor.
Don't go there. I mean it.
They talk about this villa with such terror... as if even afraid to say its name.
It's something I need to clarify.
Villa Graps is over there.
Wait a moment.
You can't tell me anything about this coin either?
I found it today inside
Irena Hollander's heart.
I was hoping that you would help me understand.
I already told you that I know nothing.
Go ahead, if you wish.
But still not too late for you to choose not to go.
Thank you.
I hope we will meet again.
If he ever makes it back from that villa.
Keirr, my love.
What's the matter, Keirr?
And there is another one.
It is a mortal chain this one, and it will never break!
Death rules at Villa Graps.
Yes, there is death.
It can be stopped only by death itself.
Leave now, Keirr.
We have to call the hearse right away.
You know the dirt has to cover the body immediately before the sun rises.
With its weight, the dirt embraces the dead... and keeps it in the earth forever.
They won't take you with them.
You will be at peace.
Kruger!
Inspector Kruger!
What do you want?
Excuse me, I am looking for
Mr. Kruger, the inspector.
There is no inspector.
But I was told that he came to see
Baroness Graps.
I am the Baroness Graps.
And nobody ever comes here.
I am alone here in this villa. Leave!
No, wait!
Leave! It's for your own good!
Leave me alone!
Hi.
What's your name?
Melissa!
My name is Melissa.
Melissa?
Melissa!
Oh no, no! No, no, no!
Mrs. Morano, I beg you! Mrs. Morano!
What do you want?
Open up! Mrs. Morano, I am afraid!
Open up, I beg you!
Go away!
What goes around comes around.
You shouldn't have touched that girl!
Paul!
Monica! What are you doing here?
I came to see you.
What's wrong?
I had a nightmare. I got scared.
I couldn't stand it anymore!
Calm down. You must be shaken by the autopsy.
The cord isn't moving.
Take me away, Paul.
Take me away from here.
Did you see that? It was the wind.
No, no, it wasn't the wind.
It's the hatred, the bell is being moved by the hatred.
It always sounds this way when someone has to die.
It's been this way since she died without a drop of blood in her.
Who?
It was a seven-year-old girl.
She would hang on to those cords of the bell, looking for help!
Her name was Melissa.
Melissa.
Listen, the lady will stay here this night.
Let them prepare a room for her.
And, has Inspector Kruger come back yet?
No, I haven't seen him.
Martha!
Yes?
Martha, go upstairs. We need to get a room ready for the lady.
Right away.
Paul! Did you hear what the innkeeper said?
It wasn't the wind making the bell sound!
Monica! Don't let it affect you this way!
But this is not like in the other cases.
Even the church is condemned.
It's a wreck. People seem to have no faith anymore.
No, they are just people in poor spirits, victims of superstition.
Miss, you can come upstairs now.
Good night, Monica.
Good night, Paul. And thank you.
Nadienne!
Nadienne, what's wrong?
You are boiling, such high fever!
What are you feeling?
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Leave!
This is none of your business!
Isn't she suffering enough already?
You can't touch her!
Let it be!
A cilice!
What have you done? Are you crazy?
Do you want her to die?
Madmen!
Your methods are absurd.
She could die of these wounds.
My daughter will die anyway.
Nothing can save her.
Shut up! Quiet!
Don't worry, Nadienne.
It will all be over, you'll see.
It's nothing bad.
They... they picked me.
They picked me! They picked me!
I know I won't be saved. I know.
She is very agitated.
Her pulse is irregular.
What should we do?
She needs to rest.
I will give her a sedative.
I left my luggage in the inspector's room.
Let's go, Martha.
Give this to her when she wakes up, not more than 20 drops!
- Don't hesitate if you need me.
- Thank you, doctor.
Furthermore I feel it necessary not to say anything about...
what the burgomeister Karl told me,
Inspector Kruger, after several meetings.
The burgomeister says that the village suffers from a nightmare of a curse...
that started with the death of little Melissa Graps.
Since then, according to the belief of these people...
Melissa keeps returning by appearing to the living.
To make matters even more incredible...
the people Melissa appears to, each die under mysterious circumstances...
which the farmers call supernatural.
Let's hurry!
There's no time to waste.
Hurry, hurry!
Paul.
There are lights at the cemetery.
What might that be?
Yes, I saw them, too.
It could be Inspector Kruger.
Maybe he has discovered something.
No, don't go there!
I'm not sure if it's Inspector Kruger down there.
What would he be doing down there at night?
I don't know.
But I want to see what's going on.
Kruger...!
No, no!
The burgomeister lives here.
Keirr!
Mr. Keirr!
Yes, I am here. Come on in.
Come in, doctor.
I knew you would come.
I found the body of Inspector Kruger at the cemetery.
I know.
I arranged for it to be taken there.
He died by a gunshot to his temple.
Don't use this tone with me.
I didn't say that I killed him.
Another victim of the demonic forces, right?
And maybe even he had a coin in his heart!
Yes.
To keep his spirit from answering to the call... of Melissa.
I understand this may seem impossible to a man of science like you.
I read what you reported to
Inspector Kruger.
You can't expect me to believe those legends!
I didn't believe them, either.
They aren't legends... but a horrible reality instead.
In the last few years more than ten people were thrown to their deaths.
All of them were sane, without worries.
None of them had enemies.
We are all in danger here.
Listen to me, Eswai.
Leave as soon as possible.
You, too, Miss, leave!
You should have never come to this village!
I was born here and the bodies of my parents are resting here.
The tombs you placed your flowers on... are not the graves of your parents.
The Schuftans never had any children.
No...
That's impossible. That's not true.
This is another absurd invention.
I have proof as to what I have said.
The Schuftans left me a sealed envelope... to give to you in case you should return.
I kept it in my utmost care.
The Schuftans were servants at the Villa Graps.
Your fate, like ours, is connected to this Villa.
I will bring you that envelope now.
Remember, doctor... the answer you are looking for can be found at the Villa Graps.
Do you think there is some truth to it?
Keirr!
Keirr!
Keirr!
No... No...
Open up! Open!
Monica!
Monica!
I can't take this anymore!
I can't take this!
Stop it for God's sake!
They will kill all of us here!
Stop it!
Help.
Let's go get someone.
Come.
Come out!
The burgomeister is dead!
Cowards!
You are such cowards, you'll get yourselves all killed!
Nobody will ever help us.
They are afraid!
Let's go.
Go away, you murderer!
You killed my daughter Nadienne, enough now!
Leave, leave!
Damn you!
It's your fault that my daughter is dead!
Go away!
Leave or I kill you!
Let's go.
Monica!
Monica!
Where are you?
Monica!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica, what's the matter?
How strange, Paul.
I came here as if I already knew this passage.
It feels like I have already been here.
Paul, I've never been here... yet I feel like I have already seen this place before.
We are locked inside, the lock has snapped shut.
There is nothing I can do.
It's impossible to open it.
Let's find another exit.
This must be the Graps family crypt.
Melissa Graps.
Maybe we can get out from there.
No, it's not possible.
It's locked down there.
Paul!
It's Melissa.
Melissa... Melissa.
My little girl. My daughter.
Why did you come here?
You shouldn't break the peace of my little one.
Why?
Baroness, terrible things are happening in the village!
The village gets what it deserves!
They always hated us, the Graps family!
They let my little girl die twenty years ago.
The village was celebrating, everybody was drunk.
One of them ran her over with a horse.
She begged for help for a long time, desperately... but nobody would help her.
In my opinion, they should all be condemned!
And she bled to death.
Bastards!
Come, come!
Please, come.
Come.
I left her room as it was.
Here... she would play here.
She was full of life.
Happy, always without worries.
She liked to see herself in the mirror.
She wasn't able to reach up there.
She had to stand on her toes here.
This was her favorite doll.
Everything has stayed the same as she had left it.
With her dolls... she had so many of them...
Melissa!
Melissa!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
No!
You have recovered, Dr. Eswai.
You are lucky. I found you in the park just in the nick of time.
You, too, were plunging towards death.
The silver coin.
At this point I can't do anything else for my dear Keirr...
The silver in your heart will bring you eternal peace.
I did everything I could to keep him from dying.
I have dreaded this moment day by day.
I loved you so much!
My life without you has no more purpose.
I will vindicate you, Keirr.
I will go to Villa Graps, even if it will cost me my life.
And Monica... Where is Monica?
There is no more hope for Monica.
She is Melissa's sister, the second daughter of the Baroness Graps.
Yes, Monica, you are my little girl.
I knew that you would come back to me. Wait.
The Schuftans were my servants.
I was the one who kept you in college.
If you really are my mother, why would you do such a thing?
Well, in order to keep you away from the Villa.
I was worried for your life.
This is you, Monica.
You were two years old.
And there is Melissa, your sister.
After Melissa's deadly accident... they all died in this Villa by Melissa's hatred.
Melissa cannot hate anymore now, she is all ashes by now.
No!
No. You saw her.
She is still here.
She uses me to return among the living.
I am a medium with supernatural powers... which I cannot control.
See, with these irresistible powers,
I am their victim.
They draw their strength from me, in order to survive.
I know... I know that they are evil.
But I can't stop them, I am their slave, they constantly force me... to call upon them!
No! No! No!
All of this is absurd, unreal!
I have to find Paul.
Please, help me.
Take care of yourself! Leave!
Here, they are coming. I feel them.
Let them go!
No. I can't let go of them.
Go away! I said leave!
You should go as well. Melissa has been waiting for you for twenty years.
Leave!
Leave!
Melissa!
Melissa... Melissa...
Enough!
Baroness Graps, you are done killing.
I have finally decided to put an end to this curse.
Ruth... you are playing with your fate.
Because it says you will die in this house.
This doesn't matter to me anymore.
I will put an end to this curse.
No, you have no powers over them.
You will die, too.
I have to vindicate Keirr.
You shouldn't have killed him.
Your time has come!
You will pay for what you did to him and all the other innocent victims!
You are the cause of all that's happened.
You who calls upon past spirits to use for your hatred... that has driven you since your daughter died!
No! It's them, it's not my fault.
It's them who force me to do so.
It's not my fault.
It is them who force me to do those things. No!
You call upon Melissa with your skills as a medium... in order to invade and throw to their death the people of this village.
They could not use their free will... and those poor people were unable to resist.
But now your maleficent powers are coming to an end!
"To an end... "?
You are a murderer!
You even want to kill your own daughter Monica.
Yes, I hate her as well.
The Schuftans kidnapped her from me and escaped through a tunnel.
They didn't want Melissa to get to them.
I hate them all. You will die.
You will all obey me, all of you!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica! Open for God's sake!
Die you damned bitch!
You and all your demonic creatures!
Monica!
This nightmare has now come to an end!
The chain of death has finally been broken.
Sometimes, reality is too complex for oral communication
But legend embodies it in a form which enables it to spread all over the world
It was 24.17, Oceanic Time when I approached the suburbs of Alphaville
Silence. Logic.
Security. Prudence
My paper reserved a room for me:
-You are?
-lvan Johnson
-Which paper?
-Figaro-Pravda
Room 344. Have you registered at Residents Control?
You must, even if you're a Festival visitor
Your bag, sir
-Please, sir.
-Nothing. Get lost
This way, sir
You're tired, sir?
You wish to sleep, sir?
It's this way, sir
If you're tired, you can rest, sir
Here it is, sir
The bedroom's here, sir
-What are you looking for now?
-I'm checking if the Bible's here
-Everyone has one.
-Do you believe that?
Yes, of course
I'll leave you the tranquillizers in the bathroom
I'm very well.
Thank you so very much
-Are you going to take a bath, sir?
-Yes, I must reflect
I'll help you, sir
And your tie, sir
-Now what? -I'll take a bath with you, sir, if you like
Listen, doll, I'm a big boy
I can find dames all alone
Now get lost
Be polite to the ladies,
Mr. Johnson
Shit. Now what?
This kid doesn't please you?
And your sister, sir?
-I'm getting out of shape.
-What sir?
What's going on here?
Are you on drugs or what?
No, it's normal, sir
All things weird are normal in this whore of cities
Sit in that chair
Her name was Beatrice
She said she was a seductress, third class
I was struck by the sadness and durability of her face
Something's not in orbit in the capital of this Galaxy
Hold this up
Not bad for a veteran of Guadalcanal
Just what I was thinking about you
Go play your games with someone else
I've heard it before
Y es? Mr. Johnson
Miss Natasha Vonbraun calls for you
Just a moment, please
Leonard Von Braun, inventor of the death ray bring back alive, or liquidate
Tell her to wait,
I'll be down in 5 minutes
She's on her way up
Henry Dickson, Agent X21,
12, Enrico Fermi, Alphaville
Got a light?
I've traveled 9,000 kilometers to give it to you
-I'm Natasha Vonbraun.
-Yes, I know
How do you know?
You are Miss Vonbraun
Yes, I'm very well, thank you so very much
You come from the Outlands,
Mr. Johnson?
-Everything to your satisfaction?
-Yes
I've been ordered to stay during your stay in Alphaville
Who ordered you?
The authorities, of course
You came for the festival,
Mr. Johnson?
Which festival?
The big one; that's why people from the Outlands come
-ln my opinion, it's silly you did not. -Why?
The festival's nearly over;
No more until next year
You don't say
Y es, Mr Johnson
But this evening, there's a gala reception
Very big
At a ministry. I'm going; come if you like
O.K.
What time? I must attend to something else first
You must go to
Residents Control registration?
No. What's that?
You mustn't forget to go there,
Mr Johnson. We can meet afterwards
No, I'll go there tomorrow.
First I must meet a friend
Me too, I've work to do
I'll give you the address where I'll be
Call for me and we'll go together
O.K. In an hour or two
All right, see you later,
Mr. Johnson
I'll go down with you, miss
Mr. Johnson, what's it like in the Outlands?
You've never been?
No, but my father told me about them when I was little
Now it's forbidden to think about them
Are you often ordered to stay with strangers?
-Yes, it's my job.
-Sometimes, it must be nice
-Why?
-You never have love affairs?
-What? -Has no one ever fallen in love with you?
In love? What's that?
There's one thing I'd like to know, miss
-Yes, Mr. Johnson.
-You've finished taking me
-for an ass, or are you beginning?
-Let go of me
But answer me
I don't understand, what are you talking about?
Realize, Princess. I don't know what you're talking about either
It's always like that.
You never understand anything
Y es, it's always like that.
You never understand anything
And one night, you end it in death
-Which way are you going?
-12, Enrico Fermi
That's after Heisenberg Boulevard, not far from Mathematical Park
I have a car, I can give you a lift, if you wish. -O.K.
I'll get the keys
-You don't want me to court you?
-What?
You really don't know what it means?
Her smile and her small, pointed teeth reminded me of the old vampire films the sort they used to show at cinerama museums
I'm a programmer, second class
Natasha's a name from the past
Y es, but in life, one can only know the present
No one's lived in the past, or will live in the future
Thanks for the lift, anyway
It's a pleasure to do my job,
Mr. Johnson
It's much farther?
You know we must cross the North Zone, Miss
What's the population of Alphaville?
Don't forget, you must go to Residents Control
Yes
What exactly do you do for a living?
I work for a newspaper
Professor Vonbraun is your father?
It's vital that I write about him;
Could you arrange a meeting?
I don't know. I've never seen him.
I'll ask
Finally, I leave you
-Here?
-I've changed my mind
You have the address?
Yes. Tell him to stop
Telecommunication
I'd like to telecommunicate
-Galaxy or local call?
-Local
Cabin 2
Miss, do you know that man?
Of course I know him.
Don't be stupid
At the end of Galata Bridge one finds the Red Star.
My place
You can't compare it to our splendid galactic corridors all a-glitter with luxury and light
It's only a vast labyrinth, tall, cramped
Is this the Red Star Hotel?
Y es, it is, thank you
-ls Mr. Dickson in?
-He's out
Fine, I'll wait
You have money, sir?
You can have a seat, sir, if you're tired
I wanted to see it again the tomb of the Duc de Montpensier
The reclining statue of the Prince is the work of Pradier
The Prince wears the costume of

We've got plenty to talk about
-Where's my key?
-Where's my money, Mr. Dickson?
-My key.
-His key
And a beer
And me?
Why don't you hurry up and commit suicide?
We need the room for our cousin from the south
You come from the Outlands?
Why did he ask if you'd commit suicide?
There's quite a few...
There's quite a few who do
One can't adapt to this place
It's the method the Chinese invented about thirty years ago in Pekingville
Dissuasion is their strong point
What about those who won't adapt, or commit suicide?
-Those... they're executed.
-Y es, the authorities
But one can hide, you know.
There aren't many left
Dick Tracy, is he dead?
And Guy Leclair?
Why didn't we hear from them, or from you, Henry?
I'm sorry.
These things happen
And what's Alpha 60?
A giant computer, like they used to have in big business
Nueva York... lBM...
Olivetti... General Electric...
Tokyorama...
Alpha 60 is one hundred and fifty light years more powerful
I see. People have become slaves of probabilities
Their ideal here, in Alphaville is a technocracy, like that of termites and ants
I don't understand
Probably one hundred and fifty light years ago
One hundred and fifty, two hundred there were artists in the ant society
Artists, novelists, musicians, painters
Today, no more
Nothing. Like here
Has Professor Vonbraun organized it all?
He obeys logical orders
Then why didn't you kill him?
"Why"... what does that word mean?
I forgot...
You know his daughter, Natasha?
Who is she really?
It was him they sent to Los Alamos
His name wasn't that then
Answer! That wasn't his name in those days
Listen, Henry
We'll get out together; you'll be O.K. But first you must...
It's a terrible secret, but...
Come in, Madame la Marquise
My coat, Madame Recamier
Thank you, Madame Pompadour
Madame Bovary, Marie Antoinette
Madame Lafayette
Madame, it's love
I'll say it in Russian
So young and me
Lemmy... conscience...
Alpha 60... make... self destruct...
Tenderness...
Save those who weep
Yes, yes, that's it

You prefer I pass through the North Zone or the South?
What's the difference?
There's snow in the North and sun in the South
Anyway, it's my journey to the end of the night
So, it doesn't matter
It was my first night in Alphaville but it seemed to me that centuries had passed
I'm very well, thank you so very much
Miss Natasha Vonbraun
-Which section?
-Programming and memory
The Central Memory...
...is thus named...
...because of the primordial role...
...that it plays...
...in the logic-organization within Alpha 60
But no one has lived in the past...
...and no one will live in the future
The present is the form of all life
This quality...
...cannot be changed by any means
Time is like a circle...
...which turns endlessly
The descending arc is the past
The arc that climbs is the future
Everything has been said...
...provided words do not change their meanings...
...and meanings their words
Is it not obvious that someone...
...who customarily lives...
...in a state of suffering...
...requires a different sort of religion...
...from a person habitually in a state of well-being?
Before us, nothing existed here
No one
We are totally alone here
We are unique, dreadfully unique
The meaning of words...
...and of expressions, is no longer grasped
An isolated word, or a detail of a design...
...can be understood
But the meaning of the whole escapes
Once we know the number one...
...we believe that we know the number two...
...because one plus one equals two
We forget that first...
...we must know the meaning of plus
I'm going
The acts of men...
...carried over...
...from past centuries...
...will gradually...
...destroy them...
...logically... l, Alpha 60...
...am merely the logical means of this destruction
Good night, Comrade
I thought I'd never
-Shall we go?
-I'll get the keys
I left because I couldn't understand a word he was saying
But it's very simple
We learnt this evening that death and life are found within the same circle
-Are you afraid of death?
-Of course not. Why?
We took the tangent to the center districts
Traffic bulletins on the radio...
...as Natasha spoke to me in her pretty sphinx voice
Pretty sphinx...
Foreign ambassadors usually attend or delegations from the districts
Why does everyone look so sad, somber?
You ask too many questions
Because they lack electricity
The essence...
...of the so-called capitalist word...
...or the communist world...
...is not an evil volition...
...to subject their people by the power of indoctrination...
...or the power of finance...
...but simply...
...the natural ambition...
...of any organization...
...to plan all its actions
In a word, to minimize unknown quantities
This dump of yours isn't
Alphaville, it's Zeroville
-What are we going to see?
-I don't know, light and sound
-Where is everyone?
-I believe; it's already begun
Hurry. We're late
It's already begun
Don't they electrocute them any more?
Darling, you know the provisions of 17th Plan took a plunge
You see, I told you so
Stay here
-lntroduce me.
-I told you to stay there we're with very important people
-Can I take a photo?
-I'll ask
Yes
-What have they done?
-They've been condemned
Only men?
There's usually a ratio of fifty men executed to one woman
But what have they done?
They behaved illogically lsn't that a crime in the Outlands?
Say, I know him.
He wept when his wife died
He was condemned for that?
Evidently
We must advance to live
Aim straight for those you love
Listen to me, normals
We see the truth you no longer see
The truth is that the essence of man is love and faith courage, tenderness, generosity and sacrifice
The rest is the obstacle created by the progress of your blind ignorance
One day...
One day...
Sorry, Professor, but I must speak with you
I never speak to journalists
I'm not a journalist
Can't we talk somewhere quieter?
-Goodbye, sir.
-Mr. Nosferatu
That man no longer exists
Are you crying?
No, because it's forbidden
Occupied
Occupied
Free
Sit there and answer when you're spoken to
I haven't done anything
Newcomers must be interrogated
Alpha 5
What is your name?
Where were you born?
Nueva York
How old are you?
I don't know... 45
What make is your car?
What do you love above all?
Gold and women
What are you doing in Alphaville?
An article for Figaro-Pravda
You seem afraid
I'm not afraid... not the way you think
Anyway, you wouldn't understand
Rest assured that my decisions...
...always have in view...
...the ultimate good
I shall now...
...ask you some test questions...
...as a security measure
No, go ahead
You have come from the Outlands
What were your feelings...
...when you passed through galactic space?
The silence of infinite space appalled me
What is the privilege of the dead?
To die no more
Do you know what illuminates the night?
Poetry
What is your religion?
I believe in the inspirations of conscience
Do you make any distinction...
...between the mysterious principles...
...of knowledge...
...and those of love?
In my opinion, in love there is no mystery
You are not telling the truth
I don't understand
You are hiding certain things
I admit I might have reasons to lie but how can you differentiate between lies and truth?
You are hiding certain things...
...but I do not know yet what they are
For the time being, you are free
I should like you to visit...
...the Control Complex
Come with me, Mr. Johnson
-Where are we going?
-To the Chief Engineer
Ah, the day breaks
Sit down, Mr Johnson
A momentous occasion
Y es, we spent three years looking for Grand Omega Minus
Well, Mr. Johnson...
How do you find Alphaville?
Not bad, if I knew where I was
You are in the center of
Alphaville, inside Alpha 60
The task of Alpha 60 is to calculate and project the results which Alphaville will subsequently enjoy
Why?
No one ever says "why"; one says "because"
In the life of individuals, as in the life of nations all is linked, all is consequence
That's the famous theory of
Professor Leonard Nosferatu
Leonard Nosferatu no longer exists, Mr. Johnson
The Outlands expelled him in 1964
Today there is only
Professor Vonbraun
I remember. He was sent to a village in the desert to perfect his invention
He was exiled, you mean
Now the Outlands wring their hands, wishing him back
They flood us with spies. Perhaps you are a spy, Mr. Johnson
You know I'm only a free man
A meaningless reply.
We know nothing
We record, calculate, draw conclusions
An hour ago, one of Alpha 60's
1.4 billion nerve centres questioned you
Your replies were difficult and sometimes impossible to codify
We deduce an above-average intelligence
We are sometimes in mortal need of superior intelligences
At other times we have a no less mortal distrust of them
So what will you do with me?
For the moment, we're ordered to show you Alpha 60
Who ordered you?
Professor Vonbraun?
Absolutely not
An order is a logical conclusion
One must not be afraid of logic.
Simply that. Period
The circuit elements... of 183 Omega Minus... malfunction
Calculating or memory elements?
Memory
Professors Eckel and Jeckel
I'm very well, thank you, pleased to meet you
Me too
I'd like to know what
Grand Omega Minus is
Our 17th electricity plan is inadequate
Sooner or later, the Outlands will declare war on us
Therefore, we decided to invade them
Directed by Professor Vonbraun,
Omega Minus will be victorious over anti-matter
I see, it's ideal
We can perhaps use men like you to tell us the weak points of the Outlands
Your tendency to dwell in the past...
...could be useful to us
We send those properly brain-washed to provoke the other galaxies the strikes, revolutions, family rows, student revolts
That's us: Grand Omega Minus
-Where now?
-The invisible part of Alpha 60
You think more of what has been...
...than of what will be
It's old, your camera
The technical...
I don't believe in it
Y es, of course
Jeckel asked why I shot the individual in my bathroom...
...when the whole thing was just a psycho-test
I replied, because I'm too old to argue. So I shoot
It's my only weapon against fatality
-What's this?
-Central lnterrogation Station
Here Alpha 60 sets itself problems
The forms and references used by Alpha 60 are too complex for human understanding
What sort of problems?
Train and airplane departures... movement of people and goods electricity distribution... crime suppression... war operations
Element Seven, Malfunction
What's happening?
It's war with the Outlands
A simple instruction...
...is usually insufficient...
...to put into...
...execution...
...a task set by Alpha 60
Do not think...
...that it is l...
...who initiate this destruction...
...nor the scientists...
...who have accepted my plan
Ordinary men...
...are unworthy...
...of the positions they hold...
...in the world
Analysis of their past...
...automatically leads one...
...to this conclusion
Therefore...
...they must be destroyed
That is to say: transformed
I don't need anyone to draw it for me
During these years, under the direction...
...of Vonbraun and his assistants...
...Alphaville had developed by leaps and bounds...
...guided by electronic brains that developed themselves...
...by conceiving problems...
...that the human imagination couldn't grasp
Foreigners were gradually assimilated...
...especially the Swedes,
Germans and Americans
The others, the unassimilatables were purely and simply killed
I walked through the threaten of executions
Usually, we would seat them
...and electrocute them in their chairs as they watched a show
Then we'd dump them into huge rubbish bins...
...and the theater was ready for the next batch
If an individual showed hope of reclamation...
...he was sent to a chronic illness hospital where...
...mechanical and propagandistic treatments soon cured him
I felt that my existence here...
...was becoming a distorted, twilight memory...
...and without a doubt, a terrible destiny
I was left only one solution
It would not be logical...
...to prevent...
...superior beings...
...from attacking...
...the other galaxies
Put in one token
Thank you
Going up, sir?
-No, I'll shine my shoes.
-Please, sir
-This man has the key.
-This way, sir
You're tired, sir?
You'd like to sleep, sir?
Y es, to sleep: perchance to dream
What are you exactly?
I'm a seductress, third class
Has your colleague gone?
Who? Beatrice?
I don't know; a blonde with long legs
She's working in the peripheral flats
We're only replacements
Ever heard of the Outlands?
Never
-Get out of here!
-Why?
If anyone asks, say you don't know
I'm very well, thank you so very much
If it isn't the little princess
I was forbidden to come, but I wanted to see you again
Not me!
Since you're here, order breakfast for me
Yes, sir
Pardon, I'm very well, thank you so very much
Me too
Bow your head
What is it?
Nothing. Just a thought
What about my breakfast?
I want to tele-order breakfast
What is your number?
You have a number?
They didn't give me one at Alpha 60
Not your control number, your room number
Ever heard of this book?
"The Capital of Pain"
Some words are underlined
We live in the void of metamorphoses
But the echo that runs throughout the day...
...that echo beyond time, anguish or caress...
Are we near to our conscience, or far from it?
These are words
I don't understand
Conscience...
And this: death in conversation
And this?
Your eyes have returned from a despotic land...
...where no one has known the meaning of a glance
You've really no idea what this is?
It reminds me of something
I don't know what
Naked truth
I know it well
Despair has no wings, nor does love
No face, they don't speak
I don't look at them,
I don't speak to them
But I am as alive as my love and despair...
And this:
Dying is not dying
And this:
The beguiler beguiler
This:
Men who change
Never heard of secret messages,
Miss Vonbraun?
A secret message?
Don't you know what a secret is?
Y es. Secrets of planning, atomic secrets, secrets of memory
Now what are you looking for?
This town is driving me nuts!
I'm looking for a Bible, to see if it's in it
Are you a complete idiot? The word
I'm looking for, obviously...
Where is it? There's always one for every room
I'm becoming afraid
Since you've come, I no longer understand what is happening
Me, I think I'm beginning to understand
Here it is
"Conscience"... it's not in it
I'm very well, thank you
It's no longer there.
So no one here knows the meaning of the word
Too bad
1 sugar or 2?
That's not a Bible, it's a dictionary lsn't it the same in the Outlands, Mr. Johnson?
Answer me now, what's it for?
Nearly every day words disappear, because they are forbidden
They are replaced by new words expressing new ideas
In the last two or three months some words I was very fond of disappeared
Which words? I'm interested
Redbreast, weeping autumn light tenderness too
When I'm with you I'm afraid
They ordered me not to see you again
Who? The Alpha 60 engineers?
-Y es.
-What are you afraid of?
I'm afraid because
I know that word without ever having seen it or read it
-Which word?
-Le conscience
La conscience
-You've never been to the Outlands?
-No
Are you sure?
Yes
You're lying
Why are you cross with me?
I believe you mustn't say
"why" but "because"
I said "why"?
And if enemy ears are listening, they heard you, too
Well, then, I was careless, because it's forbidden
Perhaps it's all right for you to use it
When did I say "why"?
Another question first: where were you born?
Here in Alphaville
Another lie. Perhaps you don't know, but you're lying
I must know the truth: where were you born?
Here. I told you
No, in Tokyorama the Land of the Rising Sun
Go on, say it
In Tokyorama, in the Land of the Rising Sun
Or in Florence, perhaps... where try to remember it for yourself, Natasha. Where?
Where? I don't know
Where the sky's as blue as the South Seas
Florence, where the sky's as blue as the South Seas
Or in Nueva York
Where the winter... Broadway glitters in the snow like a fur coat
You see, you do know the Outlands
Your father was chased from Nueva York in '64
He brought you here, so you are not from here
I know what this book is
A man who came with us from
Nueva York, he wrote these books
I don't know what became of him
They live in the forbidden quarters here; they commit suicide
I know that Alpha 60 uses them sometimes
It controls them.
How come?
Because they write incomprehensible things
Now I know: it used to be called poetry
It's believed to be secrets, but really it's nothing
When Control has an hour or so free it codifies such stuff
Like everything else, one never knows
It can always prove useful
Absolutely.
We're highly organized
I'd like to leave with you for the Outlands
But I'm afraid
Now that I've seen you
I'm no longer normal
When did I say "why"?
Why?
Because... you know very well,
Mr. Johnson
No, I don't
At which moment?
Tell me
Quite often. Last night in the corridor, for instance
This time you're lying
When I said I was falling in love with you
In love? What's that?
This
No, I know what that is: it's sensuality
No, sensuality is a consequence
It cannot exist without love
So what is love, then?
Your voice, your eyes...
...your hands, your lips...
Our silences, our words...
Light that goes...
...light that returns
A single smile between us
In quest of knowledge,
I watched night create day...
...while we seemed unchanged
O beloved of all, beloved of one alone...
...your mouth silently promised to be happy
Away, away, says hate;
Closer, closer, says love
A caress leads us from our infancy lncreasingly I see the human form...
...as a lovers' dialogue
The heart has but one mouth
Everything by chance
All words without thought
Sentiments adrift
Men roam the city
A glance, a word
Because I love you
Everything moves
We must advance to live
Aim straight ahead toward those you love
I went toward you, endlessly toward the light
If you smile, it enfolds me all the better
The rays of your arms pierce the mist
Capital of Sorrow
I must know how the chief engineer will use me
As an inter-galaxy double agent,
I think
-So it's true what Eckel said.
-What?
You send spies to sabotage the rest of the world
Of course, you learn that in school
Are you going to betray me?
You can't talk or don't you want to
Can I communicate with the Outlands from this hotel?
Just ask for Galaxy Service.
You want me to do it?
The Outlands...
I want to telecommunicate
...telecommunications are suspended for some days
-What were you going to say?
-An atomic attack on Alphaville
I'll explain later, Princess, but now let's get out of here
We must find the Professor... where does he live?
-Come with us!
-Where?
-Residents Control.
-No kidding
When he doubles up, get him
Story 842, Miss
One day a tiny man entered a North Zone cafe and said, "l want a cup of very hot, sweet coffee..." adding: "l shan't pay, because I fear no one"
He drank his coffee
He left
He drank his coffee and didn't pay
The cafe owner said nothing, he was afraid of a scandal
But when the tiny man repeated the trick a few times the cafe owner said:
"I've had it, I'll get a tough guy to beat up this tiny man if he comes back"
So, on the fourth day when the tiny man said, "l want a cup of very hot, sweet coffee..." the tough guy goes to him and says:
"So you're afraid of no one?"
"That's right"
"Well, neither am l"
"Well", says the tiny man,
"Make that two cups of coffee very hot and sweet."
Meet you outside
Residents Control
You'll stay here, Miss Vonbraun
Last night you lied
You organized Dickson's death.
Why?
Your name may be spelled...
...lvan Johnson...
...but it is pronounced
Lemmy Caution...
...secret agent...
...number zero zero three...
...of the Outlands
You are a menace to the security of Alphaville
I refuse to become what you call normal
Those you call mutants...
...form a race superior...
...to ordinary men...
...whom we have almost eliminated
Unthinkable
An entire race cannot be destroyed
I shall calculate...
...so that failure...
...is impossible
I shall fight so that failure is possible
Everything that I project shall be accomplished
Don't be so sure;
I have a secret, too
What is your secret?
Tell me, Mr. Caution
Something which never changes, day or night
The past represents its future, it advances in a straight line yet it ends by coming full circle
I cannot trace it
I won't tell you
Several of my circuits...
...are looking for the solution to your riddle
I will find it
If you find it, you will destroy yourself simultaneously because you will become my kin, my brother
Those who are not born, do not weep...
...and do not regret
Thus it is logical to condemn you to death
Fuck yourself with your logic
My judgement is just...
...and I am working for the universal good
If you plan to drive us from the other galaxies, you'll fail
You will not leave; the exit is blocked
We'll see
Professor Vonbraun - do you know where he lives?
Central Palace, South Zone, behind Raw Materials Station
Let's go
Don't budge
That way I'm sure you will keep your word
Out! Out!
No journalists!
You know "journalist" and "justice" both begin with the same letter?
Tell your boss
What can I do for you,
Mister Caution?
News travels fast here
Because we're very rapidly entering Light Civilization
At about 300.000 kilometers per second
I'm returning to the Outlands.
Come with me
Stay with us, Mister Caution
When the war's over I'll put you in charge of another galaxy
You will have gold and women
We are mastering a science so fantastic that the old American and
Russian control of atomic force will seem pathetic
I see
You oppose my moral, even supernatural, sense of vocation with a simple physical and mental existence easily controllable by technicians
Your ideas are strange,
Mr. Caution
Some years ago, in the Age of ldeas yours would have been called sublime ideas
Look at yourself. Men of your type will soon be extinct
You'll become something worse than dead
You'll become a legend,
Mr. Caution
Y es, I'm afraid of death but for a humble secret agent that's a fact of life, like whisky
And I've drunk that all my life
You never want to see the Outlands again, Professor?
Goodbye, Mister Caution
Such people will serve as terrible examples to those...
...who see the world as theater...
...when technical power and its triumph...
...is the only act in their repertoire
I was running a straight line...
...which, like Dickson's
Greek labyrinth...
...and philosophers were lost, as a secret agent was too
In many respects...
...your reactions and your modes of thought...
...differ...
...from present normality
The inhabitants of Alphaville are not normal
They are the product of mutation
Do you accept our proposal?
Answer silently...
...with yes or no
I'll never betray the Outlands
The present is terrifying...
...because it is irreversible, and because it is of iron
Time is the substance of which
I am made
Time is a river which carries me along
But I am time
It's a tiger, tearing me apart; but I'm the tiger
Look at her and me, there's your answer
We're happiness, and we're heading towards it
It is our misfortune that the world is reality
And l...
...it is my misfortune that I am myself, Alpha 60
Natasha, quick...
...think of the word love
Here
Not all the inhabitants died, but all were stricken
Those not asphyxiated by the absence of light...
...circled crazily, like ants
It was 23.15, Oceanic Time...
...when Natasha and I left
Alphaville by the peripheral roads
A night drive across intersidereal space, and we'd be home
Don't look back
-Do you think they're all dead?
-Not yet
They may recover, and Alphaville will be happy, like Florence
Like Angouleme-city, like Tokyorama
You can't go back
-Have I slept for long?
-No, the space of an instant
Where are we?
In the Outlands?
Not yet
You're looking at me with an odd face
You're waiting for me to say something
I don't know what to say
They're words I don't know
I wasn't taught them
Help me lmpossible, Princess.
You must get there yourself
Then you'll be saved.
If you don't you're as lost as the dead of Alphaville l you love
I love you
Get along, Miss Sixpence.
Damn good hunt.
By the way, congratulations, sir, getting the brush.
First brush grandfather's given away all season. l envy you. l like to see a thruster in the field.
Ginger's up a whole hunt.
You earned it.
Thanks.
As l recall, you were in at the kill when l rode up.
A master's job to stay with his hounds.
The day l can't,
I'll let him there take over. l can't grandfather, before my voice changes.
Hounds won't obey.
-Are you really off next week, Adrian?
-I'm afraid so. l saw that in the Times this morning.
Didn't know you were a celebrity.
Adrian doesn't write his books for you and you only, Derek.
-Sorry, mother.
-Damn silly time to be going away.
Three good months of hunting left. l get to find what father considers a good time to go away.
Everything one wants, right here.
Where are you off to?
-America, sir.
-What on earth for?
You know what they do out there?
Follow a drag, actually.
-What's a drag?
-An abomination.
-What's an abomination?
-Something damnable like a drag.
Blighters douse some rags with some stink, drag it on the ground.
Poor damned hounds follow it!
Ruins their noses!
-Call that hunting!
-But what's the object?
-Sham!
-'Bomination. l had a brother went to America once,
Canada actually.
Before the first German War.
He should be dead by now.
Almost everyone is.
-Dinner at 8.
-Sherry at 7.30.
Extraordinary how alike they are.
And like Ian.
To me, he's always standing between them.
My, l am stiff!
My first hunt of the season. l can do with a hot tub.
-Anthony.
-Yes?
-Give me five minutes, will you?
-Of course l will. lf you don't mind my asking, you're not still Ml6 are you?
No. thoroughly retired.
Pension and all that.
The Minister may ask me to come in now and again for trivial assignments.
-That won't interfere with this.
-Well, what is this?
Just the most tremendous favor you could do me if you would.
So that's why l was invited down here for the weekend.
My dear fellow, you know how devoted the family is to you.
Go on, old man.
Well, it's rather difficult really.
It involves your doing something without knowing why. So,... don't hesitate to say no.
Ten names.
Ten probable occupations.
Ten addresses.
Scattered all over the kingdom.
So, what do l do?
Ask about them.
-What do you mean, ''ask about them''?
-Just that. l don't want their families bothered by policemen.
I’ll put it this way.
Are those 10 men still living at those addresses? l think that should do it.
Suppose they've moved, do you want to know where? lf you like.
Well, I’ll do this, of course, you knew that in advance. l flatter myself. l know you well enough, there must be good reason.
-Am l right?
-Absolutely.
Let me give you a suggestion.
I've been watching you lately.
And underneath that admirably calm exterior of yours, you're... wound up.
Why don't you tell me about it?
No.
No, it's... so preposterous, l can't believe my suspicions make any sense.
I’m counting on you to prove that they don't.
When do you need this information?
It'll be difficult to collect.
Especially the way you want it.
Well, l...
I’ll be back in England in about a fortnight, is that too soon?
Should be about right.
It's no good theorizing, Anthony.
You'll only come to some wildly improbable conclusions.
Like, what you're thinking now.
That I’ve uncovered some fascist or anarchist or communist conspiracy.
Believe me, there's nary a conspiracy. lf I’m right about this, it's a far older sin than politics.
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.
-Just one bag?
-That's all.
-Passport control is upstairs.
-Thank you very much.
Your ticket please.
-And your passport.
-l do hope I’m not overweight.
-I’m afraid you are, six pounds.
-Dear, l was afraid of that.
-Wasn't l underweight?
-Yes, you were.
Average it out.
We're traveling together.
-A white lie.
-Uncommonly polite.
-Haven't we met?
-l don't think so.
My name's Atlee. I’m a vicar at Plumpton-on-Coot, Herts.
I’m sorry, my imagination.
-Your ticket and your baggage check.
-Thank you.
-Good evening, Mr. LeBorg.
-Good evening.
Attention, please.
Anglo-Canadian airlines Flight 21 for Montreal is now loading.
A-C-A Flight 21 for Montreal is now loading.
Will the Reverend Mr. Atlee please report to Immigration?
Reverend Mr. Atlee, please.
Reverend Mr. Atlee please report to passport control
A-C-A Flight 21 for Montreal is now leaving.
Messenger, Messenger...
Jocelyn. Got me, to tell. Jocelyn.
Got me, to tell.
Photograph.
Photograph.
George... Emma's...
George... Emma's...
All the brooms.
Clean sweep.
Only one broom left.
Clean, sweep.
Clean, sweep.
It was sabotage, pure and simple.
Communication with Shannon was cut off in mid-sentence.
There was a hell of an explosion.
You can listen for yourself, the recording from Shannon. l shall with the greatest interest.
Yes, by all means!
-Come in my dear fellow.
-You'll forgive me, Sir Wilfred.
-You know Sir Robert Carstairs?
-How do you do, sir.
These two chaps l know you know.
Good morning, Pike.
Good morning, Flood.
Just digging into this ghastly aircraft business.
Sir Robert's convinced it was sabotage.
Actually we've got corroborative evidence of a sort.
This chap that was fished out of the water swears he smelt cordite.
Of course that could be imagination on the part of this fellow.
LeBorg, a Frenchman, by the way.
Raoul LeBorg.
I don't know a better man to I.D. the smell of cordite.
There you are.
Exactly.
-Do you know him?
-The name struck a cord. l looked up some old files.
During the war, your friend blew up 31 bridges,...
11 power stations, two marshaling yards... and five ammo dumps.
A thorn, it would seem, in the side of the German Occupation.
Yes, Seymour, what is it?
We searched the Clerical Lists.
Not an Atlee on any of them.
We didn't think there would be.
But Mr. Atlee was prepared to invest 173 pounds just to place a bag... on that plane.
Any word of unusual amount of insurance on any of the passengers?
Not so far, sir.
-It wasn't done for insurance.
-There had to be a motive.
Definitely.
Take a look at this list, will you?
What's it supposed to be? A cross section of Humus Brittanicus?
-Where did it come from?
-Adrian Messenger gave it to me.
Messenger? There was a Messenger on that passenger list.
Same chap. l was to find out if those names were still living at those addresses.
So far, I’ve learned that six of the ten aren't.
The reason being, they aren't living at all.
You'll find the dates of death in this column.
The causes of death in that one.
All accidental and covering a period of roughly five years.
The last one, Dr. Devitt killed in a lift accident...
-four months ago.
-l think not. l think the last one was 12 hours ago.
It’s my feeling that Messenger's name belongs on that list too.
Check those other names, will you?
What connection would Messenger have with a farmer, a veterinarian,... a draper's assistant, a car salesman? l haven't the foggiest.
The fact remains that...
Six deaths by accident out of any 10 names can't be by chance.
But it was in 6 years, and in an area that includes most of the UK. lf you really think that all these deaths were tied together,... it would involve a mass murder plot so preposterous it would defy belief.
Adrian's own word, ''preposterous''. l think he thought no one would believe him until he had... more... what shall l say? Data.
Messenger was a writer, wasn't he?
Isn't it possible that he was letting his imagination run wild?
He wasn't that kind of writer.
Let me go a step further.
Messenger's own death could be listed in the accidental column.
That would be death rate of 7 of 11, a little more than 63%
I'd like to know how much more you'd want before you took this seriously.
-Yes, Pike, what is it?
-One quick result, sir.
Ian James Dalkeith,
27 Bolthwell Square, Edinburgh.
Remember reading about a railway wreck in the Highlands two years ago?
One of those Scottish trains ran off the rails. 16 were killed.
Dalkeith was one of them.
All right, Pike.
All information available about these deaths.
Who are the three not heard from yet?
Quincey, Rouce and Slattery.
Q., R. and S., eh?
Run them down and find out what links these men together.
There must be some common denominator.
Very well, sir.
Shall I report to General Gethryn?
Yes. You would anyway.
Right. Pike, l suppose it's occurred to you that... if any of the three remaining men is still living,... we can't be sure that he isn't responsible...
-for the removal of the others.
-Quite.
We don't want to show them even a shadow of a policeman.
We can't have our fox going to ground.
Don't worry, sir.
We won't show them any shadows.
-Any other notions?
-Yes. lf you have no objection,...
I'd like a word with LeBorg.
According to the newspapers he was the last to see Adrian alive.
He tried to save his life.
London clinic, room 327.
No more visitors. l am a weak man.
-l have a headache.
-Just take this please.
-There's a lady for the gentleman.
-No visitors.
She says she's a relative of Mr.
Messenger.
Let her come in, but let her stay but a moment.
I’ll see to that.
You may come in, Milady.
Madame, you will forgive me if l do not rise.
-I’m sorry about your...
-Cousin. He was very dear to me.
-He had no family of his own.
-l see. l want you to know how grateful l am for your efforts to save Adrian.
That was only in your newspapers.
Mr. Messenger was in the water,... he reached for the raft, l only helped him aboard.
And alas, he died.
It was just bad fortune that we were not found in time.
I’m very sorry, Milady, but...
-I’ll push the button for you.
-But you said...
It’s all right, Sister.
I’m just leaving.
Lady Bruttenholm, please.
For the first time, my headache does not ache.
There is a gentleman to see you. l told him he couldn't.
He asked me to give you this.
They eyes, they will not focus, if you will not mind?
"Will Ajax see Polidor?"
Polidor?
It is a name from antiquity.
Open the door!
It is my old comrade in arms.
Mr. Gethryn, you can go in.
Thank you.
Jocelyn, I’m delighted to see you.
-Wretched business, this one.
-Hi, Anthony.
This is Ajax? l must say you look as though you've been through a war.
-Polidor, my friend.
-The pig is dead.
Down with the pig.
There is no man l would rather meet.
-You mean you don't know each other?
-Only on the short wave. l thought you may have had many questions already about Messenger.
What is it you wish to know?.
Everything Messenger said, in the order he said it,... and whether or not it seemed to make any sense.
This is important.
-Very.
-So, okay.
There is a way with my mind that l sometimes use about remembering.
You wish me to have a shot?
Please.
He begins to speak.
His words, they are just words.
No sentences.
First he says his name, many times.
Then he says,
''Jocelyn got me to tell.''
Two times, maybe three.
''Jocelyn got me to tell.''
Then he says, ''Photograph.''
Then there are two names,
''George, Emma's''.
Then they run together.
''George, Emma's photograph.''
Then there was a silence.
Then he shouts something about brushes.
''Sweep clean, sweep clean.''
''Only one brush left.
Sweep clean, sweep clean.''
Then it was as if he had coughed.
But it was not a cough.
It was the end.
He was dead.
So, you have written all this.
-As best l could, yes.
-Does it help you? l don't know yet.
Why are you asking these questions?
In the hopes of finding Adrian's murderer.
Murderer?
It was because of Adrian that the aircraft was blown out of the sky.
That's impossible. Adrian didn't have an enemy in the world.
Are you sure? Is there anything that you can tell me about him?
What could there be? He was one of those creatures with no dark sides.
He had two passions.
Fox hunting and writing.
One other, his cat.
Clean.
Sweep.
Emma's.
My dear fellow, come in!
-l do not disturb?
-Most certainly not!
What the devil are you doing out of your hospital bed? l have been thinking.
Splendid, tell me about it. lf you're up to it. l do not walk on my arms, or my ribs. l have been thinking that l too was blown out of the sky.
This offends me.
So, l am declaring myself in on your hunt.
Welcome aboard.
This is a big improvement from room 327.
-Whiskey?
-By all means.
It begins to make sense?
Well, perhaps,...
Thank you.
All one has to do is put the words in the proper order.
It’s a wheel job, actually.
You can begin anywhere.
It could be,
''Jocelyn got me to tell something''.
Or ''Someone got me to tell something.''
Or ''Someone got me to do something.''
''Tell Jocelyn''.
Or ''Jocelyn got me two something''
Well, we both saw the same trap!
-Trap? Where is this trap?
-Phonetics.
You caught on that ''two'' could be T-W-O.
But it could also be T-O-O.
That...
That would give us...
''got me'',...
''too,''...
''Tell Jocelyn.''
It is a sentence. It makes sense.
Yes, it does make sense.
You mind if l pick your brain?
That trick memory of yours? l have to go back into the cruel sea.
Okay, shoot ahead.
No, not quite yet.
What kind of voice came out of Adrian Messenger?
What was its pitch? Its timbre?
Was he gasping?
Did he stammer? What did he sound like?
It was not deep.
It was perhaps like this.
Messenger...
Now, listen to me.
Messenger...
Too deep.
Too precise the pronunciation.
Messenger.
Messenger.
That's it.
Completely.
Back you go, into the drink.
Stop me if you hear me say anything wrong. A word, anything.
Okay.
Messenger...
Messenger...
Got me too.
Tell Jocelyn.
Got me too.
Tell Jocelyn.
Photograph.
George.
MS.
Photograph George.
MS.
George.
MS.
Well?
It is just as l have told you. Exactly.
Not quite.
Phonetics again.
What l said was,
''Photograph George''.
''MS''.
What is this ''MS''?
It’s an abbreviation for manuscript.
What he was saying was, ''there's a photo of George in his manuscript.''
Let's go. We will visit the residence of Mr. Messenger.
When you count yourself in, you really mean in, don't you?
Come on.
-You startled me.
-I’m sorry.
-Who are you?
-I’m Mr. Pythian. l live below.
Poor Mr. Messenger's cat was meowing so pitifully. Probably hungry. l stopped in to feed her. l promised Mr. Messenger l would.
She's already had three saucers of warm milk, haven't you, puss.
-You're very kind.
-Not in the least. Poor Mr. Messenger.
What a tragic loss.
He was such a polite man. We only had a passing acquaintance on the stairs.
I’m his cousin.
My deepest sympathy.
Tell me.
What's to become of little puss?
I’ll take her.
You are a cat lover, of course.
One knows instantly, there's an immediate affinity.
Two things that are equal to a third are equal to each other.
Whoever loves cats, etc. you get my point.
-Yes.
-l guess l better be going.
-Good night, Mr. Pythian.
-Good night to you, and puss.
-Thanks again.
-Not at all.
Taxi!
Fulham Road.
Jocelyn, what brings you here? l promised Adrian to look after Omar while he was away.
It is Mr. LeBorg, isn't it?
The wine speed up my recovery,
Madame.
And the oysters.
More brawn than brains, if he'll forgive me saying it.
We thought we'd have a look at that unfinished book of Adrian's.
In his desk.
Center drawer.
Why? l don't know.
I’m hoping Adrian can tell us.
Any Georges?
I’m afraid this is going to take much of the night.
I’ll make some coffee.
Come in.
Thank you.
Your husband will not be alarmed that you are not at home?
My husband's dead.
He was killed in Korea with the Gloucesters.
And you are a widow all this time?
Yes.
Appalling.
-l beg your pardon?
-I’m a Frenchman. l abhor waste. l don't understand.
You are a woman of great beauty.
You should be making happy some man.
And yourself, too.
Living alone is for the very young and the very old.
-I’m quite happy.
-No, Madame, you are not.
You should be making fine children.
-l have a son.
-No protests, Madame. l speak only for your own welfare.
Well, thanks very much.
Le Borg.
Jocelyn.
Have you found something?
Come and have a look.
This is page 101.
Page 136.
Picked at random.
This is page 17 4.
Do you notice anything different about them?
17 4 seems a line or two shorter than the other two.
Look at the capital letters on this page.
They're set higher than these capitals on the others.
The type-face is the same so it was obviously done on this typewriter.
But not by the same typist.
Just because the caps are raised slightly?
That's not all.
On every other page, the semicolon is followed professionally by one space,...
But on this page, all three have no spaces after them.
Are you saying that somebody broke in, removed a page... and retyped it with alterations?
Exactly.
Adrian had reached the point of his arrival in Burma.
This page contains names that were obviously important to him.
Equally important one of those names has been deleted.
Now the question is, who did Adrian's typing?
-You might just remember.
-l know. An unforgettable name.
Gwendolynne La Doll.
With a ''YNNE''.
Mr. Pythian!
The man you're looking for.
I’ve seen him.
He was in Adrian's flat when l arrived.
You were alone with this murderer?
He couldn't be.
He was such a mousy little man.
He said his name's Pythian.
He said he lived in the flat below and he came to feed Adrian's cat.
-Where are you going?
-To find your Mr. Pythian.
You won't find him in this building. l think he got what he came for.
-Where are we going?
-Miss La Doll lives in Fulham Road.
Jocelyn, suppose you describe
Mr. Pythian? lf l can.
Below medium height. l seemed to tower over him.
Narrow little shoulders, narrow little head.
Sharp pointed chin.
That's the man who took our taxi.
-He was not the murderer.
-You seem very positive. l have seen the murderer. The clergyman who did not take the plane.
He was taller than Madame, with a square jaw, a broad face.
There're more than one person involved. It’s a conspiracy.
No, no.
Adrian was a writer.
He chose his words very carefully.
When he said,...
''nary a conspiracy'' he meant just that. Only one man involved.
One man who becomes many men.
Miss La Doll?
Gas.
She's gone.
Poor thing.
One hour lost.
A woman whose only offense was she made her living with a typewriter.
I’ve pressed the French gentleman's clothes, sir.
-Shall l awake him?
-No, let him sleep.
More than I’ve done.
That sofa has a wild spring. l wish you'd see it's attended to.
Yes, sir.
Come in, Pike.
-Any luck?
-Yes, sir. l ran down the military records of the names on Mr. Messenger's list,...
It gave us our common denominator.
Yes, l know, Burma.
-How did you know?.
-Get on with it.
Doesn't do us much good. No two of them were in the same regiment.
Just happened to be in the same theatre of war.
Hospital or a brothel?
Something will tie them together.
No. Messenger was never wounded. l don't quite see him in a brothel either.
-What about Q, R and S?
-Coming to them.
Quincy took vows, became Brother
Quintus, Order of Saint Betolph.
Crushed under the wheels of a hay lorry which rolled down a steep hill.
-Rouce?
-Disappeared about two years ago.
-Slattery?
-He's removed from Twickenham.
No forwarding address.
But we found him.
He's set up shop in Grinidge.
14 Canon's Lane.
Good man.
One out of 11.
The sole survivor,... and then there were none.
Unless he himself is the murderer.
Hey you!
Off it!
You don't like-a the music?
No. l never ''like-a'' the music and l don't like your ugly face neither.
Now off it before l change it for you.
The police say l can make-a the music in the street. l said off it!
-Yes, mister?
-Is Mr. Slattery about?
Not in.
Where do l find him?
It’s important.
What's it about?
Wring that guinea's neck, l will. l didn't know you was home, son.
Maybe I ain't.
What's this in aid of?. l want to ask you some questions about your war service.
I'd be proud to answer, sir.
Did my bit for King and Country.
Lost my barrel and keg to prove it.
Where was that?
Last seen, it was floating down the Rhine river.
No, l want to know about when you were in Burma.
Who says l was.
-Aren't you James Slattery?
-No, I’m his brother, Joe.
Well, it's James l want to see.
That will be difficult. Six foot under, he is. Ain't he, Ma?
How did he die?
Heart attack.
Keeled over like a canary.
But he did see service in Burma?
He had the soft end of it, he did.
Balmy tropic breezes while I’m freezing my tail in La Belle France.
He returned unscathed and look at me.
Not that I’m complaining.
Duty calls and Joe Slattery is the first to answer.
What was your regiment?
Fifth Wessex. Third Battalion,
B Company, Number One Platoon.
Lieutenant Petrie Commanding, till he caught a packet outside Antwerp.
Then Lieutenant Scott took over.
Did you brother ever talk about his experiences in Burma?
Jim? Talked about nothing. Spent his time working the football pools.
Did you ever hear mention of any of these names?
Braddock, l knew s Braddock once, first name Eric.
Come to think of it, it wasn't
Braddock at all. It was Craddock.
Anything else you'd like to know?.
Nothing. Thank you.
What's this all about?
We're forming the Society of
Veterans of the Burma Campaign.
Good evening.
As l so aptly said.
11 names and then there were none.
That makes it 100%.
-They looking for you, they are.
-Stop your nattering.
Call it nattering, all right.
But l say you've had it.
You tried the impossible and you got away with it.
But not no more. Now, l say run. run fast and far.
-How do you feel?
-Ashamed.
That l should oversleep. l am not the man l used to be.
The yeas have taken their toll.
Eight broken ribs and 11 hours in salt water maybe played a part.
In any case, you were spared a wild goose chase.
No progress?
All present on Messenger's list have been accounted for.
There are no survivors.
Now we're left with an undecipherable phrase, ''Only one brush left''.
What the devil did he mean?
Madam Jocelyn has returned to the country.
-She was here?
-She stopped by. l suggested she say nothing about yesterday. You approve? l do indeed.
''One brush left.''
-You have known here long?
-Yes, since she was a child.
-Her husband was a good man?
-Very good man.
-A son survives him?
-Yes, young Derek.
Perhaps l shall buy him a bicycle. l see.
Ajax is a bachelor.
Like Polidor.
A good reason I’m not married.
She preferred Derek's father.
He must have been a very good man.
But he's dead now, and you are alive.
Don't give it another thought. lf we were to meet now, for the first time, it might be a different matter.
But there's too much past for both of us. l have met here now for the first time.
My point exactly.
Let us return to the murderer.
Double gay and frisky for Jolly Joe Slattery!
Cheers.
Let's have another.
Forget about that.
Well, Jim?
Are you satisfied now?.
Jim?
''Don't you worry, Ma,'' you said.
''Jim Slattery knows what's what!''
What do you know now, Jim?
Why did he take his brother's place.
To draw Joe's disability pension, of course.
Jim was well and strong.
''What use is it to Joe?'' you said.
What us is it to you now, Jim?
He lied to me. It cost him his life.
It was the drink. l always knew there'd be an accident.
It was no accident.
Your son was murdered.
Maybe. He made enemies with his bragging and his bullying.
It was because that happened a long time ago in Burma. lf he'd been honest with me, he'd be alive now and I'd know the murderer.
He can't answer me now, Mrs.
Slattery, but you can.
-He was in Burma, wasn't he?
-Yes. He was in Burma.
To hear him talk you'd think he was the only one that suffered.
-Him and his prison camp.
-So that was it.
He suffered horrible.
Had the scars to prove it.
Did he ever talk about his experiences, mention any names?
No. Never talked about anyone but himself.
Not Jim.
Thank you, Mrs. Slattery. l should have never taken the guard off him.
Poor fool.
He only had himself to blame.
But we should be grateful to him.
He's given us the one real common denominator.
Now we need the names of next of kin of every person on the list.
You can tackle the first half.
LeBorg and l will start with General Pomfret's widow.
It’s Mr. Gethryn.
How do you do?
You telephoned, didn't you?
I’m Anton Karoudjian.
Very good of you to have us,
Mrs. Karoudjian.
The is Monsieur LeBorg. He was on the plane with Adrian Messenger.
Yes, poor fellow.
What a fearful way to die.
I’ve read Mr. Messenger's books.
One can only be enriched by the exposure to the clarity of his prose.
Tony, please be quiet. There's no need for you to impress Mr. Gethryn.
My husband served with Mr. Messenger.
My wife refers to her previous husband,...
Sir Francis Pomfret,
O.B.E, D.S.M., K.B.
He was twice mentioned in dispatches.
A brilliant officer! l didn't have the privilege of bearing arms.
During the war years,
Mr. Karoudjian was Swiss.
Tony, don't be such a coward!
What was it you wanted to know?.
Sir Francis and Adrian were in
Burma together, weren't they?
It was a special force was trained in India.
Later they went to Burma in '42.
It was a sort of junior edition of the Wingate later... and more important operation.
A very bad show!
What was that?
Most of them were killed and the rest were captured.
Including Adrian and your husband?
Yes. they had a ghastly time!
They were starved and tortured, and finally betrayed.
Betrayed?
How?.
Well, the escape was planned.
Francis said it would have gone through if it wasn't for a Canadian!
A sergeant. He sold them out for perks, tobacco, and things like that. l wonder if you'd happen to remember his name?
I’m most frightfully sorry, l must say that l don't.
In fact, l don't think
Francis ever mentioned it.
He always called him that bloody Canadian.
Except 'bloody' wasn't exactly the word he used, if you know what l mean.
Quite. Do you happen to know what happened to this nameless betrayer?
Yes. Francis checked that, all right.
'Missing, believed dead,
' was the report.
Francis was awfully upset. He so wanted to kill the chap himself.
Well, thank you so much. You've no idea how helpful you've been.
A little more champagne? l think now, thank you.
We must get back to London.
-Good day.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye, Madame.
-Good-bye, Monsieur.
Mr. Messenger was very well connected.
A great friend of the Bruttenholm's.
-The who?
-The Bruttenholm's.
It is the family name of the Marquis of Gleneyre. l have read it in the 'Tattler.'
-Brooms!
-What? lf you must bandy names, l do wish you'd learn to pronounce them!
''Bruttenholm. Broome.''
-But it is spelled...
-l don't care how it is spelled. l do wish you'd learn to speak English.
You mean you selected him as the villain of the piece?
It is inescapable.
Some unknown Canadian guilty of some vague act of treason,... in some vague and long forgotten operation in Burma.
You elect him as a mass murderer, yet don't know he survived the war!
-Balderdash!
-Quite, but still inescapable.
You've inverted the only murder motive in that set of circumstances.
Certainly men can nurse a loathing of a traitor, conspire to murder him.
But it's ridiculous to think he'd risk murdering the man he betrayed.
No use, Gethryn.
-Your theory just won't wash.
-Is it my turn now?.
Well, fire away.
You went off the scent with your assumption that... the only motive for betrayer killing the betrayed is fear of his own life. lf it isn't the only one, name a few more. l can't. No more than one, l mean.
Therefore, it must be the right one.
The motive is fear, of course.
And self preservation.
But it isn't fear of death.
What he wants to preserve isn't merely the capacity to breathe.
So what is it?
Can't be anything in the past because that's over.
Nor in the present, or he couldn't have afforded all the time he's taken.
Ergo, it must be something in the future.
-You do follow me, l hope?
-I’d be happy if you'd tell me where.
Into the veiled land of things to come!
What is it that the Canadian wants to protect so desperately?
Since he is guilty of treason, obviously his neck.
But only in the future... or he wouldn't have taken so long to kill those who could've ID'd him.
So, he must be sure he's going to come into some position... that will thrust him into the public eye!
Pike, what's been done about identifying this Canadian?
It’s all in hand, sir.
Seymour is at the War Office.
He's searching the records for every
Canadian that was in the operation.
Blessed if l can see what future position he could be concerned about.
It’s got to be something he's sure he's going to get.
Which brings us to the question of inheritance.
-Millions or a Dukedom?
-Or both, Sir Wilfred.
Pike, get on to the War Office and see what progress Seymour's making.
-LeBorg?
-Yes.
-What do you call this?
-"Balais".
Not in French.
In English.
A brush.
A brush for the floor.
Back we go into the cruel sea.
What the devil is all this about?
The final pieces begin to fall into shape. Bear with me.
-Ready?
-Now, is okay.
You've been in the sea a long time.
Most of Messenger's talk is finished, suddenly he says something like...
''Only one broom.''
No, this is not precise.
But now l remember.
He was saying,
''all the brooms clean sweep.''
''Only one broom left.''
Congratulations.
And heartfelt thanks.
This is better?
This broom means more than brush?
It means everything.
Broome is the family name of the Marquis of Gleneyre.
Gleneyre?
But that is Jocelyn's family.
-Quite.
-Seymour is back.
There's information, sir.
The only Canadian sergeant in the operation.
Sergeant George Brougham,
Duke of Athone's Light Infantry...
Missing, believed dead.
''Had a brother went to America once.
Canada, actually. Suppose he's dead by now. Almost everyone is.''
-l beg your pardon.
-Just remember what the Marquis said.
Gleneyre! That's motive enough for a dozen murders.
107, to be exact. if you include airplane and train wreck victims.
-Now the old Marquis has his neck...
-l shouldn't think he was in danger.
But this chap can't inherit until...
No, but he can afford to wait for an 84-year-old man to die naturally.
It’s the real heir who's in danger.
The boy, of course?
Come on!
Come on!
-l say, you startled me.
-l want to see the young lord.
-I’m Derek Bruttenholm.
-Then she's for you.
-For me?
-A present from Adrian Messenger.
Adrian?
He's dead.
It’s from him all the same.
Come on, lad, get up on it.
Just grab a handful of mane.
You don't need reins with Avatar.
She's gypsy-trained.
Come on.
Get up on it.
Your knees will turn her, and your voice will make her stop and go.
Now, remember this.
Jatogree means go.
And to hold hard say "Til droven".
''Jatogree''.
Come back here.
Master Derek!
Master Derek!
Thank heaven you've arrived.
We were beginning to despair.
Father this is Monsieur LeBorg.
This is my father-in-law.
-Thanks for that business with Adrian.
-Nothing at all.
How's that hallo-ing?
Milord!
-What is it?
-Master Derek, sir.
A gypsy man just put him up on a mare.
-A gypsy? Where is he?
-He's in the stable yard, sir.
-Why didn't you stop him?
-Derek! Where are you?
Go, Avatar!
Til droven.
Derek, are you all right?
Look what Adrian gave me.
Isn't she a beauty? Her name's
Avatar and she moves on command.
Derek, what are you talking about.
You know that Adrian's gone. lf you don't want the mare,
I’ll take her away.
-I’ve done my part.
-We want her, all right.
She took the stable fence with two feel of daylight beneath her.
-You didn't jump in this fog.
-No, she jumped me.
-I’ve never ridden such an animal.
-Damn odd, this whole business.
Adrian just buried, and this gypsy fellow appearing with a...
-When did Mr. Messenger buy her?
-A year and a day past. l was to deliver her as soon as she was gentle and trained.
It’s all right, father. Adrian and the gypsies were friends.
Remember he wrote ''Romany ways''?
You can believe what he says.
Four-year-old. Good bone.
Damn fine animal.
Hard to fault.
Well, here's a fiver for your...
You hunt, LeBorg?
Alas, the horse and l are not compatible.
Shoot, eh?
The birds don't attack me, l don't attack them.
-Fish?
-Why?
All the fish one wants are available in the market.
What do you do?
-He swims.
-Not by choice, Madame.
The rest are mine, l think.
-By George, you're right.
-That makes you down three. l am also a superb tennis player and l have a two handicap at golf.
Good game, l hear.
Never played, myself. l have an apartment in Paris,
Avenue Foch.
And a small chateau in the Auvergne.
My dear fellow, you don't have to give me an accounting.
You are the head of the family, no?
Well, yes... l suppose l am.
Well to continue, my business is in textile.
Factories in France and Switzerland.
My income is not large, but adequate.
About half a million new francs.
That is 36,000 of your pounds.
For the rest, l am 43, in sound health,... except for some painful ribs, and l have been in jail only once.
That was by the Germans.
Your bid, Madame. l pass.
Good morning.
Lovely day.
These are all members of the hunt?
No, there are always visitors.
Anyone can ride, you know, if they pay the fee.
-Good morning,...
-lf you don't mind, please...
-Here.
-Thank you, good hunting.
Thank you very much, sir.
Morning, mother. Morning, sir.
Sorry you're not riding with us. l myself am delighted.
I’ve had all the broken ribs l care for.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, boy!
Where the devil did you come from? l just followed the hounds, master.
You certainly deserve this.
First time I’ve been beaten to the kill in 40 years as Master.
Thank you.
-What did you say your name was?
-l didn't, but it's Brougham.
We spell it differently to you, but it's still Broome, Uncle.
Bless my soul.
Are you my brother's whelp?
George is my name.
Why the devil didn't you introduce yourself?. l thought I’d size you up first.
That settles it, you are a Brougham, no matter how you misspell it.
Derek, come over here.
Here's a new cousin for you. l suppose that's what you'd be.
Canadian branch of the family.
-How do you do, sir?
-Hello, Derek.
Come over here and meet his mother.
Jocelyn, my dear.
This is my brother Louie's son.
-How do you do, Lady Bruttenholm.
-Didn't know he existed till now.
Extraordinary.
-Welcome to Gleneyre.
-Thank you.
This is Monsieur LeBorg.
-Delighted.
-Delighted as well.
-Where do you stay?
-At the Lion, very comfortable.
Poppycock!
Derek, sent someone to pack his things. He'll stay at Gleneyre.
-You really mustn't bother.
-Rubbish, it's your home.
Gethryn, come over here.
George Brougham,
Anthony Gethryn.
-How do you do.
-How do you do.
You chaps should like each other.
Both thrusters.
-Got left standing still today.
-High Flyer gave me quite a ride.
-Fine animal. Where did you get him?
-Ireland, about three weeks ago.
A birthday present from me to me.
Plenty of foot. Big jumper.
Well, the sun's still high.
Time to draw another covert.
Come in.
Come in.
-l don't intrude?
-Not in the slightest. Do come in.
So, the masquerade is over.
No need for disguises now. That ended when the last name was erased.
All he's got to do now is be his own charming self.
What arrogance!
Making himself welcome at Gleneyre.
Makes it easier for himself to get at the boy, from the inside. l hate to admit it, but l confess a sneaking admiration for him.
My admiration l can restrain.
What is the next move?
That is up to him, unfortunately. l leave you gentlemen to your port.
What do you do for a living out there, George?
-l ranch, sir.
-Are there cowboys?
It wouldn't be a ranch without them.
How much...
How much land do you have?
Just under 20,000 acres, sir.
But I’m hoping to get another 8,
000 before next year.
That's not so much, if you figure 10 acres to a steer.
What kind of cattle do you raise?
Whiteface, sir.
Beef cattle,...
I’m starting a Black Angus herd. l hope to pick up a bull while I’m here.
We'll ride over to the bull pens in the morning. You can take your pick.
Thanks, but your breeding might be too rich for my blood.
-What do you mean by that?
-Well,... No thank you.
It might be more than l can afford to pay.
My cattle, ain't they. l can sell them for whatever l please.
Damn government still can't do anything about that.
By the way, is my brother still alive?
No, sir.
My father died a long time ago.
Was that back in '37? February?
That's right. The 16th.
How did you know that?
-The foxes barked.
-l beg your pardon?
Didn't your father ever tell you about the Bruttenholm foxes, boy?
Any member of the family dies, they foregather on the lawn out there... and bark. Been doing it for 200 years. Damn eerie.
I’m sorry about your father. l liked Louie.
Well, if you want me to fill you in on him,... he lost the 60,000 you gave him on a three day poker session... on the train between Halifax and Moose Jaw.
Moose Jaw?.
Yes, where he became a cowboy and wed the boss's daughter, my mother.
-That's were l got the ranch.
-How did your father die?
On his way home from
Saskatoon he fell out of the wagon,...
-Wolves got at him.
-Bless my soul. l spent the rest of that winter trailing the pack,...
One by one l shot them and skinned them up.
Traded their pelts to the
Indians for enough food to go on,... until the last wolf was accounted for.
Indians?
Red Indians?
Yes.
They later adopted me into the tribe.
So you can say that you are a blood cousin to an Ojibwa.
Were you in the service?
Well nothing so exorbitant as your father.
Sergeant was my top rank.
-Did you see action?
-Did l see action? l was killed.
-You can't be serious.
-Sounds like an interesting story.
Not really. l got separated from my outfit in the Western Desert,...
Three years before l got back to Canada.
When l went for my discharge, they had me listed as 'believed dead'.
They hated having to correct their records.
Red tape. Same all over the world.
-By the way, sir.
-Out with it, my boy.
About that bull.
Thanks for the fine offer. But if l can't afford it, that ends it.
-l didn't arrive with my hand out.
-l know you didn't.
-Monsieur Le Borg.
-Please.
Now I’ve got it. l thought your name was familiar.
Aren't you the man who survived that airplane crash? l had great good fortune.
One chance in a million.
Another cousin of mine,
Adrian Messenger wasn't so lucky.
Yes, the writer.
I’ve read everything he wrote.
In a sense, he's responsible for my being here.
It was his ''Memoirs of a fox hunt''.
-Have you read it?
-Yes, sir.
It opened up a whole new world for me.
According to the papers, there's a possibility the crash was no accident.
There was a bomb. It had to have been put there by a mad-man.
That's the excuse they usually give for evil.
Hitler was mad they said.
So he may have been, but not necessarily.
Evil does exist. Evil is.
Go ahead, Derek. You shoot first.
One diamond.
Heart.
Pass.
-Four of spades.
-Pass.
-Pass.
-Pass.
Spades.
-Brougham?
-Yes?
-Are you busy?
-Nothing important, going for a walk.
-Come in for a moment, would you?
-Sure.
-Sit down, please.
-Thank you.
Over here.
Something l want you to look at.
What are there?
Pages that Messenger was working on from his manuscript when he died.
Wonderful. Just finished reading it.
''Memoirs of an Infantry Officer.''
-I’d love to read it.
-You notice anything different?
This one is shorter, a line or two less typing.
There's no reason for it. And it isn't the end of a paragraph.
That's what struck me, too.
The typist probably just made a mistake.
That isn't all. Look here.
On every other page, a semicolon is followed, as it should, by one space.
But on this page there are none.
What difference can that possibly make?
Perhaps none, perhaps a great deal.
The typeface is the same so it was done on the same typewriter.
But this means it was typed by different hands.
Well Messenger himself probably wanted to change something so he...
He didn't know how to type. l don't mean to be dense, but what does it matter if a page gets changed.
Wouldn't mean anything to me. lf LeBorg hadn't insisted he smelled cordite when the plane fell.
-Cordite.
-It would mean a bomb.
And a bomb would mean a target.
I’m wondering if it could be Messenger.
What the devil are you talking about?
Who'd want to kill a writer?
-Such a good writer.
-l don't know.
But the page and it's variations had to do with his experiences in Burma.
He had a rough go there.
Prison camp. That sort of thing.
I’m going to turn this over to the
Yard. See what they can make of it.
Shouldn't be difficult for them to get a list of those with him.
One of them might shed some light.
-What's the matter?
-You've got more nerve than me.
-Why?
-l can't see myself going police... with anything like that, they'd laugh in my face.
Possibly. But I’ll take a shot, when l get out of town on Wednesday.
-Can't thank you enough for your help.
-l haven't done anything.
Yes you have. You've given me a chance to put my ideas into words.
-Like a dress rehearsal.
-lf you want a listener, I’m your man.
For once, he spoke the truth.
Evil does exist.
And he is evil.
As the Holy Word says, ''Born of evil.''
And now you have made yourself the target.
He can't afford to have me go and ask a lot of questions about Burma.
Have you learned any more about him?
Pike phoned through.
His dossier came from Canada.
After the war, he became an actor, touring in the western provinces.
Five years ago, his mother died and he inherited a ranch.
A few hundred acres, which he promptly sold for $40,000... which has carried him up to this very moment.
He will move swiftly now.
-Mr. George Brougham please.
-Sorry, sir, he's gone for a walk.
-Any message?
-Yes, Arthur Henderson, his attorney.
Mr. Arthur Henderson calling.
I’m at the Ritz tonight. l must see him. Very important ranch business.
At the Ritz. I’ll leave a message, sir. Thank you.
No, that won't do any good. l must see him personally.
Get some papers signed.
He must come into town. I’m leaving for home in the morning.
Thanks a lot.
You'll hurry back, of course.
You'll miss tomorrow's hunt, but there'll be another one Saturday.
I’ll be here. l wouldn't miss it for the world.
-Gethryn, how do you like High Flyer?
-Enough to let you name his price.
Not for sale. But if you want a good ride, use him tomorrow.
-That's very good.
-See that he stays in front.
I’ll keep my eye on him. l promise to be on top of the hunt.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye, George.
Look to your hearts!
What has the fox ever done to you? l protest this cruel and inhumane activity.
Search your souls! Don't you know the animals are your friends?
-Are you the Master?
-l am.
Then call off this wretched business.
What harm has the fox done to you?
Why do you persecute him?
The fox and l know more of life than you do.
It is man's nature to hunt.
It is the fox's to be hunted.
Good morning, Madame.
Propaganda. Vicious propaganda!
Read what Oscar Wilde says,
''The unspeakable after the uneatable.''
That's what these so-called gentry are... the unspeakable!
Can she be the murderer?
Any one of them can be.
Which?
The fox you kill may be a vixen!
And any vixen can be a mother.
Think of those motherless vermin.
Which?
-l didn't see the fox.
-One usually doesn't.
The hounds follow the fox's scent.
Avatar's going well, Derek, eh?
Damn it, Gethryn, keep your distance.
Where the devil do you think you're going?
I’m going ahead, Master!
-Behind. Or I’ll send you home.
-Sorry, Master.
-What's happened?
-What's wrong with the hounds?
Jim!
Good man.
-Good dog.
-Queer. The scent was so good.
-The fox go in the ground?
-No fox.
We've been following a drag.
A drag?
In Gleneyre?
Unheard of. l would ruin the hunt's reputation.
What the devil do you mean, master.
Homicide, Lord Ashton.
Well conceived, too.
There is the murder weapon. l was supposed to be impaled upon it. l would have been too. lf it wasn't for this old fellow.
Jim and l took him out this morning before dawn on a leash.
He picked up the scent and pulled Jim over the very ground we covered.
Come on, Bellman, here.
The oldest detective of them all.
He'll pick up the scent of whoever laid the drag.
All right, George, come forward.
Get that ferocious beast away from me.
Stop him, young fellow!
Hold, Avatar!
''Til droven''!
Derek! Tim!
Let's get hounds back to kennels.
Jim, see to Mr. Brougham.
Listen, Grandfather.
It’s the Bruttenholm foxes!
Extraordinary. l thought the next time they barked, it would be for me.
Hold it. Stop.
That's the end of the picture.
But it's not the end of the mystery.
Ladies and gentlemen, the end.
Vtg
What's all this here?
You may choose, members of the jury...
...to believe the prisoner...
...that, returning from a walk...
...he found the hanging Mrs. McGinty...
...and was about to release the rope...
...when Police Constable Wells...
...appeared on the scene.
On the other hand...
...you may think the accused intended to cover...
...manual strangulation...
...of Mrs. McGinty...
...for motives of greed...
...with clumsy attempts to make his mean crime...
...appear to be suicide.
Madam...
...either you will have to cease knitting...
...or I will have to cease judging.
Which shall it be?
It helps me to concentrate, milord.
It does not help me, madam.
Very well.
Thank you, madam.
Yes.
If what I have just said is the truth of the matter...
...then the prisoner was delayed in the execution...
...of his evil subterfuge...
...by the desperate fight of his victim.
Those scattered banknotes...
...that pathetic crushed rose...
...torn from her breast.
He was delayed, I say...
...long enough for the timely intervention...
...of the alert Police Constable Wells.
Summing up for a conviction, inspector.
- You may further think that the accused...
- Stand you a beer afterwards, Wells.
- Thank you, inspector.
...had every opportunity of knowing...
...the unfortunate widow kept her life savings there...
...instead of in the bank...
...and that Harold Taylor was bent on...
...securing her meager fortune.
If the facts as presented to you...
...admit of any reasonable doubt...
...then the accused is entitled to the benefit of that doubt.
But, members of the jury...
...if you have been convinced by the evidence...
...beyond all reasonable doubt...
...that the accused committed this heinous crime...
...then it is your solemn duty...
...to return a verdict of guilty.
You will retire...
...and consider your verdict.
Might just have time for that quick beer before they come back, Wells.
There's absolutely no doubt in my mind he's guilty.
He was caught red-handed by the policeman.
Prisoner at the bar, have you anything to say before l...?
Not yet, milord.
The jury is still out.
Surely the time is more appropriate...
...for a very dry martini, Johnson.
Very good, milord.
- Not more tea?
- No. They're coming back.
Members of the jury...
...are you agreed upon your verdict?
No, sir.
What did you say?
We're not able to reach an agreement, milord.
Silence. I will not have my court...
...turned into a bear garden.
I suggest you retire for a further period.
I'm afraid it would be a waste of time, milord.
I see.
Very well.
There will be a retrial at a later date.
Jury dismissed.
If ever there was an open-and-shut case, this was it.
One member of that jury was being deliberately perverse.
Many more than one, inspector,
I assure you.
Eleven, to be precise.
That woman's made a mockery of my one and only murder.
No, no, no, Mr. Swanbridge.
You mustn't turn your back on the audience.
I want them to see the look of surprise on your face.
Allow me.
Just once more, Miss Rusty, please.
Right.
Our lady president.
Carry on, please.
Try again.
And do please try harder,
Mr. Swanbridge.
My arm's getting awfully tired.
A little rough at the moment,
Miss Marple. But I'm confident...
...it'll be all right on the night.
- Of course.
- Tea?
- No, thank you.
- Well, you found him guilty, of course?
- They did.
I did not.
But, Miss Marple, surely...
You recall our production in aid of the church organ renovation fund...
... The Lodger's Dilemma?
- Unforgettable.
Well, you'll remember, Mr. Stringer, that the victim in that play...
...wore a rose to receive her paramour.
He murdered her, the lodger was blamed.
Exactly. Mrs. McGinty wore a rose...
...on the fatal night.
Would it have been to receive her lodger...
...when we have no evidence of any dalliance between them?
Oh, I hardly think so.
Then she wore it for someone else.
- Her murderer, you think?
- I do.
Excuse me, Mr. Stringer...
...I'm sorry, but he still keeps turning away. What can I do?
We'll have to recast him.
I know. Ask the vicar if he'll be kind enough to have a try.
Yes.
Miss Marple, if what you say is so...
...then an innocent man's life may be at stake. What can be done?
Well, we can begin by inquiring rather more closely into the private life...
...of Mrs. McGinty than the police have seen fit to do.
Yes, but how?
By returning to the scene of the crime, as it were.
Oh, very good, vicar.
Excellent. Excellent!
Mr. Stringer.
If our plan works, you're sure you know your part?
Oh, yes. I think so.
Down. Down. You may be observed.
- Yes?
- I'm collecting...
No.
I'm collecting jumble for the church bazaar.
You're a Christian, surely?
I should hope so.
- Well, then.
- Oh, well, if it's jumble for the church...
...there's plenty here. Come in.
- Oh, thank you.
Got all her stuff here, you know.
You've heard of my sister, of course.
Yes, the poor lady.
I always thought she'd come to a bad end.
One of those theatricals, you know.
Really? I thought she was a barmaid.
Oh, yes, but she used to be on the stage.
Did it in there, you know, with his bare hands.
Gloved ones.
Well, it comes to the same thing in the end. This way.
She was always sticking her neck out, that one.
She did leave you her cottage, I believe?
Didn't have time to arrange her will, did she?
No, it would seem not.
Still, I mustn't decry her. My own sister.
Blood's thicker than water, I suppose.
Here's all her stuff. Nothing of value.
Probably got it from a jumble sale herself.
She used to swear these rat-tails was mink.
And look at this coat.
I wouldn't be seen dead in it.
Can't imagine why she dressed in these rags when she had all that money.
A real little slut she was.
I remember when she was a kid, always wanted to be an actress.
An actress, I ask you.
Mean she was, you know, me...
A little touch of rheumatism.
I find this beneficial.
- Really?
- Yes.
You should try rubbing linseed into the joints. Makes a new woman of me.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you very much.
That'll be the insurance man.
Paying out, you know.
They don't like it when the unforeseen does occur.
Persistence, Mr. Stringer, persistence.
Foot in door.
Well, I hope you've brought it in cash.
- Brought what, madam?
- Oh, come on, come on, now.
I don't want the same trouble as when my John passed away.
- I don't understand.
- Well, you are from the insurance...
...aren't you?
- Oh, no, madam. No.
I was hoping to interest you in improving your mind.
I was wondering if you'd allow me to show you...
...the new Wonder Book.
Do.
Come in, Mr... Come in.
Murder She Said, Murder She Said...
... Murder She Said.
And as you can see, the section on our feathered friends is most comprehensive.
Everything from an albatross to a shrike.
- A what?
- A shrike.
So named for its incessant chatter and predatory instincts.
It has a habit of impaling its prey.
How interesting.
Look, I've got an old woman upstairs.
I'll just get rid of her.
- And then we'll have a cup of tea.
- Please don't, I can't trespass...
...on your generosity like that.
Oh, dear. Poor Mr. Stringer.
Fancy me mistaking you for the insurance man.
- You're much too nice.
- Really?
Well, of course you are.
Now I come to think of it, you don't...
...really look like a salesman, do you?
- Don't I?
No. So you're a bachelor, Mr. Stringer?
- Yes.
- Oh, I can always tell.
And I'm a widow.
I'd never have believed it.
- How do you do?
- Oh, I see you've got what you wanted.
Yes, thank you. Perhaps the gentleman would care to help me...
...with these into the trap.
- Oh, yes, indeed.
- Thank you.
- I'll leave you the book, Mrs. Thomas.
Brood on it, will you. Brood on it.
What about the tea?
Good day, Mrs. Thomas.
So you're a bachelor, Mr. Stringer.
- Not staying to tea?
- Oh, no, Miss Marple.
Dear me, the lady will be disappointed.
Up.
Miss Marple, I do assure you,
I gave that woman no encouragement.
It's of small importance, Mr. Stringer.
Good heavens, I've got it. Jim!
Look, there's the page of the Milchester Gazette...
...I took from Mrs. McGinty's room.
Here's the identical page I obtained from the newspaper offices.
I've snipped out the same words and letters...
...and produced this.
A rose.
A rose.
Milchester 862, please.
Is that Lady Cynthia Waterhouse?
Lady who?
No, this is Mrs. Gladys Thomas.
Oh, I'm so sorry, I appear to have the wrong number.
As I thought, 862 is the telephone number...
...of Mrs. McGinty's cottage.
- I'm afraid I'm at a loss.
- Don't you see...
...this type of message is typical of a certain kind of criminal.
- The blackmailer.
- Who?
Yes, I think Mrs. McGinty may have been one.
- Dear me.
- Well, consider...
...the Cosgood Players gave six performances...
...of Murder She Said here in Milchester...
...in the week of May 12th to 19th...
...the same week, incidentally, as this issue of the Gazette.
And here we have six programs.
Mrs. McGinty appears to have attended each performance.
- Why?
- It's an excellent play, Miss Marple.
True. But I believe that her interest was not primarily in the play...
...former actress though she may have been.
No, I am convinced she was a blackmailer...
...and that it was a member of this company whom she was blackmailing.
- Her murderer, you suppose?
- I do.
Now, I think we deserve a small beer.
Yes, please.
It's you, inspector.
You gave me quite a turn.
You gave me quite a turn, Miss Marple.
- May I come in?
- Well...
Yes.
It's Inspector Craddock, Mr. Stringer.
How nice. Good evening, inspector.
- Good evening.
- Are you here socially...
...or officially, inspector?
Well, a little of both, shall we say.
That poses an interesting problem.
Socially, I can offer you a small beer.
Officially, I cannot, if you're on duty.
I...
All right, Miss Marple. It's official.
Then perhaps some tea.
Won't you sit down.
Thank you, no. This won't take long.
We were playing anagrams, inspector.
Miss Marple, Police Constable Wells informs me that he observed you...
...this afternoon, pay a call at the cottage of the late Mrs. McGinty.
Furthermore, you were apparently impersonating a rag-and-bone dealer.
I certainly was not.
I was collecting jumble for the church bazaar.
- Is that so?
- Well, if you don't believe me...
...I suggest you ring the vicar.
Now.
Now, look here, Miss Marple.
In the past you've been of some help to the police...
...and we're grateful, naturally.
But at yesterday's trial, you misguidedly...
...interfered with the course of justice.
I'd feel a lot easier in my mind, and so would the chief constable...
...if you would promise me here and now not to continue to do so.
You can have that promise freely, inspector.
I have no intention whatever...
...of interfering with the course of justice.
Yes.
Well, good.
- There's no more to be said, then.
- No.
Well, I'll say good night, then.
Good night.
Yes.
Perhaps we should have confided our suspicions.
Certainly not.
That man has just thrown down the gauntlet.
You know what the police are.
The month of September 1951.
This reference to a rose.
These things must have a great significance...
...for our man or woman.
I suppose so.
The difficulty is, the Cosgood Players have moved on.
I did read they were at the Palace Theater...
...over at Halford.
- Oh, yes.
There is no doubt in my mind...
...that one of these play actors is a murderer.
If you're convinced of your theory, Miss Marple...
...I suppose we should, in some way, well, act.
Act.
Of course. Why not?
That's what I must do.
After all, nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Take our bags to the YMCA, Jim.
If I'm successful,
I'll collect mine from you later.
I really think I ought to wait,
Miss Marple.
No, no, this may take some time.
Au revoir.
All I know is that we had over L300, and now we've got nothing.
- Where's it gone? It's a simple question.
- For simple-minded people.
And that's mine.
What's the use?
Thank you.
Oh, Daddy's very democratic, George.
He doesn't mind who I marry.
- You could've put that better.
- If he's not asking for a pedigree...
...you're sitting pretty, eh, Bill?
- You could have put that a bit better too.
I was looking for Mr. Cosgood.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Really? I wonder where that could have been.
- I'm not sure.
- Probably in another dimension.
Don't take any notice of her.
She's our resident weirdie.
No, it was in a dream.
She and you, George.
Something to do with death.
Please, Eva. Can I help you?
Well, I have an appointment with Mr. Cosgood.
He's probably messing about on the stage somewhere. It's over there.
Oh, yes, thank you.
I'll find him, young man.
Mr. Cosgood.
Mr. Cosgood.
Mr. Co...
Are you Jane Marble?
Marple, if you please.
- Very well, get on with it.
- It?
I have a performance in half an hour, madam.
Whatever you have chosen to do for me, do.
And throw your voice to the back of the theater. I want to hear every word.
I can't catch what you say.
I want to hear every word.
Oh, very well.
"The Shooting of Dan McGrew"...
...by Mr. Robert W. Service.
A bunch of the boys
were whooping it up
In the Malamute Saloon
The kid that handles the music box
Was hitting a jag-time tune
And back of the bar
In a solo game
Sat Dangerous Dan McGrew
And watching his luck
was his light-o '-love
The lady that's known as Lou.
When out of the night...
When out of the night that was 50
below And into the din and the glare
There stumbled a miner
fresh from the creeks
Dog dirty, and loaded for bear
Just give me the gist and get to the climax.
Oh, dear me, that's very difficult.
It's a long poem, and there's a great deal behind it.
However, as you wish.
Well, now, soon after the stranger...
...has entered this lurid scene...
...it becomes increasingly evident...
...that there is a growing antagonism between him and Mr. McGrew.
An antagonism which is to end in stark tragedy.
Shall I pick it up at the point when the miner...
...seated at the saloon piano, is playing like a maniac?
Yes, yes, please do.
Thank you.
Then the stranger turned
And his eyes they burned
in a most peculiar way
In a buckskin shirt
that was glazed with dirt
He sat and I saw him sway
Then his lips went thin
in a kind of grin
And he spoke, and his voice was calm
And, "Boys, " says he, "you don 't know
me and none of you care a darn..."
Yes, yes, yes, but get to the point, please.
"But I want to state,
and my words are straight
And I'll bet my poke they're true
That one of you is a hound of hell
And that one is Dan McGrew."
Then I ducked my head,
and the lights went out
And two guns blazed in the dark
And a woman screamed
and the lights went up
And two men lay stiff and stark.
Pitched on his head,
and pumped full of lead
Was Dangerous Dan McGrew
While the man from the creeks
lay clutched to the breast
Of the lady that's known as Lou.
I'm not as wise as the lawyer guys
But strictly between us two
The woman who kissed him
and pinched his poke
Was the lady that's known as Lou.
Are you still there?
You were joking, of course.
Joking? Indeed, I was not.
Then I am not joking when
I tell you that if you persist...
...in this ridiculous notion of joining our profession...
...your wisest course is to register at once...
...for unemployment pay.
That will not be necessary.
I am of independent means.
Dear lady, you didn't let me finish.
You made your view quite clear.
No, no, no. I was about to point out that your performance had merit. Great merit.
Your choice of material let you down.
Yes, definitely duchess parts.
Regal roles.
I see you with other material performing like an angel.
Angel?
Is not that the term for a backer of theatrical enterprises?
Droll, very droll.
No, I simply meant you have a lot to offer the theater, Mrs. Marble.
- Miss Marple.
- I'm delighted to hear that.
In our profession, the marital knot is so often the bolt on the door...
...to the room at the top.
Do I take it, then, that you are offering me employment, Mr. Cosgood?
Well, as to that, not exactly employment.
I was thinking rather along the lines...
...of an apprenticeship.
- Unpaid?
Well, in a word, yes.
- I accept.
- Splendid. Splendid.
- Welcome to the Cosgood Players.
- Thank you.
Well, now, as to lodgings...
...I prefer to live, as it were...
...cheek by jowl with my colleagues.
- Naturally. Naturally.
We're at Westward Ho, Prescott Street.
Mrs. Harris, excellent landlady, very clean.
Good. Well, I'll just pick up my baggage at the YMCA.
Au revoir.
- Cosgood.
- Drunk again.
Now, look here, George.
This man is not drunk, Mr. Cosgood.
He's dead.
Poisoned.
Poisoned?
Poisoned.
Arsenic, I'd say.
The autopsy will prove it.
Nonsense. George drank too much.
- It's as plain as the nose on his face.
- Now, sir, you say you were...
...on-stage when he came from the direction of the dressing rooms?
Yes. Inspector, the curtain is due up in
10 minutes, and you must appreciate...
...I now have two roles to play.
- There'll be no curtain up today, sir.
But my audience.
They'll tear the place apart.
We'll risk that, sir.
I've got quite a few questions.
- Questions? What about?
- A man is dead, sir. It's usual.
- And damned inconvenient.
- Yes, sir.
Now, which was his dressing room, sir?
Number two. Look, inspector, can't you get George...
...off the stage and come back later?
- No, sir. Number two, you said, sir?
I knew something was going to happen.
Really, miss?
Yes, I have premonitions about these things.
I've always been like that.
That's very interesting.
Well, I told George...
...as soon as I saw that strange woman.
- What strange woman?
- The one who came to see Driffold.
- Driffold?
- Driffold Cosgood, inspector. Me.
- All right, sir, what about her?
- Her?
- This strange woman, sir.
- Oh, her!
I'd just auditioned her when George interrupted.
- Is the lady here now, sir?
- I expect so.
She'll be about somewhere.
Oh, she seems to have gone.
Get a name and description, sergeant.
Now, sir, any idea what this lady's name is?
I've seen this somewhere before.
Not that one, inspector.
This one.
Miss Marple! I distinctly asked you not to interfere.
- Inspector, that strange woman, it's...
- Yes.
Miss Marple. Allow me.
Sergeant, would you escort her to headquarters.
And see that she makes a complete statement. I'll get around to her later.
After you, sergeant.
Sergeant, you're sure you didn't mishear any of what Miss Marple said?
I did not, sir.
No. Well, will you come in, please,
Miss Marple.
Certainly.
Almost a draw, sergeant.
- Well, please, sit down.
- Thank you.
All right, Miss Marple...
...let us suppose, just suppose, that Mrs. McGinty...
...was blackmailing one of those actors.
And let us suppose that this was the actual blackmail note she sent.
By all means, inspector.
Right. Now, as it was lying beside the whiskey bottle...
...in George Rowton's dressing room, she must have sent it to him.
That does spring to mind.
- So that she was blackmailing him.
- It would appear so.
Now, if there's anything at all in what you say, he murdered her.
On the face of it, yes.
So are we to suppose that today...
...in a rather belated fit of remorse, he poisoned himself?
- Perhaps.
- Are we to suppose that someone else...
...poisoned him for some reason?
Again, perhaps.
Inspector...
...may I ask you a question?
- Please do.
- If you had simply found that note...
...in the victim's dressing room and knew no more about it than that...
...what would you have made of the affair?
Well, I suppose I'd have thought the man was being blackmailed...
...and had decided to end it all.
Yes, that's what I thought you'd have thought.
It could be the note was left there deliberately...
...so that you would think that.
Miss Marple, it's been a long, hard day already.
- What are you suggesting now?
- I am suggesting that the murderer...
...of Mrs. McGinty and the murderer of George Rowton...
...are one and the same.
As to who murdered George Rowton,
I don't yet know.
But I will.
As to who murdered
Mrs. McGinty, I do know.
He is at present being held in
Milchester jail...
...awaiting a retrial necessitated by the stubbornness...
...of a certain member of the jury.
And he killed her for her money.
Yes, that L100...
...that was found by her body.
Doesn't it occur to you, inspector...
...that that wasn't
Mrs. McGinty's savings at all...
...but her payoff?
Are you trying to make me believe that whoever she was blackmailing...
...brought the money, killed her and then, hearing the lodger come in, left in panic?
- No.
- Well, then, what?
I am proposing that, like the note...
...the money was left behind deliberately.
What for?
Obviously so that the police would leap to the conclusion...
...they have leapt to.
- Now, look here, Miss Marple...
- If I were you, inspector...
...I would at least examine the bank accounts of these people...
...to see if one of them happened to withdraw L100...
...either on or about the time of Mrs. McGinty's death.
I will, of course, investigate your theories.
In the meantime,
I'd be very much obliged...
...if you would go home to Milchester.
I'm afraid that is out of the question, inspector.
My work will keep me here indefinitely.
- Your work?
- I have accepted an engagement...
...with the Cosgood Players.
And a Marple's word is her bond.
Good day.
"Actor, playwright, impresario...
...man of many talents."
- Might have used a better photo.
- You should worry. It says here I'm 48.
Listen to this:
"Lady Sheila, stage-struck adopted daughter of Lord Upward...
...and bride-to-be of juvenile lead Bill Hanson, said..."
And I quote the quote:
"This will make no difference to our wedding plans.
Daddy's very democratic."
Bully for Daddy, eh, Bill?
Arthur, you're an absolute stinker.
Why don't you crawl back under your stone.
Well, well, it's all good stuff.
Absolutely no rubbish.
A little notoriety always helps the box office.
Too true.
Have you read this about you, Ralph?
"Ralph Summers, matinee idol of Mother's Day.
Now an aging, overweight barmaid fancier."
Let me see that.
You're a nasty little joker, aren't you?
I think that's very funny.
- And so true.
- A nice wifely thing to say.
Well, your taste does rather run to barmaids, doesn't it, darling?
There was that one at Milchester.
- You remember the one...
- Shut up, Maureen.
- Yes, Mrs. Harris?
- Your new one's here.
Dear lady, I was beginning to fear we had created...
...an unfortunate impression on you, in view of today's accident.
Oh, no, indeed. I had a little business to attend to.
Well, you're here. You're here.
Boys and girls, meet Miss Marple.
Miss Marple, the company.
- Hello.
- How do you do, everyone?
There's cocoa on the tray.
If you want the beer, it's extra.
- Yes, of course, a nightcap. Do sit down.
- Thank you.
Name your poison, dear lady.
I mean...
Oh, cocoa, please, Mr. Cosgood.
An excellent brew. I can recommend it.
By the way, the...
...police are looking for you.
- Oh, yes.
I have spoken with them.
- You have? Good.
- Thank you.
I was thinking, Driffold.
Why don't we revive A Kind of Murder...
...as a sort of tribute to George.
Well, I mean, Miss Marple,
Dorothy here...
...perfect for the two scheming sisters.
- I couldn't possibly play a murderess.
- Couldn't you?
Well, one of us could.
He or she's had practice.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Well, let's face it, Bill, old man.
Someone slipped a noxious dose into old George's whiskey.
And that someone is in this room.
- You're ridiculous.
- No, no, no, I'm not having this...
...in front of a new colleague, too.
There's no question of George having...
...been murdered by a member of my company.
The whole thing is obviously some kind of...
...ghastly mistake.
No, you're wrong.
One of us is a murderer.
And you feel that too, don't you?
Well, my dear, it's hardly for me to say, is it?
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Bill.
Stop talking about it.
I can't stand it any longer.
You know, don't you?
You know it was me.
You and your insinuations...
...and your stupid sarcasm.
- What are you talking about?
Well, I'm going to finish you.
I'm going to close your big mouth...
...once and for all.
- Bill!
Let go of me! Let me go!
- That had you going a bit, didn't it?
- Well, l...
You know what your trouble is?
You can dish out the jokes, but you can't take them, can you?
Well, I think that was all in very bad taste.
Yes, so do I.
I'm sorry, love. I didn't mean to upset anybody but him.
Well, you've upset me.
Oh, for heaven's sake. I've had enough of this. I'm going to bed.
I'm feeling a bit tired myself,
Mr. Cosgood.
If I might be shown my room?
- Certainly. Certainly, dear lady.
- Thank you.
It's been a trying day.
Very trying indeed.
Florrie! Florrie!
- So glad to be one of you. Good night.
- Good night.
Mrs. Harris will show you up.
Come on, then. Number 10, upstairs.
Thank you, Mr. Cosgood. Good night.
You shouldn't take too much notice of those youngsters.
Strange lads in some ways, but hearts in the right place.
I'm sure they are.
- Well, good night.
- Good night, dear lady.
You'll soon feel at home.
We're all one big happy family here.
I hope you know what you're doing, dear boy.
You'll find this comfortable. He did.
- He?
- The deceased.
- You know, Mr. Rowton.
- Oh, yes.
Well, now, breakfast 8:30.
No cooking in the rooms.
Shilling in the gas if you're cold.
Bath days, Sundays and Fridays.
Don't waste the light.
And no male callers upstairs.
Naughty pussy, what are you doing in there?
Come along. Off you go. Shoo. Off.
Remember September.
Eva?
Yes?
What are you doing?
I couldn't sleep.
Why do you suppose that Marple woman should sneak out of the house...
...at this time of morning?
How should I know?
Perhaps she's just eccentric.
She certainly looks it.
I wonder.
Oh, darling, you're not going all creepy, are you?
Really, you could haunt a house.
Oh, I do wish you hadn't wakened me.
Now I'll start fretting again.
I'd put it out of my mind if I were you.
Oh, easier said than done.
I mean, well, where can one go for a honeymoon these days?
Everywhere is so old hat.
Hey, what do you think about Moscow?
How can you care about that after what's happened?
Life must go on, darling.
George or no George.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
No.
It was all over.
Was it?
Yes.
I hated him.
Don't worry, darling.
I won't tell anyone.
Good heavens, Mr. Stringer, what on earth are you doing in that getup?
Just training. I thought it advisable to get into peak condition...
...for any emergency.
Is there one already?
No emergency, but a very interesting development.
Do stop bobbing about...
...and come over here.
Remember September.
Not a date, a play.
And by my new employer,
Driffold Cosgood himself.
Well, you do see the significance of this?
- No.
- Well, now, follow me, Jim.
Follow me closely. It seems to me...
...that whomever Mrs. McGinty was blackmailing...
...must have had some connection...
...with the production of this play in 1951...
...and is with the Cosgood Company.
- The author himself?
- Perhaps.
- How did you come by it?
- I found it on my pillow.
- What?
- It was left there deliberately.
Then he knows. The murderer...
...he's been on to you all the time.
He's just playing cat and mouse with you.
Well, two can play at that game.
Miss Marple, I'm deeply disturbed.
Don't get yourself in a state, Jim.
I'm not in a state.
- I'm cold.
- Oh, dear me.
There we are.
That's better, isn't it?
Tuck it well round.
Now...
Now, what organization would be likely to keep a record...
...of all professional theatrical productions?
- The censorship people, I suppose.
- To be sure.
The Lord Chamberlain's Office in London.
I should be obliged if you would go there posthaste...
...and inquire into the history of this play...
...where it was produced in 1951, who was in it, and so on.
It may have been played in many theaters.
I hardly think so. You see, I've read it.
Very well, Miss Marple.
I'll take the next train up.
Good. To your task. And I must fly.
I wish to be at the breakfast table when they come down.
Away. Away!
Thank you, Mrs. Harris.
I seem to be a trifle early.
No, the others are a trifle late.
Not that I'm complaining.
If they're not down in time,
I've got six cats to feed.
- Good morning, Florrie.
- Good morning.
Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Cosgood.
- I trust you slept well, dear lady?
More like a top, thank you.
Good, good. Nothing like sleep for knitting up...
...the raveled sleeve of care, as the Bard so aptly pointed out.
What's that you find so engrossing?
- Your play, Mr. Cosgood.
- What?
This is your play?
Yes. Yes, it is.
Where on earth did you find this?
In my room. Last night.
Well, now, isn't that extraordinary?
- Yes.
- I can only assume poor George must...
...have borrowed it some time.
- Don't let me stop you reading it.
- I've finished reading it.
Oh, well, let's see how the good Florrie serves us today.
- How do you find it?
- The kipper?
- The play.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
The play.
I find it most interesting.
How very gratifying.
Has it ever been produced, Mr. Cosgood?
Oh, no.
I completed it only quite recently.
- I see.
- I have high hopes for it, though.
Those must sustain you.
They do, dear lady, they do.
Ralph.
Driffold, I've been up half the night thinking.
Now I want to ask you a question.
Yes.
Could you believe in Miss Marple...
...as a lady detective?
- I don't know any lady detectives.
- I'm not saying you do.
- But what do you think?
- She's hardly typecasting.
You're quite wrong there.
You know, she's perfect.
- What are you getting at?
- I've a marvelous idea.
- Well?
- We close the theater till Monday.
Let the publicity build up, then we reopen with Out of the Stewpot.
That old potboiler.
A murder mystery, dear boy.
We've got one of our own.
Why not put one on?
You may have a thought here.
With Miss Marple as the honorable
Penelope Brown.
Yes, now I do see what you mean.
Yes, by Jove, it's brilliant. You're familiar with the play, of course, dear lady?
- No, I don't think so.
- A classic of its kind.
I'll fetch the scripts right away.
Ralph, call the theater.
Tell them we're rehearsing on-stage for the week.
- Mr. Cosgood!
- Yes?
I really wouldn't have thought I was anyone's idea of a detective.
Not anyone's, dear Miss Marple, but you're mine.
You're certainly mine.
And mine.
Spotlight!
Get it on me and keep it on me.
Now, you've all read the play.
Let me put you in the mood.
The scene is a filthy attic in Soho...
...in the very heart of London's square mile of vice and worse.
A dim figure is flitting about the stage.
That's you, Bill. You play Sidney, working-class assistant...
...to the honorable Penelope Brown, amateur criminologist.
That's you, Miss Marple.
Sidney is looking for something...
...searching, searching...
...searching.
A noise! A step on the stair outside.
I, as the father, am about to enter with my delinquent son, Stanley.
That's you, Arthur.
Arthur.
Sidney freezes...
...then darts for a place of concealment.
Sorry, guv. Testing.
You're back.
All right, all right, don't just stand about grinning.
Just testing, indeed.
Now, where was I?
Yes, I come in with my son.
I plead with him...
...to tell the police all he knows about the killing of Rona La Plante.
He sneers at me...
...rejects me. Then...
...the climax of the scene.
I detect a movement behind the alcove curtain.
I cross to it...
...pull it aside to reveal...
...Sidney.
- What do you want?
- A phone call for Miss Marple.
Well, why didn't you say so?
All right, you're not wanted in this scene.
Thank you.
Now, let's take it from my entrance.
Bill, you're concealed over here.
Arthur, you and I come in.
You're living here?
A son of mine?
Hello?
Oh, yes, Mr. Stringer.
You were right, Miss Marple.
Remember September was put on in 1951.
A tryout performance at
Pebblestone-on-Sea.
Very interesting.
Particularly as the author claims...
...that he's only recently completed the work.
Well, that may have been embarrassment.
You see, the Lord Chamberlain's Office particularly remembers it...
...because it was booed off the stage halfway through the second act.
That doesn't surprise me in the least.
The point is...
...was there anyone we know in it?
I have obtained a full cast list...
...and in it occurs the name of Margaret McGinty.
What? Really?
Excellent.
Now, tell me, apart from Mr. Cosgood...
...who else in this company...
...was connected with this production?
No one? You're sure?
Yes.
All right, Jim. I was just thinking.
Of course, it's possible that someone has since changed...
...his or her name.
Look, Jim, drop the cast list in to me...
...at Westward Ho, will you?
Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Marple.
- Oh, I'm sorry if I startled you.
- No, not at all.
Mr. Cosgood is asking for you on the stage.
Thank you. I'll come.
This was in Props.
It should do the job.
All right.
Let's try it.
There you are, dear lady.
We've just been devising a small embellishment...
...to the scene where you confront Ralph...
...with the truth about the killing of Rona La Plante.
Instead of, as written, him merely knocking over the lamp...
...and making good his escape,
Ralph suggests...
...he also attempts to kill you.
- Really?
- Yes.
The idea is, he knocks over the lamp, shoots at you and then bolts.
- I see.
- He misses, of course.
There's nothing like a loud report...
...for keeping an audience alive and alert.
- You don't find this alarming, do you?
- Oh, no...
...not at all.
Good.
Right, then let's set the scene.
Ralph, you'll be over here...
...rifling the escritoire.
And the honorable Penelope...
...will enter through the French windows over here, right?
Positions, please.
Miss Marple, in now.
I thought I'd find you here, Faber.
- You?
- Yes, me.
- Stay where you are.
- Violence will avail you nothing.
The grounds are swarming with police.
They've got nothing on me.
Oh, yes, they have. You see...
You see, Mrs. McGinty's dead!
You made a mistake then, didn't you?
You certainly did, dear lady.
- Why, what did I do?
- You said, "Mrs. McGinty's dead."
- Did I?
- Yes. It's Rona La Plante who's dead.
Oh, yes. How silly of me.
I must've picked it up from reading...
...your play, Remember September.
My play?
There's nobody of that name in it.
How odd.
The name McGinty's on my mind...
...for some reason or other.
I know.
It was that barmaid murdered at Milchester.
There was a trial last week.
Yes, that's it.
May I try it again, please?
Yes, yes, only let's...
...do it properly this time.
I'll do my best.
Positions, please.
All right, Ralph, make your move.
Seen this in the evening paper?
"Police baffled in theater mystery."
Not that, this:
"Grand Charity reopening Monday.
Driffold Cosgood proudly presents...
...the company everyone is talking about in a baffling murder drama.
First night proceeds in aid of the
Police Benevolent Fund."
- Well, that's a nice gesture, sir.
- I can hear the chief agreeing with you.
- You got those bank statements yet?
- On your desk, sir.
Well, did anyone draw out L100...
...about the time of
Mrs. McGinty's death?
Yes, sir.
- Well, who?
- The dead man, sir. George Rowton.
Why didn't you say so?
Well, I just did, sir.
Well, well, well.
It was as simple as that.
Suicide.
Oh, Miss Marple, there's a visitor for you.
- Oh, thank you.
- In there. He's a male.
Oh, I see.
- Inspector.
- Good evening, Miss Marple.
Good evening.
I called at the police station, and they told me you were out.
- I'd no idea you'd come here.
- No, I don't suppose you had.
Well, your visit is most inopportune.
You see, at rehearsal today,
I set in train a certain stratagem...
...which I think will force our murderer to make a move tonight.
I very much doubt it, Miss Marple.
Our murderer, as you put it, is dead.
- I beg your pardon.
- Look at this.
George Rowton's bank statement.
Important item underlined, namely a withdrawal of L100.
So that explains it.
Yes, I thought you'd see the point.
Yes, indeed. Though I must admit the motive for the murder...
...of Rowton had eluded me until now.
He wasn't murdered, Miss Marple.
He killed himself.
- Oh, you really think so?
- Well, it's obvious.
Mrs. McGinty was blackmailing him.
He drew out of the bank to pay her off...
...murdered her, and then left the money behind to incriminate the lodger.
- That theory has a familiar ring.
- What?
Oh, you did suggest something along those lines. True.
The point is the lodger's innocent.
Rowton did it and then took what is called the easy way out.
Couldn't stand the strain.
The case is wrapped up. I'm just on my way to tell the chief constable so.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why not?
Because I think you're wrong.
- You do?
- Yes.
You see, I now think our murderer got the money...
...to pay Mrs. McGinty off George Rowton...
...in a way which made it necessary for Rowton...
...to be disposed of later.
Only a woman's mind, possibly only yours, could have dreamt that one up.
It may irritate you, inspector...
...that women sometimes have superior minds.
You'll simply have to accept it.
Don't you need this?
Thank you. Good night, Miss Marple.
Good night, inspector.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Oh, that's where you are. They do like to sleep somewhere up here...
...when they can find an empty bed.
Come on, my pretties.
Your liver's nice and hot.
Dinner gong in two minutes.
Come on, babies.
Come on.
Come in.
Miss Marple, I was hoping to catch you before you went down.
Were you, Mr. Cosgood?
Yes, I thought it was time you and I had a little chat.
That's it.
Overture and beginners, please.
And that means you.
No male friends in rooms, madam.
Don't be absurd, boy.
Well, Miss Marple, perhaps I can escort you down.
I think I'll give dinner a miss tonight,
Mr. Cosgood. I'm feeling a trifle queasy.
Nothing incapacitating, I trust?
Oh, no, a good night's rest.
- Well, I'll leave you, then.
- Thank you.
Take care, dear lady.
We mustn't be without you Monday, must we?
Come, Arthur.
Oh, my dear, I was just...
Bitter almonds.
Cyanide.
This is tragic.
Absolutely tragic.
When the press get on to this...
...we could open in two theaters and still be turning them away.
Now we're stuck without someone to play the housekeeper.
- You can't have it both ways, can you?
- We must.
We owe it to Dorothy.
Eva. No, you're already doubling the good-time girl...
...and the vicar's daughter.
Sheila, would you play the housekeeper, dear, if I got you a wig?
Oh, Driffy, you make me sick.
You don't care a hoot about poor old Dorothy.
All you care about is your silly old play and your stupid old self.
And no, I won't play the housekeeper.
All right, Miss Marple, cyanide gas.
- But how?
- I think I can explain that.
No doubt.
I take it from your tone, inspector, that you did not have second thoughts...
...about seeing the chief constable yesterday.
If you can explain, Miss Marple, please do so.
Very well.
Now.
So what? My wife has one.
But presumably she doesn't cook candle wax.
No, she doesn't.
There is a little at the bottom of that saucepan.
Now, this is what happened.
The murderer set the dials so that the gas...
...came on at 12:55 precisely...
...under this saucepan that contained...
...a small wax cup of acid...
...and a pellet of sodium cyanide.
The wax melted, the acid flowed over the pellet.
Result: Sudden release of cyanide gas.
- Lethal.
- I see.
And at 1:00 precisely...
...the gas turned itself off.
Now.
Leaving nothing but an innocent saucepan on the hob.
Yes, it could work. That means whoever we're looking for...
...must have specialist knowledge.
- Oh, no.
Exactly the same murder method is employed...
...in the play we open with on Monday,
Out of the Stew Pot.
- Any in the company could've done it?
- Right.
The way things are now, I am tempted, sorely tempted, to arrest the whole lot.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
What you've found out, what we've found out...
Look at what we've got.
Cosgood, he told you he'd only just written...
...this confounded
Remember September...
...and yet we know it was produced in 1951.
And victim number one, Mrs. McGinty, was in it.
And this fellow Summers, we know he took Mrs. McGinty out...
...two times the week the company was in Milchester...
...the week she was murdered.
- And his wife, Maureen...
...she knew about this, and she didn't like it.
Then there's this spooky girl Eva.
We've been able to establish...
...that she was having a romance with George Rowton...
...and that he tossed her aside like a...
- Worn-out glove, sir?
Yes. And then there's young Arthur.
That note you found in your room was typed on his typewriter...
...and as a result of the assignation, victim number three.
There is a point here.
In 1951, the younger members of the company...
...would have been mere children.
- Yes.
Yes, by George. If that performance of
Remember September in 1951...
...13 years ago, started this whole thing, then none of the youngsters...
...Eva, Bill, Sheila, Arthur, can have had anything to do with it.
Oh, it seems so.
I mean, anyone could've...
...gone into Arthur's room...
...and used the typewriter. I did myself.
- He's here, sir.
- What?
- He's here, sir.
- Yes. Would you wait here a moment...
...please, Miss Marple?
- Wait?
Please. Sergeant.
I wonder why the iron was hot.
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I...
You asked me to drop in the cast list when I was passing.
You know, Remember September.
And you were passing at 2:30 in the morning?
- Come, now.
- Yes, well...
Well, as a matter of fact, the inspector was kind enough to send a car.
He thought I might succeed where he had failed to persuade you...
To desert my post, perhaps?
This is a dangerous place.
These are dangerous people.
- Only one of them.
- Miss Marple.
- The time has come for plain speak...
- Please, Jim, I'm thinking.
It's here that the answer lies.
"Driffold Cosgood, Ralph Summers,
Margaret McGinty, Rose Kane"...
Rose.
Rose.
Mr. Stringer, we have here, in addition...
...to Margaret McGinty, an actress called Rose Kane.
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.
Don't you see? Rose.
A rose by any other name would smell.
The blackmail note.
Mr. Stringer, tomorrow I must do some digging.
- Digging?
- Yes, into the past.
You mean this Rose Kane?
Yes.
You seem to remember her well,
Mr. Tumbrill.
What is your interest in her?
Oh, I simply want to trace her.
You see, I've been outside the profession for a number of years now.
- And so the only way l...
- Well...
...if you're an old friend of hers,
I'm afraid you're in for a bit of a shock.
- Poor Rosie was hanged, you know.
- What?
Yes. Terrible business.
Terrible business. Will you?
Not so soon after breakfast, thank you.
- You were saying?
- Oh, yes, terrible.
I shall never forget it.
She opened in this play somewhere in the sticks.
A unique flopperoo, by the way.
Didn't even run the night.
Anyhow, the same night, believe it or not...
...she poisoned her husband.
- Did she indeed?
- Yes, she did.
She sent her kid out to buy half a pound of garlic sausage...
...and then doctored it with weed killer.
There was a child?
Must have been 10 or 11 at the time.
- Boy or girl?
- Never saw the kid myself.
Can't even remember its name.
Anyway, I did hear that some friend took it in for a bit afterwards...
...then popped it into an orphanage.
That friend, was her name McGinty?
Yes, that's right. Maggie McGinty.
Blond, flighty piece.
Why ever did Rose do it, Mr. Tumbrill?
Usual thing. Another man.
- And who was he?
- He never came forward.
And she never named him.
Then it could be the lover...
...or the child.
I wonder if I might have this photograph, Mr. Tumbrill.
- As a keepsake.
- Oh, by all means.
- Thank you.
- Yes, by all means.
One of mine that got away, you might say.
Well, I won't take up any more of your time.
Allow me.
- Evelyn!
- I beg your pardon?
Rose's kid. Evelyn, that was the name.
Evelyn.
Nothing like champagne for a champagne occasion.
- Uncommonly civil of you, dear lady.
- What about a toast, dear boy?
- Something appropriate?
- Of course, of course.
To success. To us. All of us.
And particularly to our hostess.
- Long life, dear lady.
- Thank you.
- Long life.
- Hear, hear.
Oh, Mr. Cosgood. Such lovely flowers.
Who's that?
Oh, she was an actress.
Called Rose Kane. Why do you ask?
I don't know.
But somehow she means death.
Something to do with George.
Five minutes, boys and girls.
Come on, come on, the party's over.
Now, remember, all you have to do is speak your lines clearly...
...try not to trip over the furniture...
...and we'll run longer than The Mousetrap.
See you on-stage, dear lady.
Oh, and don't forget, it's Rona La Plante who's dead.
Well, Driffold. Tonight's the night.
It most certainly is.
- Got the gun?
- Yes.
What do you suppose she wants to see us about, sir?
I don't know, sergeant, but she's up to something.
Come in.
Well, Miss Marple?
Good evening, inspector.
I think there's something you should know...
...before you go in to see the play.
- Oh, what?
I think our murderer...
...will try to kill me again tonight.
Again?
The first attempt failed.
Poor Dorothy perished instead.
What are you talking about?
The iron was hot, you see.
- I burnt my hand.
- No, I don't see.
When I went into Dorothy's room earlier that night...
...there was washing on the line.
- Well?
Well, I think she did her ironing later...
...and forgot to switch off.
Then in the middle of the night, she woke and remembered...
...and went down to the kitchen to do so.
- And walked into a trap for you.
- Quite.
That note was left outside my door deliberately...
...to lure me down.
Right, sergeant. We're going to stay right here...
...and we're not going to let
Miss Marple out of our sight.
Oh, you mustn't do that, inspector.
We must put no obstacle in the way.
You can't be serious.
Never more so.
You see, our murderer set a trap for me.
I have just returned the compliment.
Miss Marple, I've brought the...
Let me have it, Mr. Stringer.
- Thank you.
- Wait a minute. What's going on?
Life insurance, inspector.
Life insurance.
Beginners on-stage, please.
Beginners on-stage.
Will you please excuse me, gentlemen?
Father, we've been all through that before.
You know that I have committed myself to this way of life...
...and I won't give it up.
You're living here?
A son of mine?
I live where I choose.
Come in, Eva.
Now, don't scream.
Don't even speak.
Because I'm taking you somewhere where we won't be interrupted.
And if you do anything...
...I'll kill you.
Now, open that door.
A couple of years in jail, what's that?
Why, it might be the making of you.
You may think the police are fools,
Stanley.
Perhaps some of them are.
But not all, son.
Not all.
Right here. Now, if anyone tries to come through here...
...I want to know who it is and what he wants. Got that?
Very good, sir.
Hey, what's all this about?
Well, Miss Marple, I've covered every...
- Sergeant!
- Sheila...
...have you seen Ralph?
- No.
You've got to tell the police all you know...
- Where is she?
- She hasn't left her room, sir.
She has, you idiot. We've got to find her. You take that side.
Look, Dad, can't we cut this short?
I'm expecting a visitor in a...
In a few moments.
One of you... One of your worthless friends, no doubt.
It's the girl I'm going to marry, if you must know.
Look at me.
Look at me!
What's the matter with you?
I want you to know why you're going to die.
I want to know that too.
You killed him.
I don't know why, but you killed him.
By "him," you mean George Rowton, don't you?
Yes.
You were in love with him.
Yes, I loved him.
And you killed him.
Oh, no, you're mistaken, my dear.
He was killed by someone called Evelyn Kane.
I don't believe you.
I know it was you.
- I've felt it was you from the beginning.
- You can't do it, Eva.
You're no more capable of murder than I am.
You were quite right.
She couldn't have done it.
A pity.
I thought she might have saved me the trouble.
- Aren't you supposed to be on the stage?
- Oh, but I am, Miss Marple.
And what's more, hundreds of people will swear I am...
...hiding behind the curtain.
It's very simple, really.
You remember when that idiot Cosgood dropped through the trap?
Well, I've done the same.
In exactly three minutes...
...I shall be back on-stage, on cue.
But you, I'm sorry to say...
...will not be answering yours.
You're Evelyn Kane, aren't you?
Rose Kane's son.
Oh, yes.
Evelyn, what a name.
I soon changed that.
Yes, the McGinty woman found that out, didn't she...
...when you were playing in Milchester.
She recognized you, and as you were marrying an heiress...
...she saw an opportunity for blackmail.
She threatened to tell Sheila's father...
...unless I paid her to keep quiet.
So I kept her quiet.
Where could I find the money she wanted?
- George Rowton.
- She wanted L100.
So I forged George's name on a check.
Well, I couldn't let him find that out, now, could I?
So they both had to die, didn't they?
Poor old Dorothy.
That was meant for you, of course.
Well, I had meant to wring your neck...
...but Eva's been very obliging.
Her fingerprints are on that.
And I'm on the stage.
Wait!
I took the liberty of borrowing this from Mr. Summers.
You don't think you can fool me with a prop gun filled with blanks.
Oh, no, not blanks.
A friend of mine procured me some insurance.
- I'll risk it.
- I should warn you...
...I won the Ladies' Small Arms
Championship at Bisley in 1924.
Bully for you.
Oh, dear.
I thought I heard something.
Come out of there!
Bill, you stupid...
Inspector.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
With a bit of rest and some luck, the doctor thinks...
...I should be out of here in a few days.
- Oh, splendid.
I'm thankful the blow caused no permanent damage.
And now, if you'll excuse me.
Thank you very much, Miss Marple.
Oh, Miss Marple, there is one thing.
I thought you might like to know that as a result of my work...
...on this case, I'm to be promoted.
Chief inspector.
Oh, I'm so glad. Congratulations.
Yes, well...
- Thank you, Miss Marple.
- Not at all, inspector.
Chief inspector.
Well, au revoir.
Forgive me if I fail to rise, dear lady.
I quite understand, Mr. Cosgood.
I've brought you some magazines to help...
...while away the time.
Yes, time. Time.
I've been lying here contemplating a bleak future.
- Unless...
- Unless?
Well, I wondered if you'd given any thought to my play...
... Remember September.
It has been rather on my mind.
Dear lady, I have a small confession to make.
It was I who left the script in your room.
- Really?
- Yes, I hoped it might make some...
...impression upon you.
- It did.
Good. You see, it seems to me that with one or two minor alterations...
...in the second act, I have here a very valuable property.
I'm so happy for you, Mr. Cosgood.
There is, however, one tiny, weeny little snag.
Yes. It's sordid, of course, when dealing with the arts...
...but a play, whatever its merits, requires...
...a backer.
- Mr. Cosgood...
...whatever I may or may not be...
...I am definitely no angel.
Goodbye...
...and good luck.

Thanks. I'll see ya.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Raskin.
I see you've got the duty again.
You've been back there a week.
It comes around.
Thanks.
Good night,
Dr. Ostrer.
Good night,
Reagan.
Oh, Reagan.
Reagan, I've gotta talk to you.
I've got a minute now.
No. But I want to see you tomorrow morning.
I'll come by your house.
Fine.
What's this?
Laboratory equipment replacements.
Well, what happened while I was gone?
Nothing, sir.
The Director?
Well, you know Dr. Baxter, he's still...
Introverted.
Yes, sir.
Who's left in E Lab?
There's six, Dr. Baxter, Hoffman,
Yang, and three technicians.
Correct.
Gonna get these inside?
Yes, sir.
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Mason.
Who's left in there?
Six, sir.
Dr. Baxter, Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Yang, and three technicians.
Dr. Hoffman.
Good evening, Reagan.
Is the Director in there?
Yes.
Working late tonight?
No.
Well, how was it on the Potomac?
Not quiet.
I...
I understand the man has given us a new administrator,
Dr. Leonard Michaelson?
Who told you that?
Dr. Hoffman.
The cleaning woman told him.
Not funny.
Well, it's Friday.
Good night, Reagan.
See you Monday.
Good night, Doctor.
Any trouble? No, sir.
Just some minor residuals.
There's a couple of crates outside.
Let's get 'em in.
Yes, sir.
Raskin just called.
Good evening, Doctor.
Oh.
What is it, Reagan?
Working late?
No. But I'll be in tomorrow.
What time?
I'll set the time lock for you.
Last time you locked yourself out until Monday.
I know.
You've been away, haven't you?
Washington.
How worried are they?
Well, they're always worried about the security of this place.
My job's like that.
What they're really worried about is that.
Yes, sir.
Did you, uh, reassure them?
No. I leave that to you.
Yes.
Sir, do you think...
Why don't you take this Saturday and Sunday off,
Doctor?
Do you good.
No time for that, Reagan.
No time.
Tired men make mistakes, Doctor.
God help us if a mistake's made here.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.
Good night, Mason.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night,
Dr. Hoffman.
You are leaving, Doctor?
I'll be a few minutes.
Do you need me for anything?
No.
Good night, Hoffman.
Goodnight, Dr. Hoffman.
Goodnight, Mason.
Good night, Doctor.
Good night, Doctor.
Mason speaking.
Is Doctor Williams in?
Dr. Williams is not in E Lab.
Good night,
Dr. Baxter.
Two sixteen.
That's administration.
You're welcome.
It's Mason.
E Lab clear and closed.
Right.
Good night,
Doctor Baxter.
Good night, Doctor.
Raskin.
Yes, sir.
Reagan.
I'm going into E Lab.
The shoulder on that back road's caved in.
We ought to take care of that tomorrow.
All right.
Might as well make a note of it in the log for Mr. Reagan in the morning.
I'll tell him when he leaves.
He's still here?
Mmm-hmm. E Lab.
What time did he go in there?
Mr. Reagan.
Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Mr. Reagan?
Hello, Mr. Reagan?
Get over there and check that security door.
This is Lieutenant Raskin,
Duty Officer, Station Three.
Get me the Director, Dr. Baxter, at home, or Mr. Tasserly.
Right.
There's a phone call for you.
What?
There's a phone call for you.
Thank you, very much.
Hello. Who?
Okay, put him on.
Yes. Mr. Martin?
Well, I could, but I don't particularly want to.
Yeah. All right.
I hope it's as vital to me.
Mr. Martin?
Yes.
Good evening.
Good of you to see me at such a late hour,
Mr. Barrett.
You didn't care for a drink?
Oh, no, thank you.
Do you live aboard all the time, Mr. Barrett?
No, just some of the time.
I don't imagine your law practice is too demanding these days.
Could be better.
Yet, you can afford this yacht.
Must be rather expensive.
What can I do for you,
Mr. Martin?
We have a job for you.
We think you're the right man.
Oh? Why?
You have the background for it.
And in the past, you've been quite outspoken on the immorality of war.
Everybody says he's against war.
Not ex-United States
Intelligence Officers.
Let's take a look at some of the record.
"Lee Barrett. 1950.
University student. Pre law."
"Then active service,
Korea and helicopters."
"Detached for special service.
Excellent war record."
"Citation.
Superb lone operator who has no master in cunning,"
"secrecy or violence."
"Promoted to captain.
Recommended for three decorations."
First discordant note.
Last two refused.
You are quoted as saying that war
"had aged you so fast, you were too old to play with toys."
Rather a whimsical statement,
Mr. Barrett.
You think so?
Why did you leave the service?
Poor prospects.
Discharged, 1952.
Allowed to resign commission after altercation with a Major General.
Some people have flat feet.
I dislike taking orders under certain circumstances.
Then you got your law degree.
Passed the bar examination, but didn't practice.
Joined a government agency.
Fired.
A stint with another one.
Fired for the usual reason.
You rate rather high on insubordination.
My record is easy to check,
Mr. Martin. Make your point.
A year ago you were appointed
Security Chief at Station Three.
How do you know about Station Three?
The most secret chemical warfare establishment in this hemisphere.
Fired three months ago.
Reason? "Emotional rejection of purpose of project."
"Council for World Peace."
"Henry Martin,
Executive Secretary."
You heard of us?
Oh, yes.
But you don't approve of us?
I don't like semi-secret organizations,
Mr. Martin.
Neither do I,
Mr. Barrett.
But the Council is a potent weapon for peace.
We're not communistic or anti-communistic.
You just want a workable peace.
Like you, perhaps,
Mr. Barrett.
You have been outspoken on the foolishness of war.
That was removed from Station
Three a few hours ago.
It doesn't matter how at the moment.
Do you know what it is?
Botulinus?
No.
A vaccine against botulinus.
The contents of that flask can be cultured to provide enough vaccine to immunize any nation on Earth.
We want it delivered to this address.
Europe?
Yes.
How does that help peace?
It neutralizes a terrible weapon.
If we both have it, well, neither side can threaten the other with it.
Very dangerous assignment,
Mr. Martin.
$10,000 should cover your expenses.
I'm afraid not.
Then you refuse?
No.
It'll cost you 20,000.
10,000 each way. Cash. Now.
You mind if I say something,
Mr. Barrett?
Yes, I do.
Keep your speeches and moralities for your council.
This is a business deal.
No wonder you were thrown out of so many places.
Satisfied?
Yes.
Put your forearms on the table.
You have a strange way of doing business,
Mr. Barrett.
What is this?
A holdup?
Put your forearms on the table.
First, vaccines are not stored at Station Three.
So this has got to be some kind of a virus.
Second, no one's supposed to know anything about Station Three.
And third,
I know quite a bit about the World Peace Organization.
There's a fat, balding man who is the secretary, name, Henry Martin.
I know him.
What do you intend to do?
Turn you over to the right people.
I know this isn't evidence, but with your fingerprints on the flask, and the money, it'll do.
I guess
I underestimated you.
I guess you did.
Now, stand up.
Turn around, put your hands on the bulkhead and lean on them.
Cavanaugh? What the hell are you doing here?
Now, don't get sore, Barrett.
I had to do this in a hurry, and it's the only way
I could handle it.
Handle what?
I had to check you for security and quick.
That character's one of your agents?
That's right.
And you planned this whole thing just to see if I could be bought?
You could put it that way, I guess.
I didn't know what kind of a security risk you'd become.
People change, you know.
You did have me worried on that radio there for a moment.
Get out of here and get your tail back to Washington.
Mr. Barrett,
I'm Dr. Leonard Michaelson.
I know who you are.
You, too. Get out.
Get your props and get off this boat.
Barrett, you know the way our security agency works.
Mr. Barrett, I can understand how you might interpret this as a reflection on your loyalty...
Sir.
Barrett, the General has asked that we come to you.
He wants you in on this.
In on what?
Station Three was broken into a few hours ago.
Reagan's been murdered and Dr. Baxter has vanished.
Mr. Michaelson?
Right.
I'm Pelton Tasserly, Deputy Administrator here.
Mr. Tasserly.
Lieutenant Raskin.
Lieutenant Johnson.
Good morning.
I'm very sorry about this, sir.
No sooner take over and...
Yes, yes, Tasserly.
You know Mr. Cavanaugh?
Yes, I do.
Mr. Barrett?
Hello, Barrett.
Anything on Baxter?
Nothing. But the net's out.
All points.
What steps have you taken?
None, really. I figured you'd get here pretty fast.
So I've touched nothing, talked to no one.
I did bring in all the security people who were on duty last night.
Whom have you told about this,
Mr. Tasserly?
Well, no one, other than you people, and our security men, of course.
And Doctor Hoffman.
Why him?
Well, he was the last one out, except for the Director.
He's waiting in E block now.
Let's take a look at Reagan.
Are you with us,
Barrett?
I'll be there in a minute.
How do you see this,
Johnson?
Well, Mr. Tasserly says, and Mason swears that nobody got into E Lab.
But I don't think Reagan committed suicide in there.
Neither do I. What's the sentry dog doing over here?
He's got a lump on his head that wasn't there yesterday.
But he was still on patrol this morning?
Mmm-hmm.
I think maybe he might've been knocked cold for awhile.
Of course, being a dog, he couldn't tell me about it.
He just went back to work.
Yeah.
Has Raskin got men going over the fence?
Every inch.
Right in that corner, sir.
Dr. Hoffman's terribly distraught.
Insists he must talk to you.
Immediately, in private.
Perhaps you should see him, sir.
Hmm.
Dr. Hoffman, this is Dr. Michaelson.
How was it done?
Blow on the head.
No weapon.
Who set the time lock?
I don't know, sir.
I suppose Dr. Baxter.
Another half an hour to go.
Is there any way to work that combination and go in before the time is up?
We've got to find out if anything has happened in there.
No way on earth until those red lights go off at 8:00.
You fool with that door before that, well, you'd die quick.
It's booby trapped.
A thousand volt charge and lethal gas.
Mr. Raskin.
Yes?
We've found a break in the fence.
Don't touch it.
We'll be right there. Yes, sir.
Raskin, have your men move Reagan's body to one of the side laboratories.
Yes, sir.
Taped.
So that you can't even see it unless you look closely.
Very careful job.
Raskin, open the other side.
Cut left to right.
A right-handed man, maybe.
Or a left-handed man who wants us to think he's right-handed, maybe.
The alarm didn't go off.
The wire hasn't been touched anywhere.
Someone'd really have to know their way around this place not to trip over this at night.
The thing
I don't understand, is how anybody can get past the dog.
I don't get that, either.
What do you think happened?
I don't know, sir.
What's his name?
Rollo.
Can I handle him?
He's under sedation. Go ahead.
Easy, Rollo. Easy, boy.
Easy, Rollo.
Easy. Easy.
There it is.
What do you make of that?
Hmm.
Those are cuts.
How'd they get there?
From the wire.
Right.
Raskin, you be Rollo.
Now, you tape up your arm, stick it through, thus...
Okay, grab it.
You hang up Rollo on the wires so he can't pull free without tearing his throat out.
He'd make a noise. No.
These dogs are trained not to bark.
No matter what. Right?
Right.
Then you clobber him with something heavy, you tape up the wire and you're gone.
When Rollo comes to, he's got the world's most massive headache.
But being a dog, he can't tell anybody so he just goes back to work. Simple.
So that's how he got in.
No. That's how he got out.
Out?
Right. Look at the ends of these wires where they're bent.
He took Rollo from the inside.
Mr. Barrett, a telegram for you.
It came to our office in town.
How come you get a telegram here?
Magic.
I'd certainly like to know what it says.
I'll bet you would.
Mr. Cavanaugh, it's 10 minutes to 8:00.
I know it is an outside possibility, but it is a possibility and a horrible one.
And you cannot just kick it under the rug.
You have not the right...
What is it?
We have a very difficult situation here.
Dr. Hoffman feels that E Lab should be sealed in concrete.
Why?
Because he's afraid that some chemicals in that vault may have been broken or tampered with.
Even if they weren't, we still cannot take the chance.
The possibilities are too monstrous to gamble with.
What possibilities?
I think you better tell them, Doctor.
More than 40 bio-chemical weapons have been developed at Station Three.
I will confine myself to two which we have developed here in E Lab.
First, botulinus.
We have 1,200 grams in six flasks.
If 10 grams of it were allowed to contaminate a city, that city is a morgue in four hours.
It is an ideal weapon,
God forgive the phrase, because it destroys only people.
And it oxidizes itself.
In effect, dies, disappears after eight hours.
Well, then, it's safe to go in there.
It's been over eight hours since that vault door was closed.
And if all 1,200 grams of the botulinus were spilled on the floor, it would still be safe.
The closed air circulating system is still in operation.
So it would be oxidized.
That is correct. But there is something else in there.
It is only three weeks since Dr.
Baxter refined it and only three days since he communicated its existence to anyone.
There's something beyond the botulinus?
Yes, the second weapon.
Also a virus, air borne.
But self-perpetuating.
Indestructible.
Once released, it will multiply at a power beyond our calculations.
It perhaps, will never die.
To this virus, we have given a highly unscientific name, but one which describes it perfectly.
The Satan Bug.
If I took the flask which contains it and exposed it to the air, everyone here would be dead in a few seconds.
California would be a tomb in a few hours.
In a week, all life, and I mean all life, would cease in the United States.
In two months, two months at the most, the trapper in Alaska, the peasant on the Yangtze, the aborigine in Australia, dead.
All dead.
Because I crushed the flask and exposed a green colored liquid to the air.
Nothing, nothing can stop the Satan Bug.
What would be the last to go?
Perhaps a great albatross winging it's way around the bottom of the world.
Perhaps an Eskimo deep in the Arctic.
But the seas travel the world over and so do the winds.
One day, one day soon, they, too, would die.
The Satan Bug is behind that door.
One flask. It has got to be locked up.
It has got to be.
I must make you understand.
If botulinus is spilled, as Mr. Barrett here has just said, then it does not matter.
But, by God, if someone did get in there, and the Satan Bug is spilled, and the vault door opened half an inch and left open, then the airlock room is lethal.
Open this door for more than five seconds and everything that I have told you will happen, will happen.
I beg you, sir, seal up the door.
You cannot take the risk.
I agree. There's nothing else we can do.
We've no option.
We've no option, but to make sure it's in there and untouched.
All right, you're all set.
Barrett, if that hamster does die, you'll be contaminated.
You won't be able to come out of there.
I know.
Well, I trust your intentions, but if there is something wrong in there, I...
You wonder if I can go through staying in there?
Yes.
So do I.
Eric, do you have your gun?
If I come out of that vault with this face mask down, open that airlock door just a crack and use it.
It's below atmospheric pressure in there, so the outside air will rush in.
You'll have time.
You'll be safe.
Lee, you know if I have to,
I will use this.
I know.
There's no danger.
Baxter's in there.
He's dead.
Botulinus.
There was a accident last month, a technician.
Oh, no, it is all right.
There's just the odor now.
It's oxidized.
What about the Satan Bug, Dr. Hoffman?
Don't touch the handle, Doctor.
We need fingerprints.
It is gone.
And the botulinus.
All the flasks.
Yes. They are all gone.
It can't be gone.
It can't be. It's impossible.
Baxter walked out last night.
He was checked out. He was!
Somebody else walked out.
Good morning. Good morning.
I'm Lee Barrett.
Oh, yes, Mr. Barrett.
You're in suite 15.
I am?
Yes, sir.
You're already registered.
I am?
You certainly are.
Hello, Lee, darling.
Thank you, very much.
Don't mention it.
I thought you'd never get here.
I've read the newspaper three times and had four cups of coffee.
Well, I hope you saved one for me.
I certainly did.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm using a new strategy, darling.
I thought you might like the Mata Hari type.
But that telegram,
"The sooner the better."
Can you think of a better way to get you here fast?
At least you could've signed it, damn it.
Hey, your language hasn't improved a bit, by the way.
You need a wife's influence.
Ann, honey, what are you doing here?
Isn't this a beautiful part of the desert?
It's marvelous, almost a hideaway.
Where is he?
About 10 miles from here.
Well, who's the cover this time?
Me.
You?
You know, you're not very bright this morning,
Lee, darling and you're certainly not a bit flattering.
You and I are spending a quiet little weekend here.
Supposedly.
Oh.
What is it this time, Lee?
It's not good.
Why didn't you say so?
I know a darling place out in the desert for lunch.
Green pepper burritos and cold Mexican beer.
Ole.
Oh, hello, Ann, darling.
Good morning, Dad.
Good morning, sir.
Good to see you again.
Hello, Lee.
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Thank you.
That's it for romance today, Lee.
I'll get your breakfast.
No, that can wait.
Sit down, Ann.
There's no reason why you shouldn't hear this.
It didn't take you long to get here from Washington.
No. I'm a member of the Mach two club now.
A little over two hours.
No, Ann came ahead of me.
I was going to talk to Baxter.
We've just learned of the Satan Bug.
Baxter hadn't told you?
No, not until three days ago.
He was quite disturbed.
So were all of us.
A difficult decision.
Didn't know what to do.
Destroy it or not.
Is it gone? Yes, sir.
And all the botulinus.
And I warned him.
You set a project like this in motion, something has to blow.
You think Baxter took it?
No, I found him in the lab.
He's dead.
Baxter's dead?
Somehow two men got into E Lab yesterday.
They must've found Baxter there alone, just before closing.
One of them threw the flask at him and then shut the vault door, then he walked out as Baxter.
As Baxter?
There must've been a reasonable resemblance, and with Baxter's hat and coat, everybody expected to see Baxter.
So they saw Baxter.
And?
The other man went through the fence with the stuff.
Reagan must've stumbled on them in the lab.
Does Cavanaugh have any ideas?
None. But he's all over the place with fingerprint men and cameras.
He'll interrogate everything, everybody, but he won't come up with anything that will be of any value.
You agree that it was an inside job?
Certainly an inside assist, but too smooth to be caught by fingerprints and conversation.
Anyhow, sir, as you know, the "how" is not important, it's the "who" and the "why" that counts.
Yes.
Lee, have they told you just what this new virus will do?
Dr. Hoffman filled me in.
It's throwing that botulinus that worries me.
That's the work of a lunatic.
There're three possibilities.
Foreign power, possible.
Criminals, hijackers, improbable.
It's the first and the third that bother me.
What's the third?
Well, you said it, a lunatic.
Well, psychotics don't generally engage in team work like this.
Paranoids do, and they're very brilliant, some of them.
What sort of paranoid?
The kind that we grow the most of in this country.
A messiah.
What kind of messiah?
Take your pick.
Extreme right, extreme left.
From the "I'd rather be Red than Dead" fanatics to "Bomb Moscow right now" fanatics.
My choice, a messiah.
Let's say you're right.
What next?
A telegram, a letter, or something to the papers with,
"Mankind must abolish war, or war will abolish mankind."
And they'll make demands and end up with,
"Obey or else."
Where were you at midnight last night?
I beg your pardon?
This was delivered about 10 minutes ago.
"Mankind must abolish war, or war will abolish mankind."
"I have what you're looking for."
"I order your Citadel of the Antichrist destroyed."
"The President will publicly announce immediate compliance."
"To prove that I am to be obeyed, there will be an incident."
Unsigned.
They were carried in.
Routine delivery of crates.
Carried in!
Phony.
My God, Mr. Barrett, we had no way of knowing.
We had no idea they'd do anything like this.
No idea at all. It's...
It's so simple it's ridiculous.
It's always the simple way that works.
Nothing?
Nothing.
Only the fingerprints that belong here.
The crates were coded with the right number, the right color.
And they were delivered late Friday afternoon, at 5:35.
No reason for the technicians to open them.
Exactly.
We're just to see that nothing gets out.
Nothing. Everything that comes in stays...
Eric.
The General's here.
He got this this morning.
It was phoned in last night.
Pay phone,
Los Angeles Airport.
My God.
How did they even know he was here?
Good question.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Rip this whole place apart.
Get everybody in here.
Everyone else connected with this place.
Work them over.
Meanwhile, we'll keep the whole area completely sealed off.
I think, except for sealing off the area, we should do the exact opposite.
What do you mean?
Everybody here, at E Lab, knows exactly what happened.
Certainly whoever took the bugs know.
But nobody outside knows anything yet.
Keep it that way.
Leave it wide open.
Why?
So we don't force anybody underground.
Eric, there's got to be at least an inside assist from someone here at Station Three.
Whoever it is, let's keep them in the dark.
Let's hope they make a move, and if they do, we'll know it.
It may be the break we're looking for.
Pretty dangerous, Lee.
Lot of ways to make a slip.
You know how long it'll take to interrogate everybody.
Cross check stories, and run down leads.
We're under a time gun.
You cannot conduct this like a normal investigation.
We've got to hope that somebody, somehow, will lead us to the bugs.
Only the flasks are important, nothing else.
- What do we say about Baxter?
- Tell them nothing.
What about this?
It doesn't exist.
I'll give the word to Raskin.
Raskin.
Anything, Mr. Barrett?
Mr. Cavanaugh will be in in a moment.
That was a very brave thing you did,
Mr. Barrett.
To go into that vault.
Maybe I knew there wasn't any risk.
How could you know that?
Well, certainly, whoever planned this had accurate information.
Very accurate information.
Like me you mean?
I'd put me at the top of the list.
Why would you steal the Satan Bug, Mr. Barrett?
Possession gives one limitless power.
Military power?
And political power and limitless wealth.
The Satan Bug could make one god on earth, or the devil, if you please.
Isn't that enough to tempt anyone?
Dr. Hoffman, how long will it take us to develop a vaccine against the Satan Bug?
As a scientist,
I cannot say never, but...
Dr. Baxter was not getting anywhere, none of us were.
Tasserly, institute a crash program.
Now.
Yes, sir.
Sir, except for those present, we're taking the official position that nothing is missing.
There's been a murder, that's all.
We say nothing to anyone.
A murder?
What about Dr. Baxter?
There's a dead body in there.
It'll keep till Monday. Dr. Baxter's just missing.
Meanwhile, of course, we'll proceed with the investigation.
How?
The usual way.
What are we supposed to do?
What do you propose,
Mr. Tasserly?
I think I will stay here at Station Three, if you do not object.
I'm very tired, and I do not feel like going home.
I'll go with you.
Somehow, I...
Well, I should like to be on call.
I will be in D Wing rest area.
Do not hesitate to awaken me.
Very well.
The General is here,
Dr. Michaelson.
All of this is being transmitted to Washington in detail.
All right.
I'll be in administration with Tasserly.
Station Three personnel?
Yes.
That telegram.
Could there have been a leak?
I mean, you don't think it was a phony, do you?
It could be a maneuver.
The bugs are gone.
A lunatic with the killer of all times.
Gives me the creeps.
This whole operation gives me the creeps.
How was Florida?
Okay.
Quick trip.
No quicker than it was scheduled.
How'd you make out?
I made out fine.
Where's Ainsley?
I don't know.
When did he get here?
He didn't.
What do you mean, he didn't?
I mean he didn't get here.
And he didn't call.
Did you call him?
No, I didn't.
Hello.
Yeah, this is
Dr. Ostrer's house.
Oh, I'm just the air conditioning man.
I'm fixing the unit.
Well, he just stepped out.
He said he'd be right back. Can I take a message?
To call who?
Ah, Ainsley?
How do you spell that? A-N-S...
A-I-N-S-L-E-Y.
Ah, that's right, Mr. Ainsley.
What number?
What the hell are you doing here?
Do you usually make a habit of hanging around people's swimming pools?
I do when I see that.
Is that Ostrer?
Yeah. They wiped him out.
Could he have been the inside assist?
Could be.
Cavanaugh, please.
Cavanaugh, Barrett here.
I'm at Ostrer's. He's dead.
It's murder to me, but it looks like it could be suicide.
He's floating at the bottom of the pool.
I'll fill you in on the details later, but more important, see if you can check a call that just came in to this number a minute ago.
What does the name
Ainsley mean to you?
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.
Uh-huh. That's him.
Millionaire crank.
Right at the top of the list of crackpots.
A place in New York,
Santa Barbara and another one,
I think, somewhere outside of Phoenix. Nail him.
Don't touch him, but don't let him out of your sight.
And don't let him know he's being followed. Okay.
Now, honey, what are you doing here?
I was looking for you.
The incident?
Florida.
Well, it's happened, Lee.
Key West, Florida.
About an hour and a half ago.
We have helicopters in the area making 16 millimeter films of everything they can see from the air.
Meanwhile, the coast line is blocked off and we're at the present time clearing the ocean for 200 miles off shore.
How'd it happen?
Nobody seems to know, exactly.
One reports says there was a small explosion.
Then everyone downwind started dying.
We've closed down all the news media, but we won't be able to keep it quiet for long.
What's the attitude in Washington?
I would describe it as controlled panic.
What do they expect you to do?
Find whoever it is.
Deal with him.
Buy him off, kill him, whatever's necessary.
But meanwhile?
Yes. Speaking.
Oh, are they clear?
That bad, huh?
When will the film be here?
Well, yes, he's here now.
I'll tell him.
I'll get back to you as soon as I've seen the film.
Goodbye.
They have the film on Florida and they're shipping a print out here right away.
Cavanaugh tells me that he and his staff have drawn a complete blank.
They checked out everything and everybody in Station Three, except Hoffman.
I want you to get on Hoffman.
And push Cavanaugh on that Ainsley lead.
That's the only one we've got.
And we're not going to be able to control this thing very much longer.
Yes, sir.
Oh, that film is going to arrive at Station Three about 4:00.
Get it here as soon as it arrives.
Get me this number, will you, Ann?
Now, you left the research center in Zurich after you accepted your position here.
Is that correct?
Yes. But as you know,
I went on a four-week motor tour before I reported.
Reported to Washington?
Yes. Well, actually, to the United States Counsel at Naples before I boarded the Da Vinci.
And that was in...
That was five months ago.
The exact date was...
Oh, I have it here.
You were out of touch while touring?
I had no set plans.
I motored through the Tyrol, across the Brenner,
Lake Lugano.
Naturally, if I had been needed here immediately...
It was a... It was kind of therapeutic irresponsibility.
Lee, we just got the last word on Ainsley.
Looks like we're on target.
Excuse me.
Mr. Barrett.
Yes?
That bulletin over the radio about the trouble in Florida, the...
It sounded as if...
We think it's the botulinus.
My God.
Why, Mr. Barrett?
We don't know.
But for what purpose?
We're trying to find that out. Excuse me.
He's disappeared.
The Santa Barbara house and the Phoenix place have been closed for months.
He was last seen in his New York place.
How long ago was that?
Eight months.
We ran everybody who ever said hello to him through the wringer.
His ex-housekeeper in New York said that he told her he was going on a world tour.
Somebody bought the tickets.
Travel agency must have a schedule.
She said Ainsley is not the kind of man you ask questions of.
Well, what does he look like?
We have any pictures?
No.
There's no reason for anybody to keep a file on him.
No pictures, newspaper morgue, no personal stuff?
None. He's an eccentric.
No pictures, no relatives, no public life.
Visual description from all concerned.
Age, 50-something. Height, medium.
Hair, brown. Coloring, normal.
Distinguishing characteristics, none.
No other leads, nothing?
No.
If anybody could beat any haystacks any flatter than we have.
Lee, look. He's the only name that's dropped into this from the outside.
And he's vanished from the face of the earth.
Everything we know about him fits the man that sent that telegram.
Lunatic fringe, crank, rich, with resources.
Now, it's too much to be a coincidence.
Barrett here.
Thank you.
The film is here.
I thought something had happened when I didn't hear from you.
What?
I see.
Everything's perfect here.
What?
Where?
Where?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, we can.
Well?
No doubt about it.
Williams here. Thank you.
Hello, sir.
We're looking at the film now.
Michaelson said there's no question about it.
Did they tell them everything?
No, sir, I'm sorry,
I can't.
Not a thing.
I understand. Goodbye.
Well, they've had to give the press everything.
Except the connection with Station Three.
Hello.
Yes.
Who is this?
Who is this?
All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.
You have seen what I have done in Florida.
You have ignored my order.
Continue, and you will sacrifice hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.
Who is this?
Who is this?
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.
Now listen, don't hang up.
I'll agree to meet you anywhere you say.
But you must realize that we have to discuss...
Operator! Operator!
A call just came through on this phone, trace it.
Why not?
This is vitally important.
Well, why is it impossible?
I see.
This number can be reached by an area code number.
That call could have come from any place in the country.
It would take a week to track it down, if then.
Don't interrupt.
All right,
I'm listening. Go ahead.
You've seen what I've done in Florida.
You have ignored my order.
Continue, and you will sacrifice hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.
Los Angeles next.
Noon tomorrow!
Who is this?
Who is this?
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.
Now listen, don't hang up.
I'll agree to meet you anywhere you say.
But you must realize that we have to discuss...
Operator! Operator!
A call just came through on this number, trace it.
We have to get every man in the country to find him.
We're already doing that, but it's too late, he could be anywhere.
And he has those flasks.
Yes, I know that General, and we can't evacuate Los Angeles.
We don't have time.
We'll have to try.
Meanwhile, we keep stalling and hope for a break.
Sir.
Don't you think we should capitulate?
Station Three will only be the beginning.
It's a bluff. It must be.
No one would do such a thing.
Are you prepared to take that chance?
Bring the tape recorder with you.
There's no point in continuing this charade of hiding out here.
Lee, I'd like to have you check out...
What is it?
Why did he give his name?
It doesn't make any sense.
It would have been better to keep us guessing.
I don't agree.
That's exactly what a paranoid would do.
You heard that voice.
A monstrous ego working.
No, sir, there's something wrong.
What?
I can't put my finger on it,
I don't really know.
We'll be at Station Three.
I checked out the car for you, Lee.
He got a flat coming down the canyon.
Where?
It was picked up about a half mile down the road.
A couple hundred feet above split rock.
You remember, we caught some trout there.
You can still see the marks on the shoulder.
See you.
What's the significance of the car, Lee?
Nothing, just checking, you check everything.
Is that where the car got the flat?
Well, the car slipped off the jack.
Obviously, he tried to dig a hole to get it back on and couldn't, so he abandoned it.
Come on.
All right, sit down here, Ann.
Now follow me on this.
Everybody figures that whoever took the bugs got out.
They're gone.
The inside assist,
Ostrer, he's dead.
But let's suppose that there's another man that's tied up in all this, who's still here, who can't get out.
Why does he have to get out?
Why doesn't he just stay here?
Because he's got something vital.
Something that Ainsley's got to have, and he's got to have in a hurry.
I don't understand.
Two men got into E Lab.
One got out as Baxter, he walked out.
The other one through the fence with the bugs.
Let's say that they met this third man, who took all the flasks, except two, which he gave to them, and then they took off, probably in Baxter's car.
One flask for Florida.
One for Los Angeles.
I've got that.
Now, let's say that this third man takes off with the rest of the flasks.
But he's got one more thing that he must do.
Knock off Ostrer, who's a threat somehow.
Let's say he knocks off Ostrer, comes down this road, free and clear.
And then the nightmare of all criminals happens.
The senseless accident.
The flat.
Right!
He tries to fix it, the car slips off the jack.
Now he's stuck.
What would you do?
I'd hitchhike down the road.
But the bugs?
You couldn't take a chance on taking them with you and you wouldn't leave them in the car.
So, where would you put them where they'd be safe?
Where you could get to them when you were free to and where they'd stay cool.
The water.
I'd hide them in the water.
That's what I think.
Lee!
Whose car was that?
Just stand.
Perfectly still.
Handle that gently.
Those misses were intentional.
Stand exactly where you are, Ann.
And that I presume was Doctor Baxter?
Just put the flask back in the box.
Sit down.
There's a phone call for you in the administration,
Mr. Cavanaugh.
Thank you.
Absolutely no sign of them.
We checked out
Barrett's car.
No sign of violence there or anywhere.
Just some footprints down by the bank of the stream.
Nothing else.
Have you heard anything here?
No.
He hasn't been missing long.
He could be anywhere.
You know what he's like, sir.
I don't understand why Barrett is so interested in Dr. Hoffman's car.
I don't either, sir.
The Highway Patrol officer said...
Yes?
Mr. Cavanaugh?
Johnson's on the line.
Put him on.
Hello?
Yes, Johnson.
No sign of them in any of the places we've looked in town.
Keep looking.
Yes, sir.
The officer said that Barrett just wanted to know where the doctor had had the flat.
Well, so what? We knew about it.
You had a flat last night.
You started to hitchhike, they picked you up outside of town and brought you here.
I was very lucky.
That road is lonely at night, but I was picked up in the canyon.
Not outside of town.
Yes.
Barrett is liable to call us anytime from anywhere.
I think it means nothing.
I've pulled all the roadblocks.
You want me to put them back, just in case?
No point in that.
Yes?
There's a call for Dr. Hoffman.
Put it through. Doctor.
Doctor Hoffman?
Yes.
Hello, Gregor, this is Donald.
Sorry to disturb you, but we were going fishing this afternoon, remember?
Well, I... I couldn't,
I was tied up here.
Sorry you missed out, the fishing was good.
Do you have to work tonight?
We're at your trailer. How about dinner?
Well, Donald,
I... I do not see how...
I wish you could.
There's something I want to talk to you about.
Well, it would be very nice, Donald...
There's no need for you to stay here now.
Jeff, run the Doctor home.
All right, Eric.
Thank you.
I will be there in a few minutes, Donald.
Good.
Thank you.
He stopped on the road, slid down the bank, and got to the flasks before we did.
This is the only place we had to hide 'em.
I know it was taking a chance to call you.
But I was afraid you were caught.
He knew about your car.
Now we're stuck.
There are roadblocks all over the place.
Everything's fine, Donald.
Nobody's suspicious, and the roadblocks have been removed.
It seems that Mr. Barrett is so unpredictable that nothing has been made of their disappearance.
Did Los Angeles go as planned, Veretti?
I put it there.
We will take them with us.
That's dangerous.
If there is any trouble, they will be our best protection.
There's nothing happening yet.
They're still all in the trailer.
What about the manager?
Oh, we're keeping the manager out of the way.
Do you think Barrett saw you?
Possibly.
But he'd never recognize me, he's never seen me before.
Can you see anything going on in there?
There's no movement, no sound, no, nothing happening.
Keep on the line.
Why would Dr. Hoffman be connected with this?
Why? I don't understand.
He checked out perfectly.
There's nothing in his background to indicate that he's...
Dr. Michaelson, please.
We've got to grab them, sir.
Right now.
Certainly not,
Cavanaugh.
Now, we know that Barrett is in Dr.
Hoffman's trailer with two strange men.
And we know that Dr. Hoffman is there and he's connected with those men.
And we know Dr. Hoffman's car had some special significance to Barrett.
And that's all we know.
We don't even know if Barrett went there willingly or unwillingly.
Let me grab them, sir, and I'll find out.
I don't think you'd find out anything that would be worth losing the only advantage we have.
What is that?
They will lead us to Ainsley, to the flasks.
Only the flasks are important.
This is the break we've been praying for.
They're going to leave.
We let them.
Then we shadow them, very carefully.
Let one eager beaver show our hand, and we're through.
Now set it up.
In the desert we're okay, not much traffic.
But we could lose them in the first town.
And what if they head for that mess that'll be coming out of Los Angeles?
We'll change our strategy by then.
At least we'll know which way they're headed.
Set it up.
Yes, sir.
The evacuation of
Los Angeles is under way.
It is too early to say yet how effective this will be, or how possible it will be.
There is no further official word as to the exact imminence of the threat.
It means nothing.
There are military training fields all around here.
Incident in Florida is related to this situation.
I'm staying above and behind them.
They're still traveling west on 17.
They seem to be stalling.
They're almost going around in circles.
Why?
Evasive action.
They're taking the long way to wherever they're going.
It's getting a little difficult to keep them in sight.
This is pretty rough country and it's closing in on the road.
I don't like this section they're going through.
It's impossible to keep visual contact without the chopper tipping its hand.
There are only three points they can come out of there, here, here and here.
You have men covering all of them, haven't you?
Yes, sir. I'll double up here and here.
I'm going to lose them for a long stretch now.
Unless I close in.
Don't close up, stay out of sight until you can pick them up on the other side of the section.
Will do.
Where's your follow car?
Right here.
Tell him not to move until he can make absolutely sure that the road ahead is clear.
Yes, sir.
Hold your position unless you can see the road is clear ahead.
Understood.
You'll have no problem, Veretti?
None.
You know where I'll be.
It'd be better if we stayed together.
Got 'em again.
They're moving down the grade.
They're going to be out in the open desert any minute.
Back away to 1-1-9-30 and stay out of sight.
Right.
Tell your follow car to close up.
Zebra to X-Ray.
Position ahead clear now, move up.
Understood. Moving up.
Donald!
Is he following?
I don't know.
Take that turn.
They've turned left onto Seco Road now.
They slowed down and...
Well, for a moment we got awfully close to them.
Did they see you?
Well, I'm not sure, they might have.
You want us to take them if they spot us?
No!
Only if they stop, and if they do, get on the radio immediately.
Understood.
Pull in up there and let's see what this is.
Damn!
Hello, Zebra, come in!
This is X-Ray.
Hello, Zebra, come in.
This is X-Ray.
Hello.
Ah, it's dead.
Come out and keep your hands up!
Show yourself and keep your hands in the air.
Come out and show yourself.
We're armed with riot guns.
Now, come out of there with your hands up!
All right, drop that gun.
Tell them I'll throw it.
Don't move.
Just do exactly whatever he tells you to do.
Toss the shotguns on the ground.
Throw them down.
And the revolvers.
Easy!
I'm now hovering over 1-1-9-3-3-0.
Nothing but empty road.
Stay put.
Veretti?
What about the girl?
Why don't you take her with you?
Lee.
Take her with you.
Ann, get out of here.
What the hell kind of a thing was that?
Shh!
Don't you see, he's going to throw the flask.
It'll probably come through one of those two holes.
Where ever it comes through, we've got to grab it.
We've got to.
If it smashes on the wall or the floor or any of these objects, the three of us are dead men.
If we miss it,
I'll douse it with this.
It's hygroscopic.
It has an affinity for water.
This isn't water, it's kerosene.
It's got water in it.
Besides, it's all we've got.
Sand. Put sand on it!
Lee!
Let's go!
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Something's wrong,
Cavanaugh.
Two more minutes, and we go in there.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Come in, X-Ray!
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray.
Come in, X-Ray.
This is Zebra, come in, X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Come in, X-Ray, come in.
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray.
Come in.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Come in, X-Ray.
This is Zebra, come in, X-Ray.
Come in, this is Barrett.
Cone in, X-Ray, this is Zebra.
Come in, this is Barrett.
Cone in, X-Ray, come in.
Move and I'll smash it!
I'll never be taken alive.
Your friends can't help you.
You're on your own now.
I always have been.
You might be able to take this away from me before I could smash it.
But it would not help you.
The flask in Los Angeles.
Exactly.
You cannot evacuate the city.
If anything happens to me,
Los Angeles will be a cemetery by this time tomorrow.
If things go your way and it's announced that Station
Three is being destroyed, will you take me to where the flask is and immobilize it?
Perhaps you had better get in the car, Mr. Barrett.
On the other side.
I determined in the laboratory that only a four and a half pound pressure shatters this flask.
I can easily apply that.
I spotted the station wagon again.
They're still moving north on Seco Road.
Any sign of the follow car?
No.
It looks like there's some kind of fire back there where they came from.
A lot of orange flame on the horizon.
You'd better get somebody in there, fast.
What are your plans now, what do you intend to do, Mr. Ainsley?
Ah, I can't believe how stupid I've been.
Ainsley's been missing for months and
Hoffman's been on the scene for months.
Or at least you're an impersonation of the real Hoffman.
What happened to him?
That's not hard to figure.
Gregor Hoffman, living in Vienna, hired by Baxter from Austria.
Did you kill him or did you have him killed?
You're no biochemist, how did you fool them?
I am a biochemist,
Mr. Barrett, of sorts.
If you were more familiar with the name Ainsley, you'd know I made my fortune in patent medicines.
Sometimes a little bit of knowledge goes a long way.
The accent? Easy.
I lived for years in Austria.
Besides, Gregor Hoffman, though he lived an obscure life, was a world famous chemist.
You don't ask a famous chemist the formula for salt.
But Ostrer did.
You had everyone fooled but Ostrer.
He knew you weren't the real Hoffman, so he died, too.
That tone is surprisingly juvenile,
Mr. Barrett.
I believe that hundreds of people might have died in Florida.
This afternoon when I was interrogating you, you heard Cavanaugh say that.
Ainsley was our man.
Then you knew what to do.
Somehow you made two telephone calls.
One to your boys to pick up the flasks where you had to leave them in the stream and the other to the General.
So you could give us your ultimatum on Los Angeles.
Use the name C.R. Ainsley so he would drop the road blocks and you could get out, and he fell for it.
That's correct.
I didn't make the telephone calls somehow,
Mr. Barrett.
I made them from
Station Three.
As you're so fond of saying there's no such thing as perfect security.
Don't try it, Mr. Barrett.
You're lucky but you're mortal.
We all are.
Tank vehicles carrying liquids, assembly point B.
Ambulance section re-designated, C.
Repeat, ambulance section re-designated, C.
Control requests the following be read at five minute intervals.
An unidentified scientific research installation based in Southern California has ceased operation.
It will be dismantled and cease to exist. End announcement.
There he is.
Who's that with him?
I don't know.
You're under arrest,
Doctor Hoffman.
You're Lee Barrett, aren't you?
That's right.
What are you doing here, Barrett?
That's a long story.
Get out of the car, Doctor.
Be careful, he's got a flask in his pocket.
All right, hand it over, Doctor.
Right now.
The end of the line?
All right, get into the car, Doctor.
Better come along with us, Barrett.
How did you get here?
We're spread all over the place.
This is one of
50 we're covering.
What about the girl and the two other guys?
I don't know.
Where's Cavanaugh?
They could be anywhere.
Our orders were to pick up Hoffman, stay off the radio, and don't say a word until we get him to Station Three.
Have you got enough sense to keep your mouth shut?
Yes.
We've got a jack-knifed truck up here.
You can turn your engine off.
It won't be long.
The tow truck will have it out of here in a few minutes.
Anybody hurt?
No, he was lucky.
We got a jack-knifed truck, it won't be long.
Won't be long he says.
Did you ever hear a cop say anything else?
It'll be hours.
By that time, that mess from L.A. will hit us and we'll never move.
Look at all those cans and busted beer bottles.
You'd think people wouldn't throw things out there like that.
You got a match?
Would you look at the jerk handling that tow truck?
He's worse than the man that was driving the rig.
Oh, boy, that's all we need.
A sidewalk superintendent.
Wise guy, huh?
There's your daughter, but what's happened to Barrett?
Where's Hoffman?
Dad! Dad!
Dad, Lee's dead.
They threw a flask, they threw a flask back at the gas station.
What happened to Barrett, where is he?
You've got to go clear out the area.
He's at the station.
Don't you understand?
That man Veretti, he threw a flask.
Sir.
Where is the Satan Bug?
Hoffman took it.
He changed cars and he went back the way we came from.
What kind of car was it?
It was a green Ford sedan.
License?
Oh, I don't know,
I couldn't see it very clearly.
It was FGA, something, 7, I think.
Put it on the radio.
Hey, give me that stuff.
Dad, you've got to go back and clear out that area.
That's all right, dear, that's all right.
The flask is harmless now.
The station burned.
There's nothing to worry about.
We found the bodies of Cavanaugh's men, but not Lee's.
But Lee was in the building.
He was in the building.
Well, he's not there now.
Ann, Los Angeles, did anyone say anything about Los Angeles? Anything?
No. Nothing.
Put everything you've got on Hoffman's car.
Yes, sir.
We're already on it.
But there are an awful lot of green Fords around.
And there's nothing on these guys except this stuff.
Guns, money, watches, phony drivers license and keys.
Maybe one of the keys fits something in Los Angeles.
But how the hell do we check that?
Sounds like the ignition.
Take a look at that fuel pump.
You didn't really think that I'd fall for those goons of yours posing as Cavanaugh's men, did you?
Okay, I've got the gun now.
Put the bottle down and step away from it before that copter of yours settles down.
You haven't given me any reason why I won't smash this.
This is the end of the line,
Ainsley.
For real now.
Put the bottle down and step away from it or I'll blow a hole in your head!
You're psychotic, but don't be stupid.
If I blow a hole in your head or you drop that bottle, you'll die, then you'll have nothing.
Perhaps I am psychotic, but I'm certainly not stupid.
If I smash this,
I wouldn't die, Mr. Barrett.
Why do you think
Baxter waited so long before telling anyone about the Satan Bug.
Why do you think he was working nights?
Weekends?
The vaccine!
Well, I waited for the vaccine.
Two days ago he made it, that's why he had to die and Ostrer.
You were wrong about him, too.
He didn't suspect me.
He didn't suspect anyone.
He just knew about the vaccine and now I'm the only one who has the formula.
And the vaccine is in my bloodstream.
I'm immune!
I won't die, I'm immune!
But you told us what the Satan Bug would do.
You mean to say that you'd live on this world alone?
By yourself?
I told you about the Satan Bug to keep you from finding Baxter.
Even so, he believed every word I said.
But I'm not sure how good a biochemist he was.
Some scientists thought that the
H-bomb would start a chain reaction that would blow up the world, but it didn't.
Now, nobody really knows about this.
Theoretically, yes.
But it hasn't yet been put to the real test.
Perhaps it will destroy all life.
Perhaps.
Certainly it could destroy millions.
Do you want to test it?
Mr. Ainsley?
Yes.
I was watching for you and saw the car stop.
Thought I'd better pick you up here.
The engine failed.
Don't worry about it, we'll take off immediately.
Yes, sir.
Any trouble, Mr. Ainsley?
No, no.
Well, Mr. Barrett?
The flask is still in
Los Angeles.
Still nothing?
I'm afraid not, sir.
Nothing on Los Angeles, nothing at all?
Nothing of any consequence.
Hello.
Only two tie-ups to Los Angeles.
One of them is an office building, here.
Where?
Ten stories high, we've got men going through them.
Starting from the top.
Now, the only other thing is this little notation in red ink.
Glendale 73.
We've got men calling on every house with 73, every phone number beginning with 73, every cab, well, you get the idea, sir.
Yes.
Veretti did that, he was doodling while they were waiting for Hoffman.
Hold on, Jack, take this.
Well, they found the green car.
Where?
It was abandoned in front of a restaurant next to a service station near Palmdale.
They were both closed, but a watchman in a gravel yard across the street saw the green car park and two men get out.
He described
Hoffman perfectly.
And the other man?
It sounds like Barrett.
Well, what happened to them?
There were two other men waiting in a black car.
They held guns on the first two.
Then they got in the black car and all four drove off.
Didn't the night watchman try to stop them?
No.
God!
There's something else.
The watchman said one of the men was carrying something that looked like a small flask.
No license plate on the black car?
Wrong angle, couldn't see it.
Eric.
This was doodled by that maniac, Veretti.
Look at this.
That could be a flask.
It is a flask.
I think all these are flasks.
That is something real.
He's unconsciously trying to draw or doodle something.
What is it?
Those lines look like parking dividers on a parking lot.
Sir, look at this.
A diamond?
A baseball diamond?
A baseball stadium?
Jack, give me that.
Put me on Los Angeles 47 right away.
Hopeless, isn't it,
Mr. Barrett? And pathetic.
They can't run away.
Nobody can.
There's plenty of time.
Anything?
Nothing.
Anything over there?
Nothing yet.
Telephone for you,
Captain.
It's Mr. Cavanaugh.
Hello!
Yes, we're here looking.
Nothing.
Yes, they're looking there.
Of course, we'll look in there.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
We'll be running out of land pretty soon.
And time. Where is the flask,
Mr. Ainsley?
Don't press,
Mr. Barrett.
Judas H. Priest!
Get Olsen!
Olsen!
Fifteen, 20 degrees, eight miles.
Now, here is the helicopter, sir.
We've kept everything away from it.
But we think it's the one.
Fifteen, fifteen degrees, four miles.
Here it is, sir. Here it is now.
It's a new plot.
No voice contact?
No, sir. We're on
113.6 Los Angeles radio.
They should be on this setting if they're trying to contact us.
Hold that.
That cap is fulminated mercury.
So don't drop it.
Sometimes you're booby trapped.
You cut the wires and phfft.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's it.
Now, don't anybody move a muscle, till we get this thing collected.
We're heading for Catalina.
You don't have any intentions of going where the flask is, do you?
As much as you have of destroying Station Three.
That's not very clear thinking, Ainsley.
If you intend to take Los Angeles,
I'll take you,
I've got nothing to lose.
Except this.
I see, he takes you to a yacht, and tomorrow you get on the mike and you dictate your terms.
That's right.
You'll become everything, everyone else, nothing!
And then?
Then, for the first time in the world...
What are your plans for the world, Ainsley?
War, peace, back to the middle ages?
Forward to the future?
It doesn't make any difference what you choose, because it all means one thing to you.
Power!
Power for its own sake!
You're a little man again, Ainsley.
Where's the flask?
Your life for Los Angeles.
Oh, no. Los Angeles will be my epitaph.
Los Angeles radio, come in.
Los Angeles radio, come in.
This is Williams, Lee, we've been following you on radar scope.
I've got the big one, it's safe.
Hoffman's over the side.
I can't give you any information on the other flask.
We found it, Lee, it's safe.
What about Ann?
I'm here, Lee.
She's here with us.
What was that you said about Hoffman?
He jumped!
Oh, and tell Cavanaugh to stop looking for Ainsley.
Ainsley and Hoffman were the same man.
I'll be setting down at LAX.
Tell the boys to be on the lookout for me.
I'm a little rusty at these things.
We'll meet you there, Lee.
Take it nice and easy and for God's sake make a good landing.
I'll put down safely and I'll give you the flask.
And then we're right back where we started.
Station announcer: The train standing at Platform 2 is the 4:50 for Ealing Broadway, Hanwell,
Hayes, West Drayton,
Langley, Taplow, Milchester and Brackhampton.
- Tickets, please,
- A woman has been strangled,
- Pardon?
- A man strangled a woman in a train,
- I saw it out there!
- Strangled?
Yes, strangled,
You must do something,
Me? Well...
Madam, don't you think you had a nap and maybe had a bad dream?
Young man, I was not dreaming,
What are you going to do about it?
Well... we'll be in Brackhampton in about five minutes,
- I'll report it then,
- Thank you,
- Can I have your details?
- Of course,
Miss Jane Marple,
- Marple?
- Marple,
Old Pasture Lane,
- Milchester,
- Milchester, I see,
I'll report it to the stationmaster...
- Yes, please do,
- Thank you,
A bad dream indeed,
All right, Lucy, I'll answer that,
- Good morning...
- Not today,
Inspector Craddock, County ClD,
Oh, I am so sorry,
Do come in, lnspector,
I've been going through all the papers for the last two days and not a word about the murder,
I suppose the police asked the press to say nothing for now,
Do sit down,
Lull the murderer into a false sense of security, then pounce!
What's that?
Oh, how stupid of me, I am so sorry,
Lucy!
You will have some tea, won't you?
- Oh...
- Tea for the lnspector, please,
Yes, ma'am,
Well now, have you got him?
Well, l... that is... ,, we've come to the conclusion that what you saw on the train was... ,, a man and a woman...
Yes, as I said,
I mean... perhaps they were honeymooners?
Inspector, I may be what is termed a spinster, but I do know the difference between horseplay and murder,
Yes, Miss Marple, but there's been a full search of every train and no hospital has treated any such woman,
She was blonde, with a fur collar coat,
No such woman was seen getting on or off a train alone or accompanied,
Of course not, she was dead!
The tracks were searched for the whole length of the line - negative,
Oh, so you don't believe me?
I didn't mean to imply that,
- You did,
- Not at all,
What then?
A woman cannot be murdered on a busy train without our finding out about it,
I'm sure you mean well, lnspector, but if you imagine that I am going to sit back and let everybody regard me as a dotty old maid, you are very much mistaken,
Good day!
I'm sorry, The Hatrack Hanging,
Falcon Smith's latest, we haven't received our copy yet,
Plain inefficiency,
- Let me know the moment it comes in,
- Of course, Mrs Stainton,
- Good morning, Miss Marple,
- Good morning, Mr Stringer,
Good morning, Hilda,
One moment... ,, The Hatrack Hanging,
I've been keeping it for you,
- Would you say I am unstable?
- Certainly not,
- In full possession of my faculties?
- Absolutely...
- Not given to hallucinations?
- No,
Thank you, Mr Stringer,
- The police think I'm dotty,
- What?
Apparently,
I saw a young man and woman in the throes of connubial bliss,
If I were you, Miss Marple,
I would write to the Chief Constable,
Mr Stringer, how many detective novels have we read over the years?
Impossible to say,
Certainly hundreds,
Yes, which gives us a certain knowledge of the criminal mind?
Most assuredly,
Well, this is where we put that knowledge to the test,
- We?
- Yes, we!
So it has come in!
Oh, has it?
Well, I think I have first call,
You won't like it, Too obvious,
The mother did it, of course,
How do you know? It's just come in,
It always is with Falcon Smith,
A deprived child, you know,
Crumpets for tea,
Mr Stringer, if you care to join me,
Indeed I would, Miss Marple,
Ah, yes, here we are,
I calculate the five o'clock express to Brackhampton overtook my train somewhere about there,
How can you be sure?
The ticket collector said five minutes to Brackhampton,
He came in more than a minute after the murder,
So that makes it six minutes before
Brackhampton at, say, 30 mph,
So... about there!
The body, Miss Marple?
That was thrown from the train between here and Brackhampton,
- The police found nothing,
- Of course not,
The murderer returned before the search and disposed of the body,
By Jove, the police will want to investigate now,
They say there is no investigation,
- Surely, a fresh search...
- Yes, but we will conduct our own,
- Eh?
- Yes, Mr Stringer,
I recommend a hearty breakfast tomorrow,
You and I are going to take an early morning walk!
There must be something somewhere,
A body can't be thrown out of a fast-moving train without some trace,
If we linger here much longer, we shall certainly be apprehended,
Nonsense! No one will give two tracklayers a second glance,
I'm not convinced our disguises are adequate,
A shoe, a bit of cloth... something,
Our timetable may have been out of date, but I'm sure the 7:15 is still running,
- Very possibly,
- It could be most dangerous up here,
Undoubtedly,
Miss Marple!
- Miss Marple!
- Yes?
There you are!
I think I heard something,
I think I've found something,
Really?
Consistent with something having been dumped from a train,
If it was the body, it would roll down and finish up against this wall,
Then where is it?
That, Mr Stringer, is the question,
It could be buried,
You'd need a pick or a shovel,
No, this is hardly an ideal spot for disposing of a body,
Unless...
From her fur collar, I think,
Mr Stringer, will you give me a leg up?
- Really, Miss Marple, l...
- Please, Mr Stringer,
No, no!
Make a stirrup,
That's it, Come on now,
Careful! Are you ready?
- Interlock your fingers!
- They are interlocked!
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes... up!
Magnificent!
Down!
- What a frightful man,
- What a frightful dog!
Miss Marple, prudence demands a retreat,
I am convinced the body is on the other side of this wall,
That's the Ackenthorpe Hall Estate?
I know, Perfect,
Easy enough for someone from the house to get the body and dispose of it in the grounds,
Do you mean one of the family?
Yes, or one of the servants - if they have any,
Servants... I wonder...
Miss Marple, whatever it is, no, no, no!
Mr Stringer, we will withdraw temporarily,
- Good morning,
- Good morning,
There's nothing on my books,
Not so much as a mother's help,
I'm seeking a post, not offering one,
Pray be seated, my good woman,
Seek no more,
You've come to the right place,
How good to see the spirit of unselfish service is still here,
Let me see now,
Yes! Here's a perfect plum,

Own suite, TV, radio and a use of car,
Tea in bed on Sundays,

Oh, no, thank you,
May I have a quiet word with Mrs Binster?
I am Mrs Binster,
Oh, I see,
Well, I wondered if there was a position at Ackenthorpe Hall?
- Ackenthorpe Hall?
- Yes, Ackenthorpe Hall,
Oh, yes,
I think I can accommodate you,
Yes, there's always a vacancy there,
Thank you,
Yes?
I'm Jane, from Mrs Binster's
Employment Agency, the new maid,
Well, you look old enough to know better, Come in,
- I am to see Miss Ackenthorpe,
- You're expected, In there,
- Miss Ackenthorpe?
- Yes,
I'm Jane,
- The new maid?
- Yes, Jane Marple,
If you'll kindly show me where to put my things...
Oh, yes, Yes, of course,
Is this post really what you are looking for?
Well naturally, otherwise I wouldn't be here,
I don't want a housekeeper,
I want someone to... to do the work,
Yes, You want cooking, washing up, beds made, floors scrubbed, fires lit, ashes taken away...
I understand,
- I hope you'll find us suitable,
- Oh, I'm sure I shall,
I hope the work's not too exacting,
There are three of us, myself, my nephew - down for the school holidays - and Father,
- May I show you to your room?
- Yes,
I'll take that, my dear,
Perhaps the clubs, if you don't mind,

Oh yes and very excellent biscuits they were too,
A severe man, I'm afraid,
Miss Marple, I think it only fair to explain that my father is... ,, quite frankly, difficult at times,
He's an invalid,
He's very keen on economy and sometimes says things that upset people,

We'll manage,
Emma!
Emma! I hear you!
- Yes, Father, Excuse me,
- Don't try to sneak off,
- Is the new girl with you?
- Well... yes, Father,
I hope she's got more meat on her than the last one, I hate 'em skinny!
Don't just stand there boggling, bring her in,
Yes... er... will you come in please?
Father, this is Miss Marple, er... Jane,
A plain Jane if I ever saw one,
We can't all be young and handsome can we, Mr Ackenthorpe?
I cannot tolerate impertinence,
Then we should get on admirably - neither can l,
If you're staying and I suppose you've got to, understand this:
Because I live in a big house doesn't mean I'm a rich man,
So don't come here with big ideas,
I live here because I want to, not because I can afford it,
- Father, don't you think...
- No! Can you cook?
If you want good English cooking, yes,
Cod is as good as lobster and much cheaper,
That depends on whether one has a palate unsullied by cheap opiates,
If you mean what I think you mean, this cost two shillings,
Yes, quite,
- I'll show Miss Marple to her room,
- Good idea,
That was Hillman the gardener, When
Father moves about, he calls him,
They're close,
Will you stay, Miss Marple... Jane?
- My dear lady, of course,
- I'm so glad,
Emma, come back here!
You've forgotten my medicine,
Excuse me,
Your room is the door opposite the small stairs,
- I'll find it,
- May I give you those?
- All right?
- Yes, thank you,
Come out, at once!
I advise you to come out!
Very well...
You're Miss Emma's nephew, I presume?
Yes, Alexander Eastley,
How do you do?
How do you do?
I'm Jane, Jane Marple,
Yes... it is disappointing, isn't it?
I'd hoped for a Jayne Mansfield,
You have much in common with your grandfather,
We're very alike in many ways,
Mind you, I'm not mean, He'll stop that vase out of your wages,
It's just as well you got out of the way, or...
It would have been my head and you would get 10 years,
It's still possible,
Not only do you not look like Jayne Mansfield, you're not my idea of a maid either,
Well, quite honestly, I don't think you'd be everybody's idea of a boy,
There's something very fishy about you,
I can see you'll have to go - after Mrs Kidder of course, she's next, depressing creature,
- So was Annie,
- Annie?
Your predecessor, Thin as a rake and a shocking cook, Can you cook?
I think I've done better than Annie,
Grandfather's like that too and he hates a late dinner,
I'd leave the unpacking if I were you,
In that case, you'd better show me to the kitchen, Alexander,
Very well... Jane,
Emma!
That's him - always shouting, mostly about money, This way,
Emma!
They're all waiting for him to drop dead,
Frightful pack of vultures our family, except possibly Aunt Emma,
Who are these vultures?
Uncle Harold - stinking rich and just as mean,
Uncle Albert - deadly dull, poor fellow,
Then there's Uncle Cedric,
He paints, but not for art's sake,
Last year, he and one of his models...
- Alexander!
- He's like that,
- There was an Uncle Edmond,
- Was?
Yes, stopped a whole bomb during the war all by himself,
There wasn't another man around for miles - deserting probably,
Who can be held responsible for you?
Well put, Mummy's name was Edith, but she's dead,
- Daddy is Brian Eastley,
- Oh?
The fighter ace - Battle of Britain,
- Oh, THE Brian Eastley,
- Yes,
I'll set him up in business when
I get my inheritance, Here we are,
There you are, About time, I'm off,
I wouldn't stay here after dark, not for all the tea in China,
The pots and pans are on that shelf there over the stove,
The groceries and provisions are in there,
- Thank you,
- Cheerio,
- Good day,
- Good day,
- What's the matter?
- I was being polite,
Charming, isn't she, Jane?
- You should see this,
- What?
Phase four: Anti-Kidder campaign,
Splendid!
Dinner at eight please, Jane,
I see you made yourself comfortable,
I trust you have no objection?
Maybe,
I shouldn't make yourself too comfortable if I was you,
Yes?
Oh, who are you?
I'm the new maid, sir,
Dr Quimper,
You'll get used to seeing me here,
- Alexander, I suppose,
- Yes, I'm afraid so,
Mr Ackenthorpe will be expecting me,
- I'll show you up,
- That won't be...
Doctor...
Where on earth are my confounded matches?
- It's you,
- Good morning,
Morning,
What are you doing in here?
Snooping, I suppose?
Where are my matches?
If you're going to smoke,
I'll open a window,
I'm a great believer in fresh air,
Aren't you, Doctor?
Why, yes, I am... Miss...
Marple her name, marble her nature!
Let her give me double pneumonia!
If you can't kill me off one way, you'll kill me off another,
You're going to live to be 100 in spite of anything I can do,
Then tell her to stop opening windows and light my cheroot,
Any chance that will send him to sleep, Doctor?
I'm afraid it's a stimulant,
- Roll over,
- Oh, dear,
Hold it closer, woman!
Your home town lost a good horse doctor when you left,
In fact, I was bad with horses,
How did the birthday party go?
Did all the family get down?
Of course they did - made a weekend of it, free board and lodging from Friday night,
- Friday,
- What's that to do with you?
Oh, nothing! It just happened to be an interesting day for me too,
How old were you?
Mind your business,
Anyhow, it was a miserable weekend,
I hope it'll be a long time before
I have to put up with them again,
Not a nice way to talk about one's family,
Not a nice family, You know what that overgrown beatnik Cedric did?
He told Emma in front of me she should get away and get married,
Trying to make her as selfish as he is,
I don't know, If Emma did marry, it wouldn't be such a bad thing,
Father, I thought I'd tell you,
I'm just going into town,
I'm leaving, Can I give you a lift?
Why do you want to go to town?
Can't she go for you?
It's tradesmen, A few bills to pay,
Oh, money, that's a different thing,
You can't trust anybody these days, Off you go,
- May I be of service?
- Thank you,
Of course you can, save the price of a taxi, I pay you enough as it is,
It will be on your bill,
Are you ready?
- Only my coat,
- Good,
Friday then, Mr Ackenthorpe,
Good day, Miss Marple,
Good day, Doctor,
If you don't shut those windows, you'll be fired!
In that case, I shall require four weeks wages in lieu of notice,
- Get out of my sight, woman!
- With pleasure!
Your weight isn't evenly distributed,
I'll have you know that I won the Ladies Open Handicap in 1921,
- Really?
- You must have many things to do,
Not at all, I'm most interested,
We've never had a golf-playing maid,
This is the age of the common woman,
- You hooked,
- I'm aware of it,
- You know something?
- What?
I believe you pulled those shots on purpose,
Alexander, if you wish to be helpful at all, will you kindly look for the hook while I look for the slice,
- Found yours yet?
- Yes, have you?
- Disappeared without a trace,
- Fortunately I have some more,
At the present rate, you're going to need them,
Perhaps you could demonstrate the next one,
Certainly,
Let's see how close you can get to those outbuildings,
Yes, I think that's possible,
Fair,
You know perfectly well it was superb for a boy of my age,
A chip and a putt and I'd have holed out in three,
Does you grandfather keep horses, Alexander?
He did, Now he just keeps relics of a more spacious age,
Nostalgia, you know - a failing of the old, I suppose, Like to look?
Well, I think
I'm old enough, don't you?
An old-fashioned pony chaise,
It was used for going to the village,
And the Victoria for going to church?
Yes, on Sundays in the summer I believe,
The brougham is for the winter perhaps?
Yes, I expect so,
It's haunted here, Grandfather found a man hanging from this rafter,
- Oh!
- He'd been dead for a week,
- All purple, you know,
- Alexander!
- What was that?
- I wonder,
- All right, I'll look,
- All yours,
Dear, dear,
We are nervous, aren't we?
- Pity,
- What did you expect to find?
- Bodies,
- What?
Live ones, of course,
Used to be quite a spot for courting couples till Grandfather got
Hillman to put a stop to it,
Quite extraordinary the goings-on here,
- Apparently, this girl...
- That's enough,
There may be some other poor bird trapped,
Look, Somebody else must have been in here, This isn't Aunt Emma's,
It's mine, I must have dropped it,
Thank you so much,
It was bequeathed to me,
Are you on the run from the police?
Too much television, You must learn to rationalize your imagination,
What's behind there?
More relics from the past?
Yes, The fruits of Grandfather's Egyptian phase,
Indeed,
How interesting,
- No one's allowed in there,
- Let go!
What are you up to?
- The boy was showing me round,
- What boy?
- Alexander!
- You're lying,
Alexander, come out of there at once,
I thought discretion the better part of valour,
He's not above clipping a person's ear,
Your grandfather don't like snoopers,
Don't think I won't tell him neither,
Despite the double negatives,
I'm sure you will, Come, Jane,
Good for you, young man,
What?
No! No!
Now listen, Mr Stringer,
I want you to inform the police anonymously,
Don't mention me yet,
I wish to be in at the kill so to speak,
Miss Marple, really!
All right, but it makes my blood run cold to think of you there alone,
I was wondering perhaps they have a vacancy for a gardener?
They've got one,
Very well, I'll do as you say,
The compact! If the murderer should know that you have it...
I'll be careful, dear Mr Stringer,
Now, phone the lnspector right away,
- Well?
- I've never seen her before,
No, she's not from these parts,
Whoever she is,
I want her out of here at once,
If you hadn't left the barn unlocked, we wouldn't have these people poking their noses in,
- Are you all right, Father?
- Of course I'm all right,
I have seen a corpse before,
I'll be one myself soon,
Perhaps you'd better go back to the house, I'll follow you up,
Whoever it was tried to get her in here first,
It must have taken the strength of a maniac to shift it,
- lnspector?
- Yes, Doctor?
I don't know if this is helpful,
- Go on,
- Well, the woman...
No one recognised her and her clothes struck me as being foreign,
Perhaps French,
Yes, that's very interesting,
Thank you, Doctor,
Well, it was just a thought,
It may be a useful one, Thank you,
That explains why I didn't recognise her, I know every face around here,
I'm sure you do,
I have to assume there's a connection between her and the family,
I think
I'll get the whole bunch down here,
They hate the sight of each other,
So I believe, Anyway, routine first,
Have they got any other servants?
Yes, they have, lnspector,
Good Lord! You!
Yes,
Dotty old me,
In there please,
It's only a cigarette packet - of doubtful significance, I'd say,
I'll bear your views in mind,
Any idea what you expect your fellows to find?
- Clues,
- Well, naturally,
Do you seriously think they'll find anything?
Well, somebody dragged the body from there over to there,
Something could have been dropped in the process, don't you agree?
- Yes, Yes, I do,
- Did you find anything?
No, lnspector, Not a thing,
- The family is here by the way,
- Thank you,
I'll get around to them later,
They'll enjoy that, I'm sure,
Good hunting,
Some idiot strangles his girlfriend, which she probably deserved and what do they do - swarm all over the place and mess about in our private affairs,
I said to lnspector Haddock or whatever his name is...
Craddock, sir, Shall I pour?
Of course,
Anyway,
I said to this fellow, Haddock, that no member of my family had ever seen the woman before,
- What makes you so sure of that?
- Cedric, this is absurd,
She wasn't from around here and she was found in our stable,
One of us could have known her,
- Maybe she was your girlfriend,
- What?
Yes, yes,
I suppose Cedric has a point there,
- He never has a point,
- I mean from the police's viewpoint,
You're not too concerned with the family reputation,
You're not a member of it, are you, strictly speaking?
Who telephoned the police?
Oh, I know who did that!
Oh, who?
Obviously someone who knew the body was there,
Any coffee left, Jane?
Help yourself,
- It certainly wasn't one of us,
- Who knows?
Who cares who did it?
The woman was probably a spy,
- That's absurd,
- The police think she was foreign,
Lots of English girls go to Paris and buy clothes,
Decent ones don't,
Dr Quimper to see you,
Mr Ackenthorpe,
Still getting shot with revitalizers, Father?
I'll take anything to outlive you lot and keep my property from your thieving hands,
I'll go and see if I can be of any further assistance to the police,
Delicious coffee, Jane,
The lnspector said he'd be interrogating you all later,
Better get your alibis ready,
He's a bright boy, that one,
The police say the woman was murdered on Friday and we were down here last Friday,
They will be interested in all of us,
None of us were here till quite late,
Yes, but the point is, what were we all doing earlier?
- Albert, what about you?
- Me?
Don't tell me you were in your office,
- l... well, no,
- Aha!
As a matter of fact, there was a film that I went to see,
- A Brigitte Bardot?
- Cedric, this is preposterous,
Well, is it, Harold? What about you?
Or can your secretary verify your movements on that day?
- None of your business,
- I'm in the clear,
- I was at my club,
- It has a back door, hasn't it?
Yes, I think so, but I didn't get here until Saturday,
You could have lugged the body up here on Friday, slipped back and be sitting in your usual chair when the club closed,
Can one of your women friends vouch for you?
I'm certain my current comfort will satisfy the lnspector completely as no doubt will your secretary,
When you've finished, will you bring me some coffee into the library?
Certainly, sir,
Well, well, Jumpy, isn't he?
- You're very calm,
- I've no reason not to be,
I've just been thinking,
If that woman was foreign...
Think of girls more often - it might bring about some changes,
- I know it's laughable,
- I agree,
No, but I mean if she was French, it could be her I suppose,
I give up, Could be who?
- That Martine woman,
- Martine?
Yes, that French farm girl we had all the trouble about,
The one
Edmund was so infatuated with,
That was ages ago,
Yes, I know,
Still, I suppose it is possible,
Why should she turn up dead in our stable 16 years later?
- It's preposterous,
- It isn't my idea,
Whose idea is it then?
Well, Emma's,
Emma?
Emma's?
That's odd,
Paul!
- Darling...
- No, Paul, please!
How much longer will we go on like this? We've got to tell the old man,
- Not yet, Please, not yet,
- Why? Why?
Paul, I think someone in the family may be a murderer,
Emma!
I've had a letter,
I can't keep it to myself any longer, I want you to read it,
I'm afraid my French isn't up to this yet,
"Dear Miss Ackenthorpe, you will be surprised to hear after so many years that you have a sister-in-law,
I married Edmund two days before he was killed in action,
I decided it was best to forget the marriage, but I'm coming to England and I find
I do wish to meet you all,
I write to you instead of your father because I understand he is a sick man and my existence may come as a shock to him as it must be to you all,
Sincerely yours,
Martine Ackenthorpe,"
I thought Edmund was killed before they married,
- That's what we all thought,
- What's on your mind then?
Don't you see? The strangled woman, it must have been Martine,
If she was really Edmund's widow, she would have a share in the will,
Oh, I see,
Paul, what should I do?
- Have you told the others?
- No,
I did suggest to Albert that if she was French, she might be Martine,
What did he say?
He said it was fantastic, but I think he was worried,
- You have to tell the police,
- They'll think one of us did this,
- What else can you do?
- I don't know, I don't know,
I think you must tell them,
I'll have to think about this,
You'd better go,
- Good afternoon,
- Good afternoon,
- There you are,
- The train was late, Miss Marple,
Oh, good evening, lnspector,
I suppose you knew about this compact business before I did?
Well...
I thought it best to bring the lnspector in on this after all,
- Very wise, Very wise,
- I'm glad you think so,
Withholding information is a very serious matter,
I know, I'm most awfully sorry,
Will you take tea?
Thank you, no,
Do you know what this means - the compact being stolen from you?
Coffee perhaps?
The thief and the murderer are almost certainly one and the same and that he or she is in that house and that your life may be in danger,
Oh, I say, do you really think so?
I must ask you to give the whole thing up... ,, tonight!
Indeed you must, Miss Marple,
Very well,
I'll give in my notice tomorrow,
Good, That's settled then,
It has to be a month's notice, you know,
- Will you have a small beer?
- Miss Marple, l...
Oh, what's the use?
- Good night,
- Good night,
Well, now, How did you get on at the probate registry?
Well, I think in view of what the lnspector said...
- Did you see the will?
- Yes,
What did it say?
Old Mr Ackenthorpe's father obviously didn't get on well with him,
I'm not surprised at that, Go on,
The house and the income from the family fortune are his, but he can't touch the fortune itself,
- That's the first point,
- Yes?
The second point is that the fortune goes to his children on his death, to Emma, Cedric,
Harold and Albert,
Two of the others named in the will,
Edith and Edmund, are already dead,
Much more for the rest,
Young Alexander,
Edith's son, gets her share,
What about his father?
Next of kin only get a share if there's no issue of a marriage,
Eastley's only interest is how much Alexander gets,
- Dr Quimper to see you, sir,
- Oh, yes, Send him in,
Your call to the probate registry has been useful,
- Morning,
- Morning, Sit down,
Thank you,
Have you found out who the woman is yet?
The French police haven't come up with anything,
You're assuming she's French?
The clothes and make-up were made in Paris,
Is that what you wanted to see me about?
No, sir,
I understand last Christmas, old Mr
Ackenthorpe had a stomach upset,
He's inclined to overindulge when there's rich food about,
He said you asked questions as though you suspected arsenic poisoning,
For a moment I did suspect something was a bit odd,
- Didn't you run a food test?
- No,
- Why not?
- There was nothing positive,
No history of chronic gastric trouble that one would expect to find in the classic method of arsenic poisoning,
- You mean small regular doses?
- Exactly,
Excuse me,
Yes?
Oh, put her on,
- Miss Ackenthorpe,
- Emma?
Yes,
- Hello.
- Morning,
I have a letter from...
I see,
Well, would you read the letter to me?
"You will be surprised to hear after so many years..."
Thank you, I'd like to send round for that letter if you don't mind?
We'll check with the French police, Thank you,
Goodbye,
- Do you know what that was about?
- Yes,
- I do,
- Why didn't you tell me?
I'm in love with Emma, lnspector,
I want to marry her,
I told her she should tell you about this,
You didn't insist?
No, it was important to me, to us, that she made up her own mind,
I understand, Doctor,
Thank you, Is that all?
Is the dead woman Martine?
- Who else could it be?
- Was she killed by a family member?
I'd rather not answer that,
All right,
- Thank you,
- Thank you,
Well, sir?
- I'm worried, Bacon,
- About the doctor?
No, no, not him,
I'm worried about Miss Marple,
- Looking for something, Miss Marple?
- No!
Are you... are you all right?
Yes, perfectly, thank you,
What is it you want?
I thought I'd take up the old boy's night cap and save you the trouble,
That's kind of you, It is ready,
A storm, I expect,
The electricity supply is rather shaky, like the rest of the place,
- You're a bit shaky too, aren't you?
- No, not at all,
- Thank you,
- Thank you,
Oh, my goodness! What are you doing?
- Looking for light,
- You ought to be asleep,
I happen to be reading,
Oh,
May I ask what you're doing?
Trying to provide light,
Oh, I see,
You won't find it there, you know,
- lndeed?
- It's a power failure,
Often happens, May I borrow this?
- Alexander, come back!
- Good night, Jane,
Who's that? Who is it?
Oh, Mr Cedric,
It's a power failure, Often happens,
- I'll have to find some candles,
- Just a minute,
My sister says you started work here only a few days ago,
You don't look like a domestic,
I have to earn my living like anybody else,
The day after you arrived, the body was discovered,
- You found it,
- What makes you think that?
It fits and so neatly,
You telephoned the police,
I am not the person who telephoned the police,
- You're not?
- No,
Who are you? What are you doing here?
I have already told you,
I'm going to watch you very closely, Miss Marple... Jane,
Oh, Hillman,
I want to have a word with you,
Get out!
Oh... help!
What is it?
Albert, See to Albert...
Alexander, call the doctor, Quickly!
There was nothing I could do for him,
How are the others?
Emma, Cedric, Harold and Eastley have had only minor effects,
The old man will be all right,
He's a tough old bird,
They will recover by morning,
- No doubt about the cause?
- No,
- They were all poisoned,
- Well... thank you, Doctor,
Quimper! Quimper!
Harold - I might have expected him to bellow the hardest,
This is the last chicken stock,
- Finished?
- Just about,
See that stuff gets to the lab,
That's it for tonight,
Well?
Mushroom soup, curried duck and rice and apple pie,
Thank you,
- Mushroom soup out of a can?
- Certainly not,
Half a pound of mushrooms, chicken stock, milk, flour, lemon juice, a touch of herbs...
Hmm, mushrooms?
I had some of the soup myself - superb!
Oh, I'm sure! The pie?
I'm afraid I never can resist my own pie, inspector,
Anybody else's, of course,
- The curry?
- Exactly,
Good, of course, but rice you see... fattening... and as I was having the pie...
Where did the duck come from?
Oh, those... Mr Harold shot them,
He seems to be rather fond of killing things,
Alexander doesn't seem to have had any curry either?
No, I thought it would appeal to him,
Curious child,
Well, did anyone enter the kitchen while the cooking was going on?
Not while I was there,
I do have other duties, you know,
Anyone could have come in,
Six people are poisoned... only one dies,
I'm thinking about that too, lnspector,
Message from the Chief Constable,
- He's waiting for your report,
- All right,
- In person, sir,
- Get the car, I'll be a minute,
Very good,
I think the two killings are connected, don't you?
Yes, I do,
We've got to find out who has that compact,
I've only been able to search one room,
- Oh, whose?
- Unfortunately, Albert's,
Oh!
- Miss Marple, I have to go,
- Oh, yes, I know,
A policeman's work is never done,
Nor a woman's,
I was going to say, please be careful,
If you think of anything, do take me into your confidence,
The lab boys turned it up as arsenic in the curry,
Not a lot, just enough for stomach aches, Not enough to kill,
- So Albert had an extra dose?
- Why poison the others at all?
If the poisoner is a member of the family, he had to be ill as well,
Well, say it isn't, sir,
I mean that gardener of theirs -
Hillman,
Locals say he's in for a nice bequest when old Ackenthorpe goes,
- It is a possibility,
- You're forgetting the dead woman,
This poisoning means she was Martine Ackenthorpe,
Have the French police come up with something then?
Only that there's no record of a marriage,
The village where Ackenthorpe was stationed was blown to bits,
- All files were destroyed,
- Well?
Don't you see, it's the pattern of the killings,
Only a family member would want her dead too,
Yes, kill off all your relations in easy stages except the old man,
When he dies naturally, inherit the fortune and the property,
Albert must have got his second dose after dinner, possibly in a drink,
Don't drink that,
- Why not?
- Because it's lunch time,
Oh! What is it?
Beef broth and baked custard,
- Beef broth? I ordered beefsteak,
- The doctor said beef broth,
To blazes with him!
I give the orders,
I'm sick of slops, Take it away!
Certainly,
Hillman, another bottle,
Surely you know that if the woman was Martine, by giving the letter to the police the finger points at one of us,
Not only for her death, but Albert's too,
- Exactly, One of us,
- I expected that from you!
Oh, come now, you're thinking exactly as I am,
If you didn't do it... you're thinking it was me,
Stop it! Stop it!
Or even you, dear Emma,
I think we've had enough of this nonsense,
I bet the police don't think so,
Say what you like, but please leave Emma out of it,
Well, it could be argued that Emma kept that letter to herself to use it to her own advantage,
You'd better explain that,
Well, the moment Martine's body was discovered everyone in this family was under suspicion, including you, Emma,
The moment you produced the letter, everyone was under suspicion... excluding you,
- I hadn't thought of it like that,
- You must be round the bend,
The woman was strangled, Do you think your sister capable of that?
Oh, but Emma's an attractive woman, don't you think so?
Well?
A pretty lady doesn't need to do her own dirty work,
Emma, let's leave them to it,
Now, now, Eastley, Emma has her eye on the doctor, you know,
It won't be so easy for you to marry into the family again,
Oh, that hit home, didn't it?
Yes and I'm about ready to break your blasted neck,
Very possibly, but tell me something first,
Did you meet Emma secretly the night before the body was found?
- Well, l...
- Hillman saw you,
We did meet that night, yes,
- He asked me to mediate with Father,
- Oh, what for?
I wanted to borrow money,
Oh, my goodness!
What are you doing?
- Making up the bed,
- You made it up this morning,
Yes but the pillowslips need changing,
They look all right to me,
But not to me,
Oh, what am I doing?
I do wish that woman would hurry up,
They know I don't like the dark,
Are you afraid some man will get you?
It's funny how things come together,
My sister's eldest had measles and then her Ernie broke his arm and her husband came out all over with boils, all in the same week,
You wouldn't believe it, would you?
It will be the same thing here,
First that nasty murder, then Mr Albert poisoned,
Who's going to be next?
Things always go in threes,
Here you are,
Sorry to keep you, but the doctor was with Mr Ackenthorpe,
Hmm! Long wait for very little,
The younger generation,
Well, I don't know!
What's the matter?
It's Mr Harold,
Did he use it or did somebody else pull the trigger?
It adds up if it was suicide,
Harold killed the other two, got cold feet and took the easy way out,
They all knew he liked shooting before dinner at the Hall,
He was shot from a two-inch range,
All right,
Someone he knows casually asks him for the gun and...
It could still be suicide,
That's what the murderer wants us to think,
We can't risk any more killings,
Come on,
- Where to, sir?
- The Hall,
I'll find the compact even if I have to turn the place upside down,
Excuse me, sir, there's a Miss Marple to see you,
- Come in, Good afternoon,
- You were going somewhere?
- Yes,
- I'll come to the point at once,
Beautiful little piece, isn't it?
- Who had it?
- Alexander,
I should have realised,
That boy's incorrigible,
Playing it at midnight like that,
Typical,
- So we're back where we began?
- No, lnspector,
I think I knowwho our murderer is,
The difficulty is getting him to show his hand,
- Sit down, Miss Marple,
- Thank you,
Hold that expression,
Oh, pity, you spoilt it,
What's the matter?
Things not working out for you?
You make everything you say sound like an insinuation,
He works at it,
Do stop fussing, Quimper,
If I wish to come down,
I shall do so,
I think this chair, Hillman,
- Father, don't you...
- Don't start!
Sorry, Emma, but once his mind is made up...
I'm not going to stay up there all alone,
Might get murdered in my bed,
At least there's safety in numbers,
- I quite agree with you,
- That makes a nice change,
I want a drink,
No, not you... Quimper,
Then I must leave,
Don't smother me with it, put it over my knees!
This is all very cosy,
How about a rubber of bridge?
Just a thought!
What have you got there, boy?
A charming little thing,
French, second empire,
Valuable, I'd say,
Where did you get it?
It belongs to Miss Marple,
- You had better give it back,
- I only borrowed it,
I'll drop it in on my way to bed,
- Come in, Doctor,
- You were expecting me?
- Didn't Alexander tell you?
- Tell me what?
Forgetful boy,
I have a sore throat and asked him to ask you to look at it before you left,
I see,
I haven't had one of these throats in years,
Well you've been lucky, Miss Marple,
Any headaches?
No, just the sore throat,
Well, we'll have a look,
This is attractive,
- Yes, isn't it?
- Where did you get it?
- I found it,
- Oh, where?
- In the stables here,
- Really?
Open wide, please,
- Say, "Ahh",
- Ahh,
No inflammation,
Don't you think that was dishonest, keeping the compact?
Under the circumstances, Doctor, no,
- Is there any swelling?
- I don't think so,
I've seen you like that once before, your hands at a woman's throat,
It was on a train and you were strangling her,
- That's quite an allegation,
- I have a few more,
Oh?
You want the compact because you had given it to that woman and it might be traced back to you,
- I think she was your wife,
- Do you?
You killed her after you had written that letter to Emma,
- You signed it Martine Ackenthorpe,
- Why should I do that?
The murder - so that you would then be free to marry Emma,
The letter - so that people would think the dead woman was Martine and look among the family for the killer... ,, never at you,
How did you arrive at this fascinating hypothesis?
It was I who found her body,
Martine was, or is, for all I know, a Normandy peasant,
The dead woman had never worked on a farm,
I saw her hands,
- Go on,
- Certainly,
You proceeded to augment your prospects... ,, by eliminating Albert and Harold,
How, conceivably?
You contrived to introduce arsenic into my curry, which I find unforgivable, knowing that you would be asked to deal with the after-effects,
Easy then to give Albert his final dose in the medicine,
And Harold?
You shot him and made it look like suicide,
Ingenious, I must admit,
More than that,
Now you are here to secure your wife's compact... ,, a fair case,
Yes, a pity you won't be able to present it,
One more murder, Doctor, might be one too many,
This won't look like murder,
Miss Marple,
The death certificate signed by me will register heart failure,
- All right?
- Yes, thank you,
You're under arrest, I warn you...
That everything was recorded and will be used in evidence,
You were right about everything,
You're a very brave woman,
Miss Marple, Good night,
Oh!
About time too!
I was coming up to see you before leaving,
No need to leave,
I have my own home,
- Sell it!
- Why on earth should l?
Well... taking one thing and another... ,, l mean, you're a fair cook and... er... you seem to have your wits about you and...
Well, I've decided to marry you,
- Well?
- Well, I'm honoured, of course,
Yes, but come to the point,
- I'm afraid that cannot be,
- Why?
Well if I ever do embark on such a venture, there is someone else,
Nonsense! I don't believe it,
Who would have you?
Apparently you for one,
Mr Ackenthorpe,
Goodbye,
The woman is completely unbalanced!
- Oh, Miss Marple, I am so glad...
- How good of you to come,
- Let me help,
- Thank you,
ENGLlSH
Are you a doctor?
Yes. Yes.
He's an actor.
Oh, an actor.
We're very popular with actors.
Have l, uh, seen you in anything?
Let's see. I did Hamlet a while back, didn't l, Liz?
And then we did, the, uh,
The Sand piper.
He's joking.
He was in Luther and Nobody Loves An Albatross and a lot of television plays and commercials.
Well, that's where the money is, isn't it? Commercials.
And the artistic thrills, too.
7, Diego.
Originally, the smallest apartment was in 9.
They've been broken up into four, fives, and sixes.
Now, 7-E is a four, originally the back part of a 10.
It has the original dining room for its living room, another bedroom for the bedroom, and two servants' rooms thrown together for a dining room or a second bedroom.
Do you have children?
Uh, we plan to.
We must oil that gate,
Diego.
This way, please.
The previous tenant,
Mrs. Gardenia, passed away just a few days ago, so nothing has been moved yet.
Her son asked me to say that some of the furniture could be picked up practically for the asking.
Did she die in the apartment?
Not that it makes any difference.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
In a hospital.
She'd been in a coma for weeks.
After you, please.
Thank you.
She was very old and passed away without ever waking.
I'd be grateful to go that way myself when the time comes.
Oh, no, no, no, not in the apartment, no.
She was chipper right to the end,
Been one of the first women lawyers in New York state.
Did a little gardening on the side, too.
She was quite a woman.
Oh, closet.
Oh, plenty of closets.
Oh, nice view of the park.
Oh, very nice view.
"I can no longer associate myself"
Now, this room, for instance, it would make a lovely nursery.
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper would brighten it tremendously.
What are all these things here?
Herbs, mostly.
A nice large bathroom.
Mmm. Mint, basil.
Yeah. No marijuana?
The, uh, master bedroom.
Oh, yes.
Here we are, back at the hallway again.
There.
Oh...
Oh, Guy!
Yeah.
Ohh!
The fireplace works,
Of course.
Great.
Oh!
Oh, it's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!
See what she's trying to do?
She's trying to get you to lower the rent, see?
Yes. Well, we'd raise it if we were allowed.
Apartments with this kind of charm--
Why, that's odd.
There's a closet behind that secretary.
I'm su--
I'm sure there is.
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.
She moved it.
It used to be there.
Give me a hand, will you?
I see now why she went into a coma!
She couldn't have lifted it by herself.
She was 89!
Should we open it?
Maybe her son should.
I'm authorized to show the apartment.
Well!
Whatever she locked in got out.
Well, perhaps she didn't need five closets.
Why would she cover up her vacuum cleaner and her towels?
I don't suppose we'll ever know.
Maybe she was becoming senile after all.
Is there anything else?
Yes, please.
What about the laundry facilities?
It's bigger than the other one.
Yeah. It's more expensive, too, you know?
It's better located.
Yeah, well, God knows,
I could walk to all the theaters from here.
Oh, Guy, let's take it, please?
That living room could be--
Oh, please, let's take it.
O.K., darling, we get out of the other lease, O.K.
I was tempted to write the management that you were drug addicts and litterbugs.
Instead, I decided to lie and tell them you were wonderful tenants.
Oh, you're great, Hutch.
Wish I could talk you out of it, though.
He's pulling your leg, Ro, honey.
Indeed I'm not.
Now, that looks great.
That is--
Are you aware that the Bramford had rather an unpleasant reputation around the turn of the century?
It's where the Trench sisters conducted their little dietary experiments, and Keith Kennedy held his parties.
Adrian Marcato lived there, too.
So did Pearl Ames.
- Who was Adrian Marcato?
- Who were the Trench sisters?
The Trench sisters were two proper
Victorian ladies.
They cooked and ate several young children, including a niece.
Oh, lovely.
Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft.
He made quite a splash in the nineties by announcing that he'd conjured up the living devil.
Apparently, people believed him, so they attacked and nearly killed him in the lobby of the Bramford.
You're joking?
Later, the Keith Kennedy business began, and by the twenties, the house was half empty.
I knew about
Keith Kennedy.
I didn't know that Marcato lived there.
And those sisters.
World War Il filled the house up again.
Terrific.
What? The house?
The lamb.
Oh.
They called it
Black Bramford.
But, Hutch, awful things happen in every apartment house.
Ah, but this house has a high incidence of unpleasant happenings.
In '59, a dead infant was found, wrapped in newspaper in the basement.
Mmm! You really rouse my appetite.
Have some more wine.
Roman!
Bring me in some root beer when you come!
Hey, these are shelves.
Hey...
Iet's make love.
Shh!
I think I hear the Trench sisters chewing.
Oh!
Straight up to the left.
Here in Daytona, Florida, it's the 250-CC
100-Mile Classic with Yamaha leading the pack on the final lap... and winning it, as Yamaha takes 7 of the top 10 places.
It's the third straight year for Yamaha, a clean sweep.
Yamaha is race bred from champions, and, as you can see, we have a model for every kind of riding.
You know,you really should
Discover the swingin' world of Yamaha.
Why don't you get on, have a ride?
Come on. Get on.
O.K., come on.
Let'sgo.
Look.
It's great.
I'm sorry. I thought you were Victoria Vetri, the actress.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
A lot of people think I'm Victoria.
I don't see any resemblance.
Do you know her?
No.
My name's
Terry Gionoffrio.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
Uh, we--we're new tenants here.
I'm staying with the Castavets, seventh floor.
I'm their guest, sort of,
Since June.
Our apartment used to be the back part of yours.
Oh, for goodness sakes.
You took the old lady's apartment.
Mrs., uh...
Yeah, um, Miss, uh...
Gard--Gardenia.
Gardenia. Yeah.
She was a good friend of the Castavets.
She used to grow all kinds of herbs and things for her to cook with.
I saw those plants.
Yeah. Well, now, she grows her own things.
Excuse me a moment.
I have to put the softener in.
What does your husband do?
He's an actor.
No kidding?
What's his name?
Guy Woodhouse.
He was in Luther and Nobody Loves an Albatross, and he does a lot of television and radio.
Gee, I watch TV all day long.
I bet I've seen him.
Wow!
Ooh!
I hate this basement.
Yeah, me, too.
It gives me the creeps.
Listen, why don't we come down here regular together and do our laundry?
O.K., that would be great.
I have a good luck charm.
It might work for both of us.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Isn't it?
Mrs. Castavet gave it to me.
It's good luck.
Anyway, it's supposed to be.
It's got some stuff inside.
I'm not mad about the smell either.
I hope it works.
It's a beautiful charm, though.
I've never seen anything like it.
European.
The Castavets are the most wonderful people in the world, bar none.
You know, they picked me up
Off the sidewalk, literally?
You were sick?
I was starving and on dope and doing a lot of other things.
They're childless, though.
I'm like the daughter they never had.
At first, I thought they wanted me for some kind of sex thing, but they've turned out to be like real grandparents.
It's nice to know there are people like that when you hear so much about apathy and people who are afraid of getting involved.
I'd be dead now if it wasn't for them.
That's an absolute fact, dead or in jail.
You don't have any family that could have helped you?
A brother in the Navy.
Why, it's impossible to be 100% sure!
If you want my opinion, we shouldn't tell her at all!
That's my opinion!
That must be the partition.
That's the back part of the original 10 with a dining room, and there's-- there's a closet over here, and then there's a closet over here.
Stay back, huh, lady?
Get back now, will you, please?
Get back.
There's nothing to see.
Get back, will you, please?
Jesus.
Get back!
We know her.
What's her name?
Terry.
Terry what?
Ro?
What was her name again?
Terry what?
I don't remember.
An ltalian name.
She was staying with some people named Castavet,
7-E.
Yeah. We got that already.
Short and sweet.
She stuck it to the window sill with a band-aid.
Come on. Get back.
Theresa Gionoffrio.
Move on!
Move on!
You knew her?
Only slightly.
Come on, Ro baby.
Let's go.
Oh! Here they come.
You folks the Castavets on the seventh floor?
We are.
You have a young woman named
Theresa Gionoffrio living with you?
We do. What's wrong?
Has there been an accident?
You'd better brace yourself for some bad news.
She's dead.
Jumped out of the window.
That's not possible!
It's a mistake!
Artie, you want to let these folks take a look, please?
I knew this would happen.
She got deeply depressed every three weeks or so.
I told my wife about it, but she pooh-poohed me.
Well, that--that doesn't mean she killed herself.
She was a very happy girl with no reason for self-destruction.
She must have been cleaning the windows or something.
She wasn't cleaning windows at midnight.
Why not? Maybe she was!
Is that her handwriting?
Yeah.
Definitely.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
I'll see this gets back to you when we're done with it.
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
She was so happy.
Who's the next-of-kin?
She's all alone.
She didn't have anybody, only us.
Didn't she have a brother?
Did she?
She said she did.
In the Navy.
News to me.
Do you know where he's stationed?
No, I don't.
She mentioned him to me in the laundry room.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
Uh, we're in, uh, 7-E.
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs. Castavet.
She seemed so happy and full of--
She said wonderful things about you and your husband, how grateful she was.
Thank you.
You know anything else about this brother except he's in the Navy?
No, I don't.
It should be easy to find him.
I'm so stunned.
I'm so sorry.
It's such a pity.
Well, thank you.
Sometimes I wonder how come you're the leader of anything.
Please don't tell me what Laura-Louise said because I'm not interested.
If you'd listened to me, we wouldn't have had to do this!
We'd have been all set to go now instead of having to start all over from scratch!
I told you not to tell her in advance!
I told you she wouldn't be open-minded!
I told Sister Veronica about the windows, and she withdrew the school from the competition.
Otherwise, we would--
Hello. How are you?
Fine. May I come in a minute?
Yes, of course. Please do.
I just come over to thank you for saying those nice things to us the other night.
Oh, no, please.
There's--
Poor Terry. We thought maybe we'd failed her some way, although her note made it crystal clear we hadn't.
You'll never know how helpful it was in such a shock moment.
So I do thank you.
Roman does, too.
Roman's my hubby.
You're welcome.
I'm glad I could help.
Yeah. Well, she was cremated yesterday.
Now we got to forget and go on.
It won't be easy.
We don't have any children of our own.
You have any?
No, we don't.
Oh, well, there you have it.
Ohh! Oh... that's a nice--
Look how you put the table!
Now, isn't that interesting?
I saw it in a magazine.
Oh, my. Nice paintjob.
I know.
Ahh...well.
That's nice. What is that?
That's the TV room?
Yeah, well, only temporarily.
It's going to be a nursery.
Oh, you're pregnant?
No, not yet.
I hope to be as soon as we're settled.
Wonderful.
Well, you're young and healthy.
You ought to have lots ofchildren.
We plan to have three.
I'm dying to see what you did to this apartment.
The woman who had it before was a dear friend of mine.
I know.
Terry told me.
Well, did she?
You two had some long talks together in the laundry room.
Only one.
Oh! Oh, my goodness!
Ah ha ha!
It looks so much brighter.
What do you pay for a chair like that?
Um, I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.
What does your hubby do?
He's an actor.
I knew it!
I said it to Roman yesterday.
He's so good-looking.
What movies was he in?
No movies.
He was in two plays called Luther and Nobody Loves an Albatross and a lot of television and radio.
Listen, Rosemary...
I got a 2-inch thick sirloin steak sitting defrosting right this minute.
Why don't you and Guy come over, have supper with us tonight?
What do you say?
Oh, no. We couldn't.
Why not?
No, really, that's very kind of you.
Listen--
It would be a real help to us.
Oh... first night we'll be alone since...
Oh, are you sure it wouldn't be too much trouble for you?
Oh, honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask you.
All right.
You go ahead and count on us.
I'll have to check with Guy, though.
Listen, you tell him
I won't take no for an answer!
Oh! Here's your mail!
Oh! Ads!
Thank you.
Yoo-hoo!
Hey.
Mmm!
Donald Baumgart got that part.
It's a bad play anyway.
Yeah. Even if it folds out of town, it's the kind of part that gets noticed.
Mrs. Castavet was here to thank me for what
I said about Terry.
She is the nosiest person I've ever seen.
You know she actually asked the prices of things?
No kidding.
She invited us to have dinner with them tonight.
I told her I'd have to check with you, but that it would probably be O.K.
Oh, Jesus! We don't have to do that, do we, honey?
I think they're lonely.
We get friendly with an old couple like that, and we'll never get rid of them.
They're right across the wall.
I told her she could count on us.
You don't have to sulk about it.
I'm not sulking.
I see exactly what you mean.
Hell, we'll go.
No, no. What for?
We'll go!
No. We don't have to if you don't want to.
That sounds so phony, but I really mean it, really, I do.
Be my good deed for the day.
O.K., but only if you want to.
We'll make it clear that it's just for this one night and not the beginning of anything, all right?
Oh! Perfect timing!
Come on in.
Roman's fixing us some vodka blushes.
My, I'm glad you could come, Guy.
I'm fixing to tell everybody that I knew you when.
Look, dinner isn't ready just yet, but sit down there anywhere.
Take a seat on the couch.
You'll find yourself very comfortable.
I seem to have overfilled the glasses.
No, no, no.
Don't get up.
Generally, I pour these out precisely as a bartender, don't l, Minnie?
Just watch the carpet.
But this evening I made a little too much, and rather I'm afr--
Oh, there we are.
No, no, no.
Sit down, please.
Now, Mrs. Woodhouse...
Uh, Mr. Woodhouse, uh, vodka blush?
Yes, thanks.
Have you ever tasted one?
No, no.
I haven't.
It looks delicious.
Minnie. They're very popular in Australia.
Now, to our guests-- welcome to our home.
Hear, hear.
Cheers.
Mmm.
The carpet.
Oh, dear.
Brand-new carpet.
This man is so clumsy!
Do you come from Australia?
Oh, no, no. I'm from right here in New York city.
I've been there, though.
I've been everywhere, literally.
You name a place, and I've been there.
Go ahead. Name a place.
Fairbanks, Alaska!
I've been there, been all over Alaska--
Yes--Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,
Nome, Sitka, Seward.
I spent four months there in '38--
Where are you folks from?
Well--Well, l--
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.
Omaha's a good city.
Baltimore is, too.
Do you travel for business?
Well, business and pleasure both.
I'm 79, and I've been going one place or another since I was 10.
You name a place,
I've been there.
Ah! Steak's ready.
Don't rush your drinks, now.
Roman, take your pill!
No Pope ever visits a city where the newspapers are on strike.
I heard he's going to postpone and wait till it's over.
Well, that's show biz.
That's exactly what it is.
All the costumes are rituals, all religions.
Oh, I think we're offending Rosemary.
No, no.
No, you're not religious, my dear, are you?
Well, l--I was brought up a Catholic.
Now I don't know.
You looked uncomfortable.
Well, he is the Pope.
Now, you don't need to have respect for him because he pretends that he's holy.
Now, that's a good point.
When I think what they spend on robes and jewels!
A good picture of the hypocrisy behind organized religion was given, I thought, in Luther.
Did you ever get to play that leading part, Guy?
Me? No.
Weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?
No.
Well, that's strange.
I remember being struck by a gesture you made and checking in the program to see who you were.
Um, what gesture was that?
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction--
Oh, I did a thing with my arms when Luther was having a fit.
It was a kind of involuntary reach.
That's it! That's it.
It had a wonderful authenticity to it.
Oh, come on.
-No, no. I mean it!
My father was a theatrical producer, and my early years were spent in the company of Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson,
Modjeska.
Guy?
Oh, yes, please.
You have a most interesting inner quality, Guy.
It appears in your television work, too.
It should take you a long way, indeed, provided, of course, that you get those initial breaks.
Are you preparing for a show now?
Um, well,
I'm up for a couple parts.
Well, I can't believe that you won't get them.
Well, I can.
I'd like to have a spice garden someday.
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.
You come from a big family?
Three brothers and two sisters.
Your sisters married?
They have children?
One has two, the other has four.
There's a chance you'll have lots of children, too.
We're fertile, all right.
I've got 16 nieces and nephews.
Oh, my goodness!
Would you like me to wash and you can wipe for a while?
Oh, no.
That's fine, dear.
Now, Roman, will you stop bending Guy's ears with your Modjeska stories?
He's only listening
'cause he's polite.
No, no, no, no.
It's very interesting, Mrs. Castavet.
Minnie!
I'm Minnie, he's Roman, O.K.?
O.K.?
O.K.
O.K.!
Terrific.
Just terrific.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye.
Thank you for having us.
Yeah, it was lovely.
Oh, bless you.
Minnie!
Minnie, ya good kid, ya.
Ooh!
About that steak, huh?
Oh, my God!
And the cake.
How did you eat two pieces?
It was weird.
Out of politeness.
That's how I ate two pieces.
Out of politeness.
Only three dinner plates that matched.
Shh!
And all that beautiful, beautiful silver.
We'll be nice.
Maybe they'll will it to us.
Oh!
Yeah.
Guess what they have in their bathroom.
A bidet.
Jokes for the John.
No.
A book on a hook right next to the toilet.
Roman's stories are pretty damned interesting, though.
Yeah?
Never even heard of Forbes-Robertson before.
I'm going to go over there again tomorrow night and hear some more.
You are?
Yeah. He asked me.
Here. Do this damn thing for me, will you?
I thought we were going to do something
With Joan and Dick Jellico.
- Was that definite?
- Well, it wasn't definite.
We'll see them next week.
You don't have to come along
If you don't want to.
You can stay here.
Yeah, I think I will stay here.
He knew Henry lrving, too.
I mean, really interesting, you know?
Why did they take their pictures down?
What do you mean?
Their pictures.
They took them down.
The hooks in the wall and clean spaces and the one picture that is there doesn't fit.
I didn't notice that.
Hi, dear.
We're not bothering you, are we?
This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,
Lives up on 12.
Laura-Louise, this is Guy's wife Rosemary.
Hello, Rosemary.
Welcome to the Bram!
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
She wanted to meet you, too.
Could we come in?
Uh, of course. Please do.
There you are.
Go ahead.
Oh, look what you got.
There's a light.
Oh, gosh!
Isn't that beautiful!
It came this morning.
Are you all right, dear?
You look worn.
Oh, no. I'm fine.
It's the first day of my period.
And you're up and around?
On my first day,
I experienced such pain,
I couldn't move, eat, or anything.
Dan used to give me gin through a straw to kill the pain.
Girls today take things much more in their stride.
They're much healthier than we were,
Thanks to vitamins, better medical care.
What are those things over there, seat covers?
Um, cushions for the window seats.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, before I forget.
This is for you from Roman and me.
For me?
It's just a little present is all.
For moving in.
There's no reason--
It's real old.
It's over 300 years.
It's lovely.
Yeah. The green inside is called tannis root.
That's for good luck.
It's lovely, but l--
I can't accept it.
You already have.
Put it on.
-Yeah.
Ah, you'll get used to the smell before you know it.
Yeah, go on.
Ohh, yes.
Well, were his stories as interesting as last night?
Yes. Did you have a good time?
All right.
I got a present.
It was Terry's.
No kidding?
Kind of pretty, though.
Aren't you going to wear it?
It smells.
There's stuff in it called tannis root from her greenhouse.
Not too bad, though.
Tannis, anyone?
Well, if you took it, you ought to wear it.
Hello.
Yes.
This is he.
Oh, God, no.
Oh, the poor guy.
And, uh...
They don't have any idea what's causing it?
Oh, my God.
That's awful.
That's just awful.
Yes, I would.
I mean, yes, I am.
I hate to get it that way, but...
Well, you'd have to speak to my agent about that end of it.
Alan Stone.
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
Mr. Weiss, not as far as we're concerned.
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.
Guy?
What is it?
Donald Baumgart-- he's gone blind.
He woke up yesterday and he can't see.
Oh, no.
Oh, I've got the part.
It's a hell of a way to get it.
Listen, uh...
I have to get out and walk around.
I understand.
Go ahead.
Baumgart--
Donald Baumgart.
It's a fascinating part.
He'll really be noticed this time.
He also has an offer for a lead in a television series, Miami Beach.
He's suddenly very hot.
Mm-hmm. I understand why you're so overjoyed.
Well, it's a difficult period in his life.
A challenge.
I see.
You know how actors are.
They're all a bit self-centered.
I'll bet even
Laurence Olivier is vain and self-centered.
It's a difficult part.
He's got to work with crutches and, naturally, he's preoccupied.
And he... well, preoccupied.
I see you had another suicide up there at happy house.
Oh, didn't I tell you?
No, you didn't.
It was that girl
I told you about, the drug-addict who was rehabilitated by this old couple, the Castavets.
I'm sure I told you that.
They didn't rehabilitate her very successfully, it seems.
I've been a creep.
It's from worrying if Baumgart would regain his sight, rat that I am.
Oh, it's natural.
You're bound to feel two ways about it.
Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha for the rest of my days,
I'm going to stop giving you the short end of the stick.
You haven't been.
Yes, I have.
I've been tearing my hair out over my career.
Let's have a baby.
All right?
Let's have three babies, one at a time, all right?
A baby. You know.
Mama, dada, poo-poo. you know?
You mean it?
Sure, I mean it.
I mean, I even figured out the right time to start,
Look.
You mean it, really?
No, I'm kidding.
Sure, I mean it.
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's sake, don't cry.
I won't. I won't.
Here goes nothing.
Mmm-unh! The paint!
The paint!
Good grief.
Nobody, but nobody has a fire tonight.
Isn't it gorgeous?
I hope we have the coldest winter ever.
Oh, shit!
Hi, Guy! How are ya?
No, don't let her in.
Not tonight.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Oh, are you sure you don't want to come in?
No! I don't want to bother you.
Good.
Good.
Who says there's nothing to ESP?
Madame and monsieur shall have ze dessert after all!
Mousse au chocolat.
Or as Minnie calls it-- chocolate mouse.
I was afraid she'd stay all evening.
She just wanted us to try it.
Seein' it's one of her specialities.
It was sweet of her, really.
We shouldn't make fun of her.
Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.
Mmm! It's good.
Has an undertaste.
A chalky undertaste.
I don't get it.
That's silly, honey.
There is no undertaste.
There is.
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.
-I don't like it.
-It's delicious.
Here. You can have mine.
All right. Don't eat it.
There's always something wrong.
Oh, if it's going to turn into a big thing--
Look, if you really can't stand it, just don't eat it.
Mmm! It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.
Would you turn the record over, please?
There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?
You get two of them.
I'm sorry if I was stuffy.
You were.
...is making a full circle of the ball park...
It's the Pope at Yankee Stadium!
...to his specially built canopy at second base.
Put him out!
Listen to that crowd roar.
Everywhere the Pope
Has been today, he's received this type of reception.
As one man put it
This afternoon,
"Perhaps we are being undignified, but this is a special day. "
And a special day it has been.
That's a great spot for my Yamaha commercial.
I'd like to give you a brief summary of today's historic happening.
Pope Paul VI arrived at 9.:27A.M.
What is it?
Dizzy.
Hey.
No wonder.
All that booze.
You didn't eat anything all day before dinner, huh?
Hey.
Hey.
Nice.
Sleep is what you need.
A good night's sleep.
We have to make a baby.
Oh, we'll... we'll do it.
Tomorrow.
There's plenty of time.
Just a nap.
Why are you taking them off?
To make you more comfortable.
I am more comfortable.
Sleep, Ro.
Isn't Hutch coming with us?
Catholics only,
I wish we weren't bound by these prejudices, but, unfortunately...
Easy, easy.
You got her too high.
Typhoon!
Typhoon!
It killed 55 people in London and it's heading this way!
You better go down below, Miss.
She's awake.
She sees.
She don't see.
As long as she ate the mouse,
She can't hear.
She's like dead. Now sing.
I'm sorry to hear you aren't feeling well.
It's only the mouse bite.
You'd better have your legs tied down in case of convulsions.
Yes, I suppose so.
There's always a chance it was rabid. lf the music bothers you,
Iet me know, and I'll have it stopped.
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't change the program on my account.
Try to sleep.
We'll be waiting up on deck.
This is no dream!
This is really happening!
They tell me you have been bitten by a mouse.
Yes. That's why I couldn't come to see you.
That's all right.
We wouldn't want you
To jeopardize your health.
Am I forgiven, father?
Oh, absolutely.
Hey, it's after 9:00.
Uhm.
Five minutes.
I have to be at Alan's at 10:00.
Eat out.
Like hell I will.
What time is it?
It's 10 after 9:00.
What time did I go to sleep?
You didn't go to sleep.
You passed out.
From now on you get cocktails or wine,
Not cocktails and wine, hmm?
The dreams I had.
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.
I didn't want to miss baby night.
A couple of my nails were ragged.
-While I was out?
And it was kind of fun, in a necrophile sort of way.
I dreamed someone was raping me.
I don't know, someone inhuman.
Thanks a lot!
What's the matter?
-Nothing.
I didn't want to miss the night.
We could've done it this morning or tonight.
Last night wasn't the only split second.
I was a little bit loaded myself, you know?
Oh! Hello there.
Did ya like it?
Oh, yeah.
I think I put a little too much cream de cocoa in it.
No, no.
It was delicious.
You'll have to give me the recipe.
Yeah, love to.
Oh, listen, you going shopping?
Do me a teeny favor, will ya?
Get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka.
I'll pay you later.
Right. Bye-bye.
Don't you think we ought to talk about it?
About what?
The way you haven't been looking at me.
What are you talking about?
I've been looking at you.
You haven't.
Why, sure, I have.
Now, what is it?
What's the matter?
Nothing. Never mind.
No, no. Don't say that.
What is it?
Nothing.
Look, honey, l--
I know I've been preoccupied with the part and all, but it is important.
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.
It was due on Friday.
It was?
It'll probably come tonight or tomorrow.
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.
- A quarter.
- O.K.
You're going to lose.
Shut up, will you?
You're getting me all jumpy.
It's only been two days.
When will I know?
I'll call you just as soon as I get the results.
I like to do a general examination just to know something more...
It was Elise Dunstan who recommended you to me, Doctor.
Oh, yes.
How is she?
She's fine. And the boys are great.
Did you deliver all of them?
No, just the last.
Universal hemoglobin.
Yes, Doctor.
We went to see
The Fantasticks.
-Did you?
-Mmm.
Did you enjoy it?
-Yeah.
Good.
Hello?
Mrs. Woodhouse?
Dr. Hill?
Congratulations.
-Really?
-Really.
Are you there?
Uh, yes, um, what happens now?
You come see me next month.
You get those Natalin pills.
One a day.
I'll mail you forms for the hospital.
Uh, when will it be?
It works out to be June 28th.
-That sounds so far away!
-It is.
One more thing,
Mrs. Woodhouse, we'd like another blood sample.
Oh, yes, of course.
What for?
The nurse didn't take enough, so would you drop by and see her?
But I am pregnant, aren't l?
Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp--
Blood sugar and so forth.
But you're pregnant.
Don't worry.
All right.
Well, I'll come in on Monday.
All right.
Don't forget the pills.
No, I won't.
-Goodbye, Mrs. Woodhouse.
-Goodbye, Dr. Hill.
Blood sugar?
What's that?
Oh!
That's great.
That's just great.
Father.
Mother.
Guy, Guy, listen.
Let's, uh, make this a new beginning, O.K.?
A new openness in talking to each other, because we haven't been open.
That's true.
I've been so goddamned self-centered.
That's what the whole trouble is.
You know I love you, don't you, Ro?
I do. I swear to God
I'm going to be as open and--
It's my fault as much as yours.
No, bull, it's mine.
Now you bear with me.
I'll try and do better, you hear?
Oh, Guy.
What?
It's... a fine way for parents to be carrying on.
Hey... know what I'd love to do?
What?
Tell Minnie and Roman.
Oh, I know, I know.
It's, uh... it's, uh, supposed to be a deep, dark secret, but I already told them that we were trying.
They were so pleased.
Tell them.
Back in two minutes?
You're pregnant.
Another blood sample.
Ta-da!
Now, that's what
I call good news.
Aw, honey, congratulations.
Thank you.
-Best wishes, Rosemary.
-Thank you very much.
We are more pleased than we can say.
We didn't have any champagne on hand, but this will do just as nicely.
When are you due, dear?
June 28th.
Oh, it's going to be so exciting.
Listen, dear, you got a good doctor?
Oh, yes, a very good one.
One of the top obstetricians is a dear friend of ours,
Abe Sapirstein.
Delivers all the society babies.
Abe Sapirstein?
One of the finest obstetricians in the country.
Wasn't he on Open End a couple of years ago?
That's right.
Ro?
Uh... well, what about Dr. Hill?
Don't worry about Hill.
I'll tell him something.
You know me.
Listen, I won't let you go to no Dr. Hill nobody ever heard of.
The best is what you're going to have, young lady.
Where's your telephone, huh?
It's in the bedroom.
He's a brilliant man.
Very sensitive.
Ro, sit down, sit down.
No, I'm fine.
Abe, Minnie. Fine.
Listen, Abe, a dear friend of ours just found out today she's pregnant.
Yeah, isn't it?
I'm in her apartment right now.
We told her you'd be glad to take care of her.
You wouldn't charge her none of your fancy society prices neither.
Well, just wait a minute.
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11:00?
All right.
Yeah, 11:00's fine, Abe.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, you, too.
No, no, no, no, not at all.
All right.
Well, let's hope so.
Goodbye.
Well, there you are.
Thanks a million, Minnie.
I don't know how to thank you.
Both of you.
Just have a fine, healthy baby, that's all.
My, I can't wait to tell
Laura-Louise.
Oh... uh, please don't tell anyone else, not right away.
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.
Now, to a fine, healthy baby.
-Hear, hear.
-Hear!
Andy. or Susan.
Susan.
Please don't read books.
No pregnancy was ever exactly like the ones described in the books.
And don't listen to your friends, either.
No two pregnancies are ever alike.
Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
-No pills.
Minnie Castavet has a herbarium.
I'm going to have her make a daily drink for you that'll be fresher, safer, and more vitamin-rich than any pills on the market.
Any questions you have, call me night or day.
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.
-Here.
-What's in it?
Snips and snails and puppy dogs' tails.
That's fine, but what if we want a girl?
Do you?
It would be nice if the first one were a boy.
Well, there you are.
No, really, what is in it?
A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.
Tannis root?
Some of that along with some other things.
Don't be so violent, Harry.
If you want to be stupid, be nonviolent stupid,
I'm in love with no one.
Especially not your fat wife.
I'm a hopeless cripple...
What's that?
I-I've been to Vidal Sassoon.
Don't tell me you paid for that.
Guy,
I have a pain.
Where?
Here.
Just now?
Since Monday.
A sharp pain.
Did you see Sapirstein?
I'm seeing him on Wednesday.
This is ridiculous.
Why don't you see Sapirstein?
Why didn't you say anything?
I see him Wednesday regular.
An entirely natural expansion of the pelvis.
You can fight it with ordinary aspirin.
I was afraid it might be an ectopic pregnancy.
Ectopic?
I thought you weren't going to read books, Rosemary.
-It was staring at me in the drugstore.
-All it did was worry you.
Will you go home and throw it away, please?
The pains will be gone in two days.
Ectopic pregnancy!
I look awful.
What are you talking about?
You look great!
It's that haircut that looks awful.
You want the truth, honey, that's the worst mistake you ever made.
My God!
It's Vidal Sassoon.
It's very in.
What's wrong with you?
Do I look that bad?
Terrible!
You're not on one
Of those Zen diets, are you?
No.
Then what is it?
Have you seen a doctor?
Hutch, I might as well tell you.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, rubbish.
Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.
I don't sleep well.
I have stiff joints or something, so I get a pain.
Nothing serious.
Well, congratulations.
You must be very happy.
Oh, I am.
We both are.
Who's your obstetrician?
Abraham Sapirstein.
Oh! He delivered two of my daughter's babies.
He's one of the best in the city.
When did you see him last?
Um, yesterday.
And?
And he says it's fairly common.
How much weight have you lost?
Uh, 3 pounds.
Nonsense. You've lost far more than that.
It's perfectly normal to lose a little at first.
Later on, I'll be gaining.
Well... we must assume Dr. Sapirstein knows where of he speaks.
He should.
He charges enough.
We're getting bargain rates.
Our neighbors are close friends of his.
I'll go.
Stay where you are.
It hurts less when I move around.
Oh, I was just talking about you.
Favorably, I hope.
Do you need anything from outside?
No. Thank you for asking.
Is Guy home already?
He won't be home till 6:00.
Oh.
A friend of ours is here.
Would you-- would you like to meet him?
If I won't be intruding.
No. Please come in.
Hutch, this is Roman Castavet.
Edward Hutchins.
How do you do?
Oh, how are you, sir?
I was just telling Hutch that it was you and Minnie who sent me to Dr. Sapirstein.
Oh, so Rosemary has told you the good news.
Yes, she has.
We must see that she gets plenty of rest.
I was a bit alarmed by her appearance.
Well, she has lost some weight, but that's quite normal for the early months.
Later on, she'll gain, probably far too much.
So I gather.
Please sit down.
Mrs. Castavet makes a vitamin drink for me every day from fresh herbs she grows.
Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's directions, of course.
He's inclined to be suspicious of commercially prepared vitamin pills.
Indeed?
But surely they're manufactured under every imaginable safeguard.
That's quite true, but commercial pills can sit for months on a druggist's shelf and lose a great deal of their original potency.
I hadn't thought of that.
I like the idea of having everything fresh and natural.
I'll bet expectant mothers chewed bits of tannis root when nobody'd even heard of vitamin pills.
Tannis root?
It's one of the herbs she puts in the drink.
Or is it an herb?
Can a root be an herb?
You sure you don't mean anise or orris root?
No, tannis.
Look.
It's good luck, too.
Ish!
Doesn't look like, uh, root matter, more like mold or fungus of some kind.
Is it ever called by any other name?
Not to my knowledge, no.
Tannis. I must look it up in the encyclopedia.
What a pretty holder or charm or whatever it is.
The Castavets gave it to me.
You and your wife seem to be taking better care of Rosemary than her own parents.
We're very fond of her.
And of Guy, too.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll have to go.
My wife is waiting for me.
It's a pleasure to have met you.
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.
We'll meet again, I'm sure.
I just noticed he has pierced ears.
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.
What's she like?
Nosy.
Funny.
Guy's gotten very close to them.
I suppose they've become sort of parent figures for him.
And you?
I--I don't know.
Sometimes I think they're too friendly and helpful.
Hey, what a surprise.
How are you, Hutch?
Good to see you.
You're the surprise.
What happened?
They stopped for a rewrite, those dumb bastards.
Ah, stay where you are.
Nobody move.
Would you like some coffee?
Love some!
Loot!
Seems congratulations are in order.
Yeah, it's wonderful, isn't it?
When's the baby due?
June 28th.
Did you know that Dr. Sapirstein delivered two of
Hutch's grandchildren?
-Really?
-Mmm.
I met your neighbor.
Roman Castavet.
Oh, did you?
Funny old duck, isn't he?
Did you ever notice he has pierced ears?
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not. I saw.
It's a shame we haven't seen more of you lately, but with me being so busy and Ro being the way she is, we really haven't seen anyone.
Perhaps we can have dinner together soon.
You're not going, are you?
Thanks for the coffee, my dear.
Thank you for coming, my dear.
This isn't mine.
It must be yours, right?
Right you are.
Have you thought about names, or is it too soon?
Andrew or Douglas if it's a boy,
Melinda or Sarah if it's a girl.
Sarah? What happened to Susan?
Say, is there another of these around?
Oh.
I don't see it, Hutch.
No, it's not here.
I probably left it at the City Center.
I'll stop back there.
Let's really have that dinner, shall we?
Definitely.
Next week.
Bye.
Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
It was a nice surprise.
Guess what he said.
What?
I look terrible.
Good old Hutch.
He's spreading cheer wherever he goes.
I'm going to get a paper, honey.
He's a professional crepehanger.
He's not a professional crepehanger.
Then he's one of the top-ranking amateurs.
Hello.
Oh, uh, she's not feeling too well.
Well, I think she's asleep.
All right.
Oh, she could be, yeah.
All right, can you hold on a minute?
It's Hutch.
He wants to speak to you.
Oh.
I told him you were resting, but he said he couldn't wait.
Hutch?
Tell me, dear, do you go out at all?
Well, I--I haven't been going out, why?
Can you meet me tomorrow morning at 11:00 in front of the Time-Life building?
Yes, if you want me to.
What is it?
Can't you tell me now?
I'd rather not.
We can have an early lunch if you like.
That would be nice.
Good. 11:00 then?
O.K.
Oh, did you find your glove?
No, they didn't have it.
Good night, Rosemary.
Sleep well.
You, too.
Good night.
What was that?
He wants to talk to me.
What about?
I don't know.
He wouldn't say.
I think those boys' adventure stories are going to his head.
Where are you meeting him?
Uh, Time and Life building tomorrow at 11:00.
This is ridiculous.
You're pregnant,
I've got the yens.
I'm getting an ice-cream cone.
You want one?
Yeah, I'd love one.
Vanilla?
O.K.
O.K.
Hi.
Minnie, I'm going out now, so I won't have my drink at 11:00.
That's fine, dear.
Take it later.
Buzz me when you get back, huh?
Pain, be gone.
I will have no more of thee.
Yes?
Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?
Yes. Who is this, please?
My name is
Rosemary Woodhouse.
I had an appointment with Mr. Hutchins.
Is he there?
Hello?
He was taken ill this morning.
-Taken ill?
-Yes.
He's in a deep coma at St. Vincent's hospital.
That's awful.
I--I--I just spoke to him last night about 10:30.
I spoke to him at 11:00.
Who is this?
You don't know me,
Rosemary.
I'm Grace Cardiff,
Hutch's friend.
Um, do they know what's causing it?
No, they don't know yet.
At the moment, he's totally unresponsive.
Oh, I'm going to the hospital now.
Is there anything
I can do?
Not really.
All right, um, thank you.
No!
This is what I call the long arm of coincidence!
I said to myself, as long as Rosemary's going out,
I might as well go out and do a little bit of Christmas shopping.
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?
Aw, darling, what's the matter?
You feel all right?
Aw... aw, you poor thing.
You know what I think?
I think we better be going home now.
What do you say?
No, no, you have your shopping to do.
Ah, shoot, there's two more weeks.
It'll stop any day now.
It's like a wire inside me getting tighter and tighter.
Usually older women with less flexible joints have this sort of trouble.
I'm not going out anymore.
You don't have to.
One minute to go!
Rosemary,
I want you to meet Dr. Shand.
He used to be a famous dentist.
He made the chain
For your charm.
Oh, how do you do?
Come on, sweetie.
Put this wonderful hat on.
Doctor, come over here.
Minnie, Minnie.
Happy New Year.
Have a good year.
Happy New Year.
To 1966!
The Year 1 !
What the hell are you doing?
Planning the menu.
We're having a party a week from Saturday.
It's for our old--
I mean, our young friends.
Minnie and Roman are not invited.
Neither is Laura-Louise.
Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.
It's going to be a very special party.
You have to be under 60 to get in.
Well.
For a minute there,
I didn't think
I was going to make it.
You'll make it, all right.
You can be bartender.
Oh, swell.
Do you really think it's such a good idea?
I think it's the best idea
I've had in months.
Don't you think you ought to check with Dr. Sapirstein first?
What for?
I'm just giving a party.
I'm not going to swim the English Channel.
What about the pain?
Oh, haven't you heard?
It'll go away in a day or two.
That looks interesting.
What's it for?
We're having some people over on Saturday.
Oh, you feel up to entertaining?
Yes, I do.
These are old friends
I haven't seen in a long time.
They don't even know yet that I'm pregnant.
I'll give you a hand if you like.
I'll help you dish things out.
No, thank you, Minnie, but I can manage.
It's going to be a buffet, and we're getting a bartender, so...
I'll help you take the coats.
No, really, you do too much for me as it is.
Well, let me know if you change your mind.
Drink your drink now.
I'd rather not.
Not right this minute.
I'll drink it in a little while.
It don't do to let it stand.
No, I won't wait too long.
You go on back, and I'll bring the glass back to you later.
I'll wait.
I'll save you the walk.
You'll do no such thing.
It makes me very nervous when people watch me cook.
Now, scoot.
Don't let it stand too long.
It's going to lose its vitamins.
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
-Hey, Rosie.
-Yeah?
Bob and Leo got stuck at another party, dear, but they'll be over right away.
Oh, fine.
Oh Rosie, you're so lucky.
It's a fantastic house.
Hi.
It's been so long!
You look like a piece of chalk!
You make him feed you, luv.
-Adrian Marcato lived here.
- Yeah, and the Trench sisters.
-Trent sisters?
-Trench. They ate little children.
He doesn't just mean they ate them.
He means they ate them.
I made their first one strong to get them happy, then I go light and conserve, eh?
Rosie, do you feel O.K.?
You look a little tired.
Thanks for the understatement.
How do you like C.C. Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?
Mm-hmm, but I--I--
I'm not going to him.
You're not?
I've got another doctor named Sapirstein, an older man.
Oh, congratulations, Papa.
Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.
Ro, I'm going to take that dip inside.
Oh, yeah, please.
See my flowers?
Yeah.
Elise, will you give me a hand?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Hey, whatever happened to the other guy?
-Is he still blind?
-Donald Baumgart?
Well, you know who he is.
He's the boy that Zoe Piper lives with.
He's writing a play.
-Is he still blind?
-Excuse me.
Yeah. He's going through hell trying to make the adjustment.
He dictates and Zoe writes.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a cramp for a minute.
Don't cry.
It's all right. It's good for her.
Let her cry it out.
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.
Sit down, sit down.
-Hey, let me in.
-Sorry, girls only.
-I want to talk to Rosemary.
-You can't. She's busy.
I have to wash these--
Use the bathroom.
It hurts so much!
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.
When did the pain start?
Um... in, uh, November.
November?
What?
You have been in pain since November, and he's not doing anything to help you?
He says it's gonna stop.
Why don't you go to see another doctor?
No, he's very good.
He was on Open End.
He sounds like a sadistic nut.
Rosemary, pain like that is a warning that something isn't right.
Go see Dr. Hill.
Go see anybody besides that...that...
That nut.
You can't go on suffering like this.
I won't have an abortion.
Nobody's telling you to have an abortion.
Just go to see another doctor, that's all.
The thing to do now is move.
Guy?
Yeah?
I'm going to Dr. Hill
Monday morning.
Dr. Sapirstein is either lying, or he's...
I don't know, out of his mind.
Pain like this is a warning something's wrong.
Rosemary... and I'm not drinking
Minnie's drink anymore.
I want vitamins and pills like everyone else.
I haven't drunk it for the last three days.
I've thrown it away.
You've what?
I've made my own drink.
Is that what those bitches were giving you in there?
And is that their hint for today?
They're my friends--
They're a bunch of not very bright bitches who ought to mind their own goddamn business!
All they said was get a second opinion.
Rosemary, you got the best doctor in New York.
You know who Dr. Hill is?
He's a Charlie Nobody.
That's who he is!
I'm tired of hearing how great Dr. Sapirstein is.
Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein, we'll have to pay Hill.
It's out of the question.
No, I'm not changing.
I just wanna go to Dr. Hill and get a second opinion.
I won't let you do it, Ro.
I mean, because it's, uh... it's not fair to Sapirstein.
Not fair to...
What are you talking about?
What about what's fair to me?
You want a second opinion?
You tell Sapirstein and let him decide who gives it.
No! I want Dr. Hill!
At least have that much courtesy--
If you won't pay, then I'll...
Ro?
Rosemary?
What is it?
It stopped.
What?
The pain stopped just like that.
Stopped?
-Stopped.
What was in that drink you made?
Uh... eggs, milk, sug-- sugar.
What else?
What else?
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake, what else was in that drink?
It's alive!
Guy, it's moving!
It's alive!
It's all right!
Feel.
Feel.
Oh, yeah, I felt it.
Don't be scared.
It won't bite you.
It's wonderful.
It really is.
I feel it kicking.
It's alive!
It's moving!
I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess.
Watch the walls.
Thanks, boys.
Have one on the baby.
Thank you very much.
What's that for?
This is my hospital suitcase.
Honey, you got three weeks.
Yes?
Hello, Mrs. Cardiff.
No.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Yes, of course I will.
Hutch is dead.
I feel awful.
All this time,
I didn't even think of him.
Doris, we'll see you later.
I beg your pardon.
I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
I knew your father.
Oh, so you're Rosemary.
I'm terribly sorry.
Thank you.
This is my sister Edna.
How do you do?
And my husband.
How do you do?
I'm sorry to be late.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Grace Cardiff.
I was hoping to meet you.
Thank you for calling me.
I was going to mail this, but then I thought you were going to be here.
What is it?
-A book.
Hutch regained consciousness at the end, and he thought it was the next morning.
You know, when you had the appointment.
Oh, yes.
I wasn't there, but he told the doctor to make sure you got the book that was on his desk.
Thank you.
Oh, and I'm to tell you the name is an anagram.
The name of the book?
Apparently.
He was delirious, so it's hard to be sure.
I heard you come in.
It certainly wasn't very long.
I was late.
I couldn't get a taxi.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, you got mail already?
Somebody gave it to me.
Here. I'll hold it.
Book.
Oh, I know that house.
The Gilmores used to live there.
Oh?
-Yeah.
I've been there lots of times.
Grace-- That's one of my favorite names.
Yes.
You need anything?
Nothing, thank you.
Take a nap, why don't you?
I'm going to.
Yeah. Goodbye.
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,
He was soon after brought to New York.
He resided for several years in the United St--
He was attacked by a mob outside the Bram..."
Outside, not in the lobby.
There are no witches.
Not really.
The name is an anagram.
Now, that really makes sense.
Poor Hutch.
Ro?
What's with the chain?
What's the matter?
You all right?
-I'm fine.
Oh.
Oh, why, thank you.
How was the funeral?
O.K.
Got the shirt that was in the New Yorker.
I got that shirt that was in the New Yorker.
That's nice.
Do you know who Roman really is?
What do you mean, honey?
He's Adrian Marcato's son.
What?
Come here.
I want to show you something.
Roman Castavet is Steven Marcato rearranged.
It's from Hutch.
Look.
And look here.
There he is when he was 13.
See the eyes?
Coincidence.
In the same house?
And look. Look here.
"Soon after that in August, 1886, his son Steven was born."
1886. Got it?
That makes him 79 now.
No coincidence.
No, I guess not.
He's Steven Marcato, all right.
Poor old geezer.
With a crazy father like that, no wonder he switched his name around.
You don't think he's the same?
What do you mean, a witch?
Ro, are you kidding?
Oh, Ro, honey.
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?
Honey, it's 1966.
This was published in 1933.
There were covens in Europe.
That's what they're called-- the congregation.
Covens in Europe, in America, and in Australia, and they have one right here, that whole bunch.
The parties with the singing and the flute and the chanting, those are esbats or sabbaths or whatever they're called.
Honey, don't get excited.
Read what they do, Guy.
They use blood in their rituals.
The blood that has the most power is baby's blood.
And they don't just use the blood, they use the flesh, too.
Rosemary, for God's sakes!
They're not setting foot in this apartment ever again.
They're not coming within 50 feet of the baby.
They're old people.
They have a bunch of old friends.
Dr. Shand happens to play the recorder.
I'm not taking any chances with the baby's safety.
We're gonna sublet and move out.
We are not.
-Oh, yes we are!
We'll talk about it later.
I don't think you ought to read any more of that.
-Just this last chapter.
-Not today, honey.
Look. Your hands are shaking.
Come on. Give it to me.
Read it tomorrow.
-Guy!
I mean it, now.
Give it to me.
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
What'd you say the name was,
"Marchado"?
Marcato.
He told me his father was a coffee importer.
He told Guy he was a producer.
I understand how disturbed you must be to have him for a close neighbor.
I don't want anything more to do with him or Minnie.
I can't take even the slightest chance for the baby's sake.
Absolutely.
Any mother'd feel the same way.
Is there any chance at all that maybe Minnie put something harmful in those drinks or in those little cakes?
No, Rosemary, I'd have seen evidence of it long ago.
I won't take anything else from them.
You won't have to.
I can give you some pills that'll be adequate these last few weeks.
In a way, this may be the answer to Minnie's and
Roman's problem, too.
What do you mean?
Roman's very ill.
In fact, confidentially, he has no more than a month or two left.
I had no idea.
He wanted to pay a last visit to a few of his favorite cities.
They didn't want to offend you by leaving before the baby's birth.
I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well.
He'd be extremely embarrassed if he knew what you found out.
Suppose we do this.
I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.
I'll say I spoke to you and you understand.
Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday?
I'll see to it.
No matter where we are, our thoughts are gonna be with you every minute till you're all happy and thin again.
Your sweet little boy or girl laying safely in your arms.
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.
Yeah. You make Guy send us lots of pictures, ya hear?
Yes, I will.
Now, I'm not going to wish you good luck because you won't need it.
You're going to have a happy, happy life.
Have a good trip and come back safely.
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik or Pescara or maybe Majorca.
We shall see, we shall see.
Come back.
Bye, Minnie.
Yeah, goodbye.
Goodbye, Roman.
Bye-bye.
Take care now.
Kennedy Airport,
Pan Am Building.
Bye!
Bye, Roman.
Oh, boy.
Guy?
Hmm?
Where's my book?
Oh, I put it in the garbage.
What?
I didn't want you upsetting yourself anymore.
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.
I wasn't thinking about that.
That's a terrible thing to do.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.
Hey, watch out, lady!
"Some cultures believed that a personal possession of the victim is necessary and spells cannot be cast without one of the victim's belongings."
Yeah?
Is this Donald Baumgart?
That's right.
This is Rosemary Woodhouse,
Guy Woodhouse's wife.
Oh, yes.
I want to know--
You must be a happy little lady, living in the Bram, rows of uniformed lackeys.
I wanted to know how you are, if there's been any improvement.
Well, bless your heart.
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?
Well, I'm splendid.
I only broke six glasses today.
Guy and I are both very unhappy that he got his break because of your misfortune.
Aw, what the hell.
That's the way it goes, right?
I'm sorry I didn't come along that day he came to visit you.
V-Visit?
Oh, you mean the day we met for drinks?
Yes, that's what I meant.
By the way, he has something of yours, you know.
What do you mean?
Don't you know?
No.
Didn't you miss anything that day?
You don't mean my tie, do you?
Yes.
Oh, well, he's got mine, and I've got his.
He can have it back.
I'm sorry.
Doesn't matter to me now what color tie I'm wearing.
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.
Oh, no.
It was a trade.
Or... do you think he stole it?
I have to hang up now.
I just wanted to know if there'd been any improvement.
No, no, there isn't.
It was nice of you to call. Bye.
You aren't in labor, are you?
No, but I have to see the doctor.
It's very important.
But he has to leave at 5:00, and there is Mrs. Byron.
I'm sure he'll see you.
Just sit down.
Thank you.
How is it out there?
Oh, awful. 94.
Ugh!
See you next week.
Make an appointment.
Yes, I will.
You're due any day now, aren't you?
Tuesday.
You're smart to get it over with before August.
Mrs. Byron.
He'll see you right after.
Well, let's see, um...
July the 10th?
What time?
Fine.
All right.
See you then.
Thank you.
-Bye-bye.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Mmm! That smells nice.
What is it?
Oh, my--
It's called detchema.
Well, it's a big improvement on your regular, if you don't mind my saying.
That wasn't a perfume.
That was a good luck charm.
I threw it away.
Good.
Maybe the doctor will follow your example.
Dr. Sapirstein?
Yes. The aftershave.
Well, it isn't, is it?
I don't think he has a good luck charm.
Anyway, he has the same smell once in a while.
When he does--
Oh, boy.
Haven't you ever noticed?
No.
Well, maybe you thought it was your own you were smelling.
What is it, a chemical thing?
Will you excuse me a moment, please?
My husband is waiting outside.
I have to go and tell him something.
I'll be back in a minute.
Dr. Hill's office.
Dr. Hill, please.
This is his answering service.
Would you like to leave a message?
Um, yes.
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
Woodhouse.
And would you ask him to call me back right away, please?
Uh, my number is
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.
All right.
Quickly, please,
Dr. Hill, call me.
Oh, oh, really?
Did he really say that?
Oh, he didn't say that.
What else was it that he said?
Oh, that's wonderful.
That's wonder--
That's marvelous.
Yes. Dr. Hill?
Did I get the name right?
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?
Yes.
Are you Dr. Hill's patient?
No.
Um, yes, I mean, well, I've seen him once.
Um, please, please tell him he has to speak to me.
It's important.
Tell him to call me, hmm?
-All right.
-Thank you.
All of them.
All of them.
All in it together.
All of them.
All of them witches.
Don't you worry, little Andy or Jenny,
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.
Yes. Dr...
Mrs. Woodhouse?
Yes!
Oh, thank you,
Thank you for calling me.
Thought you were in California.
No. No, I've been to another doctor, and he isn't good,
Dr. Hill.
He's been lying to me and giving me unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me
June 28th?
Well, I want you to deliver it.
Mrs. Woodhouse...
Please let me talk to you.
Let me come and explain what's been going on.
I can't stay too long here.
They'll be coming, looking for me.
Dr. Hill?
Dr. Hill, there's a plot--
I know that sounds crazy.
You're probably thinking,
"My God, this poor girl has really flipped," but I haven't flipped,
Dr. Hill, I swear.
By all the saints,
I haven't.
There are plots against people, aren't there?
Yes, I suppose there are.
Well, then there's one against me and my baby.
Come to my office tomorrow after 5:00.
No!
Right now.
Mrs. Woodhouse,
I'm not at my office now.
I'm home. I've been up since yesterday morning.
I beg you.
I beg you.
I can't stay here.
My office at 8:00.
-Yes, thank you.
Oh, wait! Dr. Hill?
Yes?
My husband may call you, asking--
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap.
Thank you.
Keep the change.
Uh, driver, please, could you wait and watch until-- until I'm inside the door?
He lied to you.
He said we were going to Hollywood.
The worst thing of all, he's involved with them as well.
He sleeps in pajamas now.
He never used to before.
He's probably hiding a mark.
You know they give you marks when you join--
All sorts of rituals.
They hold sabbaths there.
You could hear them singing through the wall.
Guy, my husband Guy said it was Dr. Shand, one of these people playing a recorder.
Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shand unless he was there with them?
Um, they're very clever people.
They planned everything right from the beginning.
They probably made some sort of deal with Guy.
They gave him success, and he promised them our baby to use in their rituals.
I know this sounds crazy, but I've--I've got books here.
Look.
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart, and they put a spell on him.
They cast a spell on him and made him blind so that Guy could get his part.
Look, here.
I had this friend
Edward Hutchins.
Maybe you heard of him, a writer.
He wrote stories for boys.
Anyway, he was my good friend since I first came to New York.
May I keep this?
Yes, please, and, look, anyway, once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me--
Came to visit me. It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.
I was suffering so-- You can't imagine how much I was suffering, and they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would.
They were giving me a drink with tannis root in it.
Also witches' stuff, tannis root.
Hutch came, and he immediately saw something was wrong.
He--He knew about witches, you see.
Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup still on, which he never did.
They probably called him to come home and steal one of
Hutch's belongings, which he did.
Took his glove, and they put a spell on him, too.
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.
Now, maybe all of this is coincidence, but one thing is for sure.
They have a coven and they want my baby.
Certainly seems that way.
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.
I don't believe in witchcraft, but there are plenty of maniacs and crazy people in this city.
The doctor's name is Shand, you say?
N-No, Dr. Shand is one of these people.
The doctor's name is Sapirstein.
Abraham Sapirstein?
Yeah.
Do you know him?
I've met him once or twice.
To look at him, you'd never think he--
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.
Would you like to go into Mount Sinai right now, this evening?
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?
It's difficult, but we'll try.
I want you to lie down and get some rest.
Yes.
Anything they've got, even a broom closet'd be fine.
I hope we can do better than that.
I'll see what I can do, then I'll check you over.
Oh, should I undress now?
No. It'll take me about a half-hour on the telephone.
You just lie down, rest.
O.K.?
O.K.
God bless Dr. Hill.
Everything's going to be O.K. now,
Andy or Jenny.
We're going to be in a nice, clean hospital with no visitors.
Oh.
Monsters.
Monsters.
Unspeakable.
Unspeakable.
I was sleeping.
Come with us quietly,
Rosemary.
Don't argue or make a scene because if you say anything more about witches or witchcraft, we're going to be forced to take you to a mental hospital.
You don't want that, do you?
So put your shoes on.
Wejust want to take you home.
No one's going to hurt you.
Or the baby.
Put your shoes on.
She's fine now.
We're going to go home and rest.
That's all it takes.
Thank you for your trouble,
Doctor.
Glad I could be of help, sir.
It's a shame you had to come in here.
Good evening,
Mrs. Woodhouse.
Mrs. Woodhouse!
Mrs. Woodhouse!
Uhh!
Ro!
Ro!
Ro!
Ro, baby, Ro!
Ro!
Come on, open up, Ro.
Go to hell!
Come on, honey.
No one's going to hurt you.
You promised them the baby, get out!
No, I didn't promise them anything.
What are you talking about?
Promised who?
Rosemary, you're--
You, too! Get away!
Hello.
Elise?
Mrs. Dunstan is out.
-Who is this?
-The babysitter.
Do you know where she went?
They went to the movies.
This is Rosemary.
Please ask her to call Rosemary the second she gets home.
It's terribly urgent.
Don't-- Don't forget.
Don't worry.
I'll tell her.
Thank you.
We don't want to hurt you, Ro.
We're your friends,
Rosemary.
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Rosemary.
Honest and truly there isn't.
This is nothing but a mild sedative to calm you down.
You know I wouldn't let any--
Ro.
Aah!
Ro, Ro!
Help me!
Oh, Ro, baby.
Somebody help me!
Aah!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute now.
We happen to be in labor here.
Here?
Here.
You're all right, baby.
You're going to be perfectly all right.
I swear to God you will.
There were supposed to be doctors, hospitals!
Doctors, hospitals!
Everything--
Everything's clean and sterile!
No, she isn't here, Elise.
I'll have her call you back.
Oh, Andy...
Andy or Jenny...
I--I'm sorry, my little darling.
Forgive me.
Hi.
Hi.
Is it all right?
Yes, it's fine.
What is it?
A boy.
Really?
A boy?
And it's all right?
Yes.
Where is it?
Ohh!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.
The baby, where is it?
Oh, uh, you wait here one minute.
Where's my baby?
Uh, I'll go find Dr. Abe.
Ju-Just wait.
Where's the baby?
Where is it?
Honey...
There were complications,
Rosemary, but nothing that will affect future births.
It's...
Dead.
It was in the wrong position.
In the hospital
I might have been able to do something about it, but you wouldn't listen.
Honey, we can have others as soon as you're better. I promise you.
Absolutely. You can start on another in a very few months.
As soon as you're better.
No.
I don't believe you.
You're both lying.
You're lying!
It didn't die!
You took it!
You're lying!
You're witches!
You're lying!
You're lying!
You're lying!
You're lying!
Abe says it's called pre-partum.
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.
Boy, you were really kapow, out of your mind.
Uh, I know where you got the idea that Minnie and Roman were witches, but, um, how come you thought that Abe and I joined the party?
Um, let's face it, darling.
You had the pre-partum crazies.
Now you're going to rest, and you're going to get over them.
I know this is the worst thing that ever happened to you, but from now on, everything's going to be roses.
Paramount's within an inch of where we want them, and suddenly Universal's interested, too, and we're going to blow this town, and we're going to be in the beautiful Hills of Beverly with a pool, a spice garden, the whole schmeer, and the kids, too, Ro.
Scout's honor.
You heard what Abe said.
Now, I got to run now and get famous.
Let me see your shoulder.
Let me see your shoulder.
Are you kidding?
Your left shoulder.
All right.
Anything you say.
I generally prefer doing this to music.
Left shoulder.
Right shoulder.
And that's as far as I go without a blue light.
The high pressure area that we see here has been causing this extreme heat and humidity.
And unfortunately will be staying with us city dwellers through the rest of the week.
It will be hot and over cast upstate New York as well with the possibility of thunder showers tonight and tomorrow withg radual clearing by tomorrow night.
All you people leaving the city this upcoming weekend should find it hot.
Do you hear a baby crying?
Why, no, I don't, dear.
Now, you come and get into your bed now.
It's time for you to take your pill.
Did you turn the air conditioner off?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.
Why, people are actually dying, it's so hot.
What do you do with the milk?
Why, uh, throw it away.
Your pill, Rosemary.
Hello, girls.
Whew. 95 out.
Some new people moved on in up in 8.
Do they have a baby?
How'd you know that?
I heard it crying.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, no.
Don't do that.
Why not?
Uh, a little messy, that's all.
Easy, easy.
Got her too high.
Not if he's still waiting for a plane, he isn't.
Oh, hell, now, Hayato.
You're just making fun of me.
You're pulling my leg, like we say.
Aah!
Rosemary, go back to bed.
You know you're not supposed to be up and around.
Is the mother?
Uh, Rosemary--
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.
What have you done to it?
What have you done to its eyes?
He has his father's eyes.
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.
What have you done to him, you maniacs?
Satan is his father, not Guy.
He came up from hell and begat a son of mortal woman.
Hail, Satan.
Hail, Satan.
Satan is his father, and his name is Adrian.
He shall overthrow the mighty and lay waste their temples.
He shall redeem the despised and wreak vengeance in the name of the burned and the tortured!
Hail, Adrian!
Hail, Adrian!
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!
He chose you out of all the world.
Out of all the women in the whole world, he chose you.
He arranged things because he wanted you to be the mother of his only living son.
His power is stronger than stronger!
His might shall last longer than longer!
Hail, Satan!
No!
It can't be!
No!
Go look at his hands.
And his feet.
Oh, God!
God is dead!
Satan lives!
The year is one!
- Hail, Satan!
- Hail, Satan!
The year is one, and God is done!
Oh, God!
The year is one!
Hail, Adrian!
Hail, Satan!
Why don't you help us out,
Rosemary?
Be a real mother to Adrian.
You don't have to join
If you don't want to.
Just be a mother to your baby.
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.
It's not right.
Think about it, Rosemary.
Oh, God!
Oh, shut up with your oh, Gods, or we'll kill you, milk or no milk.
You shut up.
Rosemary's his mother, so you show some respect.
Come, my friend.
Come see him.
Come see the child.
What would you like to drink?
They, uh, promised me you wouldn't be hurt, and you haven't been, really.
I mean, supposing you had the baby and you lost it.
Wouldn't that be the same?
And we're getting so much in return, Ro.
Oh, Guy, let me introduce you to Argyron Stavropoulos.
How proud you must be.
Is this the mother?
Why in the name of--
Here, drink this.
You'll feel a little better.
What's in it?
Tannis root?
Nothing's in it.
Just plain, ordinary Lipton's tea.
You drink it.
Get away from here.
Roman.
You're rocking him too fast.
Sit down.
Get her out of here.
Put her where she belongs.
You're rocking him too fast.
That's why he's crying.
Oh, mind your own business.
Let Rosemary rock him.
Go on, sit down with the others.
Let Rosemary rock him.
Well, she's liable to--
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.
Rock him.
You're trying to get me to be his mother.
Aren't you his mother?
END
Lew Harper for Mrs. Sampson.
- Yes?
- Lew Harper.
Park it over there.
This way, Mr. Harper.
- Mrs. Sampson?
- That's right.
Lew Harper.
Albert Graves telephoned.
Said you needed me for something.
Oh.
- A drink, Mr. Harper?
- Not before lunch, thanks.
- I thought you were a detective.
- New type.
Oh.
Albert Graves is one of our lawyers.
It's on his recommendation I'm hiring you.
It's about time he threw some business my way.
I've known Albert since he was DA up here.
Oh. He said you were good at finding things.
My husband's...
You're sitting on my robe.
My husband's disappeared.
Tried Missing Persons?
Well, that might mean publicity.
Ralph loathes publicity.
Besides, he's got an abnormal fear of the police.
I simply want you to find him and tell me which female he's with.
- Any particular female?
- I haven't the least notion.
Ralph need never know about this.
He'd be sure I was gathering material for divorce proceedings.
Actually, I have no intention of divorcing him.
I only intend to outlive him.
I only want to see him in his grave.
- What a terrible thing to say.
- People in love will say anything.
I used to love him, before we were married.
But after we took our vows,
I had an accident, and that very same week Ralph started fooling around with a new lady.
It's taken me a while to forgive him.
A long, long while.
When did your husband...
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
Not necessary.
- When did your husband disappear?
- Yesterday.
Our pilot, Allan, flew Ralph down from Vegas.
When they reached the airport,
Allan put the plane away.
When he came back,
Ralph had given him the slip.
- Any particular reason?
- Drunk.
I don't like him drunk on the loose.
He gets sloppy, sentimental.
He gives things away.
Last time it happened, he gave away a whole mountain.
He gave it to some semi-nude religious nut from Los Angeles.
You know,
LA is the big league for religious nuts.
That's 'cause there's nothing to do at night.
If you can find him quickly, I'd be grateful.
And if he's with another woman, I'd be...
Well, more than interested.
Felix.
You're lurking in doorways again.
I did not want to interrupt.
You can go now.
I'll have my lunch up here as usual.
Thank you.
Allan's down by the pool.
Any more particulars you want you can get from him.
I'll leave the matter of fee up to Albert Graves to settle.
Did you drive up from LA?
Leave your car here.
Felix will drive you to Albert's office.
It's only 10 minutes away.
Goodbye, Mr. Harper.
It would help some if I knew what your husband looked like.
Oh, silly of me.
Here.
You can keep that one.
"A poor thing, but mine own."
Where's the telephone?
I have to call Los Angeles.
Do you got one with a little more privacy?
That's the phone the help's supposed to use.
- Hello.
- Hello, Fred? It's Lew.
Is Susan there yet?
Yes.
Tell her I'm not gonna be able to make it today.
I got called in on a situation.
And we were going to get everything settled today.
Where is he this time?
I'm up in Santa Theresa.
Tell her Albert Graves called.
Said he needed me for something.
She'll understand.
Something about Albert Graves needing him and you'll understand.
No. No, I don't.
I've been trying to get this divorce thing settled for too long now, and I have lately been running low on understanding.
- She says she's...
- I heard.
Tell her that I...
We're supposed to be handling this like adults.
Now, I don't want a screaming match, but the last time we were going to meet something came up, too.
It wasn't my fault.
- He says it wasn't...
- I heard.
I don't care what he says.
He's just trying to stall because he thinks
I'm gonna change my mind about this.
Well, I may change a lot of things from now on, but my mind isn't about to be one of them.
Look, let me speak to her, will you?
- Here.
- No.
Would you put her on?
Take it. Talk to him.
I have taken it.
Every year since we were married I took it.
And I've talked to him, too.
He holds no more surprises.
No more nothing.
You hear me, Lew? I don't love you.
And you can get shot in some stinking alley and I'll be a little sorry, sure, but that's all.
Just a little sorry.
Tell him that, lawyer.
Tell the man he is not loved.
Hey!
Hey. Top of the morning.
- Allan Taggert.
- Lew Harper.
That's Mr. Sampson's daughter.
Miranda.
Miranda.
Lew Harper.
- Could we talk?
- Sure.
Can you tell me something...
My stepmother, Lady Macbeth, is always going to extremes.
Meaning me, Miss Sampson?
I'm a very moderate type fella.
Not you especially.
Everything she does is extreme.
Other women fall off horses without getting paralyzed.
Not Elaine.
I think it's psychological, don't you?
You've been reading too many books.
That's something they'll never accuse you of.
She's not a raving beauty anymore.
- Can I have a sandwich?
- Yes.
So she retired from competition.
Falling off the horse gave her a chance to do it.
And for all I know she did it intentionally.
And you've got to admit it's pretty extreme, hiring a private detective when your husband's been gone just one night.
That may be so, Miss Sampson.
Tell me about Sampson's disappearance.
He disappeared.
Yesterday afternoon about 3:30, we flew in from Vegas and landed at Van Nuys Airport.
I let Mr. Sampson off at the administration building.
He said he wanted to call the Bel-Air Hotel for a limousine.
Daddy keeps a bungalow there.
I taxied the plane up to our hangar and tied it down.
When I got back to the entrance,
Mr. Sampson wasn't there.
I waited. Then I went to the Bel-Air Hotel and I waited some more.
What about luggage?
Was he planning to spend the night?
He said he was, but he didn't have any luggage.
That doesn't mean anything.
Daddy keeps a lot of clothes at the bungalow.
He likes to be able to pick up fast.
So do I.
How long did it take you to bed down the plane?
Fifteen minutes. Twenty at the outside.
That's not very much time for a limousine to get there from the Bel-Air.
Maybe he never called the hotel.
Maybe somebody met him at the airport.
Will you be going back to Los Angeles?
- Yeah, after I see a friend.
- Male or female?
Sampson's lawyer.
Albert Graves.
Well, you can fly Mr. Harper there or you can stay here with me.
I'll fly.
It'll keep me from getting bored.
- Hey, you in a hurry?
- Yeah, sort of.
- Storing up for the winter?
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's split.
- Sold!
You met my friend Felix?
He's always listening.
We're friends, aren't we, Felix?
He's some cat, that Felix.
How come so rough on Miranda?
How come everybody jumps to conclusions about me and Miranda?
Listen, she's no genius, you know.
Besides, she's an adolescent.
I can't help the way she feels.
Anyway, I got myself a real woman.
How does Miranda get along with her old man?
Okay, until a little while ago, when he started trying to make her get married.
Oh, yeah? Anybody in particular?
Yeah. Your buddy.
Albert Graves.
Oh.
Oh! Hi.
You look like death warmed over.
Always nice to hear from my fans.
What's that?
What's that?
- Things any better with Susan?
- Yeah. Terrific.
Good, good.
Oh, I just... Staying in shape.
I still do the old Canadian Air Force exercises every morning.
Yogurt for lunch and then a lot of this.
It's all paying off, don't you think?
Yeah, I've never seen you look more ravishing than you are at the moment.
You talk to Mrs. Sampson?
- That's a sweet lady. Warm, content.
- A love.
- Why'd she hire me?
- I talked her into it.
I think Sampson needs protection.
He's worth $20 million on the hoof and he's an alcoholic.
That's just for openers.
I also think he's losing his mind.
Did she mention Claude, the holy man he gave the mountain to?
Yeah.
Now Mrs. Sampson thinks the old man is running with another woman.
That's because I encouraged her to think that.
She'd never spend a penny on him if she only thought his life was in danger.
What about the old-fashioned custom of calling the police?
I can't. He's psychotic on the subject.
If I went to them and they found him, he'd fire me.
What kind of a weirdo is Sampson?
Well, I can tell you everything in one word: moneymaker.
He has to make money.
He's dedicated to it.
It's the only way he can prove to himself he's still breathing.
He had a son, you know.
A pilot. He was killed a few years back.
That's when he started losing his mind.
He's got this fella now, Allan Taggert.
- We met. Nice-looking fella.
- Looks, looks. Who cares about looks?
Well, the point is, we're less than two hours' drive from Los Angeles, so what does he need a pilot for?
Personally, I like Allan, but from a business standpoint
I feel he's an unnecessary expense.
How do you have an unnecessary expense with $20 million?
Well, that's enough exercising.
I don't wanna get too strong.
Did you meet Sampson's daughter?
That ugly, skinny kid?
Yeah, we passed in the night.
Oh, Lew, isn't she incredible?
Oh, boy.
You dirty old man.
Go on. You think I'm too old for her.
No. When she's 100, you'll only be 124.
You think I'm old enough to be her father?
You're old enough to be her grandfather.
Go to hell.
Solid Citizen Albert, hung up on a chick at your age.
That's a hoot.
- Lew, did she say anything about me?
- Nope.
- She didn't even mention my name?
- I only saw her for a second.
Oh, that explains it.
How does she feel about you?
Well, she's young and cautious.
You remember how that was.
But I have great expectations.
So do I.
My going rate is $2,000 flat
- against 100 hours a day and expenses.
- It is like hell.
But you can have it if you'll mention my virtues to Miranda.
My pleasure.
Hey, what are your virtues?
I decided to fly down to LA with you, all right?
- Hello, Miranda.
- Oh, hello, Albert.
Excuse me, honey.
Say, did you send a limousine for a Mr. Sampson
- to Van Nuys Airport yesterday?
- No, sir.
Well, there was this here fella at the airport said he left in a big, black limousine.
Well, he called here yesterday and asked for one, but then he called back and canceled.
You sure it was Sampson both times?
Oh, yes. I recognize his voice.
He's been coming here for years.
Did he sound drunk?
Oh, sir, I couldn't give that kind of information.
Sorry.
Got the key?
Well?
Daddy hasn't been here for a month.
I just asked the desk clerk.
Terrific.
Here.
Well, I think I'll flake out awhile and then call some friends.
Well, I was hoping we might do something.
The thing about you, Miranda, is you're such a drag.
Wow!
No wonder your old man took to the sauce.
I would, too, if I had to sleep in here.
Ever since my brother died
I've been trying to argue him out of it, this astrology bit, but obviously without much success.
- Any astrologist in particular?
- None that I know of.
- Harper.
- What?
- You work hard, you know that?
- Yep. Regular beaver.
- Harper?
- What?
Don't you ever feel the need to relax?
Let's relax some, Harper.
For what? So the beauty in the next room is gonna get all hot and bothered?
Lady, if you can't get him hot and bothered by yourself,
I sure ain't gonna do it for you.
Don't you think I'm attractive?
You're young, rich and beautiful, and my wife is divorcing me.
What do you think I think?
I think you wanna relax.
All right, honey.
If you really wanna play around, we'll just douse the lights and seal off the room.
Feel better now, Myrtle?
- You know her?
- No.
- Hey, Beauty, Fay Estabrook strike a note?
- Yeah.
You ever seen her with Sampson?
Any idea where she hangs out?
Yeah, sometimes.
She used to be a pretty hot young starlet.
What happened to her?
She got fat!
Give me another one of those, will you?
It's 6:02.
We don't serve domestic after 6:00.
Only imported.
Terrific. Keep the change.
There is no change.
Keep it anyway.
Are you Miss Estabrook?
- No! Fay Estabrook?
- Dumpling!
It is, isn't it? Can I have your autograph?
Well...
You know, it's for my daughter.
She watches all your pictures.
She thinks you're just wonderful.
- That's nice.
- I ain't bothering you, am I?
No. It's no bother.
Thanks. That's all right.
Just sign right there.
No, that's all right, just one.
Just make it to Billie Lou.
Something real intimate.
Ain't you got a pencil?
Well...
- Billie Lou?
- Can I... Billie Lou. Yeah.
Can I sit down?
Actually, you know, that's...
I don't have no daughter. That's for me.
I don't know how many fans you have.
You probably got millions, but ain't nothing, nobody who's more faithful than I am.
I just watch all your movies on the television.
Oh, that's nice.
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure. Why not?
- Boy?
- Wait a minute.
- When were you born?
- June 2.
June 2. Gemini.
Oh, Gemini are cold-hearted.
Oh, are you cold-hearted, dumpling?
Well, hell, big dogs is always licking my hand.
- Hey!
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby!
- Oh, it's just what I needed, honey.
- There's one in every crowd.
You're sweet. You ain't no Gemini.
Honey, where is the... The...
Hey, this place is like the morgue.
Where have all the merrymakers gone?
- I'm gonna take you home, honey.
- Oh, now, don't rush things.
Come on, let's have another little drinkie first.
- You want another little drinkie?
- No, stiffens up my chewing gum.
Anyway, you're too classy for a place like this.
Yeah. I am classy.
Not everybody notices.
Well, I got just the spot for you.
Bel-Air Hotel.
Oh, the Bel-Air? Oh, yes, that's...
Oh, I need...
Hey, you think you could cough up a split of champagne?
Oh, and let's have a little caviar, huh?
Oh, I love this place. I've always adored it.
Why, I'm so glad you suggested it.
- You know, I have a friend stays here a lot.
- Oh, yeah?
Oh, you're jealous.
You're getting jealous. I can tell!
What is it with me that men all the time wanna possess me?
Your friend stay around here now?
Oh, you really are jealous.
Oh, baby!
The green-eyed dragon!
Oh, Ralph's much older than you, baby.
And he's in Vegas, and, besides, now I only do his astrological charts and a little interior decorating.
I did his room in the hotel.
Oh, I wish I could show it to you.
I have this fabulous taste.
You got everything, baby.
Now, who is this fella Ralph?
Oh! He's my oldest friend.
But he's not a nice man.
He...
He's gotten to be a very kinky personality.
- Kinky?
- Kinky is British for weird, you...
Weird. You know what I mean?
Say, you're a real pistol.
- Be back in a sec.
- Oh...
You're supposed to be looking for Daddy.
Come on, get her out of here, will you?
That happens to be a hard night's work, buddy.
Say, Mrs. Sampson's been calling.
She wants to get your advice.
- About what?
- She got a special delivery...
She got a special delivery letter from Daddy.
He told her to tell Albert to cash in some bonds and get some money ready.
About half a million, cash.
- Are you kidding?
- That's what it said.
- Is she sure it's your father's writing?
- Of course.
- Well, you better get the money.
- And then?
Wait.
Till somebody gives us proof your father's still alive.
It's a possibility, so you might as well face it.
Why don't you get her bedded down?
No, you're no Mexican.
I know Mexicans, and you're no Mexican.
- No, you're a phony Mexican.
- Hey, what's the trouble, dumpling?
They don't wanna play La Cucaracha,
and I do La Cucaracha like nothing!
What do you know? You...
Honey, he ain't got no guitar.
Well, if he was a real Mexican, he'd have a guitar.
- Where do you live?
- Why?
'Cause if I don't grab you pretty soon,
I'm gonna get sick.
Oh, I live in the Pacific Palisades.
118 Woodlawn Lane.
- I'm gonna drive you home.
- All right. I'm ready. I feel great!
Help!
Don't try to do anything to me tonight, dumpling. Everything's tilting.
Some other time. Any other time.
- Yeah?
- Mr. Troy?
This is Betty. Is Fay there?
Listen, I heard she was in the Bel-Air a while ago, smashed, with some guy.
We don't want him at the house when the truck goes through,
so get rid of him.
- Where are you?
- The Piano Bar. Where else would I be?
Is Ralph Sampson there?
All right, who is this?
I beg you not to do anything foolish, old stick.
- Is that thing loaded?
- Six times.
Oh, boy.
- Who are you?
- Oh, beauty before age, old stick.
Well, I'm Miss Estabrook's escort for the evening. I...
And I see the light on in Miss Estabrook's bedroom.
What were you doing in there?
I didn't go in there. I swear I didn't.
No, she had to go to the...
Yeah, well, she never could hold her liquor.
Boy, that's shocking treatment.
Ain't nothing like this ever happen in Texas.
Oh, you all from Texas, huh?
Why are you interested in an old bag of worms like her?
She's not an old bag of worms.
She's the sexiest thing I ever seen.
Well, I disagree, but then, you see,
I am married to Miss Estabrook and I know whereof I speak.
See what I mean?
Now, my name is Dwight Troy.
I don't think you ever specified what your name was.
My name is Lewis Harper. I sell insurance.
I didn't know she was married.
I'd sure like to get out of here.
Oh, relax, old stick.
I am not the jealous type.
You want her, you can have her.
But I do not like strangers in my house.
So I don't think I'd better see you around here anymore.
Is that a threat?
Oh, is it ever, old stick.
Now you get along.
You know a place called Piano?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
But I don't think you wanna go there, mister.
Oh, well, I'm a swinger.
- Lew Harper.
- Betty Fraley.
Nice sound you lay down.
Don't put me on.
You're probably tone-deaf.
Maybe, but I got every side you ever cut.
You're not very hip, but I believe you.
Except you got cop's eyes.
Narcotics?
Listen, I did my time. I'm straight now.
- What are you after?
- Ralph Sampson.
I know your voice.
You said you were Troy.
What about Sampson?
- I don't know him.
- I think you do.
And I think I can convince my friends on the narcotics squad that those tracks are fresh.
All right, I know him.
He comes in here sometimes and gets drunk.
He's a drunk, and all drunks look alike.
- What else you know?
- Nothing.
- Come on.
- Nothing.
- Come on!
- Nothing!
Puddler.
He's fuzz, Puddler. Private.
Wise guys. Always making waves.
I'm gonna teach you.
Hot damn! I did it!
Hey, Harper. Hey, you see that?
Harper? You all right?
Sure you are. Come on.
Hey, you know, this detective work is really fun.
- Oh, boy.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
Wait a minute. Wait...
Can you make it?
- Where'd you come from?
- I got Miranda bedded down.
So I talked one of my buddies out of a car and started hitting some of Sampson's spots.
This joint was one of them.
I was coming in when you were going out.
Well, I'm in your debt, Beauty.
- Where you parked?
- Oh, across the street.
Hey, you really think
Sampson was kidnapped?
- Who'd do it?
- I don't know.
A guy named Troy, maybe a woman named Estabrook.
- Come on, let's go.
- Where to?
Back to the first place
I got thrown out of tonight.
What's this place all about?
That Fraley broad said something about a truck coming through and somebody didn't want me around.
Maybe 'cause Sampson's in it.
- Do you want me to break that down?
- You want to?
- You really mean it?
- Go ahead.
Hot damn!
Yeah, detective work is really fun.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, boy. That hurt a little bit?
That hurt a little bit?
You know how to use this?
Oh, I prefer a Thompson, actually, but this'll do in a pinch.
You dirty rat!
- "You gave that man oranges?"
- Okay. You all through?
If that truck should come through, or anybody else, let me know, will you?
Some other time, dumpling.
- What happened?
- It's the truck.
I was trying to blow a tire.
Hey, Lew. You all right?
I'm awful tired of answering that question.
You sure the handwriting is his?
That moronic scrawl is unforgettable.
It's not unlikely your husband's been kidnapped, Mrs. Sampson.
Kidnapping is a federal offense.
I'm well aware of that, Mr. Harper, but please don't bother suggesting that we bring in the police.
Kidnapping is a federal offense.
I'm not sure my husband's business dealings are completely legal.
Not all of them, anyway.
You may be jumping to conclusions.
For all we know,
Ralph may be planning a round-the-world jaunt with some happy harlot and needs some spending money.
I think your husband's been kidnapped.
I think that note was dictated.
Your husband keeps lousy company,
Mrs. Sampson, as bad as there is in LA.
And that's as bad as there is.
I knew it.
Oh, he loves playing the family man, but he never fooled me.
Water seeks its own level, and that should leave Ralph bathing happily somewhere in a sewer.
Daddy may be dead, and you're crowing.
I don't believe it's the children's hour yet, darling.
You have such an advantage in emotional scenes, Elaine, being frigid.
Puss, puss, puss.
Did Allan brush you off again?
You simpy, primping, narcissistic...
Either I'm a narcissist or I'm frigid, pussy.
I can't very well be both.
Excuse me, ladies.
Oh, why are you leaving?
It's so attractive here.
I should think you'd be accustomed to not being loved by now.
I love your wrinkles. I revel in them.
Puss, puss, puss.
I...
I just don't enjoy carrying this kind of money around.
I'm a lawyer, not a financier.
Albert, you got any friends in the LA Police from when you were DA up here?
I have some favors left uncollected, yes.
Get them to run a check on every black limousine rented or stolen in the last three days.
See if you can get them to put somebody on a dive called The Piano.
Dwight Troy's place.
You mean Troy...
What do you know about him?
I had to take some papers to Las Vegas once for Sampson to sign.
He and Troy were gambling.
I checked on Troy.
He seems elegant enough, but people have a habit of dying around him.
I've tried telling Sampson, but...
Oh, thank heavens.
I was so nervous, bringing that here.
I got this out of mothballs.
You know, you always were the most unlikely war hero I ever knew.
Still know how to use it?
I hope not.
Better get a cop up here to keep an eye on that money.
You're not staying?
I'm getting buggy sitting around here.
It's about time I visited that mountain that Sampson gave away.
Miranda? Hello, Miranda.
Miranda's coming.
How are you?
- Suicidal.
- Oh.
I just had the nicest chat with stepmommy.
How do I get to that mountain, anyway?
Oh, here, I'll diagram it for you.
Don't bother. I'll take him.
I've just got to get out of this house.
Wait till I change.
Wow!
I expect you to behave in all ways like a civilized human being.
First it's Taggert's boyish charm, and now it's your indefinable something.
- Poor, nice Albert.
- I am nice.
Wouldn't you think she'd notice?
The bottom is loaded with nice people, Albert.
Only cream and bastards rise.
Why so fast, Harper?
You trying to impress me?
You got a way of starting conversations that ends conversation.
Why is your wife divorcing you?
You got a way of starting conversations that ends conversation.
What do you do this kind of crummy work for, anyway?
What, are you trying to be funny?
I do it because I believe in the United Nations and Southeast Asia and...
You think it's funny if your life depends on what goes through the Panama Canal?
What about the English pound?
I'll tell you something, boy, so long as there's a Siberia, you'll find Lew Harper on the job.
- Are you putting me on?
- Jeez, I don't think so.
Hey, Harper, what do you think of me?
Well, I'd say you had nearly everything and could develop into almost anything.
What's my big deficiency?
Your sideburns.
Come on.
Just that.
Stop acting like a bitch in heat every time anything pretty in pants wanders by.
Oh, so we think we're pretty.
Well, what's your big deficiency?
I have none. I'm a bloody saint.
Yeah? What about that woman last night at the restaurant?
Well, what could be more saintly?
Just feeding booze to an alcoholic to get information.
All part of the job.
Well, when I'm bored, I drive fast.
I pretend I'm on my way to meet something utterly new, all naked and bright.
I've gone 105 along here.
Oh, what are you trying to do?
Impress me?
Well, why don't you stand on it, old man?
You're just as stuffy as Albert.
The same Victorian hang-up.
You probably still think a woman's place is in the home.
Not in my home.
Well, now, there's something all naked and bright for you.
Have you come to seek salvation?
Have you come to seek salvation?
It's me, Claude, Miranda Sampson.
This is Mr. Harper.
We're looking for Daddy.
Has he been here?
No.
To my sorrow, no.
I'm sorry.
You may not come onto holy ground.
You've not been purified.
I was once a lost and evil man, blind-hearted and sinful.
Miranda here can tell you that.
But then the sword of the blessed sun slew the black beast of the flesh and I was purified at last.
Can't I just look around?
He'll be risking the wrath of the sun god.
I'm lionhearted.
Expecting disciples for supper?
Whoever comes to the Temple of the Clouds may be sure of some warm beans and a bed.
- Where is the harm?
- Nowhere.
I know you think me a charlatan.
I can only say that if you were correct, then death could not claim me too quickly.
You obviously have some strong connection with the Sampsons.
Don't deride me to them, I beg you.
The gift of this temple was the beginning of my life.
I know to you I look ridiculous, but I only want to increase the amount of love in this world.
Where is the harm?
Nowhere.
That in itself is a victory. Don't laugh.
Oh, I only laugh at what's funny.
What's that,
- the bedroom?
- It will be.
It's nice.
How many followers you got up here?
- It varies.
- With the climate?
You might say that.
Thanks for the tour.
- Walk with love.
- I'll try.
Yeah, I only laugh when it's funny.
My own stupidity, maybe.
- Mr. Graves here?
- He's in Santa Theresa.
But there's a deputy in the library.
What's going on?
- Nothing much. Kidnapping and extortion.
- Oh.
Fingerprints?
Now, I knew that.
What's the matter with me?
- You got an evidence kit?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Right out in the car.
Do you want me to go get it for you?
Oh, no, no. I just want to stand here for a couple of hours and hold this.
No, listen, though, I'll get it for you, sir.
Long arm of the law, good luck.
- Yes?
- Lew.
- Yeah.
- It's a kidnapping. I got the note.
"Deposit $500,000
"at 9:00 tonight.
"Oil field, one mile south of Santa Theresa.
"Leave money at large oil pump, end of double row.
"After drop, drive north and keep on going.
"Too bad for Sampson if you screw up."
9:00 tonight.
That only gives us three-and-a-half hours.
Better call the Sheriff and have him pay me a visit.
Right.
- Anything on the limousine?
- Nothing yet, but we're checking.
Lew?
How do you suppose they knew the money was ready?
I don't know. Either they're gambling or they got somebody inside the castle.
- You think?
- I think.
Okay.
Hey!
What are you doing there?
- I was just...
- How many phones in the house?
- Five.
- Come on, quick!
Six! Three up, three down.
Too many.
Too damn many.
Since you phoned,
I've been pondering all this, and it's my opinion we give them the money clean and hope they come through with Sampson.
Then if they don't, he'll hunt them down.
- You think?
- I think.
Oh, no, no. This note says to drop the money and drive north.
Well, that means he'll be making his getaway south.
I'll set up a roadblock down the highway.
You do that, you kiss goodbye to Sampson.
Well, whoever I catch,
I guarantee I'll make him talk.
You make it worse, you trip the money man.
We'll have the kidnapper in the county jail but Sampson with his throat cut somewhere.
Who is this clown?
He's a private detective working for us.
Yeah, I used to be a sheriff, till I passed my literacy test.
Now, wait a minute.
Gentlemen, please!
- All right. You make the delivery.
- No.
I want Beauty and Albert to do it.
And what'll you do?
Are you going to rescue my Ralph for me?
Oh, now, Elaine, I don't want you to worry.
How can I worry with men like you on the job?
- Now, there's a pretty brave woman.
- Yeah. Gutty as hell.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
Boy, that's gonna look terrific, you get that unscrambled.
You want a nice table?
Well, later, maybe.
You can help me, though.
I'm looking for this fella, see.
I met him at the ballpark and he said he'd meet me here, but I don't see him.
- Well, what's his name?
- That's just it. I don't know.
- Now, wait a minute.
- No, it's okay.
I owe him some money on a bet.
That's the thing.
He's about 40. He's very tall.
Wears a windbreaker and Levi's, and he drives this small van-truck.
Come again on why you wanna find him?
Well, I owe him money on a bet, see?
And you're just eaten up with honesty, is that it?
You know what happens to bookies that don't pay off?
I knew you was a bookie the minute you came in.
No kidding.
You could really tell that I was...
I mean, you can really tell?
You been waiting tables as long as I have, you get to know the types.
But you can't be no help, huh?
Eddie's who you want.
Eddie's somebody.
Only he ain't been here for two or three nights. Three nights.
I remember 'cause he wanted to make a long-distance call and the boss didn't care for that,
'cause sometimes he gets stung if it's over three minutes.
Well, Eddie made the call anyway. Collect.
I don't know to where.
How much you owe Eddie?
Where's the boss?
Behind the bar.
Give me a can of beer.
Say, I'm looking for a fellow by the name of Eddie. I owe him some money.
Well, he called me long-distance from here about three nights ago.
- You from Las Vegas?
- Well, yeah. I just come up.
You know, I would've guessed you were from Vegas.
No kidding. You can tell, huh?
Oh, really tell?
You must be physic.
Psychic, you mean.
You know where Eddie lives?
Well, give me some dimes then, will you?
Oh, terrific.
Hello?
- Oh, Mrs. Harper?
- Yes.
- Mrs. Lewis Harper?
- That's right.
Oh, thank heavens.
You see, we've just picked your name from this enormous drum full of names, only you had to be there to win, and you are, so you have.
Win?
Six one-hour frug lessons, absolutely free.
Yes.
Well, I'm Austin Schwartz-Marmaduke of the Schwartz-Marmaduke Institute for Ballroom Education.
Well, you must have heard of us.
We're just off Wilshire.
Yes, next to the Frug Foundation.
The Miracle Mile, actually.
I don't want any frug lessons.
Oh, but of course you do, dear lady.
Well, just think how terrific you'll feel the next time you and your husband try fruging, how endlessly feminine you'll feel.
My husband is dead.
Oh. Well, that's too bad.
- As a matter of fact...
- No, as a matter of fact, you're wrong.
His death did nothing but serve the cause of mankind.
He was a fool, a sadist, a functioning pathological pervert.
You mean he actually...
Oh, but I do.
Oh, he was grotesque in all ways.
I mean, can a soul be atrocious?
Well, I'd never...
His was.
He was a degenerate's degenerate.
You won't believe this, Mr. Marmaduke, but he used to call me up on the phone sometimes, pretending to be other people.
He actually thought it was funny.
Well...
Listen, I'm in a bar at Castle Beach, but I'm hiding from an idiot cop in the men's room. Now, that is funny.
You're right. That is funny!
- Lew?
- Yeah?
- Lew?
- What is it?
Kiss off.
Oh, come on now. Don't hang up.
What are you?
You lost your sense of humor?
- Okay, put them up.
- Put what up?
Your hands.
I just couldn't. I mean, I really couldn't.
- How'd you get here?
- Matches in Eddie's pocket.
- How did you know his name was Eddie?
- A waitress told me.
Why don't you kiss off?
- The Sheriff told me to stay on the job.
- Well, then, we're all safe.
This bartender here told me that Eddie phoned you long-distance in Las Vegas.
Yeah, well,
I was trying to pump the bartender.
- Pump. It's a gag.
- That's funny.
Now, why don't you tell me what you found out?
Well, I found out that Eddie phoned
Las Vegas from here three nights ago.
Sampson was in Las Vegas three nights ago.
It all fits. It all fits!
Oh, yeah, it all fits.
You know, you ought to stick around.
This place is a hotbed of information.
Oh, yeah, right here.
Go ahead.
What are you doing here?
I got the call. I've been converted.
Is there no end to your sacrilege?
Stay right where you are, fella.
Please. I don't want any trouble.
I said please.
Where's Sampson?
Stay right there.
Tell them to stay there!
Well, well. Do get up, old stick.
No, I kind of like it down here.
Come, come, Mr. Harper.
You mustn't give way to the sulks.
I'm shocked, Mr. Troy.
A man of your eminence involved in something as seamy as smuggling in immigrant labor.
Yeah, well, you are right, you know.
It is beneath me.
But it pays so well.
You know, they are wonderfully cheap workers.
And the poor idiots, they pay me to smuggle them in, and then ranch owners and the farmers, they pay me, too.
Disgustingly lucrative.
But, as you suggest, hardly enriching to the soul.
More important, Mr. Harper, at the moment, how is your soul?
I'll pay you to let me go.
Well, you're rather low on bargaining power, aren't you, old stick?
Not necessarily. Where's Sampson?
Ralph Sampson?
Well, dear boy, how should I know?
And the 500,000?
500,000 what?
No more riddles, old stick.
Your driver kidnapped Sampson two days ago.
Eddie Rossiter?
Tonight he picked up a half a million in ransom money.
Well, he hasn't got the brains.
Got enough brains to be a fall guy.
He's dead.
Whoever killed him got the money.
Well, I see, and that's why you're here, old stick.
You suspect me.
I do if you drive a white convertible.
Mr. Harper, I am surrounded by very devious people.
Claude, we are leaving the temple.
Collect our latest truckload.
Take them to Bakersfield, to the ranch.
Get the cash, lose the truck.
Meet me at my place afterwards.
Puddler, was Betty at the club tonight?
- No.
- Is she still driving the same car?
The white convertible, yeah.
Does she still live in the same place?
No, she moved to a beach house somewhere, couple of weeks ago.
- You know where it is?
- No, man. She don't ask me down there.
You take Mr. Harper to the usual place.
Keep him there till you hear from me.
Au revoir, Mr. Harper.
Now, you make yourself at home, old stick.
Now, you and me are gonna have a nice, quiet time here, huh?
You're not gonna cause me any problems.
Leave it open. I need the air. You stink.
Man, you got a bad mouth.
You're rotten. I can smell you.
You be a good boy.
'Cause I can give you a lot more than you can take. You hear?
- We both know what you're afraid of.
- Yeah? What am I afraid of?
You?
You know, there's an old expression.
You kill the body and the head dies.
Did you ever hear that?
How'd you like that, huh? Huh?
Tell me about it. How'd you like that?
You kill the body and the head dies, huh?
You tell me about it, huh?
Untie me and I'll tear your head off.
Now I get it.
You want me to untie you so you can trick me, huh?
You can't trick me.
You fish-eyed faggot.
Harper!
Harper!
You ain't going nowhere.
Here go your car keys!
You ain't going nowhere.
Here go your car keys!
- Who is it?
- Me.
What do you want?
Susan?
But what happened?
I'm cold.
Why did you come here?
- You know why.
- I can't help you, Lew. I can't!
We're not going to get involved.
We are involved.
Were. We've been there. It didn't work.
Help me, Susan.
- Get out, Lew.
- I need you.
- Now you do. What about later?
- Later, too.
No, you'll take off on whatever lousy situation you're on.
- I'm through.
- You're through!
- No, I mean it.
- You'll leave me.
- I hate it. I'm done with it.
- You'll leave me!
I swear to you.
You just want a warm body beside you, someone you can use for a while.
- Not anymore.
- I want you to go.
- The hell you say.
- Now, go.
- Not when I'm like this.
- What do you want from me?
- Just a few kind words.
- What else?
Anything I can get.
At least you're honest.
- Let me get some...
- No, not now. Come on.
- I'm not even sure I like you.
- Come on.
You used to carry me.
That's when I was younger.
I thought I threw out all your suits.
You sure threw out all the shirts.
And we were just gonna lounge around all day.
I'll call you as soon as I can.
Going back on it.
And what you said last night.
Forget what I said last night.
Oh, sure. I understand.
Last night you were cold.
You're really ending things this time, you know that?
You know that?
Why do you have to go back? Why?
Can't you tell me?
'Cause it's not over yet.
All this food. I feel like such a fool.
Our little wedding breakfast.
Goodbye, Lew.
Goodbye.
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?
Just an infinitely lingering disease.
- Hello, Albert.
- Lew, what...
Anything new on Sampson?
No, but we know who the murdered man is.
I copied down the high points of his record here.
Name, Eddie Rossiter. Usual truancy stuff.
Worked his way up to car thief.
Boy, that's a colorful one.
Then narcotics, arrested with sister
Betty Rossiter by the Narcotics Bureau.
- After he got out, he...
- Hey, Lew, baby!
- How are you, Beauty?
- Top of the morning!
- Where does he live?
- Guest house at the back.
The Sheriff is a bit put out with your behavior.
He feels you haven't quite let him in on everything.
Okay. Where did you go after you left my man dangling at the Corner bar?
I was looking for Sampson.
A half a million in cash missing, and you were looking for Sampson.
Wait a minute.
You expect me to take your word for that?
Look, I don't care whether you take my word or not.
Baby, I'm not working for you.
You know, if I wanted to be ugly,
- I could put you away...
- You are ugly!
- Does he know who he's talking to?
- Yeah.
A sheriff with a tough case on his hands and no ideas in his head.
Well, if you'd come on like a human being instead of a leaded toy soldier,
I might have given you a couple right off, such as Betty Fraley.
Put out a statewide alarm.
She works at The Piano.
And put her down for suspicion of murder of Eddie Rossiter.
And you can put out another alarm for Dwight Troy, Fay Estabrook and a religious nut named Claude, for smuggling in immigrant workers.
They've been using
Sampson's Temple in the Clouds, and they just dropped a bunch last night in Bakersfield.
Oh, and don't bother thanking me,
'cause I'm just a law-abiding citizen doing his duty.
- Are you sure of all that?
- Sure of some of it.
- You better give King Kong a hand.
- Well, what're you gonna be doing?
I'm gonna crack this thing, Albert.
I swear to you.
It's gonna be laid out.
- Lew, baby.
- Top of the morning.
Hey! What happened to you?
She was a big girl.
- You're a big jazz buff, aren't you?
- Some kinds. Not all.
What can I do for you?
You're very polite.
What you really mean is what the hell am I doing snooping around?
Well, my shirt's not as neat as it might be and I thought
I might borrow one from you.
Help yourself. You want a beer?
Yeah.
Do you really believe that's why I came here?
- Sure.
- Well, don't.
'Cause what I'm trying to do is tie you and Rossiter and that Fraley broad in on the kidnapping.
Are you kidding?
Hey, I don't know what you're on, but I'd like to get some of it.
Eddie Rossiter phoned you in Las Vegas.
You told him when Sampson was coming to LA.
You probably told him to rent a limousine.
And the next day you got Sampson plastered, which isn't hard.
And when he phoned the Bel-Air, you canceled the call and phoned for Eddie to pick him up instead.
The canceled call's important, buddy,
'cause you're the only one who knew that Sampson was calling the Bel-Air.
Go ahead.
Give me your Sampson imitation.
I'll bet you it's pretty good.
Lew, I'm on your side.
Who saved you at The Piano?
You did, temporarily, to throw me off the track.
It worked, too.
When you took a potshot at that truck,
I put it down to enthusiasm.
But what you were really doing is warning Rossiter to take off.
Are you saying all this because I got a couple of records?
You know, there's hundreds of people with records of Betty Fraley.
First day I met you, you said you had a real woman.
Is that it?
I don't even know her.
I never saw her before in my life.
Were you seen a lot together? I can check.
Well, so check.
I mean, look.
Sure, I been to the joint a couple of times.
Just to hear her. I dig the way she plays.
But I don't know her, Lew.
I don't. Honestly.
Okay, kid, I believe you.
Oh, this mess has got me crawling up the walls. I'm just grabbing at anything.
But I had to pressure you, you understand?
But I had to pressure you, you understand?
Sure.
I mean, just for starters, the...
You know, the idea of you and that Fraley broad...
I know a little something about human nature, and you two just don't cut it as couple of the week.
- This one okay?
- Yeah.
She's a perverted, no-talent junkie.
A prime nympho, on top of that.
Night I was there, she was all over me like a tent.
Not just me, but everybody in sight.
She swings in any direction.
She's a blemish come to life, that one.
Can you believe that something as rancid as her was once a baby?
You know, if we had the right contacts, we could make a lot of loot off her.
Book her into all the best freak shows.
'Course, we'd only let her be seen at night.
We wouldn't wanna have little kids looking at her, right, Beauty?
I've seen pigs in my day, but...
Can you imagine what it'd be like, touching something like that?
Like cozying up to a piece of fungus.
Like what crawls out from under a rock.
That's the first chick I ever met that was a human disaster area.
They ought to truck her back to the...
You can be very cruel, you know that?
What Betty and I have together, you'd never understand.
But that doesn't give you the right to sully it, either.
If you think she's Aphrodite, that's your business, Beauty.
All I want is Sampson, if he's still alive.
He is, so far.
Then give him to me.
That's all I was hired for.
Take the money. I won't talk, I mean it.
But killing me gets you nothing.
Wrong, baby.
It guarantees me freedom of action.
In this state, it guarantees you death by gas.
What kind of freedom are you gonna have, running with an addict on your back?
Nobody's running.
We'll be sitting very happily at Castle Beach in our lovely little cottage by the sea while everybody thinks we're running.
You can have your lousy little cottage.
All I want is Sampson.
Top of the morning.
He was in on the kidnapping, he and that Fraley broad.
She was in love with him.
Do you know that I almost stopped off in the kitchen for a glass of water?
How could you get caught like that?
Well, I guess I hoped he wasn't involved.
You better get the Sheriff in on this, if he's still around.
Come on.
I wonder how Miranda's gonna take that.
Well, there's a strong chance she won't see the way it was. Really was.
- And I'm wondering if...
- What, you want me to tell her?
Well, I know it isn't strictly within your province...
You got a big nerve, asking favors like that.
What have you done for me lately?
Miss Sampson?
I've got some moderately good news for you.
We have reason to believe your father is still alive.
How do you know?
I just spoke to one of the kidnappers.
He's dead now.
His name was Allan Taggert.
You killed him?
He was trying to kill me. Albert got him.
Allan was so beautiful.
Typecast for the hero.
You keep getting fooled by appearances.
Go ahead, let it out.
Why don't you shut up?
Fooled by appearances?
I'm the grieving daughter, right?
Not right.
I don't give a damn about my father.
I never did.
He's a terrible man, and whatever he gets he deserves.
Yesterday, when the note came,
I realized I didn't care about anything, and that means
I'm just like my stepmother.
So I thought, "You'd better quick run, hide, Miranda,
"before everyone discovers what a horrid little girl you are."
Albert.
Do you think I'm horrid, Albert?
Horrid?
Why, no, no!
What? Certainly not.
What? Quite the contrary.
Actually, as a matter of fact, I...
- Hey. Castle Beach, right?
- Yeah.
Got a road that runs down by the ocean?
Yes, sir. You house-hunting?
More or less.
Well, you go down here and you take your first left at the light and go down to the ocean, and it starts right there and goes all the way.
Thanks.
No! Oh, no!
No! No! No!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh...
Betty, honey,
I simply cannot fathom your lack of cooperation.
Betty, tell him. Please tell him.
It's no use with him! Tell him!
You and Eddie.
Very devious, you know. Very devious.
You know by now, along with my friends here, that I enjoy inflicting pain.
As well as I know that you do not enjoy enduring it.
So now I think the sensible thing for you would just be to tell me where the money is.
No?
Well, then, I must warn you, this last little trick is gorgeously unendurable.
The locker in the frozen meat place.
The key's in that black shell.
Thank you very kindly, Betty.
You killed him in cold blood!
If you don't stop yelling,
I'm gonna kill you.
You remember this, don't you, buddy boy?
See this?
I'll give you everything.
I'll give you everything I have.
- It's a rich choice. I'll take your shoes.
- What?
All right! I'll give you...
- Look. Get in there.
- What...
Can you walk?
Maybe.
You're coming with me.
Fay'll get out.
What, a fat, barefoot alcoholic?
Sure she will.
I'm still looking for Sampson. Where is he?
I'll tell you what I think.
You got the key to the locker, so you can have the money.
But I know where Sampson is, and that's gonna buy me my one last ticket for happiness.
Right?
Well, the happiness market's crashed, baby.
Taggert's dead.
Now, where is Sampson?
You're just trying to get me to talk.
You're right. I'm trying to get you to talk.
But I'm not lying about Taggert.
He's dead.
Now, you recognize his gun, don't you?
The far side of Santa Theresa.
The old section of the pier.
There's a deserted tanker.
Sampson's in the first cabin behind the engine room.
Just rest your feet, honey.
Don't go anyplace.
Albert? Put on your skates, buddy boy.
Yeah.
The old pier. He's in an abandoned tanker down there. Meet me.
The old pier. He's in an abandoned tanker down there. Meet me.
- You got that?
- Yeah.
- Think you'll be able to find it?
- No one's perfect, but I'll try.
All right.
Oh, listen, you better call Sheriff Spanner.
Yeah. Have him go down to the end of Castle Beach Road.
A lovely little cottage down there with a white Merc and a blue T-bird.
Yeah, that's on the outside.
On the inside there's a couple of guys that are pretty badly chewed up.
Better get down there with an ambulance.
Yeah, well, listen, buddy, with a little luck we'll all be bombed by suppertime.
- What?
- Stoned by suppertime!
- Did you kill Allan?
- No.
He was trying to kill me.
Don't I wish he had!
You know, I could feel a lot of sympathy for someone as tenderhearted as you, Betty, except I keep remembering that you killed your brother last night.
- Shot him in the head.
- Yeah, my own baby brother.
I brought him up.
I taught him about music, and he taught me about cars and...
Narcotics?
He fingered me as a user.
Eddie never knew I knew he fingered me, but I always swore I'd get him.
I got him.
You sucked Taggert in 'cause you needed someone on the inside for the kidnapping.
No. No, we loved each other. We cared.
Allan and me, we...
We needed money so we could be together.
Hell, I don't buy love's old sweet song from you, Betty.
Yeah, well, it's true.
You're jealous.
Everybody was jealous of Allan and me.
Were you there when he died?
I bet he died...
Oh, I bet his last words were about me.
I bet he died saying my name.
Tell me the truth now.
Tell me.
Yeah, you're right. I am jealous.
He died saying your name.
Don't you think I knew that?
Mr. Sampson?
Albert? Albert?
Lew? Lew, it's me.
Lew?
Lew, it's Albert.
- What happened?
- Oh, the same old thing.
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.
Somebody must have been guarding
Sampson, a fourth man.
He really suckered me.
- What kept you?
- I just knew you were gonna ask that.
I couldn't find this silly tug.
I been in one boat after another.
I was looking for your car. I'm sorry, Lew.
- You mean it's not there now?
- No, that's what threw me.
I didn't see it, anyway.
Well, the guy that mugged me did the same thing I did.
He just hotwired the ignition and took off with Betty.
But I wonder if they took off with Sampson.
We better check everything. Come on.
You wanna check down there?
- That's Sampson, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Well, you did all you could, Lew.
No, if you did all you could and you did it right, it wouldn't have to end this way.
- Give me your car key.
- Where are you going?
- After Betty Fraley.
- But what about Sampson?
Well, he cops will want him just the way he is.
Come on. Move it! Move it!
How do you know which way she went?
I know the ransom money's in a frozen food locker south of here.
Well, then, why are we going the opposite direction?
She'll want to get as far as she can from that money
'cause I got the key to the locker.
Well, if we catch her on this road, it'll be sheer luck.
I haven't changed spark plugs in my crate for 30,000 miles.
I'll catch her.
13-A2. 13-A2. Code 1.
It was pretty bad.
Found him this afternoon, Mrs. Sampson.
Albert was there. He identified him.
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sampson, but your husband is dead.
Oh, that's terrible. Terrible!
Ralph!
Yeah, well, listen, you better tell Miranda
I'll be there as soon as I can.
But Ralph didn't have an enemy in the world.
He was such a good man.
Gentle, kind, wouldn't hurt a fly.
Hang this up, will you?
Miranda!
Miranda!
Mommy has something to tell you.
All units in the vicinity of 57th and Vermont, an officer needs help.
All units in the vicinity of 57 and Vermont, an officer needs help.
Where to now?
- 311, handle a call, Code 3.
- The money.
Where now?
The grieving widow.
Sheriff Spanner seemed very confident they'd pick up the fourth man, right?
What? I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
The fourth man.
The one who hit you and got Sampson.
Spanner says there's a waiter at The Piano.
He hasn't showed up for a couple of days.
An albino.
He's the fourth man, the albino.
Spanner says he won't be hard to find.
What fourth man?
You're the fourth man, fink.
You think I kidnapped Sampson?
No, but you killed him.
What do you think was killing me when I got down to that wreck?
Wasn't any fourth man, Albert.
She took off in that car by herself.
She hotwired the ignition.
No strain to her. She was taught by her brother, the car thief.
Oh, well, who cares? Who cares?
This is what nailed you. Really nailed you.
You think a member of a kidnap gang would deck me, and then with $500,000 at stake, he wouldn't search me for the key?
And Betty wouldn't tell him?
No, you killed him, Albert, that's it.
Two and two is four.
But what I don't know is why.
As a lawyer, I have to caution you that your proof is pretty insubstantial.
Well, proving it's not my job.
- I'll be perfectly safe in a court of law.
- This ain't a court of law.
Just a couple of buddies out for an evening spin discussing the events of the day.
Only don't lie to me, Albert.
I mean, lying is for other people.
Okay?
Come on.
I don't know why, actually.
Not in any concrete way.
I hadn't intended to.
Nothing premeditated.
But when I found him and was faced with the prospect of setting him free, it just suddenly seemed for the best that he die.
When it came to cruelty, he could be incredibly versatile.
With anybody.
His wife, daughter, stranger in the street.
When he found out how I felt about Miranda, he pushed us together.
But he never would have let me marry her.
Never in this world.
Just laughs for the client, that's all I was supplying.
And then today, when she put her arms around me and I felt the texture of her skin...
Perhaps I killed him for a kiss,
I don't know.
But I do know that his passing will not be the cause for universal mourning.
You gonna turn me in?
- Got no other choice, buddy boy.
- You don't have to.
Got a better friend than me?
I haven't got many friends, Albert, but none better than you.
He was scum, Lew. I swear it.
Well, you know, when we first met, you were gonna push your way all the way up to be governor of this great and powerful state of California.
That was a pretty nasty and terminal thing you did to Sampson.
Do governor-type people do that today?
Jeez, makes you stop and wonder.
And you were going to push your way up to being the greatest defender of justice that the great and powerful state of California ever had.
How does it feel to be popping your flash bulbs in dirty little motel rooms, spying on the cheaters?
Yeah, well...
Things just don't turn out the way we plan them, do they?
You were hired by a bitch to find scum.
Yeah, and every time
I hope it's gonna be Prince Charming sending me out to scout out Cinderella.
Oh, yeah.
Boy, I had a total of about eight pretty disgusting months last year.
But then I had five or six good weeks.
Let me tell you something.
I mean, it's something that you won't understand and Susan sure as hell won't, but those five or six weeks,
I really felt alive.
So all I can do, Albert, is just do the dirty job all the way down the line.
Well, I understand why you have to turn me in.
Do you understand why I can't let you?
Oh, yeah. You still got the gun?
Well, then, you better use it before I hit that door.
Well, the way I feel now, if I never make it to that door, it won't be the worst thing that ever happened to me.
So long, Albert.
Oh, hell.
Oh, hell.
English
- Can I help you?
- I don't know.
The radiator's boiling.
It's never done that before.
I had the water checked on the mainland.
- You've got anti-freeze in?
- Yes, you're supposed to in winter.
That's what's causing the overheating.
I've taken my anti-freeze out during this hot spell.
This is the best I can do, unless you want me to drain it off.
No, not now.
Tell me, is the Swan far from here?
Take the next right.
You can't miss it.
In fact, I'm going there myself.
I'd offer to show you, but I think you should let this cool down.
Do I owe you anything?
No. That's all right.
This is the BBC Home Service.
Here's the weather forecast.
Most districts will continue to be extremely cold.
Temperatures will remain below freezing point, ranging from 24º in Northern areas to 29° in the South.
However, there are exceptional conditions on the Island of Fara.
Temperatures are said to be in the region of 90°, and still rising.
90 degrees and still rising!
- Surely it can't get any hotter.
- Apparently, it can.
Yet on the mainland it's winter.
This weather doesn't make sense.
Some rain wouldn't hurt.
At least it would cool the air.
Thank you, Frankie.
- Can I help you?
- Is Mr. Callum in?
I'm afraid not. He's on his way back from the mainland.
- I'm Mrs. Callum.
- Angela Roberts, his new secretary.
Oh, yes. My husband said the agency was sending someone this week.
I've a room ready for you.
I'll show you.
I'd rather like a drink first. I'm gasping, this heat is stifling.
Yes, of course.
May I have the pleasure?
My name is Stone, Dr Stone.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll have a lager and lime, please.
And so you shall.
Is this your first visit to the island, Miss Roberts?
Yes. It's very pretty. I had a drive round after I got off the boat.
It is hot, isn't it?
We usually have the same weather as the mainland.
I'm sorry, the ice melts as soon as it's out of the fridge.
- Same again, Bob?
- No, just one for Tinker.
I must be on my way. Just the one.
Oh, that's better.
If you don't mind, I'll finish this upstairs. I'd like to freshen up.
- Of course.
- I'll show you the way.
- Is this all right for you?
- Yes, it's fine. Thanks.
Let's have some air.
Oh, I see you're reading one of my husband's books.
Yes. I thought I should. Is his new novel interesting?
He never talks about his books until they're finished, then he never stops.
- Have you worked with writers before?
- No. Mainly for publishers.
God, it's hot. It's like being in the Tropics.
When my husband gets back,
I'll tell him you're here.
- Has Callum brought my parcel?
- He'll be back soon, Mr. Hanson.
Tell him to bring it straight to my room.
- Well, he's not very polite, is he?
- No.
He's a strange character altogether.
- How long is he staying?
- Hasn't said.
We've been trying to puzzle out what he does.
Every day he goes out with his camera and masses of equipment.
He spends the rest of his time locked in his room.
He won't even let us in to clean.
Good material for one of Jeff's books.
Bob, what the hell are you doing?
Sorry, Jeff. I just wasn't thinking.
Thinking? You're lucky to be breathing.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I thought I heard something.
I'm sure I heard something.
- Heard what?
- I don't know.
It was a sort of funny whirring noise.
Must be going off my rocker.
- I assume you've come from the Swan?
- Maybe I did have one too many.
It's this blasted heat.
Sorry again, Jeff.
Forget it. No harm done.
But take it easy.
Hi, Ken. Buying up the whole place?
We've got to keep cool.
The Met Station's like an oven.
They envy us on the mainland.
My publisher's threatening to pay me a visit.
Tell him to bring some snow.
We could use it.
Haven't you experts figured out what's causing this heat?
Or are we stuck with the villagers' theory that it's the bomb?
The bomb? To be perfectly honest, one theory's as good as another.
We haven't a clue. See you later.
If the heat or the DTs don't get you first!
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thanks. Good trip?
Yes, apart from nearly knocking down Bob Hayward.
He was in the middle of the road.
How I missed him, I don't know.
Strange. He was all right when he left here, wasn't he?
- Is that Mr. Hanson's parcel?
- Yes. Why?
He's been asking about it.
He ordered it be taken to his room, immediately.
Did he? Must be important.
I'll take it up straight away.
- Yes, who is it?
- Your parcel, Mr. Hanson.
Come on, give it to me!
I forgot to tell you. Your new secretary has arrived.
- She's quite the modern miss.
- Really? Where is she now?
At the cove. She went for a swim.
I'll give you a lift.
Fine. I won't be long, darling.
- I'll be off then, Jeff.
- Yeah.
- Hello, Jeff.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- You know why I'm here.
- Then you made a mistake.
I hope you haven't unpacked.
You're not staying.
Come for a swim. It's fabulous.
Did you hear what I said?
You're getting out of here.
Don't shout at me. You always did go on. Cool down.
Now listen to me,
I'm not going through your special brand of madness again.
Aren't you?
For 3 months, I wrote nothing.
I nearly wrecked my marriage.
I'm not going through it again.
You can't just have a girl and then walk away.
Don't pull that on me.
You were no untouched virgin when we met.
How long was it before we tumbled into your bed? Two hours?
- You needn't wait so long this time.
- You haven't taken in a word.
- You're clearing out.
- Just like that?
Just like that.
What are you going to tell your wife?
That's my problem.
That you didn't like the look of me?
As far as she's concerned,
I'm just your new secretary.
You never did tell her about us, did you?
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.
Sounds as if it came from beyond the point.
It's weird.
Strange.
Bob said he heard a peculiar noise when I nearly ran him over.
Jeff.
Get dressed.
What happened?
I found him wandering on the road by his meadow, in a fair old state.
He keeps on about his sheep being dead.
What's the matter, Ben?
It's my sheep. They all be dead.
Someone's killed my sheep.
- Can he lie down somewhere?
- There's a couch in my study.
- How were they killed?
- Come on, Ben.
- I said how were they killed?
- He's in no state to answer questions.
I asked a straightforward question.
There's no harm in that.
- You found the old man?
- Yes.
- Did you see the sheep?
- No.
Only Ben wandering about, half out of his mind.
- Who's he?
- He's a guest. His name's Hanson.
Why is he so interested in the sheep? What is he?
I don't know. He spends his time locked in his room.
I'd like him to rest for a while.
- Give time for the sedative to work.
- Of course.
What do you think happened?
Do you think his sheep are all dead?
Who can tell? With this heat it's difficult to know what's going on.
Give Mrs. Siddle a ring, will you?
Tell her I'll be bringing Ben home.
Mr. Hanson...
Why is he so interested in how those sheep died?
- Why don't you ask him?
- How's Ben?
- He's calmed down.
- Did he say what happened?
No. Mumbled they were dead.
Nothing coherent.
The Doctor's not sure if it's just the heat affecting him.
Mrs. Siddle? Jeff Callum.
Ben's with us.
He's not feeling well. Dr
Stone will bring him home.
He thinks there's something wrong with the sheep.
What's that? I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.
Don't worry. He'll be home soon!
If the crisis is over,
I'd better start work.
Where's the typewriter and manuscript?
Mr. Callum?
- Jeff.
- You can't start.
It's in the study where Ben's resting.
In that case, I'll go and change.
- Yes?
- It's me. Can I come in?
Yes, come in.
Forget it. I didn't come for that.
You're here now, but let's get one thing straight...
Can you hear me?
Every word, darling.
If Frankie finds out about us, I'll break your neck.
Miss Roberts.
It's only me, Miss Roberts. I've brought you some fresh towels.
I'll put them on your bed.
Would you mind handing me one, please?
Thanks.
I could kill you.
- Jeff.
- Yeah?
Something's wrong with the TV.
The phone's been playing up, too.
It must be static because of this heat.
I'll turn it off.
Bloody set.
What's the matter with you?
That's funny. It's never done that before.
That noise again.
Stella, have you been playing around with the telly?
Of course I haven't.
I never touch the thing.
Oh! What was that?
Don't come in, there's glass everywhere.
- What happened?
- Get a dustpan and brush.
- But...
- Get the dustpan.
You don't want the dog getting cut, do you?
Jeff? Look, something's happened and I...
What's that?
I can't shout, I don't want Stella to hear.
But you remember that noise...
I said, remember that noise
I heard on the road?
I'll come over.
Stella, I'm just going to go down to the village.
I'll see if I can get a replacement set.
What a story!
- What?
- You're off to Jeff Callum's.
You men and your horse racing.
We can't keep any secrets from you women, can we?
Hurry up. You'll miss the next race.
Patch!
Patch, come back here!
Patch. Where...
Oh!
Here, Patch, here.
Who told you to come, boy?
You'd better stay, now you're here.
What's the matter, boy?
No!
No!
That's better. This was a good idea of yours.
My fingertips were sticking to the keys.
Some iced coffee will probably help.
Don't you get bored here with the isolation?
Bored?
Yes, I suppose so, at times.
But then, who doesn't?
It's the sort of thing you learn to live with in a place like this.
What happened to
Mr. Callum's last secretary?
Did she get lonely?
Is that why she left?
As a matter of fact, she didn't leave.
Jeff had to ask her to go.
- He sacked her? Why?
- She took a fancy to him.
That made her a complication and
Jeff doesn't like complications.
I can understand.
He's very attractive.
She was wasting her time.
She didn't mean a thing to Jeff.
- Of course.
- I'd have known if she had.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, I'm sure I would.
But if he were just having fun, would you know?
Jeff doesn't play around.
It'd be all or nothing!
It's a pity that such an attractive man should shut himself away.
It makes you wonder what he's running away from.
What do you mean?
What are you getting at?
A man like that would need a pretty good reason for coming to live in a place like this.
It's obvious he's running away from something.
And it's obvious you don't know him or you wouldn't talk such nonsense!
Oh, but I do. I do.
I'm surprised Jeff hasn't told you about me.
He asked for me personally, didn't you know?
- Are you saying you knew him before?
- Knew him? That's an understatement.
You little bitch! That's not true.
Don't kid yourself he's different.
Men are all the same.
Within half an hour of me arriving, Jeff was kissing me.
I don't believe you. You're lying.
Yes, I am lying.
Why? Why should you lie to me?
I don't know. I was angry.
It's an automatic reflex when I'm being warned off.
You were warning me off?
Yes.
Yes, I suppose I was.
I thought I'd get a bit more written before opening time.
I expected it to cool down by evening, but it's getting hotter.
- Bob never turned up, did he?
- No.
I thought he said he would, just before the phone packed in.
What did he want?
He was on about some noise he'd heard.
Like the one we heard on the beach?
Jeff... You don't mind if I call you Jeff?
- No, not at all.
- You said the noise came from beyond the point.
Is that where the sheep were?
His farm is in that direction.
- Do you think there's a connection?
- Do you, Jeff?
No, I don't.
I'm the one who's paid to use my imagination.
The next chapter. I'd like it finished tonight, if possible.
I'll take my coffee and get the bar ready.
Jeff... May I have a light?
Your hand's trembling.
I'm the same. Feel it beating?
You know you want me.
Why try to deny it?
Quiet.
Listen.
Jeff! Jeff!
Something just landed over by the hill.
I was looking out of the window and it landed in the field.
- What did it look like?
- I couldn't tell.
- There was glow coming from it.
- A glow?
- Did it make a noise?
- That's what drew my attention to it.
A whirring, whining... whining noise.
- It was from that direction?
- Yes, I think so.
Jeff!
- Let's get out of here. I'm scared.
- No. I want to find out who it is.
Hanson! What was he doing up there?
Maybe he saw something land.
He wasn't coming from that direction.
Surely if he saw something, he'd still be there.
Maybe he wouldn't go over the hill.
Maybe it's something even he's scared of.
He's crazy. Whatever he's doing, he's obsessed by it.
Yes. She's right.
If we stay out here, we'll all have nightmares.
- Let's go back.
- Hold it!
You said you saw something.
That's why we came out here.
Did you or didn't you?
Yes... I thought I did.
I thought I saw something coming down.
It seemed to appear over the top of the hill and move slowly down.
But in this heat, I don't know.
Stay here. I'm going to take a look.
Jeff, be careful.
It must've been the other side of that high ground.
Let's get out of here. Wait till tomorrow, when it's light.
You can't leave us here and
I'm not going any further.
All right. But I'll tell you one thing.
I've had enough of
Hanson creeping around.
I'm going to ask him what he's up to.
Hanson, are you in there?
Hanson, do you hear me?
I can't talk now. Go away.
Open this door! Hanson, open this door, or I'll kick it down!
No. Give me a moment.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Hanson!
Hanson!
The door!
Close the door, you idiot!
What do you think you're doing?
Never mind about me.
What are you up to?
This is my hotel not your bloody laboratory!
I want some explanations,
Hanson. If that's your name.
It is. And I don't owe you any explanation.
You do if you're using my hotel as a centre of your activities.
Were you out there to meet whatever landed tonight?
- Landed?
- You were prowling around out there.
What's this about a landing?
I came to ask questions, not answer them.
Yes, but this landing, what was it?
I assure you I can explain, but this is extremely important.
Well, actually it was my wife who saw it.
- Go on.
- She heard a whirring noise.
When she looked in its direction she saw something glowing.
- Yes?
- And she thought she saw it land.
- Where?
- The other side of the hill.
Do you know what it was?
- Well?
- Yes. Yes, I do.
What was it, Hanson?
I don't expect you to believe this, but for the past week
I've been convinced this island is the centre of an invasion.
A landing point for beings from another planet.
Beings from another planet!
Exactly. That's what has caused this inexplicable heat.
I've heard some yarns from villagers, but your theory is too much.
I'm not a superstitious villager. I'm a scientist.
I base my conclusions on observations of fact.
What do you suppose I'm doing here?
I've been collecting specimens. Soil.
Blood of a sheep. I've been analysing them.
You asked for an explanation, but you're too dim-witted to accept it.
You've ruined everything with your crass stupidity. Here...
Perhaps I shouldn't have broken in like that.
So you've been trying to photograph these things?
I haven't been "trying",
I did photograph them.
I used a normal lens at first, but it was ineffective against the intense light that emanates from these beings.
Remember that parcel you collected for me?
It contained this.
An infra red filter.
I experimented with a special camera and placed it...
Here. I used a mirror reflector and rigged up the shutter to be triggered by anything crossing its line of vision.
- And something did come through?
- Yes, it did!
I was developing the picture when you burst into the room.
It would've given me the proof I so desperately need.
Then what you've told me so far is pure conjecture?
- Cinders?
- Incinerated by whatever was here.
The same happened to the sheep.
They were burned to death.
There's been some sort of incineration, but it doesn't have to be a being from another planet.
I've analysed that, Callum.
It was burned by a high frequency heat, more intense than anything we can produce, even under strict laboratory conditions.
There's only one place where that kind of heat exists.
Out there, where the cosmic gases ferment and generate a heat greater than anything we can imagine.
That's where those beings must come from.
If you're right, how are they getting here? Where are they?
If we knew, we could destroy them before it's too late.
Tell me, has anybody else heard this whirring noise?
Yes, Bob did. In the lane, over by the gravel pits.
Somewhere in this area.
Here, boy. What's the matter?
Callum!
Come on.
I've found it.
Callum, look.
This doesn't affect you at all!
I appreciate how you feel.
I know he was a friend of yours, but that won't do any good now. Look.
Every particle of energy has been sucked out of it.
Hanson... We've got to warn people. They should be told.
No, not yet.
You forced your way in on me.
You had to know, didn't you?
Now you're going to do what I say.
The authorities have dismissed me as a crank, just like you did.
But I must have evidence, and I would've got it if you hadn't destroyed that photograph.
I need time to complete my tests.
- How much time?
- Two or three hours.
As for warning the villagers, we must avoid injecting fear into an already dangerous situation.
Callum, have you noticed something?
This heat, at this time of night it should be getting cooler, but it's building up.
- It's getting hotter, Frankie.
- I think you're right, it is.
- There you are.
- Thanks, my dear.
Oh, what an atmosphere.
They've probably heard about Ben Siddle.
I think I'd better finish that typing, Mrs. Callum.
No wonder the temperature's up.
Who's been hiding her?
Beer, Hanson?
Frankie, pull me a lager.
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing.
- Jeff, I know you.
- There's nothing wrong!
I'm sorry, it's this damned heat that's making me jumpy.
We've been getting on each other's nerves too.
That's why I came here.
That shows how hot it is.
Smash the bottles! All of them!
- I'll get the first aid kit.
- I'll get it. You'll never find it.
What on earth's going on out there?
The heat exploded the bottles.
It's unbearable, isn't it?
- Here we are.
- Don't touch me.
I only want to put a plaster on your arm.
- Let Ken do it.
- What's the matter?
Let it go, Callum.
This heat is bound to lead to irrational behaviour. I'll do it.
I'll get Dr. Stone.
Come on, Tinker. Back to the pub.
It's all right. Come on. That's it.
It was Tinker.
He jumped me. Come on.
Callum, come here.
Look at the gas cylinder. It's split open, just like the car battery.
Completely drained of every ounce of energy.
Tinker? It's impossible. I can't believe he'd do a thing like that.
Not under normal circumstances, but these are not normal circumstances.
If this heat goes on increasing, it could drive us all insane.
The body isn't equipped for such pressure. The glands will fail.
Then, it's only a matter of time before the brain is affected.
A logical conclusion, but we should keep it to ourselves.
That's what Hanson keeps saying.
Two men have been killed.
- Two?
- Who's been killed?
- How's the girl?
- She's all right.
Who's been killed?
Will someone tell me what's going on?
I'm afraid Tinker's met with an accident.
Jeff, who else is dead?
You mentioned two.
- Bob Hayward.
- Bob! How?
It was an accident.
- Accident? He was...
- Callum, calm down.
These creatures are killing God knows how many, and that's your answer?
Creatures? What do you mean, creatures?
- He shouldn't have told you.
- What do you know that I don't?
He claims we're being attacked by creatures from another planet.
Claims? What do you mean?
You've seen them?
Bob Hayward and Tinker did.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
- Neither do I, Frankie.
- Here.
His thinks the island is being used as a test base for an invasion.
- Don't ask me why.
- It's quite obvious.
They have to discover if they can survive in our atmosphere.
- That's incredible.
- Is it?
We probe space searching for information about other planets.
It's logical that same thing might happen in reverse.
Are you saying that Earth has become a subject of a probe carried out by creatures from another planet?
Yes, I am.
And what I saw land tonight was one of those creatures?
Yes.
One of them, forming a spearhead to find out if life is possible for them on Earth.
And if it is possible?
Then, the main force will come.
Have you any idea what they need to survive?
Heat. The way that car battery and cylinder were split suggests they were seeking heat energy.
- They obviously need it to exist.
- Fine, fine!
We'll just wait for you to complete your tests!
The temperature has risen three degrees in the last half hour. 108.
At this rate, we'll all dead by morning.
I accept that the situation is serious.
The indications are that we're approaching a crisis.
- Hanson!
- Getting emotional won't help.
- We must alert the mainland.
- How?
The telephone's out of action.
What about the Met station? They can send a message. I'll drive up there.
Just a moment, Doctor. This could be very dangerous.
Someone must go. We've lost enough time already.
Very well. But don't go until I come back.
- I'll come with you.
- There's no point both of us going.
You stay and look after the girls.
And Jeff, I should leave that alone.
Too much of it doesn't help in a crisis.
This will help us keep in touch.
Aerial, press to speak, release to receive. Got it?
Yes. Thank you.
Good luck, Doctor.
- And be careful.
- Don't worry, I will.
These creatures, are they likely to attack us?
Depends what they're looking for.
I think they're looking for an energy source to keep them alive.
But once they've found it they'll spread to the mainland.
Yes.
Hello, Hanson.
Are you there, Hanson?
Yes, Stone. I can hear you.
Where are you?
I'm on the road to the point.
I've just passed White's Meadow.
I can see the outline of the
Met station in the distance.
The radiator's boiling up.
She's losing power.
How far is the station?
I'm not sure. About a mile and a quarter I should say.
She's slowing down.
She won't last long. The heat's affecting the engine.
It's very dark out here.
She's pulling badly.
The gravel pit's coming up.
I can make out the entrance.
She's stopping.
It's no good. I'll have to leave her. I'll walk the rest.
Hanson, I'm on the road.
There's a gap in the fence.
It looks like something...
- It's that noise again.
- Get away from there!
Get away! It's your only chance.
I can't hear you! It's this noise!
Stone. Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Get away from that sound.
What's wrong? Isn't it working?
Yes, Mrs. Callum.
The set's working.
It's horrible.
What now?
- It depends.
- On what?
Whether that meeting was an accident or a deliberate interception.
If it was deliberate, it means we're not dealing with brute monsters, but with a superior intelligence.
Which do you think it is?
I don't know, Mrs Callum.
I honestly don't know.
There must be an answer to these things.
We've got to try again.
I'm going this time.
Wait, Callum.
If you go out, you risk sacrificing another life.
The Doctor took the risk.
We can't just leave him there.
No!
I'll have to go.
I'm not being heroic.
Stone was taken by surprise
I'm better equipped to deal with this situation.
He's right, Jeff.
I'll take your Land Rover.
Have you got the keys?
Supposing they're still out there, what will you do?
If they are, I'll have to avoid making the same mistakes as Stone.
Keep these doors locked and that set switched on.
Lock the windows, Frankie.
Angela. It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I must've had a nightmare.
I kept seeing that man coming towards me.
His hands... I thought...
It's all right, Angela.
It's all right. He's gone now.
There's no need to be afraid.
Come on. Lie down.
I shouldn't think we'll hear from
Hanson yet. It's too soon.
You knew her before, didn't you?
- Who?
- You know who I mean. That girl.
- You knew her before she came here.
- No.
Don't lie to me, Jeff.
I've said I didn't know her.
I saw you kissing her in the study.
That doesn't mean I knew her.
Ever since she came here, you've been tense.
Just as you were before we moved.
Frankie, let it be.
You did know her.
All right, I knew her.
Leave it at that.
It wasn't difficulty with your writing. It was her.
- That why we moved here.
- Drop it, Frankie.
You're overwrought. The heat is affecting us all. Let it go.
Are you in love with her?
Answer me. Are you in love with her?
Not now, Frankie. We're fighting for our lives!
It's important to me. I must know.
Tell me, are you in love with her?
No.
- Then, what is it?
- I wanted her. I wanted her body!
Now you know. She was a slut and I wanted her.
But not any more.
I didn't ask her here.
She's no more than a common slut.
There's no comparison with what I feel for you.
That's why we moved here. It was completely physical, I promise.
She never meant a thing to me. She never will.
Where is everybody?
Where's the doctor?
He's not here. Go back to the study.
Get him! I need him!
He can't come. Go back and lie down.
He should be here. I'm ill.
I need him. Where the hell is he?
He can't come, you selfish bitch! He's dead.
Dead? Dead...
Dead...
Callum. Callum.
This is Hanson. This is Hanson.
He's found the other one.
Can you hear me? Callum?
Can you hear me?
- Why don't you answer?
- I can hear you. Where are you?
I'm at the gravel pit.
I've found Stone's body.
He's dead.
He's burnt to death.
Just like all the others.
The ground here is all scorched.
This is obviously the way they came.
I can see something. Something glowing down in the pit.
It's getting hotter.
I'm going in.
Hanson, remember two people have already died there.
It's horrible. What's he doing there?
It's very dark in here.
I can't see very far.
I can see it again.
It certainly is a light source.
The light seems to be...
I'm not receiving you.
- Hanson, do you hear me?
- Why doesn't he answer?
Hanson!
He's not coming through.
It's a woman!
I'll have to stop her.
Of course. The light!
What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
The area beyond the gravel pit must be their assembly point.
I saw one down there.
What happened? The set went off. Are you all right?
Yes. The aerial must've been screened by the pit.
I've discovered something very important.
They're attracted to light. To them, it's a source of energy.
Turn out all your lights.
Do you hear?
Yes, I hear you. Is there anything else?
No, I'm going on now.
I'll drive without lights.
I'll contact you when
I get to the station.
Thank God he's all right.
He must've seen the creatures themselves.
I wonder how many there are.
I'll get the orange juice.
How long do you think he'll take to get there?
Not long... If he gets through.
He ought to be there by now.
- Why doesn't he contact us?
- Jeff, don't panic, please.
If it's possible to get through, he'll manage.
How do you know? How do you know he's not dead as well?
It's only five miles to the point.
He ought to be arriving any moment.
Intermediate frequency.
Range four...
Four miles? No wonder we haven't heard from him.
If he's at the Met station, he's out of range.
What do we do if he's out of range? Do we just wait?
- I can't stand it another minute!
- I want to get away too.
- We must go to the Met station.
- Anything's better than this.
We'll take your car. I know a short cut. Come on, darling.
I'll drive. I know the way.
We were in the office when the lights blew.
We heard the explosion and found the operator.
We got him to the wardroom but he was dead. Burnt to death.
That explains it. That finally explains it.
Would you mind letting us in on the secret?
Simple. Your station is the means by which these beings got here.
This station?
You must be aware that we've been sending out high frequency impulses to explore space.
Bouncing signals off stars?
Exactly. To us, these impulses are useful, but quite harmless.
But to these beings, they represent a life force.
- I see.
- Do you?
We attracted them, but that doesn't explain how they got here.
It's quite obvious, isn't it?
They must've homed in on your scanner.
These beings are composed of high frequency impulses in heat form.
They transfer like any form of high frequency.
They transferred here like a TV picture, from a transmitter to a receiver.
- Using our scanner as a receiver.
- Exactly.
- Then they materialised on Earth.
- Materialised?
In the same way as a satellite TV picture.
It starts in space as a signal and then materialises.
Do you realise what you're saying?
The Earth's surface is dotted with TV and radar scanners.
If these beings succeed, they'll heat up the whole surface.
Earth will be just another hot planet.
Like so many others in the constellation.
We've got to stop them. We must destroy them before they destroy us.
- Have you got any explosives?
- No.
Just a couple of revolvers and some ammo.
- We've got some flare guns.
- Get them.
Wait, the quarry. There'll be gelignite there.
- Anybody there you can contact?
- Like hell. I'll get it myself.
I'll be glad to apologise if we succeed. I'll take the van.
Whatever you do, don't forget: Drive without lights.
I'm getting to be quite a criminal.
She's slowing down.
She'll blow any moment.
Come on, damn you. Keep going.
It's that noise again.
I can hear it.
- Angela.
- Is she all right?
I missed her. But only just.
She heard you coming and panicked.
Have you seen Hanson?
- He's at the station.
- Good.
They got to us.
- Anyone hurt?
- Yes, the operator. Burnt to death.
Are you all right?
She's put the car in the ditch.
I'll give you a hand.
Here, sit down.
Under the wheel.
Right, start her up.
All right, push.
Put her in reverse.
I'll take Angela with me.
It'll lighten your load.
Right.
- Have you contacted the mainland?
- No.
Here, Frankie.
Here we are.
Fine. Tie them in bundles of three like I told you.
This is the plan. We split up into two groups.
- Is that a good idea?
- It's essential.
You know the hayricks out on the point?
Foster and I will go up there and I'll set fire them.
Wait. You said these creatures were attracted by light.
It'll bring them out into the open.
Foster will intercept them with the dynamite. I'll double back.
- What'll we do?
- Go to the top of the cliff.
As soon as the fires are alight, use the flares to alert the mainland.
- There's nothing else we can do?
- Has anybody got any better ideas?
It'll take us 15 minutes to get to the hayricks.
When you spot my first flare, it's your signal to move.
Foster.
Remember, 15 minutes.
Can you see them?
Why do you think Hanson split us into two groups?
If he and Foster fail, it'll be up to us.
That's what I thought.
He's a peculiar chap, but he's got guts.
Angela seems to be taking it badly.
If things get tough, will you look after her?
- Then I can take care of Frankie.
- Sure.
That's it. Let's go.
Listen.
It's coming from the meadow.
Come on. We must keep going.
- Jeff!
- I'll get her. Take this.
Lightning.
Foster!
Foster, get out of there!
Foster!
You fool. You could've run into them!
Let me go. Let me go!
- Leave me alone. Let me go.
- You'll do as I say.
In there. It'll be safe. Come on.
You little idiot.
Who are you to tell me what to do? It's my life.
You wouldn't stand a chance on your own.
At least we have a chance by sticking together.
I didn't ask you to come after me. Go back.
And leave you here? Oh, no.
Like it or not, I'm staying.
I hate you. Leave me alone.
Look, I'm just as scared as you are.
But... Well, we mustn't give up.
We'll find a way. I know we will.
- How many more flares?
- They're the last.
Whatever happens,
Frankie, stay close.
Callum. The storm, the storm.
Hanson, run for it! Run!
Run!
Aaah!
It's no good. Hanson tried to warn us.
They're all around us.
It's the lightning.
- I can't stand it. I can't...
- Stop it! Stop it!
I don't want to kill you, but I will if I have to. Don't stop me.
- You little fool.
- No, you're the fool.
I'd rather die like this than be burnt alive.
All right. Go on. Do it, but kill me first.
You?
Yes. You're right. It's hopeless, completely hopeless.
So for once, do something for someone else.
Go on, shoot.
Damn you.
What is it with you?
Don't you think I'm old enough to take care of myself?
Look. The rain.
It's killing them.
I really don't think we'll be very welcome here, Miss Marple.
I know Mr. Enderby's rich...
...but he's, well, rather eccentric, to say the least.
He may close his door on the world,
Mr. Stringer...
...but he must expect it to be knocked on sometimes.
He's never been known to give anything away. Not even to charity.
Well, perhaps the poor man's never been given the chance.
I really must be getting back to the library, Miss Marple.
It's a very worthy cause, no doubt, but my employers...
Surely, you're entitled to your tea?
- Yes, but I haven't had it.
- Oh, but you shall.
This will be our last call. After that, you must come back to my cottage.
I've prepared a very special tea to reward us for our labors.
Perhaps I'd better leave him to you,
Miss Marple, if you don't mind.
Now, pull yourself together.
He can't eat us, can he?
No, I suppose not.
- He must be out.
- You know he never goes anywhere.
Mr. Enderby?
Mr. Enderby?
Don't be alarmed, Mr. Enderby.
We've just...
Oh, my.
My goodness.
What could have happened?
How is he?
Dead, I'm afraid.
- What is it?
- Well, it's a piece of mud.
From some recent visitor, apparently.
Who still seems to be here.
- Stay with him.
- Miss Marple, you mustn't.
Please be careful.
- What was it?
- A cat.
But I thought...
I thought he hated cats.
He did.
He was frightened to death of them.
Frightened to death?
Why, Miss Marple, this is an unexpected pleasure.
Oh, good morning, inspector.
Could I have a few words with you? Privately?
Well, yes, of course.
Do come in, please. Here.
Well, do sit down, Miss Marple. Please.
Now, what can I do for you?
You're not here to tell me I've overlooked another crime, by any chance?
Well, as a matter of fact I am.
A very grave crime.
- One of murder.
- Oh, no. Not again. Please.
This time there is no mistake, inspector.
Well, you might as well get it over with.
Who murdered who? This time?
As to the murderer, that will naturally require an investigation.
The victim is old Mr. Enderby.
Enderby? What are you talking about?
He died of heart failure.
But what caused his heart to fail so unexpectedly?
I read the doctor's report, Miss Marple.
It was not unexpected.
He'd had a severe heart condition for many years.
Exactly. A very wealthy man with a chronic heart condition.
Yes, the circumstances are precisely the same.
I don't know what they're the same as, but they don't add up to murder.
But surely, inspector...
...you have read Agatha Christie's remarkable novel The Ninth Life?
I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure.
That's probably why you failed to make the connection.
Agatha Christie should be compulsory reading for the police force.
Doom came to her victim in the shape of a cat.
Now, look, Miss Marple, enough is enough.
A wealthy old gentleman...
...with a weak heart and a pathological horror of cats.
What easier than for some interested party...
...to slip a cat into the house?
A cat that the old man will come upon unexpectedly.
Yes, old Enderby was frightened to death.
A very ingenious theory...
...but my advice to you, Miss Marple, is to read fewer thrillers.
A nice love story would be much more soothing.
Am I to assume that you are not going to do anything about this?
Nothing whatever.
You see, I'm a policeman, Miss Marple.
I'm only interested in facts.
Well, then. There is only one course open to me.
- Now, wait a minute, Miss Marple.
- No, inspector, I know my duty.
I shall have to investigate this myself.
Good day.
You will hear from me again when my case is completed.
Oh, my pastry.
They look good.
Oh, dear.
Not one of my failures, as you are thinking.
Deliberate, I assure you.
I cooked the piece of mud we found in old Enderby's house...
...and then filled the hole with plaster.
Lo and behold...
...preserved in plaster forever.
I see. Ingenious, Miss Marple.
'Tis rather, isn't it?
Though I'm bound to say it went against the grain to overcook my pastry.
A perfect match.
- What do you make of this?
- The mark of a stirrup iron.
- Then it was mud from a riding boot.
- Yes.
And from a boot with a very distinctive scar on it.
That piece of fresh mud was stuck between the sole and heel...
...of someone's riding boot.
Someone who visited Mr. Enderby just before he died.
The murderer, you mean?
Well, we can hardly call him that...
...since it hasn't been officially decided that he was murdered.
True. But when Inspector Craddock has had time to consider your theory...
Inspector Craddock has assured me that that is exactly what he is not going to do.
No, Jim...
...you and I must pursue this trail entirely on our own.
Then where shall we begin?
We must find out who benefits by the death.
Then we'll have to wait till the will is published in the newspapers.
Not necessarily. Not necessarily.
- That's the lot, Fred.
- Right. Tea's up. I'll see you inside.
Right.
Fortune favors the brave.
- I beg your pardon?
- That dray, under the very window.
This calls for a certain amount of ingenuity.
- We have to get up there.
- What if anyone should see us?
We're effectively screened from the high street by the archway.
Come along.
I feel we're taking a grave risk of seeming inquisitive.
A calculated one, Mr. Stringer.
On we go.
I trust something pithy will be said, after all this.
Oh, dear. Here we are.
And though it is with some regret...
...that I finally satisfy the greed of my relatives...
...I nevertheless do devise and bequeath that my entire estate...
...be divided equally between my fourth cousin, George Crossfield...
...in order that he no longer need borrow from his clients' funds...
...my niece, Rosamund Shane...
...in order that she may support her husband...
...in the style to which he would like to be accustomed...
...to my nephew, Hector Enderby, in order that he may be able...
...to afford to hunt every day, rather than once a week...
...thereby providing more opportunity for breaking his neck...
...and finally, my sister,
Cora Lansquenet...
...out of gratitude that she stayed out of the country...
...for 30 years and didn't bother me.
The money to be given outright to all parties concerned...
...with the hope that it will make them all as miserable as possible.
That is the important part as far as you're concerned, I'm sure.
No, Mr. Trundell, the important part is, how much money am I going to get?
I don't think you should say things like that, even if it's how you feel.
Why not? I want to know.
Of course, we all want to know.
Well, a rough estimate...
Mind you, very rough.
Each of your shares should be about
20, 25,000 pounds.
Hector, I don't think you should have used the word "suddenly"...
...in the newspaper announcement of your uncle's death.
- What do you mean, Aunt Cora?
- Well, it might make people wonder.
But anyway, it's all been hushed up very nicely, hasn't it?
What are you talking about?
Well, after what he said when he came to see me last month...
...it can't do any good making it public.
It should be kept strictly in the family.
My dear, Mrs. Lansquenet, would you mind saying plainly...
...what you mean by all this?
- But he was murdered, wasn't he?
- What?
Really, Aunt Cora, that's a very silly thing to say.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning, inspector.
Thank you.
Miss Marple, when I thought it was you,
I thought, "No."
But it is.
- Allow me.
- Oh, thank you.
Miss Marple, you do realize if I didn't know you so well...
...I would at this moment be detaining you for loitering with intent.
Loitering with intent to what, conceivably, inspector?
To snoop.
- Snoop?
- That is the word I used, Miss Marple.
I'm sure everyone in Milchester is interested to know...
...how much Old Enderby had left, and to whom.
I suppose you wanted to be first.
Well, inspector...
...since you are clearly alleging that I am a tittle-tattling busybody...
...I will bid you good day.
Come, Mr. Stringer.
Miss Marple, don't you think you should go to the police...
...tell Inspector Craddock what you overheard and...?
"Tittle-tattling busybody,"
I believe were his words.
- No, yours.
- His meaning.
- Well, perhaps now...
- Please, Mr. Stringer...
...after this morning, I prefer not to mention Inspector Craddock.
Well, anyway, no matter what he thinks...
...after what Mrs. Lansquenet said, at least we know we were right.
- Mr. Enderby was murdered.
- And we know the motive.
Twenty-five thousand pounds to each of the family.
Yes, and it's a great deal of money.
- And since they all benefit...
- They are all suspect, true.
But a motive isn't enough.
Facts are what we want.
Otherwise, we're groping in the dark.
No, we must set to work to find out all we can about the entire family.
Mrs. Heyley-Brown?
Yes. Always a good starting place.
Of course, I disapprove of her gossiping...
...but in a desperate situation one must use the means at hand.
- Oh, yes.
- What is more...
...I suggest we start at once.
Surely you realize why.
Have you and I ever read a murder thriller that stops at a single killing?
- Then, you mean...?
- Yes, the killer may strike again.
I hadn't thought of that.
Perhaps, after all, the police...
We will go to the police when our case is complete.
They have their methods, we have ours.
Yes, and moreover I'm told that Cora Lansquenet...
...did not return to Milchester just for the funeral.
After living in France for a number of years...
...two months ago she rented a cottage a few miles from here.
And that's where her brother,
Mr. Enderby, visited her.
Yes, and the vicar maintains that he was a recluse.
- He hadn't left the country for 30 years.
- Yes, I heard that too.
- And Mrs. Heyley-Brown...
- Always a mine of information.
...says Cora Lansquenet needed that inheritance badly...
...because, before he died, her husband ran through all her money...
...buying worthless paintings.
Yes, all very useful.
But it still doesn't tell us why she thinks her brother was murdered.
Perhaps she wasn't telling the truth.
- Why should she lie?
- Well, she did marry a Frenchman.
- A painter too.
- Yes, and a very bad one.
Still, that doesn't make her completely irresponsible.
No, not completely.
Do you know, I think it's time
I had my portrait painted.
Your portrait, Miss Marple?
Yes. I'm going to call on Cora Lansquenet.
Just as an excuse, mind you.
We must find out what her brother said to her that day...
...that makes her so sure he was murdered.
I'll be back to tea.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to get it ready for us.
Mrs. Lansquenet?
Mrs. Lansquenet,
I'm sorry to disturb you...
Mrs. Lansquenet?
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
- Well, I was...
And what's the matter with Mrs. Lansquenet?
I'm afraid she's dead.
Dead? But...
You killed her. You killed her.
- My dear woman...
- Don't you touch me.
You killed her.
I saw you bending over her.
My dear woman, do I look like a murderess?
Well, I don't know what you look like, but I saw you.
What you saw or didn't see isn't of much point at the moment.
We have to call the police.
Where's the telephone?
There it is.
But you haven't yet told me who you are.
I'm Mrs. Lansquenet's companion,
Miss Milchrest.
Hello?
Yes, I can hear you're talking, but you'll have to stop talking.
Yes, I know it's a party line, but this is an emergency.
I have to call the police.
You needn't be sarcastic, young man.
Indeed I have a crime to report.
Murder. Murder most foul.
- Good afternoon, inspector.
- Miss Marple.
Yes, I have some tittle-tattle to convey.
Do come in.
- That's about all we need, sir.
- Fine, thanks.
Let me have a lab report on that as soon as possible.
All right, sir.
Funny weapon to use.
Yes, a woman's weapon.
Or a man's, wishing everyone to think it was a woman's.
I wasn't precluding that possibility,
Miss Marple.
The lady says she feels well enough to talk now, sir.
Right, bring her in.
Well, Miss Marple,
I won't keep you any longer.
It's quite all right, inspector.
I'm entirely at your disposal.
You don't suspect her, do you?
Well, she was here, the weapon was a hatpin...
True, but would anyone make themselves so obvious a suspect?
There have been stupid murderers.
She's a timid woman, inspector, not a stupid one.
By the way, I think you ought to know that this morning...
Not now, Miss Marple, please.
Oh, Miss Milchrest, sit down, won't you?
Oh, dear. I've never had anything to do with the police before.
There's nothing to worry about, my dear.
They're really very nice.
Thank you, Miss Marple.
Now, I understand you've been
Mrs. Lansquenet's companion...
...for many years now.
- Oh, yes, indeed.
I know this must be a great shock to you...
...but there are things we need to know.
- Well, l... I'll do my best.
- I'm sure you will.
- Now, when did you see her last?
- Just before I went to the library.
- What time was that?
- I caught the 2:00 bus.
I'd say she's been dead about two hours.
It's now 4:30. So about 2:30.
The coroner will be able to be a bit more exact.
Isn't it extremely difficult to determine the exact time of death, inspector?
We'll do our best to be as accurate as possible, Miss Marple.
Before you left her, did she seem nervous or upset in any way?
No, she was fine.
She was just getting ready to go out.
Miss Milchrest, have you any idea at all who may have killed her?
Aside from your suspicions of Miss Marple, I mean.
Anyone else? Anyone who hated her?
Oh, no, she was kind to everyone.
She was very kind to me.
She told me she was going to leave me her amethyst brooch...
...and one of her own paintings as a remembrance.
She painted very well, don't you think?
Yes. Yes, indeed.
Miss Milchrest, did she have any visitors lately?
No, we live very quietly, really.
But did none of her relatives ever call on her...
...after her return to this country?
Only her brother.
Her late brother, I mean.
He called about a month ago.
But in latter years he hardly ever left his home.
Was that for any special reason?
Well, yes. You see, they'd been estranged for a number of years.
After her husband died, she needed help financially.
She wrote to him.
- Were you present when he called?
- Oh, no.
Did you by any chance overhear anything they said to each other?
Do you suppose I'm the sort of woman who listens at keyholes? Of course not.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just wondered if you might have happened to overhear something.
I didn't hear a thing.
Miss Marple, I think I'm capable of asking any relevant questions.
So sorry, inspector.
Thank you, Miss Milchrest.
If you'd be good enough to make a statement to Sergeant Bacon...
...we'll talk again later.
Sergeant, you'd better notify the relatives.
The solicitor should have the addresses.
- Right, sir.
- Mrs. Lansquenet told me...
...they were all staying with Mr. Hector Enderby for a few days.
- That's at the Gallop Hotel, isn't it?
- Yes.
It is also a riding establishment.
Miss Milchrest, did you or did Mrs. Lansquenet ever ride?
- Ride?
- Horses, you know.
- No.
- Thank you.
Well, I won't detain you, inspector.
But I suggest that you pay a call on the family as soon as possible.
Oh, you do, do you? And why?
Well, I think you ought to know that at the reading of the will this morning...
...Cora Lansquenet said that her brother had been murdered.
What? How did you know...?
Oh, yes, of course.
You happened to overhear, didn't you?
As you say, I overheard.
May I ask why you didn't tell me this before?
Well, I did try to tell you earlier, but you wouldn't let me.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. So I didn't.
Don't you think it a trifle coincidental...
...that she should have been murdered so soon after making that statement?
Yes.
A little too coincidental.
Unless someone in the family...
...thought that Cora not only knew her brother had been murdered...
...but who murdered him.
Yes.
Moreover, that poor woman is in a very dangerous position.
- Miss Milchrest?
- Yes.
You see, if she did overhear what passed between Cora and her brother...
...and the murderer suspected it...
...she's likely to receive the same treatment that Cora did.
Well, I'll have to leave you now,
I'm afraid, inspector, to go and pack.
- Pack?
- Yes, I'm going on a short holiday.
Good day.
A very good idea, Miss Marple.
I hope you have a most enjoyable time.
- Mr. Enderby, Inspector Craddock.
- This way, sir.
I'll be in touch with you.
Miss Marple, I'm still not absolutely happy about this.
- I feel if I could be with...
- Now, Mr. Stringer...
...we have agreed that a non-rider in a place like this would be conspicuous.
Besides, the police are here.
Purely as a matter of routine, you understand...
...I'd like an account of all your movements...
...between 2:00 and 4:00 yesterday afternoon.
You're not suggesting it was one of the family...
...that put poor Auntie Cora down?
I'm not suggesting anything, sir.
I'm merely making inquiries.
Extremely offensive ones,
I have to say.
I'm sorry. I find murder offensive too.
Good heavens. Why would any of us do a dreadful thing like that...
...to an old woman?
Well, one suggestion that's been put forward is...
...to keep her quiet.
About what?
Well, it seems she made a statement yesterday morning.
A statement to the effect that your uncle, Mr. Enderby, was murdered.
How on earth did you find that out?
I think that's irrelevant, don't you, sir?
I take it no one is denying
Mrs. Lansquenet did say it?
Very well, then. There's one motive.
There could be others.
May I start with you, Mr. Shane?
Yes, all right. But I'm afraid
I can't give you an alibi...
...if that's what you're looking for.
Yesterday...
Well, I was out riding all afternoon.
- Alone, sir?
- Quite alone.
Where?
I'm afraid I'm not familiar enough with the neighborhood to tell you.
But familiar enough with it to find your way back?
The horse did.
And did you meet anyone when you were out?
No, I'm afraid not. I wish I had.
Yes, so do I.
Now what about you, Mr. Crossfield?
Well, I was out riding too, as a matter of fact.
- I see.
- I didn't meet anyone either.
Very well, then. And I suppose you were out riding too, Mr. Enderby?
No, I was in here all the afternoon.
Were you, Hector?
I tried the door and it was locked.
I thought you were out.
I locked the door.
I didn't want to be disturbed.
- What were you doing?
- I was doing my accounts.
I see. Very well.
- And you, Mrs. Shane?
- We all seem to have pretty feeble alibis.
I was in my room too.
All afternoon?
Yes, except when I went to look for Hector.
I was reading.
Did any of the staff see you when you came here looking for Mr. Enderby?
No.
I must say, inspector, 'tis unusual for an English woman to prefer reading...
...when she could be riding, but it is possible.
- I didn't say it wasn't.
- Well, then I hope you're satisfied.
I'm far from satisfied, Mr. Enderby.
But we'll leave it for the moment.
I'd appreciate it if you'll all make detailed statements to Sergeant Bacon.
And keep yourselves available.
I'll be with the chief constable for the next hour or so.
- Yes, sir.
- Just one moment, inspector.
Does that mean that you want us all to stay here?
I'm afraid so, Mr. Crossfield.
At least until after the inquest.
- But I have to go up north tomorrow.
- I'm sorry, that isn't possible.
It's an important sale, inspector.
Lord Fotherway's picture collection.
Every dealer in the country will be there, and I have a client for the Gainsborough.
You also have a partner, I understand.
Does that mean you've been checking up on me?
Merely routine, Mr. Crossfield.
Your partner can handle the sale, can't he?
- Yes, but...
- That's fine. Good day.
Now, sir, perhaps
I can deal with you first.
- There's something I want to tell you.
- Yes?
Well, ask you, really.
I'm trying to run a business here.
It's not very nice having a police car parked outside the front door.
If you find it necessary to come again, you might come a bit more incognito.
- Nothing else?
- That enough, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Enderby, it is.
Good morning.
- Do you see that?
- Can't really miss it, can you?
It's a Broadbreech side saddle.
Broadbreech of Northampton.
- Vintage too. Well, have a look.
- What?
Have a look at the date.
Behind the stirrup bar.
Well, it says...
No, don't tell me, I'll tell you: 1882.
No, I'm lying to you, 1885.
- Right.
- I can tell you who it belongs to too.
I've only glimpsed one of these once in the whole country. Lady Curthbrackle.
No, it...
- It belongs to...
- Me, Mr. Enderby.
Morning, inspector.
My mama's, of course.
My dear lady, it's magnificent.
I do hope you have an animal to accommodate it and me.
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.
Oh, how nice. I booked in for a week, don't you know.
Well, inspector, how nice to see you again after so long.
- So long?
- Yes, it must be months.
- Yes, quite.
- I'm delighted, Miss Marple.
I never dreamt that you aspired to be one of us.
Well, I have done some riding in my time, you know.
Junior Silver Spurs, Brockbrook, 1910.
Junior Silver, Brockbrook, 1910?
Miss J.T.V. Marple?
- Miss Marple, l...
- You... No, please, inspector.
But to think that we've been neighbors for years.
You must let me take you in to lunch.
You'll lunch with me.
- Of course.
- 1910. What a year that must have been.
You must have seen
Harry Devenish in his prime. Yes?
- Mr. Enderby.
- So sorry to have kept you waiting.
I said I would wait.
I didn't want to disturb you at lunch.
Well, that was kind of you.
Won't you come in?
We must find somewhere to bed you down.
- Bed me down?
- Get you a room.
- Won't you sit down?
- How very kind of you.
Nonsense. You couldn't possibly have stayed in the cottage...
...after what happened.
No, I couldn't. I just couldn't.
That's why I'm so grateful.
It's a pleasure, dear lady.
A shock like this takes weeks to get over.
A few gallops over the downs...
...will have you back in the saddle in no time.
But I don't ride.
You don't ride?
Oh, we'll have to see to that, won't we?
Perhaps whilst I'm here there might be something I could do.
I can arrange the flowers or be a hostess?
Yes, well, we'll talk about that later.
Yes, I mustn't keep you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Perhaps someone could show me to my room?
- I'll take you myself.
- No, don't bother.
I'll get the porter to take my things up.
Oh, Miss Milchrest?
Yes, Mr. Enderby?
There was something I wanted to ask you. What was it now?
Oh, yes, of course.
The day that her brother called on poor Aunt Cora...
...were you at the cottage?
Why, yes, I was.
You've no idea what they were talking about?
Well, no.
Naturally, they wanted to be alone.
Oh, it's not important.
Thank you.
Oh, Miss Milchrest. Good morning.
How nice to see you again.
Good morning.
Don't look so frightened, my dear.
I've done my quota of murders today.
- Are you staying here?
- I am indeed.
Oh, I didn't know that.
A delightful surprise for you, no doubt.
Incidentally, may I ask what brings you here?
Oh, Mr. Hector's been very kind.
He invited me when he heard
I had to leave the cottage.
I really had no place to go.
- Mr. Hector invited you?
- Yes.
Well, I hope you have a very pleasant stay.
- Thank you.
- Oh, by the way...
...I shouldn't tell the family that I was in the cottage yesterday.
It might hinder the inspector's inquiries.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Thank you.
- Can I help you?
- Well, I was just admiring your boots.
They're quite beautiful.
I'm really envious.
Thank you. Goodbye.
- My dear lady. Feminine but practical.
- Thank you, Mr. Enderby.
When I'm behind one of my lady guests in jodhpurs...
...I think what a shame it is that elegance has disappeared...
...from the equestrian scene.
Oh, how graciously put.
Well, now for your preliminary canter.
Hello, George.
What are you staring at?
Come in, Rosamund.
What's so interesting down there, anyway?
That old woman going off with Hector is the one who found uncle's body.
- She arrived here yesterday.
- What of it?
I don't like people prying into my affairs.
You are nervous, aren't you?
If you see Michael, will you tell him
I was looking for him?
Don't go for a moment, Rosamund.
Unless it makes you nervous to be here alone with me.
And why should it?
Because you know how attractive I find you.
Yes, I know that.
- Still only Michael?
- Of course.
And it doesn't bother you that he married you for your expectations?
He didn't marry me.
I was the one who decided.
I knew I wanted him from the first moment I saw him.
- Do you always get what you want?
- Of course.
I just take it.
You're a dangerous woman, Rosamund.
I hope you never want anything of mine.
You mean, like your money?
I don't, at the moment.
George, why were you so anxious to get it?
Did you want it that desperately?
Let's just say I needed it pretty badly.
Are you in trouble again?
What the devil do you mean?
Clients of yours sometimes give you money to buy pictures, don't they?
What of it?
It wouldn't be the first time you borrowed some of it?
- Shut up.
- Don't get so angry.
I don't care.
Oh, George, have you...?
Oh, hello, Rosamund.
I was looking for you.
I was looking for you too, darling.
- I want to go for a drive.
- I thought we were going for a walk.
I want to go for a drive.
Well, all right then, we might as well.
See you later, George.
Bye, George.
Thank you.
Now, are you comfortable, Miss Marple?
Perfectly, thank you.
I thought Daisy would suit you.
When you get your seat back, we'll put you on something a bit livelier.
Stand, Black Jack, stand.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
That's better. Come on.
You're nervous today, aren't you?
Careful, sir. He's in an ugly mood.
I can handle him.
Don't worry, Hillman.
- He'll throw you if he can, sir.
- Nonsense. Are we ready, Miss Marple?
- I am if you are.
- Yes.
He's high-spirited, you know, but he's no problem to me.
Are you, old boy?
Come on, come on.
We shall have you in shape in no time, Miss Marple.
A few days hacking along the lanes shall have you cantering...
Hello, Hillman.
- You want something, Mr. George?
- Yes.
I'd like to have a little chat.
No time for a chat.
I've got my work to do.
Now, don't be insolent.
All I want is a little information about Mr. Hector and that old lady.
You'll get no information out of me.
- Why not? Are you hiding something?
- No, I'm not.
- Now, let me get on with my work.
- Now, calm down, Hillman.
I think that old lady is trying to make trouble for Mr. Hector.
- She'd better not.
- She might.
I think it would be worth your while to keep an eye on her.
Whoa, boy, whoa. Steady. Steady.
It's a car coming that seems to be unsettling him.
Can't stand the sound.
I don't blame him. They're a menace.
My foot. My foot.
What are you trying to do?
That was Hector.
- You trying to kill him?
- I wasn't anywhere near him.
Well, you nearly hit him.
You did it on purpose, didn't you?
- What's the matter with you, darling?
- Look, will you slow down?
There. Is that better?
All right, Rosamund, now what's all this about?
- What's all what about?
- You know darn well.
All right, so I lied to the policeman that morning about riding.
What difference does it make?
Depends what you were doing.
Well, I had some business in the city.
Did you? I hope it was to say goodbye to her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't you?
Doesn't matter.
I know when you're lying.
I'm not lying.
Of course you're lying.
You lied about where you were last week...
...when you went to see uncle on the day he died.
- How did you know that?
- I know everything about you.
Now, look here, Rosamund, I don't like having my movements checked up on.
Now, I mean that.
Don't push me too far.
But I like to know.
What happened?
Did you think your fatal charm might loosen his purse strings?
Something like that, yes.
- And didn't they?
- No.
- And that's all?
- Of course that's all.
Then why not mention it?
I thought that after what happened, people might think that I...
That they might think that Aunt Cora was right?
Yes, they might think that.
How's the foot now, Mr. Enderby?
As well as can be expected after a horse has stepped on it.
- I'll help you.
- Thank you, that won't be necessary.
But I insist, Mr. Enderby.
That boot must come off immediately.
All right, Black Jack. Whoa.
Come on, Black Jack.
Easy, boy. Easy, boy.
Is he all right?
- Well done.
- I can manage quite well now.
I wouldn't dream of such a thing.
Come along, leg up.
- Please don't trouble yourself.
- I assure you, it's no trouble at all.
The longer you wait, the worse that swelling's going to be.
I propose to stand the whole thing in cold water for an hour or so.
Useless, Mr. Enderby. Boot up.
Now, this may hurt a little when I pull.
But be brave. Be brave.
Come along, now. Take the strain.
Here we go.
Gently, gently.
Nearly off, Mr. Enderby.
There. Well, it wasn't too bad, was it?
Oh, dear. Dear, dear.
- What's the matter?
- The colonel's not going to like this.
- The colonel?
- They're his boots.
I borrowed them this morning.
Some fool stable girl upset paint all over mine.
Oh, did she?
No idea, of course, how to get it off.
Mr. Enderby, I think you'd be better occupied bathing that foot.
Unless, of course, you want it to swell even more.
Yes, perhaps you're right.
It'll be up like a balloon in the morning anyway.
What the devil are you doing?
Mr. Hillman, how you startled me.
- What are you doing with those boots?
- Merely admiring them.
Fine old English leather.
Strong, yet supple.
Well, leave them alone from now on.
Hillman, that's no way to talk to a lady.
Now, get on with your work.
Well, I only came to tell you
Black Jack was back.
You mustn't worry about Hillman.
He's a surly chap, but he's been with me for years.
Completely trustworthy.
Then his appearance is extremely deceptive, Mr. Enderby.
Well, if you'll forgive me,
I really must have a little rest.
Careless of me.
It's a family matter.
I don't propose to discuss it in public.
Johnson, will you see we're not disturbed for the next half-hour?
- Right, sir.
- Are you going out, Miss Marple?
I always take a constitutional before retiring, Mr. Enderby.
All right, John. Put them in there.
You don't seem to understand.
I don't want anything of uncle's except that picture.
Well, that's just too bad, because I told
Hector yesterday that I wanted it.
Why not auction all the stuff, divide what it brings equally...
...and there won't be any more quarrelling.
I'm not quarrelling, darling.
That picture wouldn't fetch two pounds at an auction.
Are you sure, George?
You're an art dealer.
Maybe it is valuable and you're the only one who knows it.
It's not valuable. It just happens to appeal to me, that's all.
As Rosamund feels so strongly about this picture, you better let her have it.
After all, "ladies first" and all that sort of thing.
- Not in my book.
- Well, it is in mine.
Oh, why don't you toss up for it?
You, none of you, seem to understand. I want it.
That doesn't mean you're going to get it.
But it does.
- You listen to me, Rosa...
- Stop it, both of you.
I've had all the unpleasantness that I can take around here.
- Well, Hector.
- I mean it, Rosamund.
- Yes, Hector, you may mean it, but...
- No "buts." The matter's settled.
This is my house.
I make the rules around here.
It's marvelous what a little security does for some people, isn't it?
I don't find that remark very amusing.
I didn't mean it to be amusing.
Anyway, I'm glad it's all settled.
Thank you, George.
It's not settled as far as I'm concerned.
Oh, but it is, George.
I think you misunderstood, Rosamund.
It's settled...
...because I'm keeping it.
Oh. Not in bed yet, Miss Marple?
I'm just choosing something to read before retiring.
- Good night.
- Good night.
If you're looking for Miss Marple, she's downstairs in the lounge.
I'm sorry to have startled you.
That's all right.
I'm still a little nervous, I suppose.
Yes, well, under the circumstances,
I'm not surprised.
What do you mean?
Well, if I was the murderer,
I'd be very worried...
...in case you heard what Old Enderby said to Cora when he called.
But I didn't.
Personally,
I don't blame you for forgetting.
The murderer would hardly leave you running around, now would he?
- Oh, I must... I must...
- Go?
Yes, so must I. Good night.
- Is anything wrong, Miss Milchrest?
- Yes, I...
- Could I speak to you, please? Alone?
- Of course.
- Won't you come to my room?
- Thank you.
I hope this means that you no longer think I'm a murderess.
Forgive me for that.
It was stupid of me.
Not at all.
A natural conclusion when you found me standing over the body.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
There was something you wanted to say to me?
Oh, Miss Marple, I did overhear Cora...
I mean, Mrs. Lansquenet and her brother that day.
- Yes, I thought so.
- I wasn't deliberately eavesdropping.
Naturally not. What did you hear?
Only bits and pieces, really.
But enough to realize he was afraid that someone in the family...
...was going to kill him.
- Which one of them?
- I don't know.
He kept sort of hinting, as though he hated to say the word.
Understandable.
Miss Milchrest, have you told this to anyone else?
Oh, no. Because when he died so soon afterwards...
...I began to wonder.
And then, Mrs. Lansquenet...
Oh, Miss Marple, I'm afraid.
I'm terribly afraid.
Yes, I think you have reason to be.
They've all asked me, every single one of them.
And they look at me as if they don't believe me.
I'm afraid you're not a very good liar,
Miss Milchrest.
Now, we must tell this to Inspector Craddock...
...and to no one else.
- And the sooner the better.
- Yes.
Don't let it worry you anymore.
Go to your room and leave the rest to me.
Yes. Thank you very much.
Is that you, inspector?
Miss Marple here.
Please forgive the lateness of the hour...
...but, as it happens, I have the evidence I've been looking for.
I know who the killer is.
I hardly think you're in a position to threaten me.
But under the circumstances...
And you surely don't think it will stop me anyway, do you?
Nothing more to say? Good.
Then listen.
Yes, I went to see the old man on the day that he was killed.
We, all of us, went there at one time or another.
And all for the same reason:
To get money out of him.
But you were worse than any of us.
You were greedy enough to kill for it.
Oh, and not just for a quarter of the estate...
...but for a real sum of money.
That picture is worth a fortune.
Ironic, isn't it...
...to think that he must have picked it up
30 years ago in Paris for a song?
Now, I know what that picture is worth...
...and I want it.
If you don't tell me where it is, you know what's going to happen.
So where is it?
- What are you doing?
- Let me go. You're hurting me.
Snooping and prying, you old busybody.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
How dare you.
I shall report you to your employer first thing in the morning.
Hey, who's there? Let me out.
Help! Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Help! Help!
Stop that infernal row.
Turn the engine off.
Come on, Black Jack. Come on, boy.
Steady. Steady, boy, steady.
What on earth's going on here?
What's happened?
- What's the matter with Black Jack?
- Black Jack's all right, sir.
- He's all right.
- But there was someone in there.
- What?
- There was someone in there.
Who?
Mr. Crossfield, sir. He's dead.
- And where were you, sir?
- I was upstairs in my room.
And you, madam?
I was fast asleep, inspector.
So you were all in your rooms?
One of you wasn't.
Whoever locked that stable door and turned that motor on is a murderer.
That is the situation...
...and until I get to the bottom of it, none of you is to leave.
That will be quite impossible, inspector.
I'm afraid I must insist.
My men will be here...
...to see those orders are carried out.
Are you trying to ruin me?
I can't have police...
You can and you will.
But, good heavens, tonight is our annual dance.
Tonight? You're having a dance here?
It may sound unfeeling...
...to hold a dance under the circumstances...
...but I'm running a business.
I've lost enough guests already.
All right, you can have your dance.
But nothing else changes.
That's all for the moment.
Can I get back to work now, sir?
There's a lot to do for tonight.
- I suppose that's permissible?
- Of course.
Does that mean we can all go?
As long as you don't leave the grounds.
Inspector, I wonder if I might go to London this afternoon.
- I have an app...
- No, I'm sorry, but no one leaves.
- But, insp...
- That's all, Mr. Shane.
- Oh, Miss Marple.
- Yes, inspector?
Could I have word with you?
I have something rather important to say.
Yes, sure.
About that call last night.
Oh, that. Yes.
You had the evidence and the murderer,
I believe you said.
Well, I'm afraid I was a little premature there.
Were you? Who'd you think it was?
Crossfield?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But only briefly, inspector.
Very briefly. Now, I really know.
- Oh, yes. Yes, I'm sure you do.
- But I do.
Only before I can be quite sure...
...I need the expert opinion of an art dealer.
- An art dealer?
- That's what I said, inspector.
However, I'll take care of that.
But I need your help.
There is Mr. Stringer.
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be with you in a moment.
I'm sending him to London on an important mission...
...and when he returns tonight...
...he will have certain information that I need.
After that, we can force the killer out into the open.
- Oh, we can, can we?
- Yes, I guarantee it.
How much do you know about first aid, inspector?
First aid?
What has that to do with it?
I'm planning to have a heart attack at the dance tonight...
...and I shall be much obliged if you will pretend to take care of me.
If you think for one moment...
And have the doctor confirm the diagnosis.
Just like that. May I ask what you're proposing to do then?
I am proposing to allow myself to be frightened to death.
Good day, inspector.
Come, Mr. Stringer, let's go up to my room.
It's easier to talk there.
You know, I'm not entirely sure about that woman.
George thought she was working for the police, and I do too.
What nonsense. She's a lady.
Besides, she's a great horsewoman.
One doesn't necessarily preclude the other, does it, Hector?
I've never heard of a mounted policewoman.
You know her well.
Is she working for the police?
Oh, no. At least, I don't think so.
I believe she knows the inspector personally.
What does it matter, darling? You sound like a man with a guilty conscience.
My conscience is perfectly clear, thank you.
In that case, you have nothing to worry about.
Hector, now I can have the picture, can't I?
No.
Nobody else wanted it but George, and he's dead.
I've told you why. I'm keeping it myself.
Now, you are pleased to take this to London to the art dealers.
They will appraise it.
Get it back here as quickly as you can.
All right, if it will help.
I'm hopeful it will not only help, but clinch the whole matter, so to speak.
- That means you've made real progress.
- Yes. We are near the end. Very near.
- You know who did it?
- I think so.
- Oh, good. Who?
- I can't tell you that at present.
- Miss Marple, please be careful.
- Of course I'll be careful.
And you see you don't get yourself arrested.
That's stolen property.
Stolen prop...?
Mr. Enderby, you quite startled me.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
Sorry, I was just going to knock.
- Of course. You know Mr. Stringer?
- I don't think I've had the pleasure.
I'm so sorry. Mr. Enderby, Mr. Stringer.
Always delighted to meet any friend of Miss Marple's. How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, goodbye.
You're not leaving on my account,
I hope?
No, no, no.
An errand in London, you know.
What a shame. I was hoping you'd stay for our little dance.
Now, isn't that a good idea?
And you are so fond of dancing.
- I am?
- Well, you know you are.
Why don't you return here after going to London?
Yes, yes, perhaps I could do that.
Capital, capital.
Perhaps you'd like to leave your parcel?
He'd never be parted from that.
Would you?
No, no, no.
Don't you think it's time you got started?
The sooner you go, the sooner you will get back.
True, true. Well, it's been very nice to meet you, Mr. Enderby.
The pleasure was mine.
What a charming man.
Is he by any chance in the same line as my cousin George was?
- And what line would that be?
- He's an art dealer.
- What can have put that into your head?
- I'm not sure really.
Perhaps it was the parcel he was carrying.
It rather suggested a picture.
Oh, no. Mr. Stringer is custodian of the local library.
- Do you know anything about pictures?
- Well, just a little.
I can't tell a good one from a bad one myself.
I'd rather value your opinion on some my uncle left me.
My knowledge of pictures is rather limited.
But surely, just an opinion?
Well, you're welcome to that, but at some other time.
This afternoon I'm afraid
I really want to rest.
I'm not feeling very well.
Oh, dear. And here am I, making a nuisance of myself.
- Not at all.
- You must rest.
We must have you fit for the dance tonight.
I'm looking forward to a whirl or two with you.
You dance beautifully, Miss Marple.
Why, thank you, Mr. Enderby.
So do you.
Well, my foot holds me back a bit, you know, but I manage. I manage.
Indeed you do.
I hope you don't misunderstand about the dance.
It's not that I'm unfeeling about George, but we always have it.
Naturally. You have to consider your guests.
- Care for another whirl?
- Of course, Mr. Enderby.
- Perhaps we'd better sit this one out.
- Oh, dear.
Dreadful. Not dancing at all.
Still one must be tolerant of the young, Mr. Enderby.
I remember my dear mama was quite horrified...
...when she caught me doing the Charleston in public.
But the Charleston was different.
I'm sure you danced it beautifully.
Thank you.
There's Mr. Stringer.
As it happens, this is his favorite dance.
- Mr. Stringer.
- Miss Marple, I found out...
I was just telling Mr. Enderby that this is your favorite dance. Shall we?
- Dance, you mean?
- Naturally.
You'll excuse us, won't you,
Mr. Enderby? Come along.
- Really, Miss Marple, I don't think...
- Do your best, Mr. Stringer.
This is the only way
I could get you alone.
What did you find out?
You were quite right, Miss Marple.
It's worth at least 50,000 pounds.
I knew it.
Then it was that picture, after all.
It certainly was.
Excellent. We can now proceed with certainty.
- Proceed where, Miss Marple?
- To trap the killer.
Was Inspector Craddock in the foyer as you came through?
Yes.
Well, then. I think perhaps a little livelier.
And don't be alarmed if I suddenly pretend to be ill.
Now then, hot it up.
Help me to a chair.
I shall be quite all right.
- Really, no need to fuss.
- No, there's every need.
The doctor warned you after that last heart attack.
Did he?
I think if I could just lie down.
Oughtn't I to get a doctor?
We'll get the police doctor.
It'll be quicker. Bacon.
Yes, sir.
She's got to lie down immediately.
Where's her room?
- Upstairs at the end of the passage.
- She can't manage any stairs.
Isn't there a room on this floor she could use?
Well, there's a small back room, but she'd be all alone there.
Good. That's what she needs.
Complete rest and quiet.
Miss Marple, do you think if we helped you...?
- Yes, perhaps.
- There we are. Easy.
Why, I am so sorry to give you all this trouble, Mr. Enderby.
Don't be foolish, dear. It's no trouble.
- It's just we're rather worried about you.
- Oh, I'll be fine. Fine.
Mr. Stringer, won't you sit down?
She'll be all right, I'm sure she will.
- How is she?
- Not very good, I'm afraid.
- She'll be all right, won't she?
- Doctor, could I see her?
I'm afraid not, Mr. Stringer.
She mustn't be disturbed.
I won't even risk moving her to the hospital until the morning.
You haven't answered my question.
Will she be all right?
I hope so, but it's a pretty severe attack.
- Now will you see she's not disturbed?
- Of course.
- If I could speak to her before we go...
- Absolutely not, inspector.
She's to have complete rest and quiet.
I won't disturb her...
...but she wanted to tell me about a painting.
She can tell you in the morning, possibly, if she's any better.
I'm afraid I've got to insist.
You can insist all you like...
...but for the moment, she's my patient, and no one goes near her.
Any disturbance of any kind would probably be fatal.
Now, I suggest you all get to bed.
Try and get some sleep. Good night.
Miss Marple, are you awake?
Wake up. Wake up!
It's me, Cora. I've come back.
Yes, Cora, I've been waiting for you.
You've come for your picture, haven't you?
Yes, you stole it.
I only borrowed it, my dear.
I have it right here.
Allow me to return it to you...
...Miss Milchrest.
- Then you're not ill?
- I never felt better in my life.
Then there's nothing the matter with your heart?
I should have guessed it was a trick.
How foolish of me.
How did you know?
I've seen you before at the reading of the will.
By impersonating Cora...
...you were able to plant the suspicion that Old Enderby had been murdered...
...so that when you killed Cora...
...it would look as if someone in the family did it to keep her quiet.
I fooled them all.
Not one of them dreamed I wasn't Cora.
So then you had to kill
George Crossfield too.
It was clever me, wasn't it?
And all this for nothing.
No, not all for nothing, Miss Marple.
Because you're the only one left who knows.
Not so clever after all, are you, Miss Marple?
Nor was Cora. The fool.
The picture is worth a fortune, and she didn't even know it.
She was so stupid.
She said I could have it when she died because I admired it one day.
You won't get away with it this time.
Oh, yes, I will.
A few minutes from now and I shall be harmless Miss Milchrest again.
- Inspector, help!
- Miss Milchrest.
No, please, don't touch me. I don't...
Please, don't touch me.
All right, Bacon.
For goodness sake, why didn't you ring?
The law may have a long arm, inspector.
Unfortunately, I haven't.
And now, if you'll forgive me,
I must catch up on a little sleep.
Come in.
You asked to see me before I left,
Mr. Enderby.
Oh, yes, indeed, Miss Marple.
Yes. Yes, indeed.
- May I help you with that?
- Oh, that is good of you.
Not at all.
- There we are.
- May l...?
Oh, please do.
Is this wise, Mr. Enderby?
Oh, yes. It's the hunt today, you know.
It's the Fidget Hunt.
Mr. Enderby, you did want to see me?
Yes, that's true, Miss Marple.
That's true.
Well?
Do you know that every chair in this room is stuffed...
...with the hair of the horses that I've loved...
...and I think I may say, have loved me?
- Really?
- Human beings, you know...
I've never got on so well with human beings.
They're all right when they're up...
...but when they're down, only two legs, you know.
Yes, I think I follow you, Mr. Enderby.
I knew you would.
We're alike. Alike.
Well, I mean, you're a lady in retirement.
A single lady, living alone.
Well, I think you know what
I'm trying to say.
Are you by any chance proposing to me, Mr. Enderby?
That's right.
I'm proposing that you should keep your saddle here permanently.
- This is where it belongs.
- I'm afraid...
Oh, it would be a working arrangement, of course.
You run the hotel, and I'll run the stable.
Well...
You run the stable, and I'll run the hotel.
I'm extremely flattered, Mr. Enderby.
- Well?
- But I'm afraid I must say no.
No?
You see, I have so many other interests to occupy my time.
One indeed presses now:
The next production at the church hall.
A murder mystery, you know.
I do hope you'll come.
I don't think I'd care for it.
Oh, what a pity.
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Miss Marple.
- Yes?
I would deem it an honor...
...if you'd at least stay the day and be my guest at the hunt.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Enderby, but I disapprove of blood sports.
That was a very narrow escape.

An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted...
is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored.
Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more.
Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House.
Whatever walked there walked alone.
Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide.
The history of Hill House was ideal.
It had everything I wanted.
It was built 90-odd, very odd years ago...
by a man named Hugh Crain as a home for his wife and daughter...
in the most remote part of New England he could find.
It was an evil house from the beginning.
A house that was born bad.
Hugh Crain's young wife...
died seconds before she was to set eyes on the house.
She was killed when, for no apparent reason...
the horses bolted, crashing her carriage against a big tree.
Mrs. Crain was carried...
lifeless is the word, I think...
into the home her husband had built for her.
Hugh Crain was left an embittered man...
with a small daughter, Abigail, to bring up.
Fortunately, for me, that is...
Hugh Crain did not leave Hill House.
He married again.
The second Mrs. Crain's death was even more interesting...
than her predecessor's.
I've been unable to find out how or why she fell...
although I have my suspicions.
Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse and went to England...
where he died in a drowning accident.
Marvelous!
I mean, the way the history of Hill House follows a classic pattern.
For some reason...
Abigail kept that same nursery room in Hill House where she grew up...
and grew old.
In later years, she became a bedridden invalid.
She took a girl from the village to live with her as a paid companion.
It's with this young companion...
the evil reputation of Hill House really begins.
The story goes that the old lady died calling for help...
in the nursery upstairs...
while the companion fooled around with a farm hand on the verandah.
The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years.
The local people believe that, one way or another...
she had murdered her benefactor.
She lived a life of complete solitude in the empty house...
though some say that the house was not empty...
and never has been since the night old Miss Abby died.
They say that whatever there was and still is in the house...
eventually drove the companion mad.
We do know she hanged herself.
After her death...
the house passed legally into the hands of a distant relative in Boston...
an old lady, Mrs. Sannerson, who I very much wanted to see.
All my life I've been looking for an honestly haunted house.
In the interests of psychic research, you must let me have it for a few weeks.
No one who rented Hill House ever stayed for more than a few days.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
I don't believe it.
Dr. Markway is a trained anthropologist... a respected member of a university faculty.
We should welcome such a man to investigate Hill House.
Perhaps.
As an old woman due shortly to enter the next world...
I'd like to know if there is one.
I'm sure his report will give Hill House a clean bill of health.
How will you go about conducting your investigations, Dr. Markway?
I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...
- Assistants?
- My dear Mrs. Sannerson...
I am a scientist conducting an unusual experiment.
A haunted house. Everyone laughs.
So I must have specially qualified help... to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find.
- Who are these assistants?
- I haven't made my final choice yet... but they're from a list of names
I've been assembling over the years.
- We don't want any publicity seekers.
- Of course not.
These people have only been selected after painstaking research.
They've all been involved before, one way or another, with the abnormal.
I don't like the sound of that.
- Are any of the people women?
- Some.
- Are you a married man?
- Yes.
Then your wife will be accompanying you.
I'm afraid not.
My wife disapproves of my experiments with the supernatural.
She wants no part of Hill House.
To make sure that everything is as it should be... suppose your nephew goes along with Dr. Markway?
Luke?
Our young Lochinvar from out of the Midwest.
I haven't much confidence in that branch of the family.
In this case, I think you can.
Luke expects to inherit Hill House... and he'll make sure that his property is well taken care of.
His property?
Still, it might be rather good at that.
Luke hopes one day to live off Hill House.
But he never dreamed to find himself living in it.
Harper, give Dr. Markway his lease.
Thank you, Mrs. Sannerson.
A word of warning:
Don't play gin with Luke.
He's a cardsharp.
Good. That indicates a strong instinct for self-preservation.
Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?
Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe...
I only say maybe... the key to another world.
You've just got to let me have the car.
There's no other way of getting there, and I'm expected.
- Calm down.
- I've even bought some new clothes.
Please, Bud.
Carrie drives the car all the time and I never even take it out of the garage.
- Mother...
- Mother what?
Nothing.
Auntie Nell is blinking.
Quiet, Dora.
Let's talk this over without anybody getting emotional or nervous.
Why shouldn't I be nervous?
My first chance for a vacation in my life and you won't let me take it.
There's a good reason Mother was afraid for you to go anywhere... and it still applies.
We're not going to dig up the family skeleton again, are we?
I think you should have a vacation, Nell.
Nobody knows better than me what you went through during your mother's illness.
Dirty laundry, the smell of that sickroom...
Talk about mean old ladies!
Let the dead rest in peace.
It's half my car.
I helped pay for it and I mean to take it.
We don't know where you're going.
You haven't seen fit to tell us anything, have you?
No, you may not have the car.
What beats me is why you're playing this thing so cozy... like this was a jailbreak.
In any case, I'm sure I'm doing what Mother would have thought best.
Although I don't suppose poor Mother's wishes mean much to you.
Get out. Get out, both of you.
Now just a minute, young lady.
You happen to be in my living room.
I happen to be in my bedroom, and I pay a good part of your rent for it.
Now get out before I show you what my nerves can really do!
Besides, how do I know you'll bring back my car in good condition?
Come on.
I want my car. I mean to take it.
- Which?
- The Fredericks' car.
- You ain't Mrs. Fredericks.
- It's half mine.
- Who are you?
- Her sister, Miss Lance.
Look, here's my driver's license... here's my library card... and here's a blood donor card.
All the same address as my sister's.
I live with her.
- Front row, left of the far pillar.
- Thank you.
"Very happy that you'll be joining us in Hill House.
"Take US 50 from Boston...
"and watch for the turnoff onto Route 238."
Route 238.
At last I am going someplace where I'm expected...
and where I'm being given shelter.
And I shall never have to come back.
I hope...
This is what I've been waiting for all my life.
I'm going. I'm really going.
I've finally taken a step.
By now they know the car is gone...
but they don't know where.
They would never have suspected it of me.
I would never have suspected it of myself.
I'm a new person.
Someday...
Someday I'll have an apartment of my own...
in a house with a pair of stone lions guarding the gate.
I might just stop anywhere and never leave again.
Or I might drive on and on...
until the wheels of the car are worn to nothing...
and I've come to the end of the world.
I wonder if all homeless people feel that way.
I wonder what Dr. Markway is like.
I wonder who else will be there.
I wonder what Hill House is like.
- What do you want?
- I want to come in, please.
- Please unlock the gates.
- Who says?
I'm supposed to come in. I'm expected.
- Who by?
- Dr. Markway.
- You better come back later.
- Please.
I'm one of Dr. Markway's guests.
He's expecting me in the house.
Please listen to me.
He can't rightly be expecting you... seeing as you're the only one who's come so far.
Do you mean that there's no one in the house?
No one you'd want to see.
- What did you say your name was?
- Eleanor Lance... and I am expected in Hill House.
- Unlock those gates at once.
- All right.
Suppose you know what you're asking for coming here.
Suppose they told you, back in the city.
You seem to be the one who's afraid.
You'll be sorry I ever opened the gate.
Out of the way, please.
You've held me up long enough.
- Are you Dudley, the caretaker?
- I'm Dudley, the caretaker.
I shall report you.
Think they can find anyone else to stay here?
Think we can't have things the way we want, me and the wife... as long as we stay around here, see to the house... for all you city people think you know everything?
It's staring at me.
Vile.
Get away from here. Get away at once.
It's my chance.
I'm being given a last chance.
I could turn my car around and go away from here...
and no one would blame me.
Anyone has a right to run away.
But you are running away, Eleanor...
and there's nowhere else to go.
It's waiting for me.
Evil, patient...
waiting.
Mrs. Dudley?
I'm Eleanor Lance. I'm expected.
Can you take me to my room?
I gather I'm the first one here,
Mrs. Dudley.
You did say you were Mrs. Dudley?
I met your...
Talk about being scared of your own shadow.
Pull yourself together.
Here.
This is your room.
How nice.
I can't keep the rooms the way I'd like... but there's no one else they could get that would help me.
How very nice.
I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at 6:00.
I clear up in the morning.
I have breakfast for you at 9:00.
I don't wait on people.
I don't stay after I set out the dinner.
Not after it begins to get dark.
I leave before the dark comes.
- Your husband?
- We live over in town, miles away.
So there won't be anyone around if you need help.
I understand.
We couldn't hear you... in the night.
- Do you have any idea when...
- No one could.
No one lives any nearer than town.
No one will come any nearer than that...
I know.
...in the night, in the dark.
I'm like a small creature swallowed whole by a monster...
and the monster feels my tiny movements inside.
Now, Eleanor Lance, you just stop it.
There's no one else they could get.
I set dinner on the...
Thank heavens somebody's here.
My name's Eleanor Lance.
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm Theodora. Just Theodora.
What about this crazy house?
I'm right next door.
We have a connecting bath.
This used to be the embalming room, I bet.
It was terrible being here alone.
I set dinner on the sideboard at 6:00...
Where's Markway?
I thought he'd be here first.
Serve yourselves.
I clear up in the morning.
- Have you known Dr. Markway long?
- Breakfast is at 9:00.
- I've never met him.
- I don't stay after 6:00, when it gets dark.
Our only contact is our correspondence about the "experiment."
I leave before the dark comes.
So there won't be anyone around if you need help.
No one can hear you if you scream in the night.
Isn't that so, Mrs. Dudley?
No one lives any nearer than town.
No one will come any nearer than that... in the night... in the dark.
- You're frightened, Nell.
- No more.
Just when I thought I was all alone.
But how did you know my nickname is Nell?
That is the affectionate term for Eleanor, isn't it?
Yes, I suppose it is.
What a nice way of putting it.
The affectionate term for Theodora is Theo.
We're going to be great friends, Theo.
Like sisters?
There's no need to hang around our rooms.
- Let's go exploring.
- I'd like to.
Why don't you put on one of your new things? Something that'll stand out.
I think it's a good idea around here to always remain strictly visible.
Be ready in a jiffy.
How did you know I brought new clothes?
You wear your thoughts on your sleeve.
Anyway, that's better than my heart.
How did I get into this? Why am I here?
What nightmares are waiting?
Damn it! I still say one of these doors should lead to the main hall.
Any lights near you, Nell?
It helps if you make a game of it.
Pretend this is hide-and-seek.
But we're still lost.
Yes.
That passageway.
We haven't tried that one yet.
What's the matter?
There's something with us.
I don't see anything.
- Can't you feel it?
- No.
I feel a chill.
- It's moving.
- It's just the air rushing past our ears.
Then who?
What?
The house, it's alive.
She didn't hear that.
Nobody heard it but me.
It wants you, Nell.
The house is calling you.
I've waited such a long time.
Is this what I came so far to find?
Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me!
You won't believe this, but five minutes ago I left this door open... so you could find your way.
It closed by itself.
Welcome to Hill House. I'm Dr. Markway.
Thank goodness.
I thought you might be a ghost.
- How do you know I'm not?
- Don't be ghoulish.
You mustn't confuse ghoulish and ghostly.
The word "ghoulish" is used to describe a feeling of horror... often accompanied by intense cold.
It has nothing to do with ghosts.
Ghosts are visible.
- Enough of that. Get us out of here fast.
- What's the matter?
Let's just say we're scared of the dark.
I, too, go in mortal terror of the dark.
- I'm Theodora.
- You must be Eleanor.
I'm unsure at the moment.
If it turns out you're not,
I'll be disappointed.
All right.
It's Theo who's wearing velvet, so I must be Eleanor in tweed.
Good.
Follow me through the uncharted waste of Hill House.
Dinner's waiting.
- Do you like it?
- Lovely. What do you call this?
The Purple Parlor.
We're going to use this as the operating room.
I mean the center of operations.
- It's not very cheerful.
- I don't know.
There's nothing more cozy than an old gargoyle... except maybe a whipping post or two.
This house does have its little oddities.
The man who built it was a misfit... who hated people and their conventional ideas.
He built his house to suit his mind.
For instance, all the doors are hung slightly off-center.
Probably explains why they keep swinging shut by themselves.
Watch.
Now watch this.
What did I tell you?
Anyway, all the angles are slightly off.
There isn't a square corner in the place.
No wonder it's impossible to find your way around.
Add up all these wrong angles... and you get one big distortion in the house as a whole.
Clever, Eleanor. You catch on fast.
I'm hungry.
Let's go.
Sorry. In the psychic world we're apt to forget... that food is still the main concern of poor old homo sapiens.
You see? Closed by itself.
To the right, ladies.
Now, which door?
- That one.
- Wrong.
I've studied a map, it's this one.
- This proves it, one of you is a witch.
- A broom closet.
If you can't find your way around, how will we ever?
All these doors, it makes me think of the lady and the tiger.
Let's see if there's a tiger behind this one.
That's funny.
- No tiger?
- Listen.
What's wrong? Too much vermouth?
Nothing that serious... and, please, no cracks about my passion for spirits.
If you two are the ghostly inhabitants of Hill House...
I must confess I'm glad I came.
It has taken 60 million years... to develop the carnivorous biped you see before you.
Luke Sannerson.
Let's see what kind of martinis it makes.
They should be pretty good.
I majored in them at college.
Are we to expect any more carnivorous bipeds?
Originally, there were six committed to the experiment... but one by one the others dropped out.
I suppose they were frightened by the various unsavory stories about the house.
You're the only ones left.
What stories?
You didn't investigate before you came here?
So much the better.
You should be innocent and receptive.
- So let's drink to our success.
- Success?
And just how do you reckon success in a junket like this?
I'd like to drink... to just us, good companions.
Excellent.
To my new companion.
Except I don't drink.
- I think I'll have some more salmon.
- Palissy.
- Yeah? How much is it worth?
- Plenty.
Haven't seen Palissy outside of a museum.
I'll take a pair of Kastle skis for them any day of the week.
I wonder how much I'll get for this New England fossil.
Don't let Mrs. Dudley hear you saying that.
At the moment she's giving us the best.
I'm a simple fellow myself, easily satisfied by the best of everything.
Including, I hope, some startling events to come.
Exactly what do you expect to happen, Dr. Markway?
Yes, what is the matter with Hill House?
What's going to happen?
Why are we here?
Like so many people through the ages,
I've been intrigued by the supernatural... or rather the possibility of the supernatural.
I'm here in hopes of proving its existence.
You're here to keep track and take notes for an authenticated record.
- Okay. But why us?
- It's no accident.
You're what's left of a select company chosen with great care.
I combed the records of psychic societies... the back numbers of newspapers, reports of parapsychologists... hoping to find people who've been touched in some way by the supernatural.
It's my belief that the very presence of people like yourselves in this house... will help to stimulate the strange forces at work here.
Charming thought, to be used as live bait.
I'm here because
I'm a wolf in ghost's clothing.
I'm not really running a psychic beauty contest.
You're here, Theo... because of your remarkable powers of extrasensory perception.
ESP? Don't believe in it.
Theo's a champ.
Her name shines in the annals of Duke University Psychic Lab... where she identified 19 out of 20 cards... held up out of sight and hearing.
But I've never had anything to do with the supernatural.
Yes, you have, Eleanor.
Your poltergeist experience.
What's a poltergeist?
- A playful ghost, isn't that right, Nell?
- I wouldn't know.
According to the records of the International Psychic Society... showers of stones fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old.
That's ridiculous.
It was witnessed by your family... the neighbors, sightseers and the police.
In fact, it's the only case ever officially recorded by the police.
It never happened.
Perhaps not, if you say so.
I only mention it because that's the reason I wanted you in Hill House.
Doc, level with us.
I mean, you're a college prof.
A man with a PhD.
You can't really believe there's such a thing as a haunted house.
I wish you'd stop referring to this desirable property as haunted.
There's that word "haunted" again.
Makes me expect to find a disembodied hand in the sauce.
Nobody knows even why some houses are called haunted.
What would you call this place?
Fun-o-rama?
Diseased, sick, crazy if you like.
A deranged house isn't a bad way of putting it.
Your aunt thinks that maybe Hill House was born bad.
Such houses are described in the Bible as leprous.
Or before that, in Homer's phrase for the underworld:
A house of Hades.
Come off it, Doc.
Really, the local mayor makes more sense to me.
He says the disturbances are caused by subterranean waters... electric currents, atmospheric pressure, sunspots, earth tremors, et cetera.
Sure, people always want to put an easy label on things... even if it's meaningless.
"The trouble with Hill House is sunspots."
There's an explanation you don't have to think twice about.
And it has a scientific ring.
That was the neighbors.
They threw the rocks.
Mother says they were against us because she wouldn't mix with them.
Mother says...
Oh, dear.
That's all right, Eleanor.
- Go on. What does your mother say?
- Nothing.
I must be more tired than I thought.
My mother died two months ago.
You weren't sorry when it happened... were you?
No, she wasn't very happy.
Then I won't say I'm sorry now.
If I'd known,
I'd never have asked you to come here.
But I'm grateful you did. I had to get away.
- Perhaps you should...
- Please, let's talk about something else.
Oh, dear.
Doc, see that? Now what about that?
Does salt work against the supernatural?
The Montusi bushmen thought so, but they're extinct.
You see, you haven't a ghost of a chance.
I have a place in this room.
These people are my friends.
I'm one of them. I belong.
Gin!
- That's the fifth time, five times in a row.
- $12, please.
- I hope your skirt isn't stained.
- That's all right.
But the upholstery on the couch.
I've cleanser upstairs.
- Do you think I'm a sucker?
- Pay up. Cash on the line.
Over my dead body.
You knew every card I had in my hand.
- There's a name for that.
- If you mean cheating, I don't have to.
Okay, Miss ESP, go dream yourself up the $12.
Pay up, you welsher!
I won fair and I want my money.
- What was it?
- I had a feeling.
- I'm sure it was just my imagination.
- A feeling you were being watched?
Yes, I did.
The house.
It watches every move we make.
- That's your imagination.
- Don't be so cocksure of everything.
A closed mind is the worst defense against the supernatural.
You think you're too civilized to need to protect yourself against evil spirits.
But even prehistoric man had a dozen practical methods of warding them off.
Some of your theories strike me as prehistoric.
Besides, they downgrade property values.
I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen.
Yet it does happen.
Ghosts make the papers along with celebrities every day of the week.
If it happens to you... you're liable to have that shut door in your mind... ripped right off its hinges.
Look, Doc, we're buddies, but don't try to convert me.
I'm trying to prepare you.
There's something going on in this house or I wouldn't be here.
What?
Don't ask me to give a name to something which hasn't got a name.
I don't know.
Tomorrow we'll see all the place.
Now let's go to bed.
Unless anyone wants to clear out now... and not have anything more to do with Hill House.
I hope to have plenty to do with it someday, moneywise.
We couldn't leave now even if we wanted to.
- You mean I'm holding you prisoner?
- I mean Dudley keeps the gates locked.
We could always break out.
I have a key to the gate anytime you want it.
- I wouldn't dream of leaving.
- Thank you.
Adventurers all.
But you mustn't expect every night to be Halloween.
Psychic phenomena are subject to certain laws.
And just what are these laws?
You won't know until you break them.
At the end of each day, you have to fill out these forms I've had mimeographed.
Very scientific, aren't we?
The really scientific phase won't start for a while yet.
First of all, we have to get orientated.
What's this? Looks like "psy-kookiness."
Nothing like that wrong with me.
Psychokinesis is just the technical form... for what you'd call objects moving by themselves.
Actually, they don't... but are moved by a force from somewhere which we call psychokinesis.
I see.
About this ghost
I can expect in my room tonight... tell me, is it male or female?
Good night, ladies, Doc.
I just thought of something.
Nobody locked the front door.
Won't make any difference.
I see.
- Good night, Dr. Markway.
- John.
Good night, Theo.
Get a good rest, Eleanor. Sleep well.
I'll turn the lights off below, in case you wonder who did it.
If you feel in the least bit nervous, just run right into my room.
Thanks. Good night.
I'll come in for a second.
You've been thinking of changing your hair. I know just the style for you.
Why, yes. I was. But I'm awfully tired.
- Thanks anyhow.
- Okay. We have a date for breakfast.
Good night, Theo.
Funny. Everything's so ugly and yet so comfortable.
Like drowning, I guess.
Now I can think about them. I'm all alone.
Alone.
He won't know I locked it.
Against what, Eleanor?
All right, Mother.
Just a minute. I'm coming.
What, Theo?
Nell, in here!
I'm here. What is it?
I thought it was you pounding.
It was. I mean, I did.
But now it's down near the other end of the hall.
It's not at all like Mother knocking on the wall.
It's only a noise, and the room is terribly cold.
Terribly, terribly cold.
It must be Luke and Dr. Markway.
Why should they be knocking on the walls?
Something is. Anyway, it's only a noise.
Earth tremors?
Maybe it'll go down on the other side of the hall.
- No!
- Go away!
Now I've done it.
It was looking for the room with someone inside.
You big baby.
Whatever it is, it's just a noise.
- I'm cold.
- So am I.
- Where's Luke? Where's Markway?
- I don't know.
- Warmer now?
- No.
In a minute
I'll go out in the hall and call them.
Are you all right?
Oh, God, Nell!
It's against the top of the door!
It's found us.
Now I know why people scream, because I think I'm going to.
Is the door locked?
You can't get in!
It's over.
- How do you know?
- Can't you feel it?
Aren't you warm again?
That terrible cold has gone.
Why, yes.
Intense cold is one of the symptoms of shock. My mother...
Intense shock is one of the symptoms I've got.
Where have you two been?
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Did anything happen?
Nothing in particular... just something knocked on the door with a cannonball... then tried to get in and eat us.
I'm with Nell.
Miss ESP and Bridey Murphy, some combination.
- There isn't a scratch on the wood.
- Or anywhere else.
How nice, it didn't mar the woodwork.
Where were you, Dr. Markway?
Chasing a dog.
At least, we assumed it was a dog.
We followed it outside.
You mean it was inside?
I thought I heard something run past my room.
I woke Luke. We went looking for it all over the house... and finally out in the garden.
But let's face it, girls, we didn't get very far from the house.
Then you must've heard that ungodly noise.
No, there wasn't a sound from the house.
At least, nothing audible to us.
- We'd better take precautions.
- Against what?
When Luke and I are decoyed outside... and you two are bottled up inside... wouldn't you say that something, somehow, is trying to separate us?
Good morning, Dr. Markway.
'Morning, and please call me John.
- This curious life seems to agree with you.
- Thank you.
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please.
How is it you look so pretty after last night?
That was last night.
There may have been a little noise.
One has to expect that in these old houses.
I give up. I was sure you'd be packed and on your way.
Not likely.
This is my first vacation in years and I'm going to enjoy it.
That's the point. You need a real vacation.
This isn't the place for one.
I mean to stay. Period.
Unless, of course, you want to get rid of me.
No, you mustn't think that.
Till last night you were just a name on my list.
I scarcely know Eleanor Lance.
- She's horrible.
- No, you mustn't make fun of me.
You're sweet and pleasant and everyone likes you very much.
I want to know more about you.
I dislike lobster, crack my knuckles when I'm nervous... save buttons, and sleep on my left side.
Why on the left side?
I read someplace it wears the heart out quicker.
That's a depressing thought.
For the past 11 years I've been walled up alive on a desert island.
I thought you might be hiding some dark romantic secret in your past.
Romantic?
I've spent all my adult life taking care of my invalid mother... until she died.
No, it wasn't romantic.
Now that you're free at last, you shouldn't be wasting your time in Hill House.
- It's a mistake.
- But it isn't, don't you see?
The only thing that kept me going... was that someday
I knew something would happen.
Something truly extraordinary, like Hill House.
Yes, it's extraordinary.
What'll you do when you get back?
Do you have a job?
No job, nothing.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You wouldn't send me back, would you?
That depends on what happens.
We may all have to go back.
But I won't give up easily.
How did you get so interested in the supernatural?
I didn't want to become what my father called a practical man.
I come from one of those respectable English families... that dragged all the Victorian virtues into the 20th century.
In a Gladstone bag, of course.
Everything had to be practical and conventional.
So my first reaction as a kid... was to choose something useless and unconventional. Like ghosts.
But you're an anthropologist now.
When I refused to read law at Oxford as my father had... there was a terrific row.
I took off for America, without my Gladstone bag... and worked my way through college.
I decided on anthropology because it seemed... to be a short step from the study of dead souls... to the study of dead men and dead civilizations.
I'm not very practical, either.
But it didn't occur to me till I was hooked... that my combined knowledge of anthropology and psychic phenomena... had led me on to something very practical.
You see, if ghosts, which are pure spirit, come from man... then perhaps it's possible some day to have individuals... whose spiritual caliber far surpasses anything humanity has yet known.
Human nature could certainly stand some improvements.
However, my idea remains pure theory... until somebody proves definitely the supernatural exists.
Anyway, that's enough about me.
Now tell me about last night.
Thank you.
I've been trying to remember.
I can remember knowing I was frightened... but I can't remember actually being frightened, or how I felt.
I think it's because it was so unreal.
Still could be subterranean waters, you know.
I hope not.
That wouldn't be nearly so exciting.
Not good, this feeling of excitement.
It's the first sign you've fallen under the spell of the house.
Maybe it isn't just the house.
Then what else?
Let's blame it on sunspots.
Well, it wasn't sunspots last night.
If anyone gets hurt, it's going to be your fault, Markway.
No ghost in all the long history of ghosts ever hurt anyone physically.
We weren't in any actual danger at all, isn't that right, John?
No, not entirely.
Fear alone can do the damage to the victim.
Prehistoric man, for instance, could die of fright during an eclipse.
- Poor sap.
- You mean poor homo sapiens.
A modern man can react with the same unreasoning terror... to a supernatural event.
Especially if he doesn't believe that the supernatural exists.
I've always been more afraid of being left alone or left out... than of things that go bump in the night.
What are you afraid of, Theo?
Of knowing what I really want.
- Good morning, fellow earthlings.
- Luke, what are you afraid of?
What I just saw in the hall.
- Is there something?
- You mean you haven't seen it?
The show's just getting good. Come on.
Right here.
It's writing?
Writing.
Chalk.
Or something like chalk.
- Can you read it?
- No.
What?
No.
Wipe it off, please. It's crazy.
Crazy is the word for it, all right.
- Get something and wipe it off, Luke.
- But it's crazy. Why?
Why all the fuss?
It spelled her name right, didn't it?
- Those letters spelled out my name.
- Take it easy.
It's my name!
It belongs to me and something is using it.
Writing it and calling me with my own name!
- Just because your name...
- That's it!
It knows my name, doesn't it?
- It knows my name!
- Simmer down, Nell.
It could have said any of us.
It knows all our names.
Did you write it? Please tell me.
I won't be angry or anything.
I just want to know so that...
Maybe it was only for a joke to frighten me.
You know none of us wrote it, baby.
- She's lying, I could swear she did it.
- Easy.
I clear breakfast at 10:00.
- Why should I write your name?
- I set lunch at 1:00.
Because I didn't wait to have breakfast with you.
- You're way out.
- You don't know Theo as I'm beginning to.
- I clear up at 10:00.
- Mrs. Dudley, please!
- No one blames you for being upset.
- It's 10:00.
Why me? Why should I be the one chosen?
Maybe something in the house finds you a kindred spirit.
Maybe it thinks you have more understanding and sympathy than we do.
Maybe you wrote it yourself.
Sure, I'm just the kind to want to see my name...
- scribbled all over this foul house!
- It's one way to attract attention, isn't it?
You think I like the idea
I'm the center of attention?
Why are you all done up in that new hairstyle?
- You were the one who suggested...
- That's enough.
How dare you?
Can't you see Theo's just trying to get a rise out of you... so you won't be frightened anymore?
I'm sorry.
Take Eleanor to her room.
We'll postpone the tour of the house.
Okay, but don't forget.
I don't want to spend another night... wondering what's over my head or underneath me.
You wouldn't leave me behind, would you?
No one will leave you behind.
Holy cow! Mount Rushmore!
- It's not there. I don't believe it's there.
- How?
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
It's supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers.
I'd say it's a family portrait.
A composite.
The tall, draped, masculine type... that's old Hugh Crain... pointing out all the great treasures in this creepy house he built.
The dame on the end down there and this one must be his two wives.
His daughter, Abigail.
- Now the dog...
- The dog you were chasing last night.
Yeah, very good.
Now that one, she's got to be the companion.
The one who's supposed to have murdered Abigail.
No, that was much later.
When Abigail was an old lady.
I wonder how this statue got here.
It wasn't on the original inventory.
Maybe I'll break it up and sell it for tombstones.
The companion reminds me of you, Nell.
Oh, no!
She does at that.
A natural beauty, I'd call her.
What does he think of me, really?
Am I being a fool?
Don't let me know too surely what he thinks of me.
This could be a family portrait of us.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You're the companion.
I'm Abigail, grown up.
And Markway could be old Hugh.
- Where do I fit in?
- The dog.
When are you going to show me your ESP?
Keep your hands to yourself.
What's going on?
More than meets the eye.
You know, this wouldn't be such a bad room without the statue.
Ideal for the zombies' annual ball.
Why don't you dance with Hugh?
I believe he has his eye on you.
- That's not funny.
- Don't be chicken.
- Leave her alone.
- I bet she doesn't know how to dance.
I do, too.
Hugh Crain, will you dance with me?
I believe he's going to accept.
- He moved.
- Of course.
Haven't you noticed how nothing in the house moves till you look away... and then you just catch something out of the corner of your eye?
She stepped on my toe.
Let's go out this way before somebody gets hurt.
Come over here, I want to show you something really unique.
A library complete with ivory tower.
I can't go in there.
- My mother...
- Yes?
That smell...
- It's just stale air, Eleanor.
- No, that other smell... Awful.
Smells sweet to me, honey.
At 25 cents a book,
I should do all right with this room.
I don't think I'll do much reading while I'm here.
- Not if the books smell like the library.
- I didn't notice it.
No, that's good, Eleanor.
It's just what we're after.
Try and remember your reaction and describe it exactly...
- when you write your notes tonight.
- That's what I'm here for.
Only, do you mind if I skip the library for now?
No, do just what you want.
We'll only be a minute.
- You're sure you're all right?
- Yes.
I want to show you something really interesting.
You remember that companion, the one that Abigail had... when she was an old lady?
See that little balcony... clear up at the top there, right up there in the shadows?
That's where the companion hanged herself.
- It would have been easier to jump.
- Without a parachute?
They say she tied the rope on to the railing and then...
Thanks, we get it.
I just had a great idea.
You know what I'll do with this room?
After I inherit the house, of course.
I'll turn it into a nightclub.
Tear out these bookshelves and put a band in there.
Now comes the best part.
A line of beautiful chorus girls dancing down these stairs.
Can't you see it?
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
- Quick thinking.
- Instinct.
My strong instinct for self-preservation.
And it's telling me right now loud and clear to get the hell out of here.
Vile. Hideous.
I wonder what it would be like looking down from there.
That's where she did it.
From that window.
Climbing out through the bars...
hanging on for an instant, hanging on...
Eleanor, you'll fall!
Didn't you hear me calling?
This house, you have to watch it every minute.
I didn't realize you were so nervous.
I think I should send you home.
- No, please, I can't go home.
- It's no reflection on you.
An atmosphere like this might break anyone down.
But I'm not breaking down.
I did hear noises last night.
Something was trying to get into the room.
You realize that if even one event is proved to be a hallucination... then this whole experiment will be questioned.
I'm not crazy, you know.
After all, Theo was there, too.
Is it my fault it just didn't make sense?
We'll let it go for now.
- Maybe I'm just being selfish.
- Selfish?
Keeping you here for the sake of the experiment.
Of course, for the sake of the experiment.
You do seem to be the main attraction... for whatever's in the house.
- But I'll send you back the minute...
- No, please. I'm all right. Really I am.
Well, don't you two look cozy.
She was halfway off the verandah when I caught her.
I was leaning back to see the top of the tower.
- I got dizzy.
- Dizzy like a fox?
Poor Nell.
You look like death. Let's go inside.
I think you'd better move in with Eleanor.
- You're the doctor.
- But that's my room, my very own room.
I wouldn't want to risk either of you spending another night alone.
Don't get all hung up, Nell.
We'll have fun. Like sisters.
- It tickles.
- Of course.
Your toes are tickled pink.
I knew my shade would suit you perfectly.
Have another drink.
It will keep the chill out.
Just a teensy one. To keep the chill out.
- I don't really like whisky.
- This is brandy.
By the time I'm through with you, Nell, you'll be a different person.
It's wicked.
I mean, on my foot.
You've got foolishness and wickedness mixed up.
Maybe.
Haven't had much chance to learn the difference.
Know something?
Even when I'd play solitaire in my room... she'd bang on the wall and make me feel guilty... for leaving her alone just that little bit.
- She'd always...
- Your mother?
My mother...
Story of my dull life.
What's your apartment like?
It's an old place we furnished ourselves from stuff we picked up in the junk shops.
We both love fixing over old things.
Like me.
You married?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm stupid and wicked and untrustworthy...
- and not good for anything at all.
- I don't think so.
Maybe just a little tight at the moment.
Tell me something about where you live.
I haven't had it long enough to believe it's my own.
It's a little apartment.
Smaller than yours, I'm sure.
I live alone. I'm still furnishing it.
Buying one thing at a time to make sure I get everything right.
Took me two weeks to find the little stone lions I keep on the mantel.
Brush their teeth every night.
I've got a hunch I better get you back to your apartment as fast as I can.
- Don't say that.
- I only mean...
Why do you all pick on me?
Am I the public dump or something for everybody's fear?
I don't want to leave Hill House ever.
I've been waiting all my life for something like this to happen.
Hey, everybody, come here.
I've found something.
What's wrong with you, Doc?
Stand there, go on.
You, too, girls. Stand there.
A genuine cold spot.
I guarantee it won't register on any thermometer.
Bunk. It's just a draft, that's all.
- Coming from somewhere.
- A draft? In Hill House?
Not unless you can make one of the doors stay open.
No, I found it. The heart of Hill House.
You mean where we're standing?
Behind these doors.
- What's in there?
- The nursery.
Abigail Crain grew up and died there.
- Just the place to chill our beer.
- No, don't go in there.
We'll keep the lid on the pressure cooker a while longer, then.
Now don't give me that, Doc.
It's like the doorway to a tomb.
Bless you.
Now, that's enough, girls.
You'd better run along to bed before you catch cold.
Yes, teacher. Bless you.
Come on.
No. There's got to be a draft.
The floor's solid.
Look, Doc, don't give me any of that supernatural jazz.
This is something I can feel. And see.
Maybe there's a pipeline to the North Pole.
Why won't you accept it for what it is:
A supernatural phenomenon?
You knock on wood, don't you?
Yeah, what's that got to do with it?
It shows that even you, despite yourself... feel that there are forces beyond nature able to help or hurt us.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that belief in a superstition... is the same thing as believing in the supernatural?
It's food for thought.
Frozen food for thought.
You know what I think?
Markway has us all so edgy, we're getting the cold sweats.
The temperature needn't drop to make you feel like that.
That's right.
Music gives me goose bumps.
Still, there was that awful smell in the library.
Here we go again. You know very well... what you thought you smelled in the library. The sickroom smell.
Let's discuss me some other time.
I'm tired.
- Turn out the light.
- I'd like it on. Have you seen this?
I told you. I just want to go to sleep.
Good night!
Why be mad at me?
I don't think you killed your mother.
Leave me alone.
Go to sleep!
Good night, Nellie my Nell.
Are you awake?
Don't say a word, Theo. Not a word.
Don't let it know you're in my room.
Hold my hand.
And for God's sake, don't scream.
Is it over? Do you think it's over?
You're breaking my hand.
This is monstrous. This is cruel.
It is hurting a child and I will not let anyone...
anything hurt a child.
I won't endure this. It thinks to scare me.
It has, and poor Theo, too.
Honestly, it feels like she's breaking my hand.
I will take a lot from this filthy house for his sake...
but I will not go along with hurting a child. No, I will not.
I will get my mouth to open right now, and I will yell.
Stop it!
What, Nell?
Oh, God!
Whose hand was I holding?
- Eleanor, too bad. You just missed it.
- What?
The Hill House Concerto for Harp.
Were you playing the harp?
It was playing itself.
Naturally. How do you explain it?
Subterranean waters? Earth tremors?
As a matter of fact,
I don't think it is anything supernatural.
The self-starting music.
More likely it's in the realm of the preternatural.
Something we don't have any natural explanation for right now... but probably will have some day.
The preternatural of one generation becomes the natural of the next.
Not so long ago, scientists laughed at the idea of magnetic attraction.
They couldn't explain it, so they refused to admit it existed.
Life is still full of the preternatural.
My mother...
Go on. Say it.
You've been trying to since you got here.
I don't know what I was going to say.
I'm still so terrified from last night.
You shouldn't be.
It's silly to be frightened.
You haven't been through it.
This horrible unknown thing.
Unknown. That's the key word.
When we get involved in a supernatural event... we're scared out of our wits just because it's unknown.
The night cry of a child.
Face on the wall, knockings, bangings.
What's there to be afraid of?
You weren't threatened. It was harmless, like a joke that didn't come off.
- But the child...
- There was no child.
- Just a voice.
- Worse.
Look, let me put it this way.
When people believed the Earth was flat... the idea of a round world scared them silly.
Then they found out how the round world works.
It's the same with the world of the supernatural.
Until we know how it works... we'll continue to carry around this unnecessary burden of fear.
Supposing it is in my imagination... the knocking, the voices, everything.
Every cursed bit of the haunting.
Suppose the haunting is all in my mind.
You can't say that because there are three other people here.
We all resist the idea... that what ran through the garden the first night was a ghost... what banged on the door was a ghost, what held your hand was a ghost.
But there's certainly something going on in Hill House.
We're getting close, Eleanor, very close to finding out what it is.
I could say all three of you are in my imagination. None of this is real.
Sure. That's the easiest way to dismiss the supernatural... by pleading insanity or accusing others of it.
Maybe I am insane.
The night my mother died... she knocked on the wall.
And I didn't come.
Eleven years of looking in on her after every small noise.
That night... my back hurt and my hands.
It wasn't fair.
We could've afforded a laundress.
I ought to have brought her the medicine.
I always did before.
This time... she called me... and I never answered.
- Is that how a normal person acts?
- Yes.
You were tired and disgusted. 11 years!
You're human.
Stop trying to be either a saint or a martyr.
You probably like thinking it was your fault.
My sister says I wanted Mother to die.
I've wondered ever since if I didn't wake up in the night... and hear her just go back to sleep.
It would have been easy.
- I've wondered about it.
- No, you're not capable of that.
You're a fine person, Eleanor.
Sensitive and honest and thoroughly good.
- Do you really think so, John?
- I do indeed.
Goose bumps.
There isn't by any chance a cold spot in this room, too, is there?
No, there isn't.
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."
All I want is to be cherished.
And here we are listening to that ridiculous harp.
"Lust. Daughter, preserve thyself.
"Hold apart from this world, that its lust corrupt thee not.
"Could you but hear for a moment the agony...
"the screaming..."
Oh, now, get this, congregation.
"...the dreadful crying out of the lustful...
"damned for eternity in everlasting flame!"
- What have you got there?
- I found it in the library.
He made it himself.
Look.
"Memories for Abigail Lester Crain:
"A legacy for her education and enlightenment.
"From her devoted father,
Hugh Desmond Lester Crain...
"Hill House, October 21, 1873."
- But that's today.
- Tomorrow and 90 years later.
Some nursery book, huh?
"Honor the authors of thy being, daughter.
"Thy father and thy mother."
Just the thing to give a child at bedtime.
No family should be without one.
I can see him now spitting out the words so they take root in her little mind.
Hugh Crain, you were a dirty man and you made a dirty house.
If you can hear me,
I'm telling you to your face...
I hope you spend eternity in that foul, rotten book... and never stop burning for a minute.
- Don't be a bore, Nell. Sit down and we'll...
- Leave me alone.
You are a bore.
I've got it. I'll tear out the pictures... and send them as Christmas cards to my New England relatives.
I think it's funny. "Dear Uncle Ned:
Merry Christmas, may your soul..."
Close that book.
It's enough to set anyone's nerves on edge.
It's not the book that's making our Nell nervous.
She's worried about her apartment.
I didn't know.
Is there anything I can do to help?
She thinks she's being funny.
Tell me, Dr. Markway, are you fond of stone lions...
- the kind you keep on the mantel?
- Shut up, Theo.
Do you long for a tiny home, something smaller than Hill House?
There's room for two, isn't there, Nell?
You're a monster, Theo.
You're the monster of Hill House.
- You'd better go with her.
- Wouldn't you rather?
I said go with her.
She shouldn't be left in that room alone.
Here you are. Okay, Isolde.
- Tristan wants you inside.
- Leave me alone.
Stop trying to be the center of attention.
- Come inside.
- You revolt me.
Can't you take a joke?
I didn't know you were serious about Markway.
Of course you did.
But he shouldn't be allowed to get away with it.
Get away with what?
- You're making a fool of yourself over him.
- Suppose I'm not, though.
You'd mind terribly if you turned out to be wrong for once.
- You poor stupid innocent.
- I'd rather be innocent than like you.
Meaning what?
Now who's being stupid and innocent?
- You know perfectly well what I mean.
- Is this one of your crazy hallucinations?
- I'm not crazy.
- Crazy as a loon.
You expect me to believe you're sane and the rest of the world is mad?
Why not?
The world is full of inconsistencies.
Unnatural things. "Nature's mistakes," they're called. You, for instance.
A reporter's been telephoning all day.
He's on your track.
- He's heard about you renting this place.
- How?
The Dudleys, I bet.
They must've blabbed in town.
Come back with me now, please.
If they find out why you're here, the papers'll have a field day.
Who are you?
Grace Markway.
Didn't John tell you he's married?
- I tried to warn you.
- Welcome to our party.
Who are you?
We're researchers in the field of psychic phenomena.
Please go.
You couldn't have arrived at a worse time.
Stop this insanity, John, and come back with me.
I can't. Not now.
I'm convinced we're on the verge of a breakthrough.
Here you are, driver, that'll be all.
But I had to come. I had to.
I've waited such a long time.
I've earned my happiness.
I was afraid this would be your attitude.
I'm not leaving here until you've got sense enough to leave with me.
I hope no one minds if I join the ghost hunt.
All right, I'll put your things in my room.
I'll be very disappointed if I don't see a ghost.
Hadn't you better put me in the ghastly dungeon... or the mysterious secret chamber?
There are no dungeons, no secret chambers in Hill House.
In fact, nothing romantic at all.
It's a deadly serious place.
- Not even a treasure buried in the cellar?
- There's the nursery.
Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.
You must listen to me.
Certain things have happened here.
You may not believe in the supernatural, but these are physical facts.
Mrs. Markway, please...
Don't sleep in the nursery.
I didn't realize what I was saying.
You insult my intelligence.
You don't think I'd believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me.
Even so, you shouldn't sleep in that room.
It hasn't been opened since we've been here.
I agree with you about the spook bit,
Mrs. M, but it's true, the air might be bad.
Oh, poisonous.
I've just remembered. No problem.
I don't have the key to the nursery, and the Dudleys have gone for the night.
Incidentally, how'd you get through the gate?
Very supernatural. With a key.
Your Mrs. Dudley is quite human,
I assure you... and not at all averse to a $5 bill.
Hey, look.
From your expressions,
I gather that is the dreaded nursery.
And as for the bad air, it's quite the opposite.
There seems to be a draft.
Wait a minute, Doc.
This is ridiculous.
Nobody opened these doors.
That's right, Luke.
You're beginning to see the light.
I haven't seen a damn thing.
I just don't like the way it looks.
Now I know who your fiend of Hill House is.
The interior decorator.
Evidently Mrs. Dudley doesn't get in here very often.
Looks the same as the rest of the house to me.
It's no use, Grace. The air in here is stale.
I can take care of that.
Only one way to argue with a woman, Doc. Don't.
Good night.
My mother...
This room is the cold, rotten heart of the house.
Since you're so foolish, I'll stay with you.
But you're not to be in this room alone tonight.
I can't go on watching you waste your life on all this nonsense.
If there is such a thing as a haunted house, this is my chance to find out.
All right.
John, my bag.
At least leave the door open.
Don't worry.
I've brought a special ghost trap with me.
What if he does have a wife?
I still have a place in this house.
I belong. I want to stay here.
It's the only time anything's ever happened to me.
He can't make me leave, not if Hill House means me to stay.
Go away, Eleanor, we don't want you anymore, you can't stay.
But I can.
He doesn't make the rules around here.
Nell, I'm talking to you.
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter?
Didn't you hear Markway?
He doesn't want us to stay here.
He wants us to spend the night downstairs in the parlor.
Luke and he will take turns watching on this floor.
For Pete's sake, snap out of it.
- Why aren't you upstairs?
- I needed a drink.
- Grace.
- Wait a minute.
It's nowhere near the nursery, it's down here.
It seems to me we've been on this kick before.
Next vacation
I must really go somewhere else.
It knows my name.
This time it knows my name.
- I'll have to go out there.
- No!
- It hasn't hurt me. Why should it hurt her?
- She might try to do something about it.
Is it over, Theo? Is it?
No, I'm so cold.
It's going to start everything all over again.
It can't get in. Don't let it get in.
Oh, God, it knows I'm here.
Doc, I'll let you have the house cheap.
It will go on and on and come back again until it finds me.
On and on until it finds me.
It's at the nursery.
- You must be crazy!
- I'm going out there!
Not with that thing out there.
- We have to, Luke. She's there!
- Don't be crazy.
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.
I don't know what it is, but I don't want to find out...
I've got to get out of here.
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.
- No, don't.
- Cut it out!
I'll come.
Whatever it wants of me it can have.
The house is coming down around me.
The house is destroying itself.
It's in the nursery.
Mrs. Markway?
Please.
Grace, are you...
Where is she?
- Where is she? What did you see?
- Nothing.
She wasn't here.
- What happened?
- She's gone.
Where? How?
Good God!
Markway, if this is your idea of a joke... if living in a haunted house has done this to you...
We'll start here, then the whole house.
- Even if we have to tear the place apart.
- You can't do that.
If we don't find her, the police will be around.
I'm coming apart, a little at a time.
Now I know where I'm going.
I'm disappearing inch by inch into this house.
We killed her. You and I, Hugh Crain.
She must be around this house somewhere.
Maybe this whole thing is a bad joke.
- She isn't the kind who makes jokes.
- You find her, she's your wife.
I'm taking Nell and I'm clearing out of here.
Where is Eleanor?
I want to stay here.
I want to stay here always.
I will not be frightened or alone anymore.
Has anyone checked outside?
Please, Nell, where are you?
Here I am, inside.
It's not cold at all and the smell is gone.
I've broken the spell of Hill House.
I'm home.
No stone lions for me. I am home.
I will not look back...
because then they will know what I am thinking.
Eleanor, turn around and come down.
Now, be very, very careful.
Come down.
All that is gone and left behind.
Eleanor, for God's sake!
- Wait a minute. This thing will collapse...
- It can't possibly hold the both of you.
Just turn around, Eleanor.
Keep hold of the rail and start down slowly.
Stand still! Don't move!
Stand perfectly still!
Nell, do what they say, please!
I'm coming on the platform.
Now come along.
Are you sure, Eleanor?
It was Mrs. Markway.
Just before I fainted, I looked up, and there she was above the trap door.
What's more, she's still around.
I don't know who or what you really saw, Eleanor.
But whatever it was, we can't risk letting it happen again.
- That's why you're leaving now.
- But I can't leave now.
- I brought the car round front. She ready?
- She's all packed. Take her suitcase.
No, please, Luke, let me stay.
I'll help Mrs. Dudley.
All it will cost you is just my keep.
Sorry, honey, but you're not the type I keep.
- I can't leave, I tell you.
- I can't take any more chances.
I realize now what a terrible thing
I was asking of you all.
You're leaving as quickly as you can.
Then we'll find Grace or go to the police.
It isn't fair.
I'm the one who's supposed to stay here.
She's taken my place.
Don't worry.
Luke will see you get there safely.
- Get where?
- Why, home, of course.
Go back to your own little apartment where all your things are.
I haven't any home.
I made it up.
No apartment, no things...
Everything in all the world that belongs to me... is in that suitcase and a carton in my car.
So you see, there's no place you can send me.
I have to stay here.
You must have lived somewhere before.
- You had an address where I wrote you.
- My sister's.
I sleep on a couch in the living room.
I'd be much happier here.
I can't go back to my sister's.
Yes, you can, and immediately.
This is a mistake. Don't you understand?
The house wants me.
Mrs. Markway can't satisfy it.
No one else can.
Forget about this house as soon as you can.
No, please. I'm fine now. I'm not afraid.
I was happy here.
- I don't think Mrs. Markway will be.
- Put the bag in the car, Luke.
Nell is right. Grace is around somewhere.
- You see?
- Please, there's no time to waste.
Please, let me stay. I'm the only one who can call Mrs. Markway back.
I was wrong. I should have sent you home the first night.
This is the only time anything's ever happened to me.
I'm the one it really wants.
Can't you feel it? It's alive.
Watching... waiting...
Waiting for me.
I won't go away.
You will go away. Right now.
- No, come on.
- I'll drive. It's my car.
At least, half mine.
All right, let her.
I can't stand here arguing.
Thank you for rescuing me in the library.
That was wrong of me, I know, but I'm all right now, honestly.
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry, really.
Goodbye.
Let's get moving.
I thought you weren't going to say goodbye.
Nellie my Nell, be happy, please be happy.
Everything's going to be all right.
I'm sure Grace is here and we'll find her.
So don't worry.
She has my place. It isn't fair.
Goodbye, Eleanor.
I'll write you. Drive carefully.
Goodbye.
Who do I thank for a lovely time?
Oh, hold it. Markway!
The key.
- To the gate.
- Yes, of course.
What fools they are.
The house tricks them so easily.
Just by telling me to go away, they can't make me leave.
They can't shut me out.
Not if Hill House means me to stay.
- Eleanor.
- Wait.
So now I'm going.
But I won't go. Hill House belongs to me.
I knew it.
Hill House doesn't want me to go.
Stop it. Please. What are you doing?
Let go.
What are you doing?
Why don't they stop me?
Can't they see what is happening?
But it's happening to you, Eleanor.
Yes. Something at last is really...
really happening to me.
She's dead.
I didn't want any of this to happen.
You must believe me, John.
What were you doing? What happened?
That terrible house.
I woke up and I was frightened.
So I tried to find your room, but I got lost.
Almost as though the house were doing it on purpose.
And I ended up in the attic.
I was only trying to find a way out when I opened the trap door.
I wasn't trying to frighten her.
- Didn't you see me?
- No, but Eleanor did.
The shock of seeing you almost killed her.
She did kill her.
Seeing her is what made Eleanor lose control of the car.
No. She only saw me the very last instant.
The same time I saw her.
I don't even know how I got out here.
It wasn't your fault.
Eleanor did it to herself.
It looked to me, anyway, like she... deliberately aimed the car at this tree.
Where the first Mrs. Crain was also killed in an "accident."
Here's the mark.
There was something in the car with her,
I'm sure of it.
Call it what you like, but Hill House is haunted.
It didn't want her to leave, and her poor bedeviled mind... wasn't strong enough to fight it.
- Poor Eleanor.
- Maybe not "poor" Eleanor.
It was what she wanted, to stay here.
She had no place else to go.
The house belongs to her now, too.
Maybe she's happier.
You wait here, Grace.
I'll go and get your things and call the police.
No one must go in that house again.
Whatever is there might...
I'll be all right.
The house has what it wants... for a while.
It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.
Hill House has stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more.
Within, walls continue upright, bricks meet...
floors are firm, and doors are sensibly shut.
Silence lies steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House.
And we who walk here walk alone.
I wonder if everything will go well this time.
Each year I worry.
Each year everything has gone well.
When will I stop worrying?
Soon enough, I suppose.
The only advantage of being 79.
Once again, the Swedish academy of science has voted.
The Royal Caroline
Institute has voted.
The Swedish academy of letters has voted.
Once again, man bestows immortality on his fellow man.
Ladies and gentlemen, this year's winners of the Nobel prize.
The prize for literature went to the
American novelist Andrew Craig, the youngest man to be thus honored since Rudyard Kipling won the prize at the age of 42.
Mr. Craig is best known in Europe for his anti-fascist novel
"the imperfect state."
Dr. Max Stratman...
In chemistry, the prize went to the French husband-and-wife team.
Dr. Claude Marceau and Dr. Denise Marceau.
They achieved the prize for their researches into sperm structure and the vitrification of human reproductive cells.
In physics, the German-born physicist Dr. Max Stratman, now living in Atlanta, Georgia.
Dr. Stratman was awarded his prize for his research in the field of solar energy and the development of new rocket propellants.
In traditional ceremonies at concert hall, the king will present them with a gold medallion, a Nobel diploma, and a check for $50,000.
Dr. Claude et Denise Marceau de Paris...
Dr. Max Stratman...
For their work in overcoming the immunological barrier to organ transplantation in the human body,
Dr. John Garrett of the United States and Dr. Carlo Farelli of Italy were jointly awarded the Nobel prize in medicine.
Dr. Garrett's award is one of 3 Nobel prizes given this year to citizens of the United States.
The others are physicist Dr.
Max Stratman and novelist Andrew Craig.
The winners will arrive in Stockholm shortly before the ceremonies and stay at the grand hotel, which is the custom.
Oscar, Hilding, stop it at once!
Must I remind you again?
During Nobel week, nothing but English is to be spoken here.
But...
Even when you quarrel.
But it is my turn to deliver the trays, Mrs. Ahlquist.
Last year, it was his.
Gentlemen, please. You will both deliver the trays.
Both? Both?
One to carry, the other to assist.
I will carry.
No, I will.
You will alternate on each delivery.
Now don't let me hear another word about this, especially in Swedish.
Now which is first? Medicine, literature, chemistry, physics?
The way I feel, I am in the mood for medicine.
The way you sound, you should be in the mood for physics.
"The Nobel prize for medicine"
"is equally divided between Dr.
John Garrett of the United States"
"and Dr. Carlo Farelli of Italy."
Ja. So... ja. Dr. and Mrs.
John Garrett and children, suite 447.
Let's go, assistant.
Mrs. Garrett?
Yes?
With the best wishes of the management.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Well, can't you ask someone at the hospital for Dr. Oman's private number?
Right over there.
It's not in the book.
He must live in the suburb.
Ooh, can I have some?
Me, too!
I want this banana.
- I want this.
- I want it.
Be quiet. Be quiet.
Shh. Your father. Now get your hands off.
Amy, David.
Please. Please. Here.
No, thank you. Good night.
Good night. Thank you.
No, I am not ill, but it's important that I speak to Dr. Oman.
Why not? Because you had dinner.
Come to think of it,
I am getting ill.
You know what, madam?
I've just had an idea.
I'm going to hang up.
That's right. Good-bye.
Oh, we should never have left California.
Won't tomorrow be time enough?
You're exhausted.
I wanted to have the evidence on
Farelli before the press conference.
Are you so sure there is evidence?
What's a Farelli, mommy?
Stupid, he's the man that stole half of daddy's Nobel prize.
Aren't they supposed to be in bed?
Yes, yes. Come on.
Come on, now. Move. Bed.
♪ Farelli is a-smelly ♪
♪ Farelli is a-smelly ♪
No, no, no, mama.
Who is there, man or woman?
The waiter here, sir.
Dr. Farelli?
Uh-huh. In the flesh, as you can see.
Compliments of the grand hotel.
Oh. Magnifico. Come in. Come in.
Over there next to my mother, please, so she can stuff herself without moving.
Madame Farelli.
Madame Farelli.
Good night. Good night.
I thank you a thousand times.
Good-bye.
Just what I needed.
Ahh.
Ooh.
I suggest that you watch my performance with our Nobel prize winners in chemistry...
Dr. Claude Marceau and Dr. Denise Marceau.
There is much to be learned by observing me.
I agree. You should be placed under observation.
Good evening, doctor.
I did not order anything.
A gift of the management for you and your esteemed wife.
Ah.
Good evening, madame doctor.
Thank you, and the same to you.
Ahem. Do you have one of those for the young lady in the next room, my, uh... ahem... my secretary?
Miss Souvir? Oh, yes, doctor.
Not only the laureates but their guests as well receive every hospitality of the management.
Perhaps you would like to enclose a card, suitably inscribed.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good night.
Denise. Denise, must you in front of them?
If we're going to go through with this charade, let's at least have a few laughs along the way.
Did I know we are going to win the Nobel prize?
The least we can offer in return is a few days of dignity.
Dignity? It's disgraceful.
It's positively immoral, you and I living together in the same room this way.
We are husband and wife, aren't we?
Yes, but what will she think, hmm?
Come in, Cheri.
The door is open.
Oh. Bonsoir.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Oh, is that for me?
Who likes me so much?
The grand hotel, miss Souvir.
Oh, not you?
To the grand hotel.
Put it right there.
Is the champagne cold?
Perfect. Shall I open?
No, no. Too soon, too soon.
Merci beaucoup, gentlemen.
And you will leave the door open un tout petit peu? Like so, yes?
Good night.
Good night.
He did say secretary, didn't he?
Something must have been lost in the translation.
Oh?
Good evening. Miss Stratman?
Yes.
For Dr. Stratman and you from the management of the grand hotel.
Well, how kind of you.
I'll take it.
My uncle is resting.
Oh, are you sure you can handle it?
If I drop it, I'll call you, and we'll pick up the pieces together.
Very well.
Good night, miss Stratman.
Good night, and thank you.
Oh, I thought it was those people to take you out to the nightclubs.
Mr. and Mrs. Bergh aren't due for an hour.
And what are you doing out of bed?
Can you imagine putting my old body in this beautiful thing?
It's an insult to the tailor.
Emily, when the king shakes my hand, couldn't I just be wearing a sweater or something?
No. And if you don't lie down, uncle Max,
I'm not going to let you go out tonight on that secret rendezvous of yours.
Oh, secret nothing.
Just ashamed of old friends.
Oh, if only you weren't going out.
Well, what have we got here, liebchen?
Schnapps? Ha ha!
You'll crush it.
Oh, on purpose. I choose to keep myself from admitting
I just can't wait to wear it to the concert hall.
Well, good stuff.
Worthy of the double occasion...
Seeing you for the first time as a grown-up woman, and then this... this wonderful foolishness of your old uncle being called to Stockholm for the Nobel prize, like he was somebody important.
You're supposed to be resting.
Enough rest. If I don't take some schnapps quick,
I might wake up and the whole thing will turn out to be a dream.
It's no dream, uncle Max.
This is the suite of the Nobel prize winner for literature.
Mr. Andrew Craig, is it not?
Yes, it is. Set it down over there, please.
Don't go yet.
You will have to remove the bottles.
Remove them?
Champagne, beer, aquavit? Out.
But then Mr. Craig will have nothing to drink.
Exactly. Now please do as I say.
Begging your pardon, but who says?
Miss Andersen of the foreign office says.
In 30 minutes, Mr. Craig will be landing at the airport.
And here we are, playing games. Catch.
Ugh.
There he is.
You fly a very nice glider, miss Munsen.
Thank you, Mr. Craig.
You also mix a very civilized Martini.
Perhaps one too many for such a short flight?
Never deny a man his right to be unconscious.
I'm afraid they're waiting for you.
Yes, I'm afraid so, too.
Good-bye, miss Munsen.
Good-bye, Mr. Craig.
You know, watching you walk up and down that aisle tonight,
I feel as though I've known your legs all my life.
Ha ha ha! Now, you behave yourself in Stockholm.
Silly girl.
Can you smile, Mr. Craig?
Yes, if you say something funny.
Mr. Craig, I am count Bertil Jacobsson.
On behalf of the city of Stockholm,
I welcome you to Sweden.
Thank you very much, sir.
I'm very happy to be here,
I think.
This is Mr. Clark Wilson of your splendid embassy.
Ah, yes. Mr. Wilson.
Congratulations, Mr. Craig.
You've done us proud,
Americans everywhere.
Just one of those things.
Another picture, please, Mr. Craig.
I want to ask you a few questions, Mr.
Craig, please.
Wait a minute. Where were you fellows when I needed you, when my books were being published?
Mr. Steen Blickman of the Swedish academy.
Oh.
Honored, Mr. Craig, greatly honored.
Thank you very much.
Radio Sweden. A few words, Mr.
Craig, please.
Oh, yes. Well, I'm, uh...
I've always wanted to see Sweden.
I never thought
I'd be able to do so under such rewarding circumstances.
$50,000 reward, huh?
We were rather worried when you failed to arrive on the morning plane from Copenhagen.
Oh, yes. Well, I met this
Danish girl in Tivoli.
An old friend?
She is now.
Excuse me, count Jacobsson.
Why, certainly.
Mr. Craig, allow me to introduce myself.
I'm miss Inga Lisa Andersen of the Swedish foreign ministry, assigned to you for your stay here in Stockholm.
Hello.
Hello. I have a car waiting outside.
Will you follow me, please? Excuse me.
Things are looking up.
Mr. Craig, a few more words, please.
And immediately afterwards, there will be a tour of the city.
Am I keeping you awake?
Just barely. That's all right.
Go ahead. Keep going.
This can wait.
Don't go away mad, miss Andersen.
I'm rude to everyone.
I know that, Mr. Craig.
Before taking this assignment,
I tried to make myself an authority on my subject.
Well, just how much do you know?
Your lack of regard for the Nobel prize, your threat to turn it down, your decision to come to Stockholm only because $50,000... how did you put it in "time" magazine?
"Ain't hay"?
That's right. "Ain't hay."
Yes, I think you have caught the outer man, miss Andersen, but bear in mind that 9/10 of the iceberg is generally hidden from view.
And in your case, it happens to be ice cubes.
Well, we have been doing our homework.
Thank you.
What do you plan to do about these ice cubes?
Nothing. Just hope and pray.
We'll do our best.
We certainly will.
How come you instead of some aging male diplomat?
You're unattached and alone, and there are social functions to attend, and we felt it would be happier for you this way.
That's thoughtful of the
Swedish government, but aren't they a little concerned about you?
Oh, you mean your reputation with women?
Something like that.
Mr. Craig, I hope you'll forgive me, but in matters of sex, compared to the average Scandinavian, you would be considered a mere amateur.
Miss Andersen, will you marry me?
We have a saying in Sweden.
Why settle for one dish when there's smorgasbord?
Ahem.
Nice little place you have here.
Your suite faces the Royal
Palace across the water.
I hope you find everything satisfactory.
If the king promises not to watch.
What's on the agenda for you and me tonight?
You have a formal press conference at 11:00 tomorrow morning,
Oh, this is Mr. Andrew Craig from the United States.
Mr. Lindquist will anticipate your every need.
Welcome to grand hotel, Mr.
Craig.
Thank you very much.
Would you excuse me for a moment, please?
Oh, yes.
Professor Stratman.
You will mail this for me, please.
Certainly.
Shouldn't one Nobel prize winner know another?
Mr. Andrew Craig of literature,
Dr. Max Stratman of physics.
Oh. Ah.
Doctor.
So this is the young man who has done so many fine things with words.
If you please.
Oh. Just a minute.
Thank you.
I have been looking forward to meeting you, Mr. Andrew Craig.
And I, too, doctor.
Congratulations, of course.
Yes, but do you really mean of course?
You and I will have to have a little talk.
We will?
While I admire the words that you've written,
I cannot say the same for what you've spoken to the newspapers back home about the Nobel prize, how it means nothing to you but money.
Now, is that enough respect for Mr. Nobel and the wonderful united states of America?
Tomorrow, perhaps some schnapps and conversation, ja?
If you promise not to spank me.
I make no promises.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow. Thank you.
Tell me, what do, uh, people around here do at night?
Well, we have the Royal Opera, the Royal Dramatic Theater...
No, no, no. Something a tiny bit more vulgar than that...
You know, dancing, music, beverages with a slight alcoholic content.
I see.
A little, uh, local color floating about.
Local color.
Always adds interest to a place.
Let's see. We have the...
The golden crown in the old town.
No, the golden crown would not do.
Ahem. Why not?
Too many young girls with the wrong ideas.
Awful. Yes.
Glad you warned me.
So you'll remember to forget it.
Very kind of you.
Always glad to be of service.
Everything seems to be in order.
Now, you will be ready to meet the press tomorrow morning?
Oh, absolutely. I'm going straight to sleep.
You wouldn't care to help me turn down my bed covers, would you?
I'm afraid I have no skill as a chambermaid.
Nobody's perfect.
Except during Nobel week.
Yes, Mr. Craig?
Yes, miss Andersen.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'll have the hall
Porter make the reservations.
Wasn't that Andrew Craig, the Nobel laureate in literature?
Unfortunately.
Oh, now, Rolf.
Stockholm during Nobel week is a China shop with no place for bulls.
Have you read any of his books?
We work for the foreign office, miss Stratman, not the Swedish academy of letters.
Well, I think he's marvelous.
Uncle Max.
I thought that you were off to your meeting.
Oh, well, some people it gives me a pleasure to keep waiting.
I'm glad. Now I can kiss you good-bye again.
What is this good-bye business?
Aren't you planning to come back tonight?
Not if Mr. and Mrs. Bergh keep their promise and take me to every nightclub
I should see in Stockholm.
And some she shouldn't see, too.
Ja.
I've given Mr. Bergh a list.
Everything from the ambassador to the golden crown.
What can he do? He promised.
Well, enjoy, enjoy. Good night.
Good night.
Max.
Max.
My old friend Max.
So we meet again, Eckhart.
I flew in this morning just to see you.
I should be honored.
Instead, my stomach hurts.
We'll fix that.
I know a place where the food is warm and the beer is cold.
No. We will walk. I have no wish to be seen with you.
Well, walking is good for the soul, I admit.
You read my note.
And threw it away.
Were my congratulations not welcome?
I told myself,
"I will not answer him."
"I will not meet him."
But you came.
An old man's pride which says,
"can a man be worthy of the Nobel prize
"and not be able to handle two minutes of conversation with a former colleague?"
Two minutes only?
So commence.
Your country needs you, Max.
My country is the united states of America.
I have it in writing.
We'll say my country, then.
Which belongs to others.
We want you with us.
Now, please...
I am authorized to offer you the highest position, complete autonomy, 3 times the money you earn in America.
Now, I've heard enough.
To work for us is to give strength to the cause of peace throughout the world. Peace?
Peace, you say?
Is there no love for the fatherland left in you?
Strangely enough, more than is left in you and your kind.
Now, listen to me.
I am ordered to say this.
Starting tomorrow when you talk to the press, you will begin to prepare the world for your voluntary defection to your homeland.
You will indicate there are warmongering uses to which America puts its men of science.
And then at concert hall, you will make the gesture that dramatizes your disapproval of the work you have done for the imperialists.
This gesture, Eckhart...
Draw me a diagram.
It will be necessary for you to renounce the Nobel prize.
For this they've sent you to Stockholm.
For this nonsense you've brought me out here in the middle of the night.
In a matter as important as this,
I couldn't sleep well unless I made at least one serious attempt to persuade you before severer measures are taken.
So now you can sleep well.
What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Skool.
Ja. Skool.
I've been wearing you out tonight, haven't I, Mr. Bergh?
Not at all, miss Stratman.
I always yawn deliberately after the third smoke-filled cabaret.
It helps the breathing, you know.
Oh, Rolf.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Swedish.
He doesn't speak English.
He's inviting you to dance with him.
I'd be delighted.
Is it all right?
- Ja.
- No.
Ivar Cramer.
Emily.
I told him he gets one dance.
Bye.
Uh!
Put it on my check.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I think we should go now.
But... guess what.
I've just met some dear friends from London on the other side of the room, and they've asked me to join them.
Do you mind?
Not at all. Good night, miss Stratman.
Come along, Sylvia.
Thank you so much for everything.
I really enjoyed being here.
Good night, dear.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I was only looking.
If you don't want people to look, you should cover her with a burlap bag or something.
Hello.
Stay out of this.
On second thought, she'd look great in a burlap bag.
There's only one way to settle this.
Let's step outside.
Me and the girl.
Hey!
Go away. Shoo. Shoo.
What is this?
Red cross rescue service or something?
Could crawl.
Well, I'll sit down, then.
My name is Smith.
I'm an American tourist, and I am slightly tiddly.
I never would have guessed.
Hey, shall I give you my money now, or would you rather roll me later?
You have just given me an idea.
Oh. Drink?
No, thanks.
You speak very good English for a nondrinker, miss...
Greta Garbo.
Mind if I call you Ingrid?
Not at all.
Yeah.
Why don't we get out of this crowded place?
What's the matter?
Don't you like crowds?
There are some things that should only be done in private,
Mr., uh, Smith.
Yeah.
And we wouldn't want to do anything conspicuous, would we, Mr. Smith?
How old are you?
Why?
I don't know.
I mean, most of the girls in this place are...
You look as though you ought to be in bed.
I accept.
Who's your sick friend?
Say, are we really going where I think we're going?
To your hotel, of course.
Oh, incredible country, Sweden.
What's so incredible about it?
Well, I don't know. It's just so chock-full of surprises.
You think this is something?
Wait till we get to the hotel.
Shouldn't we, um, go up separately?
Oh, it's all right.
They know me here.
Have you got your key?
I never make a move without it.
You Americans are so clever.
The only trouble is, I haven't done anything to deserve this.
Oh, yes, you have.
Funny thing. Everybody tells me that I look like, uh,
Andrew Craig, the fam...
Is not that door, and is not that door.
It is...
This door.
Wrong door.
Uh-uh. Right door.
Uh-uh.
Wrong door.
Uh-uh.
Right door.
Sleep tight, Mr. Andrew Craig.
Andrew Craig.
I'm Dr. Stratman's niece Emily.
You can thank me in the morning.
Oy, oy, oy.
Who was that?
Andrew Craig, my good deed for tonight.
Success.
Success.
We will have it.
Ivar said everything went all right.
Perfectly.
Now, you must stop worrying, Emily.
I know.
I command it.
What time is it?
10 minutes past 12:00.
Wrong. You can't read the dial without your glasses.
Smart girl.
Sorry.
Nothing closer than 6 feet.
Fine.
Madame Marceau, may I raise a point that might seem a trifle irreverent?
If the point is not too sharp.
Considering that you and your husband achieved the Nobel prize through your work in the preservation of human reproductive cells, isn't it a bit ironic that you and Dr.
Marceau have never had any children?
Ironic, no. Explainable, yes.
I fail to see what this has to do...
My husband and I have worked so long together as a scientific team that perhaps we may have come to see each other only as gray matter,
I myself have not yet learned to cope with the situation, but I think my husband has made a rather successful adjustment.
Would you care to read that back to me, miss Souvir?
I'm sorry. I did not get it.
Oh. I was so sure you would.
Perhaps you'd like to say something, Claude.
No. I think you've said enough already.
And now please forgive us.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Where's your sleeping beauty?
I'm trying, but...
Why don't you go up and get him?
Together at any time or correspond with each other?
I'll answer that. We did not work together at all.
I knew nothing whatever of Dr. Farelli's research, and I must assume that he knew nothing of mine.
Only one other man knew of my techniques...
There were long nights of lonely battle,
I in the Istituto Superiore di Sanità in Rome while unknown to me, my admirable colleague Dr. Garrett was pursuing his victory in far-off Pasadena, California, each of us using the same methods of trial and error.
Dr. Farelli is too kind when he gives me credit for using his methods.
I crawled from "a" to "b" to "cc" while he was leapfrogging from "a" to nz" without making a single experiment in between.
Well, in Rome one does as the romans do...
Improvise.
Dr. Garrett, a moment ago, you said that another man knew of your work.
Yes. Dr. Eric Oman, a prominent surgeon right here in Stockholm.
3 years ago, when I learned that he was doing work in the field of heart transplants,
I corresponded with him, and I offered him all of my findings, in the strictest of confidence, of course.
One of the reasons that I am happy to be in Stockholm now is that I will have the pleasure of meeting Dr. Oman face to face, a pleasure which I believe you had last year, Dr. Farelli.
Mm-hmm. In Geneva, yes.
Regrettably, there was not time for more than a brief meeting between us.
I'm sure.
Come in.
Set it down. I'll have it in a moment.
Suppose it doesn't want to be had.
Can I interest you in leaving immediately?
You wouldn't have some ham and eggs in that handbag, would you?
There's coffee at the press conference.
Mmm. The condemned man ate a hearty nothing.
Tell me, why all this fear of the press?
Because it is time, methinks, to let them in on a few secrets that I've been living with for much too long.
What sort of secrets?
I'm a slow writer.
I'd say you work rather fast.
Miss Stratman did all the work.
1 just supervised.
Interbreeding of Nobel prize winners or their families while guests of the Swedish government is not something we encourage, Mr. Craig.
To tell the truth, she didn't lay a glove on me.
I'd like to be able to believe that.
Why?
I find honesty irresistible in a man.
Stick around.
What are you planning to do?
Be irresistible.
Except for reading everywhere that you have found a way to harness the rays of the sun,
I have been unable to learn precisely what you have done.
I have asked the Royal
Swedish Academy of Science, and they cannot or will not tell me.
Well, they cannot tell you because they have been so instructed by the United States government in the name of so-called national security.
I seem to get the impression that you're not completely in accord with the Washington authorities.
Well, secrecy is becoming a way of life in this world, an attitude which is excused by using the word "survival."
It is an unhappy condition for the scientist.
But secrecy was not the invention of the United States.
If it weren't for the policy of the iron curtain...
Excuse me, please.
I will answer questions about science or myself, and that is all.
And again I must remind the photographers there are to be no pictures without permission.
Dr. Stratman, it is a matter of curiosity to many of us why you remained in Germany and continued your work there during the second world war when so many others left the country or escaped.
I do not know of the circumstances of the others.
I can only answer for my own.
Those dearest to me were in concentration camps...
My poor wife, my brother
Walter, his family...
And so long as I cooperated, they were kept alive, but unfortunately, despite my efforts, only my niece Emily survived.
I trust this satisfies your curiosity.
Is it not a fact that you were kidnapped by American army in Berlin at the end of the war and taken to the united states at gunpoint and forced to work for the
American imperialists?
No comment.
All it takes is a simple "no" for an answer, professor.
Let me end this interview by saying that a scientist always prefers to carry on his work where he can feel that his accomplishments will not be perverted to the exploitation of mankind.
This has been weighing heavily on my mind of late.
Exactly what do you mean?
Now I must thank you all for your attention.
Good day.
Perhaps the strain was on the other foot.
Allow me to introduce our Nobel prize winner for literature...
Mr. Andrew Craig.
This is Dr. Stratman.
It's all right. We've al...
I am pleased to meet you, Mr. Craig.
I had believed you to be a much older man to have such knowledge.
Apparently you don't recall our meeting last night, doctor.
How are you feeling today, Mr. Craig?
Fine. Oh, I mean fine, fine, yes, thanks to you.
You and my uncle Max have met before?
Yes, although it seems that...
Mr. Craig, they're waiting for you.
Oh, excuse me.
I hope you'll bear in mind this is the world press.
Courage.
Come, liebchen.
I would like to stay and listen to Mr.
Craig a while.
Wouldn't you?
All right.
Please.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Andrew Craig of the United States.
Mr. Craig.
Ladies, gentlemen, fire away.
Yes. Mr. Craig, please, what was your first reaction when you received the news of your Nobel prize?
Uh, no reaction at all.
I was dead drunk at the time.
Well, you seem perfectly sober right now, so may I ask you, how does it feel to be in the company of William Faulkner, Albert
Camus, and Ernest Hemingway?
I'll answer that with a question: Why me?
I haven't had a book out in 5 years.
But that has little bearing on your body of work...
6 superlative novels.
Not one of which sold enough copies to stick in your left eye.
Do you find that alcohol stimulates your creative imagination?
Not at all. It just happens to be necessary.
Why necessary?
Oh, I don't know. I suppose it's because I'm a sorehead.
I'm sore at myself for not being able to interest the reading public, and I'm sore at your Swedish academy for forcing me to stand up before the world and die in public when I was doing such a damn good job of it in private.
But, Mr. Craig, what about "return to Carthage," the book that you've been writing for the past 6 years?
There is no
"return to Carthage."
It's all a fiction designed by me to conceal the fact that I just ain't got it anymore.
Fritz.
Well, if your books haven't sold and you haven't written anything for several years, how have you been earning a living?
Are you sure you'd like to know?
Ja, please.
Detective stories.
Detective stories?
Yes. I've been keeping myself well-dressed, well-fed, and well-oiled by grinding out detective stories...
Mystery novels, private eyewash, all under a pseudonym.
Ah. Don't ask me what the other name is.
I won't tell you.
Somebody from the Swedish academy might read one of those books, and they would take back the $50,000.
You'll forgive my saying so, sir, but I feel it hard to believe that the Andrew Craig who wrote "The walls of Croyden" and "the imperfect state" is even capable of doing what you have just described to us here.
Well, let's just say that I have a nose for sniffing out the mysterioso in life, for finding devious plots in everything that I observe.
I don't suppose you'd care to give us a demonstration of this, uh, nose?
Well, it is rather short-order cooking.
How about this one?
Nobody steal it. I may want to use it sometime.
Nobel prize winner comes to Stockholm.
He's wined, dined, interviewed, and awarded, and all the time, what nobody knows is that he's an impostor.
An impostor?
Yes. Sent here by the real prize winner so that he can slip off to a secret weekend of joy in Acapulco.
Preposterous.
Why?
How do you know that I'm really Andrew Craig and not some gate-crasher?
What? Because I look like his photographs?
Have any of you ever seen me before I arrived in Stockholm last night?
Maybe Dr. Stratman over there is really Dr.
Marceau with a beard and, uh, Dr. Marceau is really his wife's hairdresser.
Thank you very much for the demonstration, Mr. Craig.
Not at all.
I think we've taken enough of Mr.
Craig's time for now, ladies and gentlemen.
This press conference is adjourned.
Angry?
I could be discharged for saying it.
Impressed.
Then there's more where that came from.
I suggest you save it for a rainy day.
Night.
Oh, Mr. Craig.
Could I talk to you for a moment?
There, you see? Not all is lost.
Someone still wants to talk to me.
Miss Stratman, this is miss
Andersen of the foreign ministry.
How do you do, miss Andersen?
Miss Stratman.
Miss Andersen is officially in charge of me during my stay in Stockholm.
What a delightful assignment.
And thank you for handling it for me last night.
Anytime, miss Andersen.
Why don't we all have lunch or something?
I must go now, and please don't forget the reception at count
Jacobsson's villa starts at 7:00.
Don't run.
I'll pick you up at 6:30.
Here's my card.
Office number and home number, in case you need me.
Good day.
Well, I don't think
I like you either.
Hmm. This just isn't my day.
Where can we talk?
There must be a bar somewhere in the hotel.
Well, if there isn't, you'll invent it.
Thank you.
You can start working on another one of these.
So.
So.
You were sort of sneaky last night.
Wasn't I, though?
You never could have done it if I'd been sober.
I never would have wanted to if you'd been sober.
Why did you want to?
A fool and his Nobel reputation are soon parted.
I think I took care of that at the press conference.
No. You were wonderful.
Thank you.
What sort of trickery do you have in store for me today?
Trickery?
Yes. You said you wanted to talk to me about something.
Yes. I heard you tell my uncle Max that you met him last night.
Yes, when I checked into the hotel in the lobby.
The desk Porter introduced us.
Oh, I see.
Tell me, does your uncle have lapses of memory?
I wouldn't know.
I really don't know uncle Max all that well.
I was just a tiny little thing when he went off to
America after the war.
How could anyone leave a tiny little thing like you behind?
I was already in Montreal, living with a family there after my mother and father died.
Uncle Max and I corresponded, but somehow we just never managed to get together.
Then I went to college in London and stayed on.
It wasn't until he won the Nobel prize and I cabled him a hint that he invite me to join him here that I really got to see him.
That was yesterday morning.
We're practically strangers.
Did you notice anything different about him today?
I mean, as compared with yesterday?
Different?
You'll laugh.
Tell me the joke.
Well, when I met your uncle last night, he, uh, seemed quite friendly.
He was familiar with my work and me, and, uh... thank you.
And he enjoyed having his picture taken, and he was noticeably pro-American.
Then today, he acted as though he'd never met me, his voice sounded slightly different, he looked slightly different, and he objected to having his picture taken, and he, uh, was noticeably anti-American to the press.
Uncle Max?
And last night when I shook hands with him,
I had the feeling that I was much taller than he, and today he seems to...
Ha ha ha!
Yes, he seems to have grown a little.
Mr. Craig, you must do yourself a favor.
Don't say a word about this to anyone, and in the interest of preserving your precarious reputation,
I won't either.
I shall take it under advisement.
Oh, now I've got to run.
There's uncle Max.
I promised
I'd meet him for lunch.
See you tonight if not sooner.
Put this on my check, please.
Oh, Mr. Craig.
Yes?
I'm Denise Marceau.
Oh, Dr. Marceau, of course.
I should have recognized you.
Well, how could you recognize me when you still have in your eyes that beautiful Stratman girl?
May I say that my eyes are large enough to hold two beautiful women?
So I've heard.
Please sit down.
Science needs the advice of literature.
But I was just going to have lunch.
Splendid idea. Please.
Oh, Martini very dry.
Make that two.
Oh, I believe I see miss
Stratman in your left eye.
Oh, forgive me, doctor.
Oh, no. Not doctor, please.
Denise.
Ah, rhymes with chemise?
Oh, I knew you were the right man to advise me.
What kind of advice was this again?
Purely literary, I assure you.
Given the following situation:
A husband loves his wife but has forgotten he loves her because of his infatuation with another woman's body.
Problem: How should the story proceed to a happy ending for the wife?
May I call you Andrew?
Oh, please do.
Now, does she win back her husband with threats?
Never works.
Then does she try to open his eyes to the truth about the other woman?
What is the truth?
Ravishing, damn her.
Ooh, that's bad.
Well, then I see no other way but for the wife to find an equally attractive male to remind her husband that she, too, is desirable.
Does that sound workable, Andrew?
What would she have in mind for this male?
Once having found him, she could pretend to a relationship...
You know, create the illusion, not the fact.
Not the fact.
Thank you.
Cheers.
To illusions.
Oh, this is my third Martini, and I haven't even had any breakfast yet.
I'm with the hotel. Thank you, Dr.
Marceau, Mr. Craig.
We must make sure that my husband gets a copy.
There's a telephone call for you, Mr.
Craig. Follow me, please.
Don't go away.
Thank you.
Hello. Mr. Craig here.
I can't.
Did you say Stratman?
Well, what about Stratman?
Can you speak English?
Uh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Ne quittez pas.
Excuse me. My name is Craig.
Do you speak Swedish?
I was born in Stockholm.
I hope so.
Could you tell me what the gentleman on the other end is trying to say?
Marten Trotzig Lane, number 40.
He says come right away.
Lindbloom is his name.
It is something about you and a Mr... Strutman?
Very serious and urgent matter, he says.
Then he hangs up.
Hmm. What was that address again?
Wait. I'll write it for you.
Marten trotzig Lane, number 40.
That is in the old town, just across the canal.
Lindbloom. And hurry.
Right away, he says.
Thank you very much.
Good day.
They have called to tell you your Nobel prize was a clerical error.
Don't want you to think that I am terribly rude, but something urgent has come up, and I'm going to have to leave right away.
Oh, what's her name?
Probably miss wild goose chase.
Will you forgive me?
Never, and I'm going to make you pay for it tonight.
Marten trotzig Lane.
Ja. Ja.
Hello?
Mr. Lindbloom?
Hello.
Mas. Mas.
What?
Excuse me. Excuse me. Where can I find an officer?
No, thanks. An officer.
Where can I find an officer?
A constable?
No! No! Back!
Back! No! Stop!
No! Back! Back! Back!
No. I am sorry. I can't help it, but the whole story is so amusing, especially the part about the new Dr.
Stratman.
Well, I'm doing my best to amuse you.
Now, I hope you don't mind my asking, but had you been drinking?
I told you. I only said that to the crew that fished me out so they'd believe I fell in.
And I'm very glad you didn't tell them who you were.
I was afraid they'd throw me back in.
But no drinking, yes?
No drinking. No. I had one
Martini with Emily Stratman.
Ohh!
Oh. Make that two.
Oh-ho.
And one little Martini with Denise Marceau.
With Denise Marceau.
But that's all.
What happened?
No time to get around to the mother of Dr. Farelli?
Gesundheit.
Ohh!
They should have left me in those clothes when they dried them in the boiler room.
We really should go to the hotel and let you change.
No, no. We're going to number
40 marten trotzig Lane, and then maybe you and your friend constable Strohm will find things a little less amusing.
I hope you won't do anything to antagonize the police.
We must keep it out of the papers, you know?
Just keep me out of the canal.
This city doesn't need police.
They need lifeguards.
Goddag.
Goddag.
Uh, Mrs. Lindbloom?
Ja.
I'm v-very sorry to bother you, uh...
She does not speak English.
- Goddag.
- Goddag.
Goddag.
Something's wrong.
She's too cheerful.
Ask her what happened to her husband.
Uh, may I carry on, constable strohm?
Please do, miss Andersen.
Her husband is on a holiday in Switzerland and has been gone for almost a week.
Is that Oscar?
Ah, ja. Ja. Oscar.
His body was lying right there in this room.
I saw it this afternoon.
She has been home all day, and she says you are making a joke.
If she thinks that's funny, wait till she gets to the funeral.
Ask her, uh, what he does for a living.
Did for a living.
Theatrical makeup and wigs for Swedish films.
I see.
Did he know a man by the name of Stratman?
Stratman? Nej.
Perhaps we should leave, miss Andersen.
Yes.
Wait a minute. I'm telling you.
I saw him sitting there right in front of the te...
The television set.
Ask her where the TV set is.
They have no television set.
She's lying. It was right there.
He was probably watching the press conference.
Something he saw, something I said.
That's why he called me at the hotel.
Shall we go, Mr. Craig?
No.
What about, uh, mas, mas?
Mas?
I already told you.
Mas means seagull, and Stockholm is full of seagulls. Please.
What's happening?
We are leaving.
You mean, this is it?
Yes.
Well, I certainly enjoyed your performance as the merry widow.
Ja. Ha ha! Ja.
I know what you're thinking.
You do?
Yes. Why don't you just come right out and say it?
All right. I was wondering what to wear to the reception tonight.
Yes. You're right.
I made the whole thing up.
I had nothing better to do with myself today, so I invented the murder and then decided to try a half gainer into the canal.
Constable strohm? Yes?
What are you planning to do about all this?
As a favor to the foreign ministry, the police will forget the entire incident.
You mean, including the character with the sunglasses who tried to kill me?
The feeling seems to be that he, too, is on his holiday in Switzerland.
I'm surprised you don't arrest me for drunk diving.
Mr. Craig? Hmm.
Now, can I trust you alone until 6:30?
Yeah. I'm just going to be soaking in a hot tub, trying to defrost.
What can happen to me?
You could always go down the drain.
Miss Andersen, will you do me a favor?
Before you pick me up tonight, would you mind soaking in a hot tub yourself?
I think you could stand a little defrosting, too.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Who is it?
Somebody dangerous.
Hello.
Hello.
Still alive?
Temporarily.
Your press conference in the evening papers.
How did I make out?
I suggest you don't learn to read Swedish.
Ooh. I don't suppose there was anything in the newspapers about a dead man named Lindbloom?
Nothing. May 1?
Hmm.
Nice.
Bath oil.
What's the Swedish word for, um, enchanting?
Foertjusande.
And for female?
Kvinna.
Who are you planning to use Swedish with tonight?
Who are you planning to enchant tonight?
There.
Why don't we have a little...
Drink before we go?
We are late.
It's... it's out of the question.
You're absolutely right.
What are you doing?
Inspecting the foreign ministry.
And I didn't want to come to Stockholm.
This is not on the Nobel schedule, Mr. Craig.
I think you should be prepared to make unscheduled flights, miss Andersen.
I never should have listened to you.
What did I say?
About defrosting in the bathtub.
Did you?
Much too long.
Well, I've been getting into hot water all my life.
I thought an iceberg never melts.
I thought Sweden was neutral.
You shouldn't have done that.
I don't want the king to see.
He'd understand that I'm merely doing my duty.
Mmm. Don't stop.
Keeping you out of one kind of trouble...
Mm-hmm.
By getting you into another.
This calls for more than a drink.
Yes?
This calls for...
All sorts of things.
Yes.
We may even have to...
Yes?
Yes.
No.
We can't be late for the reception.
Oh. There are the Stratmans.
And here are we, and let's keep it that way.
No. I think we ought to mosey over and see what we can see.
I think not.
You just don't want me to be near Emily.
I just don't want you near her uncle.
If it is her uncle.
See what I mean?
Oh, boy.
What is it?
That waiter over there.
Oh. What about him?
He looks like the guy...
Hello. Waiter, waiter.
Excuse me.
Uh, ha ha! Haven't we met somewhere before?
Sir?
Oh, now, surely you remember me.
Andrew Craig. Hmm? Nobel laureate in drowning.
Uh, how about this?
Lindbloom. Chop, chop.
Nothing, huh?
Uh, what's your name?
Daranyi, sir.
Daranyi, huh?
Would you like a canape?
Which one has the body in it?
Now, don't look at me that way.
Where's count Jacobsson?
No, please. Why not?
I don't want to see you make a fool of yourself.
Then you'd better stay here.
Ah, count Jacobsson.
Ah, there you are, Mr. Craig.
May I see you for just one second?
Carlo Farelli, Mr. Andrew Craig.
How do you do? I'm delighted.
Signora Farelli,
Mr. Andrew Craig.
How do you do? How do you do?
Mr. John Garrett and Mrs. Garrett.
Congratulations, Craig.
Yeah, well, we're a long way from home, aren't we?
You can say that again.
I want to see you.
John, not now.
There's something very strange happening here.
Yes, of course. This is Dr.
Denise Marceau and Dr. Claude Marceau.
Mr. Andrew Craig.
Andrew.
I never should have left you today.
Your wife and I almost had lunch together.
I have already seen the photograph of your tete-a-tete, Mr. Craig.
I hope we were in focus.
Thank you for the flowers you sent me.
3 dozen of the most beautiful roses.
Well, I'm extravagant, aren't you?
Oh. This is mademoiselle Souvir, the secretary of Dr.
Claude Marceau.
Hello.
Congratulations, doctor.
Ah. Finally. You, see.
There's this...
Oh. You know Mr. Wilson of your embassy here.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, Mr. Craig, that was quite a splash you made in your newspaper interviews today.
Well, if you think that was a splash.
Uh, now, you see that waiter over there?
Yes.
Well, do you know who he is?
Uh, obviously an employee of the firm catering this occasion.
His name is Daranyi.
I see.
Please.
Gentlemen, please don't laugh, but he tried to kill me today.
Ahem. My dear count, what would your guests say.
Mr. Craig, please, I beg of you.
Now, wait a minute.
He murdered a man by the name of Lindbloom, who was going to tell me something about Dr. Stratman.
He knows that I know, so he pushed me into the canal.
And you drowned, no doubt.
I think we should call the police and question the fellow and, while we're at it, see if we can't find
Lindbloom's body.
Oh. Oh, it's missing.
Yes.
How awkward.
Mr. Craig, don't you think you have gone far enough?
I did my best to save you from yourself today by cutting your press conference short.
I tried to save you further embarrassment by not telling Mr. Wilson miss Andersen's report to me.
What report?
She has given me full details of your highly imaginative afternoon.
Oh, she has, eh?
I found it necessary to reprimand her for not tending to you properly.
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.
I hope I won't have to do it again.
Gentlemen.
Well?
Nothing.
So you, uh, reported to count Jacobsson today, eh?
I had to. Please forgive me.
Did he tell you what kind of bath oil to use?
You don't think that, do you?
I don't know what to think.
This, foolish man.
Hmm.
You know, whatever is going on around here,
I'm going to get to the bottom of it, if only to prove to you that I am not as big a nut as you think I am.
What are you going to do?
Even if I knew, do you think I'd tell you?
You'd blab everything to teacher.
So, uh, what would you like, dear?
Well, I can't quite make up my mind.
Hello there.
Hello.
Who are you tonight... how are you tonight, doctor?
Too many, uh, bubbles in the mouth, eh, Mr. Craig?
You should have seen the bubbles in my mouth this afternoon.
I'm afraid you're a little too quick for us.
Only two kinds, they say, the quick and the dead.
Eh, professor?
Mmm. I'm sorry. Do you know miss Andersen of the foreign ministry?
Oh. Good evening, miss Andersen.
Good evening.
Dr. Stratman!
Oh. I'm so relieved to see you here this evening.
Well, I hope you didn't think
I was too feeble for such festivities, Mrs. Garrett.
Oh, no. You see, this evening when my husband returned to the hotel, he said to me, "Saralee,
I know it couldn't be,"
"but I could have sworn
I saw Dr. Max Stratman"
"in a hospital corridor this afternoon"
"being wheeled to an operating room or someplace,"
"and he looked sort of unconscious."
And I said, "why, you must have been seeing things."
Well, I was right, wasn't I, Dr. Stratman?
Hold the fort.
John!
Where is that man now?
My drinking has nothing to do with it.
Now, please, Dr. Garrett.
You're gonna hear what I have to say.
You can fool the Nobel committee and the press, but you can't fool me.
You are joking with me, Dr.
Garrett.
And don't give me that innocent Italian charm.
Sure, Eric Oman had nothing to tell me at the hospital this afternoon.
How could he after you got to him first?
I give you my word. I never...
You used my findings, my years of work!
No.
And covered the thievery with one rotten, lying word... improvise.
Make yourself sober, and maybe someday, il will let you apologize.
No, wait. No, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stay out of this!
I am... am most embarrassed, Mr. Craig.
Go to hell!
I'm very sorry, but there's something
I have to ask you.
I don't want to talk about it.
Which hospital did you visit today?
Leave me alone.
No, Dr. Garrett, this is important.
Your wife said that you saw a man that looked like Max Stratman being wheeled down a hospital corridor today.
Amazing likeness.
Which hospital?
Ohh. I think I'm gonna be sick.
But which hospital?
Flora sanitarium, fourth floor.
Ohh.
Thanks.
I have just done a wicked thing.
I changed the place cards at the dinner table to put us side by side.
Oh. Well, you better switch them back again, or you'll be talking to an empty chair.
Oh. We've just had a lovers' quarrel?
What do you know about the flora sanitarium?
It's a private institution for rich nervous breakdowns.
Where is it?
On Paulsolmen.
How far away?
A few minutes driving time.
Paulsolmen, hmm?
You're not thinking of leaving?
I'll be right back.
But dinner. Make excuses for me.
I'll go with you.
Oh, no, you won't.
What took you so long?
I didn't know I was expected.
Mr. Craig's coat, please.
Shall we use your car or mine?
Are we going someplace together?
That hospital, of course.
Of course.
Sorry.
Meanwhile back at the ranch, they discover we're both missing.
Wonder what they'll think.
People will say we're in love.
Tell me something. Anything.
Earlier today, you implied that I was, um, imagining things, and pretty ridiculous things at that.
Here you are on your way to double-check them.
When did you change your mind?
Oh. I haven't changed my mind.
I just want to be there when you change yours.
I see.
You don't sound very convinced.
But I'm beginning to be convinced about you all right.
Wait here.
Yes. If I'm not out in two days, come in and get me.
Uh, good evening.
We're... do you speak English?
Somewhat.
Uh, do you have a patient here by the name of Stratman?
Wait here, please.
Mind if I do the talking?
I'm not even here.
I'm Dr. Eckhart.
May I be of assistance?
Yes. My name is Craig, and this is miss Stratman.
We're trying to find out if you have a patient here, uh, miss Stratman's uncle,
Dr. Max Stratman, or else someone who looks like him, possibly on the fourth floor?
There's no Stratman here.
Well, here's a picture of him.
Does that face look familiar?
Oh. Nobel prize winner.
And that's you...
Mr. Andrew Craig.
I am honored.
Yes or no, doctor? No.
It's a matter of some urgency.
Would you object if we looked around the fourth floor?
Is this your request, miss Stratman?
Yes.
Come with me.
Sorry.
What about that one?
Unoccupied.
For how long?
A week or so.
- May 1?
- Yes.
Coming, Mr. Craig?
I suppose you must think that I'm...
Where's miss Stratman?
I believe she's waiting downstairs.
I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you, doctor.
No bother. It gave me the pleasure of meeting you.
All right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Why, you...
Oh, not again.
Oh. Come on, Daranyi.
Just because I didn't eat one of your damn canapes.
Excuse me. I need help.
Could you tell me...
What? No, I can't.
No, I can't.
Herrar. Herrar.
Yes. Herrar. Herrar. Of course.
Someone's following me.
Clothes off, or no in here.
I need the police.
Nothing on. Nothing on.
Nothing on?
Ahh! Stop it. I'm ticklish.
Please.
Hold it. No, no. Just a minute, please.
Do you speak English?
Why, yes. Most of us here do, I'm sure.
Well, I need help.
Then as a courtesy to our visitor from another land,
I will continue in English, all right?
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.
I'm in trouble!
Clothing does more than keep out the sun and air.
It makes the human anatomy excessively mysterious, giving rise to improper thoughts.
Just... just... just a minute.
I'm being followed by two men who are trying to kill me.
No. They're right back...
I, uh, I want you to send for the police.
No. I'm serious.
Now, I can't explain everything to you...
Americans are rarely serious about nudism, but kindly remember that you are in Sweden.
Yes. And about to get a knife in my naked back.
Now, please, do not disrupt this meeting again!
Because if you persist,
I will summon the police.
Can I borrow your towel?
I should say not.
One has only to observe...
Police?
Which modesty takes in different parts of the world, to recognize the essential falsity.
If a man came upon a naked Swedish girl or a naked French woman by accident...
You can be sure it was no accident.
She would quickly cover a certain area of her lower body with her hands, but if she were a naked Arab woman, she would cover her face before all else.
Oh, yes. I've got a couple of tomatoes back home that I wish would do the same thing.
I have asked you to stop!
What? And leave that poor Arab woman with her bare face hanging out?
If a man were to surprise...
Psst. Mr. Norberg.
A naked Chinese woman...
She would try to hide her feet.
A celebes woman would cover her knees, a Samoan girl her navel.
Listen. I once surprised a girl who was part Chinese, part Samoan, and part celebes, and when I...
She had a terrible time.
Under international nudism...
Under international nudism, every part of the body would be revealed.
What about elbows?
A person would have to cover nothing, for there would be nothing to fear.
Question! Question!
And the consequence would be a generally higher standard of morality all around.
Mr. Speaker, I demand to know your position on the question of naked elbows.
Why don't we throw him out?
Let's all throw him out, Mr.
Norberg!
Be patient!
Be patient!
He will not be with us for long.
Permit me to continue.
Stop peeking at me!
What kind of nasty minds do you have anyway?
If anybody touches me,
I'll scream.
Uh, my friends, what is our goal then?
It is to promote the physical well-being in a more relaxed atmosphere.
Hypocrisy! Hypocrisy!
Lies, lies, lies.
I wish to be heard. Now, listen to me, all of you.
I'm speaking as an American citizen and as a non-nudist...
Throw him out, Mr. Norberg!
Temporarily caught with his pants down, but don't listen to Mr. Norberg there because he's playing the skin game.
While you're sitting here in the altogether, your clothing lies back there in the locker rooms at the mercy of professional thieves!
Mr. Norberg is stealing the shirts off your back, and that's the naked truth!
Easy does it, boys.
You will put your clothing on, please.
Well, if you want me to go in there, you're gonna have to come in there with me.
Can't you dress yourself?
There are two men in there waiting to kill me.
Why do you think I sent for you?
Oh. Come along.
All right.
Hmm. So they got away.
Yes, sir. Just get dressed.
How do you like that?
They stole my clothes!
Hold on to your towel, please.
Come along.
Yes, I, um... we ought to go straight to headquarters.
I've got a rather involved story to tell, and it may take some time, but it's rather urgent.
Ja, sure.
There won't be any need to tell us anything, Mr. Craig.
We know all about you and your stories from constable strohm.
Oh, yes, well,
I can explain all that, but couldn't we...
Please get in the car.
Get some sleep, Mr. Craig.
Thanks a lot.
I'm going to 4. You?
Six yes, I always take a brisk walk before bedtime.
It helps me to fall asleep.
It's a bit chilly out tonight.
That's why I wore the towel.
No key.
Aah!
Oh, ma'am. Shh! Ma'am. Ma'am.
Denise!
Oh. Andrew.
May I, uh, come in?
Such a question.
At last, you are living up to your reputation.
Well, I'll explain about all this some other time.
But I understand everything.
Well, but right now, could you do me a favor?
Call the desk and have them send me up my key, room 443.
Immediately.
Uh, meanwhile, why don't you put on something more comfortable?
To a beautiful evening.
To the woman who has made it beautiful.
Dr. Marceau, telephone.
Follow me, please.
Hello.
Allo, Claude. C'est Denise.
Mon Cheri, je voulais te dire j'ai un homme nu dans ma chambre.
Non.
Non, ce nest pas possible.
Hello. This is Dr. Marceau.
Would you kindly send to my room the key to Mr. Andrew Craig's suite, number 4437?
Well, of course it is for him.
Ships!
Your key's on the way.
Hmm.
Put this on and give me that ridiculous towel.
Oh, thanks.
Hello? Could you hold on for just one moment, please?
Hello? Andrew Craig speaking.
Do you have a bureau of shipping here in the city?
One hook in the back would you, please, Andrew?
Yeah. That's right.
Arrivals and departures.
Now, let me tell you what you missed at the reception tonight.
No, no, no. Some other time.
What was that?
And the zipper.
Well, could you find out what time they open in the morning?
Merci.
Yes, I'll wait.
A marvelous reaction took place between my husband's secretary and that charming Italian
Dr. Farelli.
Oh, wonderful.
Thanks to my scientific manipulation of the place cards at the dinner table.
Yes?
What are you doing?
Oh. I'm so happy, I want to share it with you.
Well, uh, yes. Never mind.
Some other time.
Oh, hello, Claude.
You know Andrew Craig.
More so every moment.
My dressing gown looks almost as well on you as it does on me.
And so, I might add, does my wife.
Very ingenious woman, your wife.
Excuse me. The key of Mr. Craig.
Yes. I have to run.
Good night, doctor. I shall return this in the morning.
Denise.
Thank you, Andrew.
Oh, Andrew.
You forgot your towel.
Denise...
I think you need to be watched more closely.
I think so, too.
Hello.
How could you do this to me?
You deserve it.
I've been beside myself all night.
I wish I could be beside yourself all night.
Tell me what happened.
You'd never believe it.
Pretty.
It's not mine. It's
Claude Marceau's.
His wife gave it to me.
Well, I was naked. What else could she do?
And what was she wearing?
Oh. Sort of an off-the-shoulder smile.
I want to know everything.
First things first.
Now, where would you like to start, with Denise Marceau and you naked or Emily Stratman and you cleverly slipping away from the party?
Ah. The foreign ministry is jealous.
And waiting for an answer.
In due time. In due time, but first, I have to scout around and get some shipping information, and the bureau of shipping is closed.
What sort of shipping?
Cargo ships, freighters, everything in port, what's arriving, what's sailing.
I hope not sailed.
That should be in the evening papers.
Oh, of course.
You translate. I've got to get dressed.
Am I permitted to ask the importance of these ships?
Yes. I'm playing a hunch.
Dear old Max Stratman has been hustled aboard one of them from that sanitarium tonight.
Please.
Well, everything today sailed this afternoon.
What about tomorrow?
Tomorrow. White explorer, destination San Francisco.
No.
The George P. Wilson bound for Marseille.
No.
The boulanger for Antwerp.
No.
Dampfschiff moewe for Leningrad.
Leningrad? Hmm.
Well, go on.
Nothing. Probably just a coincidence, but dampfschiff moewe is German.
It means steamship seagull.
Lindbloom's seagull.
That's what he was trying to tell me.
That's it. That's got to be it.
Arrives pier 18 tomorrow morning from Tallinn.
But not in yet?
And, um, sails tomorrow night to Leningrad.
Tomorrow night?
Oh, of course.
Right after the Nobel ceremonies with the real Stratman on board smuggled behind the iron curtain while who knows what that phony
Stratman does at the ceremonies.
You're going too fast for me.
No, no, no, no. It's perfect.
It all fits.
Now, then, if we do anything tonight, we might tip them off, force them to change their plans.
They might even kill Stratman, but tomorrow, they'll fall into their own trap.
They'll put Stratman aboard the seagull, and then we have the police move in and search the ship.
On what evidence?
No evidence. A hunch, and a damn good one.
Isn't that enough?
Enough for an international incident, yes.
I love everything about you except your misguided diplomatic caution.
Lindbloom had something to tell me.
That word was seagull. Daranyi tried to kill me again tonight.
So tomorrow, we are going to go to count Jacobsson or someone who knows how to listen and get some action before it's too late.
All right. We'll talk to count Jacobsson.
He'll be at concert hall at the rehearsal tomorrow.
And you'll back me up?
Yes. Promise?
Yes.
Who is it?
The bellboy, sir.
Mr. Craig, a gentleman brought these to the hotel, saying you forgot your clothing at the gymnasium.
Oh. On the chair, please.
Was he a tall gentleman with a thin face?
Yes, sir.
That was no gentleman.
He instructed me to say to you he will be seeing you again.
Oh. How comforting.
Will there be anything else tonight, sir?
I hope so.
Ohh.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh-uh.
I think I like you a little bit.
I think I like you a little bit, too.
And I approve of gymnasiums.
You must be in excellent physical condition.
You must be in excellent physical condition, too.
Good night, dear assignment.
Good night.
Concert hall, please.
Konserthus.
Remember me, Mr. Craig?
Dr. Eckhart.
Never forget the face.
Please forgive me for inviting myself into your car, but I feared I might not have an opportunity to speak to you in time.
In time?
About miss Inger Lisa Andersen.
What, uh, about miss Andersen?
I know how greatly it would grieve you if she were to be found tomorrow the victim of some unfortunate accident.
Eckhart, I don't know who you are, and I don't know exactly what all this dirty mess is about, but how would you like to wind up in one of your own hospital beds?
Tend strictly to your own affairs, and immediately after the great Nobel event comes to an end, miss
Andersen will be released as untouched and as lovely as she was when she left your hotel suite last night.
What do you mean released?
She's perfectly safe in our hands, I assure you.
You're lying.
She's waiting for me right now at concert hall.
No, Mr. Craig.
Well, if she's not there, then I'll call the foreign ministry, and they'll take...
And they will tell you that she was regrettably summoned to the bedside of an aging relative in northern Sweden.
We have already sent a message in her name.
You will do nothing further, say nothing further to anyone, particularly the authorities.
Is that clear, Mr. Craig?
Her life is in your hands now.
Oh, here we are, concert hall.
If you don't mind, I'll continue in this car.
Now rise, gentlemen, and after a moment, come down to me, the king, to accept your award.
Perhaps you'd like to accept both prizes.
If you mean an additional prize for tolerance and restraint, yes.
His majesty will then make the presentation.
Dr. Farelli,
I'll take your hand.
Dr. Garrett...
Excuse me.
Your hand.
Now, gentlemen, if you'll step back, bow, and return to your seats.
Not so fast.
I, uh, just want to thank you for everything, especially last night.
You've been such a lovely little peach.
Do you mind, please?
I thought I didn't give a damn about the Nobel prize, but now, thanks to you and your ugly little playmates,
I'd rather lose my neck than see the wrong man get it.
I've had about enough thanks for today.
You will have a lot worse coming if anything... if anything happens to Inger Lisa Andersen.
You remember that?
Oh, Mr. Craig, you're just in time.
Where, uh, where is miss Andersen?
Oh. I'm sorry. Ja. She had to journey to Oernskoeldsvik, an illness in the family, but I can arrange for someone else.
Oh, no, never mind.
Then if you'll take your place on the stage, please.
Oh, I can't.
But the rehearsal.
There isn't time.
Why?
Is something wrong?
No, no, nothing. Nothing at all.
Oh, then, please.
Excuse me.
Mr. Craig. Mr...
Wer ist da?
Daranyi and ivar.
Wer ist da?
Daranyi.
What's this?
What's this?
Well, help me. I'm a writer, not a weightlifter.
Mr. Craig.
Are you all right, professor?
I've never felt better in all my life.
Ohh.
You know, it's all your fault.
You should have stayed with me last night.
All your fault.
You didn't insist.
Now, what's this all about?
You tell him, miss Andersen.
Well, you see, the other
Stratman is his brother.
Emily's father?
Yes. Twin brother Walter.
He's supposed to have died in a prison camp during the war.
Get his belt.
Wound up behind the iron curtain and became one of them, dedicated.
Tie his feet.
But it's him they want, his brain working for them.
A man named, um, Eckhart is running the show.
Ja, and boasting to me in that hospital about all his tricks, the dirty swine.
What tricks?
Well, it would be bad for world opinion if they kidnapped me, so they have to make it seem like I was leaving because I wished to leave.
My brother will step onto the stage of concert hall, posing as me, and nobody will ever know the truth.
Only he's not going to get on that stage because you're going to get there first.
We'll never make it in time.
What's Emily's part in this?
Well, first, they shocked her with the news that her father was still alive, and then they forced her into helping them by saying his life would be in danger if she didn't.
You... you... you mustn't blame my Emily.
She really loves me.
Well, I am glad to hear that.
All right. You're off to the concert hall.
Oh, no, no. I'm too weak.
Aren't we all? Come on, come on, come on.
On your feet.
No.
Please, oh, please.
It will be all right.
What now?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Here. Stop.
I guess we're gonna have to take a ride.
Must we?
Oh. And I was so comfortable.
I'll be in the next one.
Daranyi. Shh.
Do you know what you're... unh...
What you're doing to me?
I guess we'll have to get married.
You haven't given me an answer.
To what?
My proposal.
The answer is yes.
If you take your elbow out of my... unh... ribs.
Let's go.
You all right, professor?
Kaput bin ich.
What do you... what do you...
Pull this one. The other one.
Yes, yes.
Steady.
No, no, please.
Dr. Farelli?
Hello, Mr. Craig.
I hate to do this, but I need you.
What is it?
Max Stratman... he's collapsed.
Ay. Where is he?
Right here. Follow me.
The house doctor's out on an emergency.
They don't know for how long.
Grave, molto grave.
Ah. Dr. Garrett, come on in.
I don't think you need me.
Oh, please,
Dr. Garrett, quickly.
I must have your opinion.
He's had a cardiac arrest.
Si. Ventricular fibrillation, I think.
Or tachycardia.
Wh-what does that mean?
His heart is fluttering.
There's no effective beat.
It's hopeless unless we can get him to a hospital.
It's too late. No time, no time.
I think he's failing.
You can't let that happen.
Improvvisare, improvvisare, improvise!
What are you gonna do?
He must live.
Open his shirt.
You'll kill him.
Get back.
Oh, uh, don't touch him.
Stand back.
Where am 1? Heaven?
Stockholm.
Ah. Heaven.
We did it, Dr. Garrett.
We did it!
You did it.
Ohh.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
No, please.
Please. We're late for concert hall.
Oh. Don't be foolish.
No. Getting out of bed now would be a grave risk.
But now at the greatest moment of my life.
Oh. My dear Stratman, if I were you,
I would stay put, huh?
Yes, but you're not me.
I'm going. Nothing will stop me.
Nothing. Please. I feel fine.
All right. All right.
I feel all right.
Just rest a moment.
Shall we tell them that you're...
No, no, no. Don't tell anybody about anything, regardless of what happens later, all right?
All right.
Everybody, hear me.
Get ready. The king is entering.
Mr. Craig?
How do you feel?
I feel well, Dr. Farelli.
How do you feel?
Mr. Craig?
Where is Mr. Craig?
He is not here.
What is going to happen?
Ohh. That I should have to wear a headwaiter's uniform instead of my beautiful dress suit.
Think of the poor headwaiter, sitting around in his underwear.
Ja.
All my life I'm an ox.
Tonight, I feel like a dog.
You're doing fine. Up there.
Up there? Oh. I can't do it.
To Dr. John Garrett of the United States and Dr. Carlo Farelli of Italy.
Bravo!
Oh, please. Just for a minute.
Why don't you let me carry you, doctor?
Because I'm a stubborn old man who wants to do this on his own two feet.
The introduction is brief.
They are coming to you,
Dr. Stratman.
Ach, der liebe.
For his distinguished research in the field of photochemical solar energy conversion and for his discovery of hitherto undreamt of methods of employing solar energy to synthesize new rocket propellants, the Nobel prize in physics to Dr.
Max Stratman of the United States.
I want to talk to you.
Let go of me!
It's about your daughter Emily.
I have no daughter!
I know you're Walter Stratman.
I know the whole story.
Stratman!
She did it for you.
Do something for her.
Free her. Tell her she's got no obligation.
Look out!
Unh... Max Stratman.
Ach. You fool.
Take care of him.
A good performer knows...
When to leave the stage, ja, liebchen?
And so farewell to Max and farewell to Walter Stratman and good-bye to the makeup magic of Oscar Lindbloom, who could not hold his tongue.
But my father.
We had to deceive you into believing he was alive in order to get your help.
Who are you?
I'm just an actor who specializes in political roles.
Your friend Mr. Craig has rewritten my ending... badly.
Aah!
For his writings in support of humanitarian ideas, for his restless curiosity, his unending search for the truth, his unconquerable spirit, and his adventurous imagination that seems to recognize no boundaries, the Nobel prize of literature to Mr. Andrew Craig of the United States.
I owe him so many explanations
I won't know where to begin.
From London by mail.
Why do I always worry each year that something is going to go wrong?
It never does.
Your husband was a wonderful man.
Death is very sad.
Sad?
Mr. Bentley.
I'm very pleased to see you.
Thank you very much.
Will you have tea. or would you prefer a drink?
I really haven't time.
It won't take any time at all if you have your refreshments while we conduct our business.
Tea will be fine.
- I'll pour. Albert.
- Yes. Miss Marrable.
I ordered tea brewed because
I was expecting Mr. Honigger.
Avid tea drinker.
But I suppose the reading of the will is usually left to the junior partner.
Will you have cream.
Mr. Bentley. or brandy?
Brandy lends an elegance to tea.
Neither. thank you. and no sugar.
The actual reading is a formality we can dispense with. and I can give you the salient points.
After all. you're the only person mentioned in the will.
Well. I shouldn't be surprised to find that Joseph had left me everything.
After all. there's no one else he could've possibly included.
Will you have a piece of hazelnut cake?
No. no. thank you.
Of course. I'll depend on you to fill me in on the details of Joseph's enterprises.
I suppose they're terribly involved.
Actually not that much.
To sum up. Mrs. Marrable. your husband was not as solvent as you probably assume.
You must be referring to that dilapidated apartment house he bought.
Joseph mentioned that that turned out to be an unprofitable venture.
Yes. He disposed of that some time ago.
Oh. did he?
Well. he wasn't always able to keep me up on all his ventures.
His oil holdings. though. must be doing very well.
His oil holdings are unexercised options.
They must have some value.
Well. Joseph invested in so many companies.
They're so numerous. I can't even remember all the names!
Mrs. Marrable. there are no assets. only liabilities.
Surely you know your husband borrowed the money to pay the surgeon for the last two operations. and the hospital bill has yet to be settled.
You are overlooking the insurance. which amounted to 200.000 before he increased it!
He cashed out all his policies.
Well. certainly there's the house... with the furniture and the rugs.
How many of these pieces have been in Joseph's family for generations?
They don't belong to me either.
I'm afraid not.
I have the documents here.
Of course. Mr. Marrable bequeathed his personal possessions to you. including his watch. his gold cufflinks. his briefcase with all its contents.
He lost his cufflinks!
The watch disappeared between trips to the hospital!
But I have his rusty dagger... his stamp album that he hasn't looked at in years... and his boyhood butterfly collection.
All this is mine. is it. to keep?
Plus the shirt on my back.
I suppose!
What am I going to do?
You must have relatives.
No. I have a nephew in Arizona... or is it New Mexico?... but I haven't laid eyes on him since he was a child.
I have no one.
I'm sorry. but I'll need your signature on these...
Nothing. Nothing.
Mr. Bentley. all I have left is my personal savings account.
That ought to help.
To live on for the rest of my life?
It's something to keep you going for a while.
It won't last any time at all. and you know that. and Joseph Marrable knew that.
How am I to live?
I'll need your signature.
What am I going to live on?
What shall I do?
What shall I do?
Your signature.
Mrs. Marrable.
I'll take the flashlight.
Do we have to do it now?
Oh. yes. The soil's too dry in the daytime. and the hot sun can burn the roots.
Pick that up. will you?
Miss Tinsley.
Miss Tinsley. will you fetch the mail?
Here's that sample of tea you sent for.
Want it for your lunch?
There'll be plenty of time to taste it.
Just store it for the present. naturally without opening the lid.
Hindus have taken great pains to teach us that tea loses its aroma unless properly sealed.
Oh. well.
That's flattering.
I have been invited to join the museum building committee.
Lunch is almost ready.
I have to talk to Juan first.
Has he made one of his usual blunders?
I'll never know why you put up with him.
Miss Tinsley.
Oh. do remember to leave ample room for the roots.
My gardening magazine says it never hurts to make the hole too deep.
I make it good.
But when they bring the tree?
Well. the nursery delivers in the late afternoon. but as you know.
I like to attend to it myself.
You have a very green thumb.
Yes.
Your pine trees grow good.
Very good.
Don't spill it.
Obviously you haven't the remotest idea how much a bottle of Grand Marnier is worth. or you'd be more watchful of every drop.
You've never tasted it. have you?
No.
I'm afraid
I don't care for liquor.
When referring to a cordial. we use the French pronunciation... liqueur. Miss Tinsley.
I shouldn't try to teach you any more. considering how little you've absorbed under my tutelage.
Will you turn that off. please?
It's one of your favorites.
Is it indeed?
I believe we can do without music this evening.
May I see the financial page?
You may.
What do you expect to find there?
Your stocks are unlisted. as they were the day you placed your order.
But how are they doing?
Are they going up. or are they going down?
How would I know?
Well. I thought your broker would keep you advised.
He has more pressing business than to render daily quotations of your gigantic investment.
I know it doesn't seem much to you. but it represents my savings. practically all of it.
It was at your request. my dear Miss Tinsley. that I handed your massive capital over to my broker.
Well. yes. When you told me your stock had doubled and was still going up. I...
You wanted to hitch onto a star without any awareness of how treacherously it can become a falling comet.
However... no more of this.
I'll call my broker in the morning and instruct him to sell your securities. at a loss if need be.
Oh. no.
I can't afford that.
No. I don't want to sell now.
Don't call him. Mrs. Marrable. not on my account. Please.
I won't. if you'll kindly stop wringing your hands over your money.
I think I'll go to my room.
Good night.
You promised to help me plant my pine tree.
You want to do it now?
Go on. I'll join you in the garden in a moment.
This would be much easier in the light of day.
Well. the soil's too dry in the daytime.
Besides. hot sun can burn the roots.
I think this hole's too big for that little tree.
Oh. I don't think so.
Oh. what a nuisance.
My watch dropped off.
- I don't see it.
- It's over there.
Down there.
Look at Aunt Claire charming the men.
Who wouldn't. with that fabulous necklace you and George gave her?
I wouldn't have my own mother to a cocktail party.
Elva. George and I are very fond of Aunt Claire.
We know. dear. That's why you asked her to come live in Arizona.
She's got so much money that somebody has to keep an eye over.
You aid and abet them.
Well. Aunt Claire believes in the underdog. don't you?
Wait till the underdog starts building across the road from you.
If the Indians are rich enough to build there.
George won't mind a bit.
That's the measure of aristocracy nowadays. isn't it. George?
It isn't every day I can get away from my dull husband for a matinee.
I went there. my darling.
I waited over half an hour.
You should never miss an appointment with me. oao o oo g vo o oo a o
Pity. too.
You've escaped.
What's wrong with our party?
Nothing. It's lovely.
Maybe I've been to too many in the East.
And this is the reason I came to Arizona.
The rocks or the snakes?
The open spaces.
No kidding.
Well. there's a lot more desert out there.
I could take you for a drive.
They won't miss us.
Least of all my wife.
No. thank you. I'd like to take my time discovering the desert.
I confess that's what I had in mind.
On my own.
Your brother-in-law asked us to look out for you.
He went too far.
The whole family did.
They wanted to be nice to the widow.
And so do you?
Harriet. I'm sorry your husband was killed.
I...
Let's go. huh?
Well. well. well.
Mrs. Vaughn. I don't believe you've met George's aunt. Mrs. Marrable.
Mrs. Vaughn's brother-in-law is a stockbroker. too. in the East.
I hope he gives better advice than George.
Those stocks I bought for you went up. Aunt Claire.
Up and down. up and down.
Never enough to matter.
I should be going.
It's nice to meet you.
Mrs. Marrable.
I'd completely forgotten you had a child to take care of.
I'm so glad you had time for a breather.
Bye-bye.
Can I get you another drink. Aunt Claire?
No. I have to steer this vehicle of mine.
I hope you find a new housekeeper soon.
It's a pity you had to fire Miss Tinsley.
She was the nicest one you ever had.
You know. I still can't picture her drunk.
Oh. she was though. horribly.
Otherwise I wouldn't have discharged her.
The help problem is getting absolutely impossible.
I hope you didn't give
Miss Tinsley any references.
She knew better than to ask for them.
You've had such rotten luck with your housekeepers. Aunt Claire.
Have I?
Actually. I think
I've done rather well.
What makes this valley so rip-humming popular?
Prettiest part of the county. but it is kinda remote.
Well. there's one neighbor.
No one's lived there for some time now.
I gave up nursing on marrying a doctor. but when he left me... by dying... a few years ago.
I took it up again.
Of course. my knowledge was pretty dated to return to full-fledged nursing. so I became a sort of combination housekeeper/nurse/companion.
Have you any references?
Three. I-I had four positions. but one of my people died... quiet. natural death at age 95. and I haven't been able to reach her son.
You mustn't be misled by my confinement to this chair.
It's purely temporary. and I shan't require any nursing. however adept you may be in that field.
Well. you don't object to it as a bonus. I hope.
I can cook a grand meal... everything from buttermilk pancakes to a very good beef bourguignonne.
I've always kept a neat house.
I assume there's an underlying reason for your desire to offer your services.
What is it?
In other words. why do I want to work?
Well. I applied for the job. so I guess I want it.
Do you require better reasons than that?
My dear woman. you don't expect me to buy a pig in a poke. do you?
Well. uh...
I want to work because...
I don't think anyone should be idle.
It's bad for your morale.
Besides. I don't like to live by myself.
I can't come up with more reasons. but I'll keep trying.
I know it isn't easy to pick one out of all the people who answer your ad.
I assure you not every applicant who contacts me by phone is invited to appear in person.
Should I. however. decide on you. the terms must be quite clear.
I provide room and board and the stipend indicated in my advertisement.
There are to be no increases.
Well. the salary's very satisfactory. or I wouldn't have come out here.
Well. it wouldn't allow you to save much. and I would like to know that you're covered in case of illness.
Oh. I do have savings of my own.
You don't drink. do you?
Why are you hesitating?
Well. I'd hate to miss out on the job because I enjoy an occasional glass of sherry.
Well... one more thing.
I've had abominable luck with housekeepers who went dashing off to family weddings and to nurse ailing grandchildren.
But who would I dash off to?
I have nobody... nobody in the entire world.
Mrs. Dimmock...
I hope you will be very happy here.
Well.
Before you leave. would you transplant the geranium?
Mrs. Dimmock.
Yes?
Bring me that new pamphlet on deep rooting. will you?
In a minute.
It's in the library with the government publications.
It came yesterday.
Can't you find it?
I have it.
I don't consider that broadminded.
Well. I think you're a saint.
Stuck with that brat for months.
How can you stand it?
Don't you think your husband's family took advantage of you?
Nope. I volunteered.
Gave me a chance to get away from the relatives. both Ken's and mine... and from the small talk. gossip. pressures.
To become one with nature.
M ao
Does. um...
Does that apply to men. too?
I'm sorry.
I suppose it's too soon.
Don't be sorry.
It's a good question.
I just don't have the answer.
Well. you couldn't have come to a better place if you want a good roll in the hay.
Help yourself.
- Even with George.
- No. thank you.
I think you're the kind that plays for keeps.
- If that's your...
- Excuse me.
M ao
Yes.
I knew I couldn't be wrong. but I can't pinpoint where we met.
M ao o avo
We must've.
I knew your name.
Mine's Mike Darrah.
Mind if I sit down?
Please. You don't mind?
No.
Have you also met
Mrs. Vaughn somewhere?
No. I haven't.
You don't live in Tucson.
No. I'm from Phoenix.
I'm only here for the day to see a customer.
Let's see who can tell what Mr. Darrah sells.
I say... real estate.
Your guess?
Mrs. Vaughn doesn't play games.
So says my husband.
Some games I do.
I don't know what you sell. but some of your work is done with your hands.
Hey. you're warm.
I take your ordinary automobile and I turn it into a snappy racing car.
- You go to the racetrack?
- Yes.
She's here taking care of a sick nephew.
The poor little thing has asthma and takes up all of her time.
He is improving.
Well. you told me...
No boy of ten years old likes to be cooped up in a hotel. especially when he's been promised a great adventure in the West.
Look. I know this isn't exactly typical of the West. but I bet he likes fast cars.
He wouldn't be the only one.
I'd love to see what a souped-up motor would do for my car.
I'll be glad to demonstrate.
Well. it's been very nice seeing you again.
- Please call us.
- I will.
Let me take care of the check.
Well. thank you.
I'll call you the next time
I'm in the village.
To demonstrate my engine.
Well. bye. you two.
What's the matter?
I was ready to laugh.
Why don't you pour yourself one. too?
M a
Please do.
Lovely.
Take a look at my calendar.
What do I have to do this afternoon?
Well. you have a note here
I can't make out.
Oh. I have to write to my broker in Chicago.
He's a marvelous man of the old school.
He's not much given to correspondence. but he has yet to be wrong about a stock.
But your nephew is a stockbroker?
Oh. nothing like my man in Chicago.
He's a delight.
He's made a fortune for me.
Sure.
You wouldn't know the word for parrot fever. would you?
Psittacosis.
How marvelous to have an encyclopedic knowledge.
You wouldn't know how to spell it. would you?
P-S-l-T-T-A...
Whose dog is that?
Chloe!
Get away from there!
Don't you hurt that dog!
Who are you?
James Vaughn. and where's your property line?
Jim!
Oh. I'm awfully sorry.
Jim's been reading about all the lands the Indians had. and he...
We moved into the cottage for three months.
I don't think you remember me.
We met at the Lawsons'.
My name is Harriet Vaughn.
I was not informed that the cottage was available for renting.
Ask her if Chloe belongs to her.
Chloe?
Well. that's what she called the dog.
Chloe is a tramp.
Then we can keep her. Harriet.
You will do nothing of the kind. and if the dog is so misfortunate as to appear again. you will not encourage her to stay.
I hope that wasn't an order. Mrs. Marrable.
If you don't want the dog around. we'll work it out. but...
I have not taken loving and diligent care of my garden to have it wrecked by this vagrant bitch.
Neighbors don't always warm up to each other right away.
Mrs. Marrable hasn't had any for years.
Can we keep the dog?
Keep the dog out of this garden or we'll have the sheriff after us.
She doesn't even know what kind of dog it is... you know. male or female.
Rose Hull was forever petting and feeding Chloe.
Rose...?
Hull. She used to live in that cottage before she became my housekeeper.
It's a wonder she didn't take her dog with her.
It wasn't her dog!
I have told you. Chloe is a tramp.
At least she was clever enough not to come around after Rose Hull left.
Well. did Rose Hull...
George. someone has moved into the cottage.
You had a chance to buy that cottage when Rose Hull stopped making payments.
Tle bark owrs it row.
Well. I had no idea anyone would want to live there.
I must have my privacy. George.
Use your friends at the bank. can't you?
Didn't you tell me you're one big club. one for all and all for nobody?
Come here. Let's go.
Come on.
Hello.
Hi.
...explain myself.
I'm entering the same contest as Mrs. Marrable.
I can't let her know... she wouldn't like that at all... so I was mailing my card from your box.
A blank card is all that they ask for.
The first hundred entries get a portable makeup mirror that lights up all over.
How will they know where to send it?
There's no return address.
Am I getting absent-minded!
Oh. dear.
May I have my mail. please?
That is. unless our captivating neighbor requires you further.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were up and about.
She seems to be a pleasant young lady.
Would you prefer to be in her employ?
I was just being friendly. that's all.
Oh. I'm convinced of it.
Soap manufacturers put more scent in their samples than they do in the product they sell.
Put that in the closet. will you?
We have so much stored up in there. we could open up shop.
Are you suggesting that I give it away to your newly acquired friend across the way?
I won! I won!
I am the winner of the...
Well... it's only the third prize.
Nevertheless. feast your eyes on that.
$25! What was the contest?
In 50 words or less.
I gave an inspired account of how I allured my most recent boyfriend!
I am going to proceed to enter every teenage contest in the country.
I didn't expect...
I should have told the mailman there's no one here by that name.
Post offices have been known to make mistakes before.
It's not a serious one.
This was her address at one time.
Your breakfast is ready.
Thank you.
How long are you gonna stay?
Certainly another couple of months.
We took a lease on the cottage.
But you know that.
Are you happy with the place?
Great for Jim. Me too.
I'm so glad you told me about it.
I'm sure the lease can be extended.
Oh. I might stay longer.
I just might.
Look what I have for you.
Come on.
Come on. Chloe.
Come on.
Come on. Chloe.
Delicious!
Come. come.
Come and get it.
Come on.
Chloe. are you coming?
Come on. Chloe.
Come and get it.
Come on. come on.
Are you coming?
That's a good dog.
Are you aware that the cocktail hour has come and gone?
Has it? I have your margarita right here.
I'm a bit slow today. Haven't had much experience with pheasant.
When I engaged you. you led me to assume that you were a highly proficient cook who wouldn't be thrown off schedule by a new variety of fowl.
I'm only running a few minutes late.
Punctuality is essential to a gracious way of life. which I do not intend to give up on account of you.
Well. I've been trying to prepare a lovely meal. and that cannot be done with all the complaints and interruptions... a o o o a o o vo o
I would like to be heard for once.
If you want to live like some duchess or maharani. you better learn to behave like one!
I must have known this would be my reward for being far more considerate and patient and generous to you than I have been to any of my former housekeepers.
And how long did they stay with you?
Not one of them walked out on me.
Are you threatening to?
Well?
Are you?
No.
No. I wasn't threatening to walk out. no.
I wouldn't blame you if you fired me on the spot.
Oh. well...
I must admit that I was tempted to. but I soon realized that what at first seemed disrespect. if not mutiny. was simply an uncontrollable outburst of temper.
My temper will do me in.
Oh! I've been told and told.
If I keep on flying off the handle.
I'll have no friends left.
Well. I've been so disgusted with the procession of humdrum. mealy-mouthed yes ladies who have paraded through this house that a touch of fire is a welcome change.
I've been wondering about those others.
We nurses tend to do that.
If you learn where your predecessor fell short. you're less likely to make the same mistakes.
There's no danger.
Miss Tinsley was a tedious woman. endowed with an astonishing lack of taste.
Is that why you got rid of her?
No. No. it was... it was her devotion to alcohol which brought about the parting of our ways.
You mean she drank a whole lot?
Well. I wouldn't have made an issue of an occasional highball.
What I had to go through to cleanse her room of that pervasive odor of gin.
And once she stumbled into this table. knocking off all the china. and the glassware. and then proceeded to put her fist through the windowpane.
At times like that. the filth that came out of her mouth!
Why. it was worthy of a man who'd spent his entire life at sea.
Well. undoubtedly she learned it from just such men.
Men?
Oh. at her age. she was carrying on with strangers who would call in the middle of the night. write letters to her.
Yes. I'd prefer to forget that she was ever here. my dear.
Well. you've certainly had your share of strange experiences.
Of course... hiring women from an ad could be a risky business.
How do you make your choices?
Well. I take into account their experience. their references.
Could be dangerous. though. living way out here in the desert. no protection to speak of.
Oh. I've never been afraid.
Not of people.
My. isn't that nice.
You don't think it has a bitter taste?
Does it?
Well. I'm afraid so.
Distinctly bitter flavor.
Did you get this at the market?
Pheasant is hardly an item you'd expect to find on supermarket shelves.
These birds were brought to me by George.
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to eat it at all?
Why not play it safe.
Mrs. Marrable?
I've seen enough in my years as a nurse to scare me. especially where there's money...
You didn't finish your sentence.
I've been taken off a case when the patient showed the first signs of improvement.
Doctor wanted me to stay on for a while. but not the family.
When the patient died...
You blame me for wondering if it wasn't a bit... unnatural?
George and Julia.
What an absurd notion!
You are far too permissive with your fantasies.
People don't go around murdering each other.
May not be as difficult as you think.
It's not very perceptive of you to minimize the courage that it takes to kill.
Courage?
Why. it's just nerve with a dash of cruelty.
You're mistaken.
It takes extraordinary courage born of inner fortitude.
My father told me that. and he was an authority. having spent his life in the military establishment.
It takes extraordinary courage.
Well. if you're not afraid. why don't you eat your pheasant?
I've lost my appetite.
Mrs. Dimmock.
Sabre Irdustries.
This is Mrs. Claire Marrable calling from Tucson.
I believe you wrote a letter of reference for Mrs. Dimmock. who is now in my employ.
I would like to verify that she worked for you and that you found her satisfactory.
Sure. She worked for my mother for over two years.
A wonderful woman.
I'll tell you this. though... she's got an Irish temper. and if it shows up. you'd better watch out.
Thank you.
Sure. Ary time. Mrs. Marrable.
You're lucky to lave ler.
Good-bye.
You're shaking like a leaf.
Take it easy. will you?
The queen of spades won't be back for a while.
I don't like to take unnecessary chances.
You said they went out to dinner.
I didn't want you here today.
I told you I'd stay in touch with you.
I've had it with the blank postcards and this whole damn mystery bit!
You're getting out of here and going home with me right now.
You can't go on playing this part.
I haven't been found out yet. and I won't. if you don't give me away.
You don't have the strength...
- Never felt stronger in my life.
...or the training.
You don't appreciate my talent.
I have to stay here.
Now. you're entitled to think that
I'm playing with the squirrels. but don't ask me to leave.
Just don't!
Those blank postcards were your idea.
I had to know you were all right.
If they're piling up too high for you.
I'll stop sending them.
Let me take the statue.
Aunt Claire.
You've got to stop blaming yourself for Miss Tinsley.
How can I?
It was my fault.
Of course I didn't mean the things I said. but say them I did.
I'm not going to give up until I find out where she is.
My instincts tell me something happened to her. here.
You just can't jump to conclusions.
Not just the Bible.
Mrs. Marrable's housekeepers seem to vanish.
And you haven't heard her talk about the courage to kill!
Let's get out of here.
There's one thing that I want you to do for me.
Help you pack.
Go to the First National Bank in Phoenix.
Find out if Edna still has money in her savings account.
You just can't walk into a bank...
You'll find a way.
Oh. please.
After that.
I'll do whatever you say.
I'll leave this house.
Is that good enough?
And I also want... her forwarding address!
Go. Go!
- Where's your shoes?
- Wait a minute! My shoes!
Won't you come in for a drink?
Well. thank you. Aunt Claire. but we should be going.
Very well.
And thank you for entertaining me so regally.
Will you call me before long?
We will.
Good-bye.
Forgot to say good-bye.
You're sure you wouldn't be interested in the polo match at the Bennetts' on Saturday?
Aunt Claire doesn't like polo.
You know that. George.
Well. thank you anyway.
George. Good-bye.
Thanks.
Oh. my.
I must have dozed off.
Did you have a pleasant time at the fair?
Why did you let her pick the most expensive statue they had?
It's a good long-term investment. Julia.
Yes. George. but are we so sure that Aunt Claire is a sound stock?
You mean because she never pays for anything when she's with us?
She thinks we're loaded.
Well. we're so smart. we've fooled her. haven't we?
But she might be playing the same game.
We can give you the information. Mr. Darrah.
Miss Edna Tinsley's current balance is $32.83.
She withdrew $9.000 on March 5th?
Yes. She took out the entire amount in cash.
You have her latest forwarding address?
Yeah. it's right here on the card.
"Care of Marrable.
Route 3. Tucson."
- Thank you.
- Right.
Oh. yes. Mrs. Marrable is terribly rich.
However. I doubt that auto races will appeal to Aunt Claire. but she'll take to you.
Well. if all the proceeds are going to her Indian charity. she ought to go for it.
Even if she doesn't.
I'm enchanted that you called me.
Hey. Harriet! Come here!
Come here!
Look over there.
If I could use your phone.
Mrs. Marrable.
I could call the manager of the racetrack and check on available dates right now.
Oh. please do.
Yes?
Thank you.
My housekeeper will show you the phone.
Mrs. Dimmock. this is Mr. Darrah.
He would like to make a phone call.
Certainly. This way. please.
Mister... I didn't catch the name.
Darrah.
How is that you've never introduced me to Mr. Darrah before?
Well. we've only met recently.
Actually. George hasn't even met him yet.
Would you tell dear George to call me this evening. Julia?
Certainly.
I must talk to him about those stocks. which do nothing but go down.
Mr. Johnson. please.
They've both been dropping points every day. causing me great concern.
- Well. that's just...
- Pack up. Aunt Alice!
I mean it! You're going back to Phoenix with me now!
...stocks sometimes dip...
You promised if you...
You promised if you got this information...
Stop whispering.
What are you going to do exactly?
I want to know!
...tip on those stocks.
I'm sure.
Stocks do go up and down so rapidly sometimes.
Well. that's the market for you. Aunt Claire.
I told George to sell before I took a loss.
He procrastinated until it was too late.
You're leaving with me!
I'll meet you at the market on Route 4.
9:00 tomorrow morning.
You'd better not let me down.
Aunt Alice. I mean it.
Yeah. I see. No. that's all right.
I'll call back.
Yeah. thank you.
I mean it!
- Would you pour?
- Love to.
It's better to perish than fail to maintain appearances.
That's a trait George inherited from his grandfather. my father.
Very few of us understood Papa.
He was a gentleman of style. of true style.
That's the word that I've been trying to think of. "style."
That's what you have.
Mrs. Marrable. style.
I thank you.
I should hope so.
And a flair for things.
I wish I had.
I wish I had your flair for money.
I don't believe I ever heard you mention money before.
But it's hardly a flair. dear Mrs. Dimmock.
I'm not a greedy woman. but it irks me to see how little my money earns in the bank.
When you talk about your stocks. they sound fabulous.
Yes. All except those George recommends.
Don't you have a stockbroker in Chicago. too?
Yes.
Would you be willing to speak to him about me?
I'd like to invest my money. and I need good advice.
And you shall have it.
The stock market is one thing if you can stand the loss without being hurt. but if it's your life savings you're speculating with. don't dream of doing anything so foolish.
I wouldn't have the nerve to bother you if I wanted to invest a mere dribble.
Now. this won't sound like much to you. but I've amassed a goodly sum.
Have you?
How much. Mrs. Dimmock?
Well...
I must admit. in my wildest dreams...
I never thought such an amount could be accumulated by serving as a housekeeper. even companion.
My husband left a generous insurance policy.
Even so. 46.000 could provide a handsome livelihood for a woman for quite a few years.
You're extremely fortunate.
Now will you speak to your broker?
We'll see.
We'll see.
You have to let me sleep and think on it.
May I have another cup?
Get out of my garden!
Get out of my garden. you...
Harriet!
You get that dog out of my garden at once!
What happened?
I'm awfully sorry!
You deliberately enticed that dog here to destroy my grounds.
It's impossible to keep him out of your garden.
Maybe if we put up a small fence.
Are you taking it upon yourself to tell me what to do with my property?
I was suggesting a way to protect your garden.
You've had no compunction about taking the time of my companion. poking into my affairs. and overtly displaying your hatred of me.
What do you want from me. Mrs. Vaughn?
I don't want anything from you.
You really expect me to believe that?
Please go back to the cottage.
Seems I'm powerless.
I wouldn't let her upset me.
She's like crabgrass... never really quelled. only cropping up secretly and victoriously in another spot.
Well. I do not intend to sit here and wait while she thinks up a new way to harass me.
I won't have to.
We will go to the Indian
Music Festival in Tortugas.
It's only a day's drive. and I've been wanting to hear their chants and see their dancing.
We'll leave first thing in the morning. Mrs. Dimmock.
You don't dislike traveling. I trust?
No.
If I'd known. I'd have bought stockings in town this morning.
These are gone... they're my last pair... and I'm out of toothpaste.
I know you don't like to lend yours.
I want to leave first thing in the morning. Mrs. Dimmock. without delay.
Do you mind if I drive into town now?
The new market has both nylons and toothpaste.
Very well.
You may take the car.
And get a roadmap at the service station. will you?
Don't be too long.
I'll get it.
Hi.
We saw you with that other broad.
Harriet. you've got the wrong idea.
If you'd just let me tell you something.
Are you gonna let him. after what he did to you?
Shut up. Jim!
Look. we can't talk here.
Come with me.
All you have to do is listen.
All right.
But I hope you have something to say.
I'm back.
I'm back.
I must've dozed off.
I found everything I needed.
Would you like to study the roadmap?
Thank you.
I think I ought to start dinner.
Let's have a very light supper this evening. since we want to retire at an early hour.
Would you write a letter to Juan reminding him to cover the roses with burlap?
I certainly will.
Will you do it now. please?
It's the kind of last-minute detail we might overlook.
I forgot.
Juan's taking a week's vacation.
It'll be his helper who attends my garden.
What is his name?
Alfredo? Alberto?
You'd better just put "Al." and then we'll be correct in any case.
I'll take care of it.
Just leave it on the table.
Turn that off. will you?
I think we can do without music tonight.
Will you have your liqueur?
Is there any particular reason why I shouldn't?
Did I tell you to help yourself?
Well. I'm very sorry.
I hate a sticky bottle.
I told you.
I made a promise.
I'll tell you the whole story tomorrow. and you'll see it's got nothing to do with you and me.
Vow of silence again?
Suppose I have nothing to say.
Well. I said something.
Did you hear me?
I said I love you.
I didn't ask for that.
I know you didn't.
But I know if I lie.
I'll lose you.
I don't want to lose you.
Harriet.
Do you still want to go home?
No.
Do you believe me now?
I'm not sure. but I don't want to go home.
I'm going to leave the note for the gardener.
Please forgive me for not knocking.
I forgot my manners in my anxiety to see that every window in the house is tightly closed.
If it should rain. my floors would turn into soaking sponges.
Yes.
The weather report is ghastly... high winds. terrible drop in temperature.
We may have to postpone our trip.
The sun will be shining for us when we get to New Mexico.
I promise you.
Have a good sleep.
Mrs. Dimmock.
It's a coincidence. isn't it?
I couldn't sleep either.
Yes.
I never can sleep through the night before a trip.
I guess it's because
I haven't traveled much.
Sleeplessness can be brought on by any number of apprehensions.
In your case. I daresay even I can diagnose the cause.
You've been too preoccupied about your money.
Oh. no.
It's the last thing on my mind.
I think I'll have some hot milk.
Perhaps it will help me sleep.
When I turned on the light. you were on the verge of making a phone call.
Yes.
I was checking with the weather bureau.
I thought you might be calling the market to order new toothpaste and stockings.
What a fraud you are!
You come into my house in the guise of a faithful companion.
You want to utterly destroy me.
- I didn't come here to destroy.
- You did. however. lie.
So did you.
Edna never left this house. did she?
What was Edna Tinsley to you?
For many. many years she lived in my house.
We ate together. and shopped and traveled.
She was my companion.
Do you expect me to believe that...
I don't care what you believe!
I shared bread with my companion. not crumbs.
- I never humiliated her.
- She left your service?
Yes. she did. and that was my doing.
She was ready to come back to me.
She told me so over the phone. her voice shaking she was so frightened of you!
Where is she?!
When you left the house this afternoon. you went to meet someone. didn't you?
That girl across the way.
How many women have you killed?
You could have lasted quite a few years.
You expect me to be flattered?
I expected a little loyalty.
It isn't often that I find someone whose company I enjoy. truly enjoy.
I saw many happy years ahead for both of us.
You are the only mistake I made.
Didn't you ever think you'd be found out?
No! And I won't be!
You've given yourself away.
To you?
You are a dead woman.
Oh. no.
I'm alive. see?
I'm very much alive. and I'm not going to be your next victim!
Dead.
It was dead all the time!
Good morning. Your nephew called a few minutes ago.
Your phone hasn't been answering. and he's concerned.
Won't you please come in?
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting in that awful wind.
Would you call George and assure him we have survived the storm?
Of course. poor Mrs. Dimmock went out early this morning in spite of all my warnings and received a terrible blow from a tree branch.
Oh. will you excuse me a moment?
- You go ahead. Help yourself.
- No. thank you. l...
I wish you wouldn't try to get up.
At least not yet.
I do insist that you continue resting.
She wants to drive into town to get my sinus prescription filled.
It's a touching gesture. I must say. but I shan't allow her to do it.
Well. maybe I could.
I wouldn't think of it. Mrs. Vaughn.
My sinus isn't that serious.
Well. maybe I can get Mrs. Dimmock a doctor.
She's recovering very nicely.
However. if you could report my phone. we'd be able to communicate with the outside world again.
I'd be glad to.
Thank you so very much.
Mrs. Vaughn.
We will pretend that you are loyal to the bitter end. running off to fill my prescription no matter what the weather. or your own health.
How is Mrs. Marrable?
Fire. except for
a sirus leadacle.
Sinus headache.
I'll tell him.
I imagine we'll be out to see her after a while.
All right. then.
Yeah. Bye-bye.
Hey. Harriet. I thought you said
Mrs. Dimmock was sick.
Come here. Iook at her.
I'm surprised she got her way.
What are you trying to tell me?
I told...
Who did you tell?
Who?!
Was it the girl across the road. your friend?
Who?!
Tell me this instant!
Tell me who!
If they were up early this morning. how come nobody's answering?
I don't know. Mike.
Mrs. Dimmock went off in the car.
- How long ago?
- About a couple of hours.
- You live here?
- No. my aunt does.
I hope you've got a key.
No one's opening the door.
Aunt Claire. are you all right?
What?
What's going on?
Ma'am. your phone's out of order. I have to check it.
Yes. of course.
Please come in.
- Where's Mrs. Dimm...
- Isn't she here?
Oh. She must have gone to the drugstore after all.
Nothing would satisfy Mrs. Dimmock. but she had to fetch my medicine. and I took two pills. and she...
Must've been quite potent!
I still feel rather groggy.
Mr. Darrah. how nice to see you again.
And won't you come in. too. Mrs. Vaughn?
You haven't seen
Mrs. Dimmock. have you?
I saw her drive away a while ago.
Isn't she back yet?
Well. it seems she's not.
Phone's working fine.
By the way. there's a call for you. Mrs. Marrable.
Would you get it. George?
What drugstore did she usually go to?
I don't know. Why?
I thought we might call and find out if she'd been there or when she left.
Aunt Claire?
I'm afraid this is going to come as quite a shock to you...
Mrs. Dimmock was found in your car.
It went off the dirt road into the lake.
Yes?
And Mrs. Dimmock?
Well. I'm afraid she's dead.
M o o a o
I trust you.
Why can't you trust me?
You said she was hurt.
Yes. by a branch.
- Mrs. Marrable said she was...
- Are you quoting me. Mrs. Vaughn?
I'm sorry.
She shouldn't have been driving if she felt sick.
Is the car wrecked?
Oh. Julia!
It's not unfeeling to be practical.
Why was she so eager to drive off this morning?
If I were you. Aunt Claire. I'd check and see if everything's all right.
I don't understand you people!
You blame her. you suspect her. and no one has a kind word to say.
Fate has dealt me a cruel enough blow without your compounding it.
I don't understand you either.
Mrs. Marrable.
- Nobody seems to care.
- Well. I care.
M o o a o
I've got to go to town.
I'll be back.
Yes?
This is your very distressed neighbor.
I'm dreadfully lonely.
Will you and James join me for cocktails?
I'll have something different for him. of course.
I'm afraid
I have some errands.
I would be ever so grateful if you would come to see me this afternoon.
Won't you please?
Please.
All right. I'll come.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Will 5:30 suit you?
Fire.
When are you gonna talk to Mrs. Marrable?
Why are you picking on her?
You're not from around here.
You don't know her like we do.
Is she above suspicion. Sheriff?
You're crazy.
You're sure that eggnog is all right?
Yes. it's fine.
You know. Mrs. Dimmock and I used to sit here every evening before dinner.
I'm sure we shall both miss her.
Isn't that true. Mrs. Vaughn?
Yes. I'll miss her.
I didn't know her that well.
You didn't?
Nevertheless... she told me that she was so pleased to have found a neighbor she could confide in.
Confide?
I'm afraid that we have to go now.
Already?
I haven't had a good look at these stamps yet.
You may take them with you.
Yeah? The sword. too?
Of course. You may have the whole briefcase.
For good?
I really don't think you should.
I insist.
James. you haven't finished your eggnog.
We really should be going.
I'll help you carry your briefcase home.
You'll never have a case against Mrs. Marrable. so why am I wasting my time with witnesses?
This is the first and the last.
Juan. come in.
Juan. this gentleman wants to talk to you... about Mrs. Marrable.
Mrs. Marrable.
But why didn't you tell me?
I thought it was something bad.
Come in here!
They've torn you out by your roots.
This is my garden.
This is my house.
This is my land.
And you trespassed!
You trampled my flower bed. and you killed my pine trees!
You had no right!
You had no right!
Who gave you the right to do this. to deprive me?
Who?
I'm still alive. Mrs. Marrable. in spite of your eggnog and your fire.
I've got to be grateful to Mike for that.
Harriet says
I've gotta return this even though you gave it to me to keep.
These stamps are worth a whole lot.
Mr. Darrah says they're worth over $100.000.
Joseph...
Marrable.
He must've hated me more than I hated him.
Would you kindly drive me into town?
Since I'm all alone. it seems fitting that
I should apply for a position.
I think I would make a most acceptable companion. don't you agree?
I have savings of my own... and I have no one left in the world.
After all...
I'd make a very handsome pine tree!
Katya...
Don't, you mustn't. It was all such a long time ago, Georgia.
Not for me, Katya.
Not for me.
It's the blood of m y daughter on that blade.
I cling to m y hatred as I cling to this dagger.
Before I die, I swear I'll see this dagger plunged into his throat.
As I saw it in Tanya's because of him.
Crying won't help now.
He's back. Kurt is back.
Georgia.
Yes... Kurt is back. You can't stop the hand of fate.
My lord! My lord! Kurt is back!
What did you say?
Kurt is back.
Yes, Losat, I'm back.
I told you never to come back.
Who are you trying to frighten,
Kurt?
No one... I came back because I heard of your marriage.
Good luck.
My compliments, Nevenka.
Thank you, Kurt.
Tell the truth, Kurt. What do you want?
Brother, I came back to compliment you on your choice of a wife.
You must be tired, Kurt.
Kurt, you're not m y son. You're a serpent. You like to make others suffer.
You seduced Tanya, and then abandoned her, causing her to kill herself.
The same old story.
Father, you promised.
He didn't come back to seek m y forgiveness.
You're so wrong, father. I also came back for that.
No, I don't believe you.
Are you afraid of me,
Christian?
That which was once mine is now yours. Now, it is you who are the favorite son.
I've never been afraid of you.
As far as I'm concerned, you can stay if you want to.
All right, Kurt, you can stay.
I've never had a warmer welcome.
It's wonderful to see things being born, to see them born and to see them die.
Let me go.
My pretty little cousin. You're still in love with m y brother. You wouldn't exactly refuse him if he...
You miserable wretch.
You always wanted to marry him. And instead? Christian's marriage was bitter for you too.
Poisoned?
No, that's not the way it'll be, Kurt
Menliff. You'll die the same way you made m y daughter die.
I obtained forgiveness from the masters. I would not presume to that of the servants.
Ah, here are the masters.
I see you've already had your tea, Kurt.
Yes, I'm not in the habit of waiting.
Nobody asked you to.
You did well to remind me.
You shouldn't treat him like that.
You'll only make things worse.
You don't know him well, if you think he could be worse.
Father. There was a time when you weren't so afraid when I came to say goodnight.
You showed me the way. I've never forgotten it.
What do you want?
I have your forgiveness, but I must have m y rights restored to me, m y title and patrimony.
I shall soon be dead. I have not enough time to put you to the test.
Whatever was yours, you forfeited, forever. You did it yourself with your infam y.
Be careful, father.
Get out of here! Get out, I tell you.
I think you've got something against me. Isn't that true?
You're wrong. I've nothing for or against you.
Are you afraid of me?
You were fond of me once.
Yes, once.
You haven't changed, I see.
You always loved violence.
You two, search the grounds.
Where is Nevenka?
And how should I know?
And that whip?
This? I found it on the road a few yards outside the gate. I've been looking at m y estates.
It'll soon be night. It'll be harder to find her.
She's right. You'd better hurry.
Let's go.
They make quite a couple, but
I have the impression that Katya isn't so eager to find Nevenka.
You don't agree? You're an old fool, Georgia.
Let's light a lantern. I want to have a look in the moats.
Kurt...
Kurt...
My lady. My lady. Georgia,
Georgia. I found her. My lady.
God be praised. I thought she was dead. Let's take her home. Come, help me carry her.
She'll come around very soon now. It must have been fear more than anything else.
She must have been thrown from the saddle.
Where is Kurt?
Go call him.
Yes, sir.
Losat.
Losat.
What's wrong with her?
Only some welts on her back as though... as though somebody has whipped her, m y lord.
Go, go on.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Kurt? Mr. Kurt?
Kurt!
Father, don't look.
I had to stand the sight of him alive. It... it can't be any worse now.
Look. Look. The dagger.
The dagger. It's Tanya's. He's died the same death she did.
Tanya. Tanya. Rest now in peace.
God. Dear God. Thank you.
Thank you.
Have mercy on me, oh, God, according to Thy great mercy.
Block out mine inequities.
Wash me from mine inequities and cleanse me from m y sins, for I acknowledge mine inequity and m y sin is always before me. Against
Thee only have I sinned and done evil before Thee. For behold, I was conceived in inequities and in sins that m y mother conceived me. Turn away Thy face from m y sins.
Cast me not away from Thy face and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Eternal rest, grant unto him, oh, Lord, Absolve the souls of the faithful departed from every bond of sin and by the help of Thy grace, may they be enabled to escape the avenging judgement. Oh, God, by whose mercy the souls of the faithful find rest, bless this grave. Release the souls of all those buried here that they may rejoice with Thy saints forever through Christ our Lord, Amen.
Now, our son, Kurt Menliff, is ready for the last judgment. Let us pray for him.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost, amen.
Who is it?
It is I, Christian.
What do you want?
I want to speak to you, father.
I'm listening, son.
I... I wanted to speak to you about Kurt. It is hard for me to ask this, but I've got to know.
What?
Everybody was away. There was only you in the castle, you and Kurt.
You... you dare ask if I...
I've always obeyed you, father, as you well know. I have never dared to question you.
Get out!
Out of obedience, I married the woman you had once intended for m y brother. But now I must know.
What do you want to know?
If it was you who killed him, it's an act of justice.
Get out. Get out.
Thank you, Georgia.
What's wrong? Tell me.
I saw Losat. He said he saw a shadow moving in the chapel and a light.
Losat is crazier than you. It was obviously only the reflection of the moon.
- Kurt.
- Nevenka.
Kurt.
Nevenka, what's the matter?
It was Kurt. He was watching me. I saw him.
You mustn't be afraid. It was only an hallucination. If you want, I can stay with you tonight.
No, go to bed. I want to be alone.
All right, dear. I'll leave m y door open. Call me if you need anything.
Kurt.
Kurt. Oh, oh...
No. No. No. No. No.
Nevenka. What's wrong?
Tell me. What happened?
Kurt was here, alive. And he had his boots full of mud, as though he had climbed out of the grave.
Calm down, please, you've had a nightmare. There's no one here but me.
Look. He was the one who did this to me. And besides, there are the footprints.
What footprints?
They were there.
Nevenka, it was only a bad dream. There's nothing there.
Look for yourself.
No, no, it wasn't a dream. He was here, I tell you, he was here.
I saw the footprints and his hand.
Oh, m y God, his hand. It came out of the shadows like a spider. Oh, help me, Christian, help me.
Are you afraid? You always loved violence. You haven't changed and you never will.
My lady, you. I heard noises and
I came down to look. I thought...
What did you think?
Nothing. The dead can't move from their tombs.
Maybe they do, if they don't find peace.
Yes, we were happy then. Now, m y life is empty and meaningless.
Do you remember that lake we used to go to, that one up in the mountains?
You used to said with me in m y boat. You were just a little girl then.
Yes, I used to follow you everywhere.
Christian, why did you do that?
Katya, listen. We can still be happy.
No, it's too late now. It's too late.
No, no, dear, don't say that.
I've always loved you. And you love me, don't you?
Yes, Christian, I love you and
I'll always love you, but you're married now.
No, don't... don't touch me.
Call him. Call him and tell him you've always been mine.
No, I don't want you. I don't want you.
I've come back for you and to get m y revenge on all those who hate me.
You better leave, Georgia. Besides, there's nothing you can do now.
Just like Kurt.
The dagger has disappeared.
The count told me that... that it was here.
It's his revenge. He'll kill us all because we're all to blame.
Stop talking nonsense, Nevenka.
Are you trying to drive us crazy?
Someone will pay for this, father, be it man or ghost,
I promise you.
Christian, I've been looking for you.
What for?
I don't know. I thought perhaps if I was near I could help you.
No, dear, the only thing that will help me now is to be able to get revenge.
Leave me alone now, please. In a while, I'll come back to you.
Ah, it's me, Losat. I didn't mean to frighten you, miss. I've been watching Christian.
I'm worried about him. Listen, I've been wanting to ask you something for some time.
What?
The night when we were searching the motes for Nevenka.
Yes.
Did you stay all the time with Christian?
Yes, I think so. Why?
Are you sure that he never left you, never for a moment?
No. But, why do you ask?
You don't think that Christian...
Why, I don't think anything.
That's absurd.
Why the old count too? Why?
Georgia. You're the one who's got the dagger in your hand.
You can tell me everything, Katya.
I don't pretend to condemn you.
Oh, stop it. Where did you get that dagger?
You know very well, Katya, don't force me to say it.
Oh, stop it, please. You had a reason to kill Kurt, not I. Tell me where you found that knife.
Under the mattress of your bed, Katya.
No!
Christian.
Christian, I know who killed your father.
What?
Yes. I could have killed Kurt. Oh, you bet I could. But, the count, no.
I'd never kill him, you understand?
If you found that knife there, then you or somebody else put it there.
It wasn't I, Katya, not I.
Throw away that cursed knife.
I don't want to ever see it again.
Throw it away.
No, Katya, no. It's not possible.
You don't believe me. You think I'm lying. Answer me.
I don't know. I don't know. I can't possibly imagine that one of us is a murderer. No, it's absurd.
But, still, somebody here killed him.
But, now we know, Christian.
No, Katya no.
You're a coward. You're afraid to face the truth. Kurt in your place...
Kurt. Kurt. It's always him,
Kurt instead of me. He's the one you've always loved.
That's not true. That's not true.
And you've always wanted to marry him. I've always known it.
If that's why you killed him, it was a useless crime. I hated him. I've always hated him. I hated him.
Novenka!
I heard screaming. I thought it came from your father's room.
She's not here. Let's look in her room.
The footprints lead toward the garden. Someone carried her off.
You'd better wait here.
Christian, don't go alone.
Katya, come inside, Katya.
Please, come inside.
Losat. What are you doing here?
Oh, it's you, me lord.
Where have you taken
Nevenka?
Me?
There were footprints from boots just like you have.
I was making m y rounds at the castle when I thought that I saw somebody in here.
Don't lie to me, Losat.
Oh, no.
There was no one else in here but you.
My lord, you don't think that...
Quiet. Come along.
The footprints are coming from the secret passage.
Help me.
But, who could have put her in there?
Nevenka, Nevenka.
Kurt.
How is Nevenka?
Delirious. She said it was Kurt who carried her there. She also said that he whipped her,
He carried her to the crypt and put her in the tomb. We've got to help,
Katya, do something.
This time I even heard Kurt's laugh.
But, I still can't bring m yself to believe in ghosts.
I know it's difficult to understand, but what do we know about what happens after death?
I almost believe he's alive.
Alive? But you saw him too. You saw him when he was placed in the casket.
With our own eyes, we both saw him buried. I don't really believe that
Nevenka saw him out there.
No, no, there's no other possible explanation. Kurt's still alive and hiding in the castle.
I've got to find him. I'll go crazy. For a moment, I've suspected you... I've suspected m yself.
Then, if what you say is true, he could have hidden the dagger in m y room. I'm afraid, Christian.
Katya.
Oh, Christian, there was someone here.
Calm down, Katya, it's all right.
I'll go and look.
There are the footprints.
They're the same.
What are you going to do?
Open the coffin. Help me.
Carry it over there.
Nevenka.
They're opening m y tomb. This is the last time I can be with you.
Why do you torture me?
Because you belong to me, only to me.
What do you want?
We've got to go away from here forever right now.
I can't do that.
Yes, you will. You love me. And your love for me is greater than anything in this world.
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I...
It's not recognizable. It could be anybody.
The clothes are Kurt's. Let's put it back in the tomb, for
God's sake.
No.
What are you doing now?
I'll destroy it.
Where are you, Kurt?
I'm coming, Kurt. I've never been afraid of you.
Nevenka.
My lord. Oh, sir, what happened? Are you hurt?
Come on. It's not important.
Hurry. It's locked from the inside. We'll have to go by way of the chapel.
Yes, you're right.
Why? Why did I do it, Kurt?
Why?
I love you, Kurt, only you.
You were right. I love you, Kurt, only you. But, there's an end to everything, Kurt.
No, no, Nevenka, no.
Nevenka.
Forgive me. I had to do what... what Kurt told me. I killed him again, this time for good.
He hated you. I love you. Christian.
So, she was the one. She killed your brother and your father.
Yes. Perhaps she was possessed.
She was convinced Kurt was alive.
She killed herself thinking she was killing him. Let's hope she's free of him forever.
Good afternoon, Miss Gault.
Good afternoon, Judson.
I'd like to see...
Hello, Kate.
What do you want?
Will you tell Guy that
I would like to see him?
I'm afraid he doesn't wish to see you.
I shall have to hear that from Guy himself.
Oh, really, Kate, don't you think... at least I deserve an explanation?
Very well.
Will you please wait here?
I'm sorry.
Guy does not wish to see you.
I told you I'd have to hear that from Guy himself.
Guy?
Emily.
Emily, you... you shouldn't have come here.
So I understand.
But, Guy, don't you think
I deserve something... a little more than a letter?
Look at me and tell me you don't love me.
My darling,
I do love you... very much.
That's why I sent you that letter... because I do love you.
Now, darling, please go away and forget you ever met me.
I know what happened, Guy.
My father told me.
Did he tell you why?
Despite what he thinks...
I didn't run away from what was inside that coffin... but from what I knew to be inside me.
I... I don't understand.
I'd hoped to spare you this.
If you do understand, then you'll realize...
Why there can never be a marriage between us.
Come with me.
Where does this lead?
Below.
Are you all right?
Yes, I... I think so.
Do you want to go back?
No. No.
You've often expressed a wish to meet the rest of my family.
Well, here they are... all my ancestors, famous and infamous... laid here to... what is the term?
To rest.
From the beginning, death has come... to the Carrells like an assassin... but the least fortunate of all was my father.
How did he die?
Like a single candle in a dark and airless room.
Emily, my father...
Guy.
Kate, why are you here?
It's time for your medicine.
Oh, yes. I'd forgotten.
I'm sorry. Thank you.
What medicine?
Laudanum.
Guy, is this the cause of...
No. Not a cause. An effect.
Without it, I couldn't sleep.
Guy, tell me.
I should never have gone with your father... and those other doctors that night.
I'm interested only in private research.
I can never forget that poor wretch...
Whose grave they robbed.
His staring eyes... his clutching hands... his fingernails broken and bloody... from the vain attempt to claw away... the lid of that coffin.
You see, all this has a special meaning for me, Emily.
For years,
I've lived in dread... of being buried alive.
Can you possibly conceive it?
The unendurable oppression of the lungs... the stifling fumes of the damp earth... the rigid embrace of the coffin... the blackness of absolute night... and the silence... like an overwhelming sea.
And then, invisible in the darkness... but all too hideously real to the other senses... the presence of the conqueror worm.
Guy!
I'm sorry.
These are just morbid fantasies.
I'm afraid not.
Every member of my family... has met with a violent and horrible death.
I now wait my turn.
How did your father die?
Catalepsy.
Do you know what that is?
When it strikes... the victim gives every outWard sign of being dead.
But he's not dead. He's alive.
I was barely 13 when my father was stricken.
Doctor said it was a heart attack... and there was a funeral... and he was sealed in this vault.
That night...
I heard him crying out... a pitiful, desperate cry.
I begged with them.
I pleaded with them.
"He's alive.
He's alive", I said... but no one would believe me.
Because it wasn't true.
It was!
I heard him.
In your mind.
No, Kate.
It would be easier for me to accept that.
But I know the truth.
God help me,
I know the truth!
My father's inheritance and my wedding gift to you... catalepsy.
Now you know why
I asked your forgiveness.
There's nothing to forgive.
But you must understand...
I understand that I love you... and that I want to be your wife.
Miss Gault...
My brother is ill.
Then I shall nurse him back to health.
Emily...
Guy, if you love me... if you really love me... you won't shut me out of your life.
You'll let me share it with you.
You want that?
After what you've heard?
More than ever before.
Tell her, Guy.
Tell her.
Kate... you've been most considerate... and you've always thought of my welfare.
That is true.
But in some things,
I must make my own decisions.
Of course.
Then I take it you have made your decision?
I have.
Then let it be on your own head.
Do you, Guy... take Emily to be your lawful wedded wife... for better, for worse, in sickness and in health...
So long as ye both shall live?
I do.
Do you, Emily, take Guy... to be your lawful wedded husband... for better, for worse... in sickness and in health...
So long as ye both shall live?
I do.
If there be any here who know just cause...
Why these two should not be joined together... in holy matrimony... let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
The ring, please.
Repeat after me.
With this ring, I thee wed.
Then I do pronounce you man and wife.
Champagne, Lady Catherine?
Thank you.
Oh, yes, a beautiful ceremony.
A toast... to the most beautiful bride... and the most fortunate groom who ever lived.
May they be happy to the end of their days.
No, Guy. Not in front of everyone.
Well, then, you'd better go and play something... before I lose control completely.
Isn't she beautiful?
Very.
Are you enjoying yourself, father?
Hmm?
Don't stop playing, Emily.
It's lovely.
I want to wish you every happiness.
Thank you, Miles.
You're going to Venice... for the honeymoon, I understand.
What was that? I... I'm sorry.
I inquired if you were going to Venice for your honeymoon... and I'm not accustomed to people...
Carrell!
Forgive me, please.
What the devil's the matter with the fella?
- Emily.
- Yes, darling?
That melody you're playing... what is it?
"Molly Malone".
Don't you like it?
No. Please stop playing.
But it's a charming melody.
I said please stop playing it!
I'm sorry. I...
Is there anything I can do, Guy?
No, nothing.
I'll come with you, Guy.
No. Please leave me alone!
All of you, leave me alone, please!
Guy. Guy, darling.
Please wake up.
They've all gone now.
Yes, Emily.
Are you feeling better?
I think so.
What's the matter, Guy?
What happened to you down there?
I can't remember, exactly.
I was talking with your father, and then...
And then what?
The music.
Something about the music you were playing.
What was it about the music?
It was the tune he was whistling that night.
Who was?
There were two of them.
Sweeney and Mole were their names.
Oh, filthy, disgusting creatures.
They were the ones who opened the grave... and all the time whistling that loathsome tune.
Darling...
Now we're alone.
Alone.
Just the two of us.
Together.
What was that?
I don't know.
It sounded like a scream.
Stay here.
King.
King, old fellow.
He is dead.
It must have been the lightning.
We'll bury him.
As you wish.
Now let us go in out of the rain, Guy.
Why, he was only stunned.
I was going to bury him.
Guy.
I was going to bury him... alive!
Sketching? Out here?
No, not sketching, really.
Making plans.
For the house?
You're very inquisitive.
Well, I'm married now... and wives are supposed to be inquisitive.
And husbands are supposed to be secretive.
However, I'll tell you one of my secrets... a very closely guarded one.
I possess the ability to kiss a woman without touching her.
Oh, Guy, really.
You don't believe me?
I'll wager you a shilling.
All right.
I'll accept your wager.
Come on. Show me this miracle.
With pleasure.
There you are.
What about your wager?
Oh, I lose the wager.
Here's your shilling.
It was worth much more, believe me.
Guy.
Yes, dear?
What about our honeymoon?
You promised you'd take me to Venice, remember?
Aren't you happy here?
Oh, yes, of course... but, well, you're on your own so much... and I worry about you.
You must be patient with me.
All right.
In the meantime...
I'll brighten up that dreary old house.
There.
Look. Aren't they lovely?
Take them away!
Guy, don't be so ill-tempered.
I can't bear living in a house without flowers... and neither should you.
Just throw them away!
I loathe flowers.
You must promise never to bring... those sickly funeral decorations into the house.
Guy, I was only...
You must promise!
All right.
I promise.
Milady?
Yes, Judson.
Dr. Archer has arrived, milady.
Oh. Show him in, please.
- This way, sir.
- Thank you, Judson.
Emily.
Miles, dear, how kind of you to come.
I came directly.
I received your message.
Is something wrong?
Yes.
Guy is ill.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I suppose it's the Italian climate.
But we didn't go to Italy.
But I thought...
We've been here in this house... ever since the day we were married.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
All I know is that Guy is ill... and you've got to help him, Miles.
My dear, surely your father... has done everything that can be done.
My father has done nothing.
To him, Guy is a perfectly healthy man... but that isn't true... and you must do something to help him, Miles.
If you don't, something terrible will happen.
He's a completely changed man.
I don't even recognize him.
Well, I'll do whatever I can.
Why don't you take me to him?
Thank you, Miles.
I'll just get my wrap.
Your wrap?
It's chilly on the moors.
Emily...
Where is he?
There.
He started building it a month ago.
Guy?
Yes?
Let me in.
Go away. I'm busy.
Guy, please open the door.
Emily, didn't you understand me? I said I...
Hello, Guy.
Hello, Miles.
I'm glad to see you.
I must apologize.
I was very rude.
Yes, Guy, you were.
Very rude.
You see, I've been quite ill.
So I understand.
Guy, I have brought
Miles along... to see if he can help you.
That's very solicitous, but quite unnecessary.
I'm helping myself now.
How, Guy?
How?
Come inside. I'll show you.
This is it... my grand plan.
What shall it be?
Some liqueur, brandy, amontillado?
Guy, I brought...
Now, let us drink to something appropriate...
To death.
Not drinking?
What a pity.
It's really quite good.
Guy.
Yes, my dear?
You wish to say something?
No.
Well, in that case... let me tell you about my latest addition.
I thought of it the night before last.
Of course, it's highly unlikely I shall ever use it... but one never knows, does one?
Permits of easy egress... and it's completely impassable from the outside.
A simple arrangement,
I grant, but effective.
Guy, this is madness.
Madness? It's the only
Sane ansWer to my problem.
I'll show you just how mad I am.
I suppose she's told you my father was a cataleptic?
No, but that doesn't mean that...
And I am prone to the same affliction.
Very well.
Let us consider the following.
Apropos of nothing at all,
I have an attack.
Let us say it happens during dinner.
Emily sends Judson to fetch a doctor.
The doctor arrives, he examines me... and pronounces me dead.
I am, of course, alive.
You know the nature of catalepsy.
But to the rest of the world, I am gone... passed on, deceased.
So a funeral is held... and I'm brought down here to this vault... and placed in this coffin.
The mourners have departed... the doors are both locked... and I'm alone.
Now, pay close attention.
Now, the slightest movement of my finger... caused that to happen.
I am now free of the casket... but I'm still capable of only slight effort.
So...
"But", you say, "supposing no one hears the bell"?
The departing mourners lock both the doors.
But is that really foolproof?
What if the gate should stick?
You see?
But, of course, it's barely possible... that all these methods might fail.
So...
But tools break, too, don't they?
A recent invention by a Swedish chemist named Nobel.
It's called dynamite.
It's an explosive.
But how can one be sure the stuff will work?
One can't, of course.
So... one has a bit of food...
Something to drink... every five or ten minutes or so... rings the bell.
Reads a periodical or perhaps a book.
In the event the strain becomes too great... one can avail oneself with the soothing effects of music.
And then one simply waits.
Rather well thought out, don't you think?
But no plan is ever perfect.
So now comes the "piece de resistance"... or perhaps one should say the "coup de grace".
What is it, Guy?
What is it?
The cure for all suffering.
The answer to all problems.
The key, my darling, to heaven... or to hell... or to nothingness.
Poison.
Thank you, Judson.
Tea is ready in the dining room, milady.
Thank you.
How do you explain it, Miles?
Well, I don't just yet.
However, I venture to guess... that the episode at the cemetery... changed the general fear into a specific obsession.
Then... you don't think it's catalepsy?
He's never had these attacks before, has he?
I mean, fainting spells, dizzy spells?
No. No.
But his father...
To the best of our knowledge... catalepsy is not an inherited affliction.
And there's a new line of thought... among some of us... myself, Cargrave, and a few others... that may shed some light on Guy's case.
You see... most people tend to think of the body... and the mind as being totally different... two separate entities...
Whereas, in point of fact... they're actually linked.
No sugar.
Do you follow me?
Yes, I think so.
You see, physically...
Guy may be perfectly sound now.
However, this constant fear... that gnaws at him night and day... may actually bring about a condition of catalepsy...
Where no such condition exists now.
I see.
Well, what can be done?
I am not sure.
I'm not sure at all.
However, I do know this... that Guy's mind is like a keg of gunpowder... and the smallest thing might set the fuse... the most innocent reminder of death... corpses, graves, anything at all.
That's the first thing you must remember.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Oh, Miles, I wish you could come and stay with us.
Well, I was just thinking.
The laboratory downstairs.
What about it?
Well, you may know that Guy offered me the use of it... in order to further my researches.
If I accepted his offer...
I might be able to come here from time to time.
Oh, Miles, that would be absolutely wonderful!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, I must go now, but I'll be back.
And remember, the smallest thing.
Don't forget.
I won't forget.
Dear Emily.
Frog, please, Judson.
Yes, sir.
Your frog, sir.
Oh, put him down here, please.
Now, if we place one terminal of the galvanic battery... in contact with the nerve... and the other in contact with muscle...
We cause a contraction of the muscle.
There.
You see?
Now, if you could control the responses... of the human mind as easily as you control... the muscles of a frog...
I might have some faith in your work.
Someday, we may be able to... if we continue our research.
And if you were to continue your work...
No, no, no, no.
You know, I think you should make an effort... to take your mind off your fears.
You should get away from this place.
Take Emily to Venice.
Then when you return... most of your problem would have disappeared.
Perhaps you're right.
I'll think about it.
Don't think about it. Do it.
I may. MeanWhile...
I'll leave you to your little friends.
Do you wish to continue, sir?
Hmm?
Oh, yes, Judson.
You and Miles were right.
I do have to get outside occasionally.
I told you.
All we need is each other.
We need nothing else to be happy.
How true.
How true that really is.
What is it?
Listen!
What's the matter, Guy?
That whistling.
I don't hear anything.
Listen, I tell you!
Guy!
Guy, don't run away!
Guy!
Guy!
Darling! Darling, what's wrong?
I saw them.
You saw whom?
Those two filthy grave robbers.
They were coming for me.
Ask Emily.
She saw them, too.
No. I saw no one.
But you must have.
They passed right by us.
Surely you heard them.
Guy, you're overwrought.
I... please.
They were coming for me.
No one questions your word, Guy.
Don't humor me! I'm not mad!
I saw them as clearly as I'm seeing you!
Darling, let's go back to the house... and you can rest, and... well... then you can talk.
Come on.
You didn't see them?
No.
It was dark and foggy.
I'll join you downstairs in a little while.
I just want to rest some more.
All right, darling.
We'll all be waiting for you.
How is he, Emily?
Well, he's better, I think.
- He's resting.
- Good.
What do you think he saw, Miles?
Exactly what he said... the two grave robbers.
Well, then why didn't I see them?
Because they weren't real.
You mean, they were
Something supernatural?
I don't deny the possibility of the supernatural.
However, I do believe... that there's a more logical explanation.
You see, Emily, the human mind...
Well, it's a remarkable instrument.
It can create something out of nothing... and that's probably what happened.
Well...
What you're trying to say is that...
Guy is mad.
No. Nothing of the sort.
He's disturbed, and there's a difference.
If his father was prematurely interred...
He wasn't.
How do you know?
I know because
I went to the crypt... and saw for myself.
My father rests in peace.
It's the wind.
- Guy!
- He's there!
There's nobody there.
But you must have seen him!
I saw only you, Guy.
Miles, what are we going to do?
Ever since that night on the moors, he's been...
Well, I just don't recognize him anymore.
Have you asked him to go away with you?
How can I?
He won't come out of that terrible place... and won't let me in.
All he wants to do is just sit and brood.
Miles, you've got to do something.
Emily, I'm afraid
I've done all I can.
Someday, treatment of the mind...
Will be a science... and they'll be able to cope with such problems.
But at this present stage...
Emily, there is one thing we haven't tried.
Well, just tell me what to do.
Guy?
Guy, let me in.
Well, this is quite a surprise.
Is there any purpose to this visit... apart, that is, from interrupting my work?
Yes.
I thought you'd given up painting.
It's merely portraiture.
Let us say I'm entering a new period.
May I see it?
I don't think you'd find it very pleasing.
Surely I should be the one to decide that.
Very well. Don't say
I didn't warn you.
I call it "some sonsummations devoutly to be wished".
But why?
Think.
All these dreadful tortures you see depicted here... the rack and the stake... the whole ghastly catalog... are they not indeed devoutly to be wished... preferred to that fate which is the most terrible of all?
That fate has already come to pass, Guy.
What are you talking about?
About you.
You don't fear burial alive... because you are already buried alive.
What is it you're afraid of?
Being locked in a tomb?
Why, you've been locked in a tomb for months.
This tomb!
And I've been your widow... and I don't like being your widow, Guy.
And what's more, I'm not going to be much longer.
Emily!
No, Guy. I'm here to give you a choice.
You can have this... this living death... or you can have me... but you can't have both.
Emily, please.
I love you, Guy.
I love you very much... and I want to take care of you... but as long as you're here, I can't.
No one can.
I realize that, but...
I'm so afraid.
Oh, you needn't be, my darling.
I promise you.
Look at me.
I promise you that no matter what happens...
I'll never let them take you down to that... that horrible crypt.
Trust me to take care of you.
I do trust you, Emily, but it isn't that.
Guy, if you do choose me... then you must destroy this evil vault.
Wipe it off the face of the earth... and out of your mind forever!
If you don't... then I shall never see you again.
Well, which is it to be?
Death by yourself... or life with me?
Emily!
Please forgive me, darling.
I wouldn't lose you.
I just couldn't.
Not for anything.
Oh, Guy, I love you.
Guy, that took great courage.
No. Once again,
I was motivated by fear... fear of losing something more valuable than my life.
You'll never regret it.
I pray God you're right.
I want to thank you both for asking me to the ceremony.
I suppose that now you'll be having that honeymoon, huh?
Yes, but first there will be a small party Friday night.
You will be with us,
Miles, won't you?
If your father doesn't take it into his mind... to keep me working at the hospital.
Oh, he won't, because we shall invite both of you.
Well, then, of course, in that case.
Lady Catherine?
Milord?
Thank you, Judson.
My friends, to life.
Dr. Gault, would you like a cigar?
Oh. Thank you. Yes.
- Join us, Miles?
- In just a moment.
It's extraordinary,
Lady Catherine... but he looks the picture of health... don't you agree?
Looks can be deceiving,
Dr. Archer.
Thank you.
Well, permit me to offer my congratulations... on your lordship's recovery.
I think you should offer them to Emily and to Miles.
They are responsible.
Well, Father, are you enjoying yourself?
I never enjoy myself.
I merely experience greater and lesser... degrees of tedium, that's all.
It's just the cat, darling.
Yes, I know... but why should
She cry like that?
Hungry, I expect.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Sounds as if it's coming from over there.
Poor little thing must be stuck.
Wait a moment.
Down here.
Look at that.
It's down here.
Down here.
There it is.
All right, old girl.
We'll have you out in a moment.
However could she have got behind there?
It must have crawled through.
Let me have the poor wee thing.
There, now.
What a thing to happen.
There, you see?
No harm done after all.
There. She's all right.
Guy, are you all right?
What if we hadn't heard her?
But we did hear her.
You haven't put these thoughts... out of your mind after all, have you?
Oh, of course he has.
This is just a sort of...
You haven't, have you?
Guy, you've got to put it out of your mind.
I've tried.
I've tried everything.
Not everything.
Guy, your fear of catalepsy is based on your belief... that your father was prematurely buried.
Isn't that correct?
I heard him. I heard his voice.
You think you heard it.
I heard his voice!
All right, then prove it.
What do you mean?
Just that... prove it.
Take me down to the crypt and show me his body.
I can't.
Because you know it isn't true.
- No!
- Yes.
Why else do you think you've avoided it?
Because you're afraid... afraid that this fear... is nothing more than a trick of your mind.
I'd give anything to find out if that were true.
All right, then take me downstairs.
All right.
I will.
No. Guy, don't you think you should rest?
Emily, Miles is right.
I've put this off long enough.
The key to the crypt... it's gone.
Who has access to these?
No one but myself.
But do you keep it locked?
No, but...
Guy, did you come down here and take the key?
I don't think so.
Is it possible for someone to do... a thing like that and not remember it?
It's possible.
You admit to doing... many things lately that you don't remember.
Well, it's unimportant.
We'll break it open.
Follow me.
Which one is it?
Over there.
I can't.
You must.
It's your only chance.
If you fail now, you'll be haunted forever.
Kate, bring me a mirror.
You're wasting your time.
He's dead.
No. No, he can't be.
He can't be.
He's finished. Heart attack.
Oh, no!
Are you sure, Dr. Gault?
Of course I am.
No, there's no sign of life, but to be absolutely sure...
We should make one more test.
Foolishness, Archer.
The man's dead.
Judson, help me with the galvanic battery.
No, don't do this.
Listen to me. I'm alive.
Can't you hear me?
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Uh, Kate, you and Emily had better leave the room.
Miles.
Miles! In the name of heaven!
Well? Is he dead or isn't he?
He is.
No. I'm not dead.
I'm alive!
Judson, help me with the battery.
We may as well take him back to the crypt.
No. I promised him that no matter what happens...
I'd never let them take him down to the crypt.
Nonsense, Emily.
Oh, well. It's your decision.
Man that is born of woman... hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery.
He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.
He fleeth as it were a shadow... and never continueth in one stay.
In the midst of life, we are in death.
Of whom may we seek for succor but of thee, dear Lord...
Who, for our sins, art justly displeased?
Yet, oh Lord God most mighty...
Oh holy and most merciful savior... deliver us not into the bitter pain of eternal death.
Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts.
Shut not thy merciful ears to thy prayers... but spare us, God most mighty.
O most merciful savior, thou most worthy judge eternal... suffer us not at our last hour... for any pains of death to fall from thee.
Suffer us not.
Pains of death.
Oh, please, help me!
Someone, help me.
Help me!
Amen.
You may say farewell now.
Good-bye, my darling.
Emily.
Emily, come back.
Come back!
They'll see me.
They'll look at my eyes.
They're not taking me to the crypt.
But... Where are they taking me?
Where? where?
Why can't I move?
Oh, God, why can't I move?
O merciful God...
We consign the soul of Guy Carrell... son of Gideon and Agatha Carrell... to thine eternal care.
Amen.
Look at me!
Someone, look at me!
Oh, for God's sake, please!
You can't bury me alive!
Can't you see I'm alive?
God, why can't I move? why can't I move?
No. No!
Help me.
Someone, help me!
I'm alive!
Can't you hear me?
Can't you see my eyes?
I'm alive! Alive! Ali...
You'll be leaving, I suppose... after the reading of the will.
Why should you say that?
No reason. I merely thought that under the circumstances... you might find this house rather disturbing.
To your conscience, I mean.
Kate, are you implying... that Emily is in any way responsible for Guy's death?
No one is responsible.
He died of a heart attack induced by shock.
Don't you understand?
Yes. I understand.
The fact is, he brought on the shock himself.
The episode in the crypt and all the others... they were planned, contrived.
Don't you see?
Planned? By whom?
By Guy himself.
In a strange way, he wanted to die.
Stop talking about him!
That's a bit much,
Mr. Sweeney.
What is, Mr. Mole?
The old gentleman sending us out here to dig up this one.
I mean, his own son-in-law!
Well, one stiff's pretty much like another.
Oh, we've struck wood.
Now, where's the bloody crowbar?
I believe I left it up on top.
Well, Mr. Mole, would you do me the kindness to fetch it down?
Yes, I will, Mr. Sweeney.
I found it, Mr. Sweeney!
Huh? No!
No! I never did nothing to you!
Please! Please!
I've never done nothing to you. Please!
Sweeney! You blithering idiot! what did you...
I told you to take him to my quarters.
Oh, well. May as well have a look at him now.
Yes.
Ironic, don't you think?
And rather fitting, really.
In life, Guy Carrell contributed nothing to medical science.
In death, he shall
Serve it admirably.
Sweeney?
No! You're dead! No!
Emily, there's nothing whatever wrong with you.
Well, not physically, perhaps.
Then why did you send
Judson for me? Hmm?
Well, I was afraid to be alone.
Well, I can understand that.
Perhaps you shouldn't be here.
Oh, Miles, don't you see that...
Please come and sit down.
Please?
Now, just for a moment, and then you must go to sleep.
Miles, you must know... or at least you must sense that...
I've been very worried today... that I'm in need of something or someone to give me solace.
You and I were very close once, Miles.
You remember that, don't you?
I can remember a medical student...
Who was poor as a church mouse... and a girl who wanted to be a great lady.
I was very foolish.
Oh, Miles... maybe it's not too late for us.
But, Emily...
I made a mistake.
Is that so very wrong?
Come in!
Dr. Archer.
What is it, Judson?
It's... excuse me, milady.
It's something I'd like you to see, sir... if you would.
- A medical matter?
- Yes.
Then certainly Dr. Gault could take care of it.
I think Dr. Gault would want you to come... as quickly as possible, sir.
Perhaps you had better go, Miles.
Now, come along, Judson.
Judson, why are you behaving so oddly?
I heard a sound from the laboratory, sir... just a bit ago, and...
Yes?
See for yourself, sir.
Who's that?
Miles?
No welcome?
No rejoicing?
No kiss?
He's been killed by electrical force.
Dr. Archer!
That's Sweeney.
Emily.
Emily?
Guy.
Now...
Guy, you've got to listen to me.
To what? More lies? More deceit?
More treachery?
No, no. That's not true.
Oh, but it is.
You were very clever, Emily.
Very clever.
In a way, I'm sorry to spoil your plans.
Oh, I had no plans.
It was Kate.
You... you wouldn't kill me, would you, Guy?
No, darling, not at all... just as you didn't kill me.
You wouldn't soil your pretty hands with murder.
No, you just stood aside and let them bury me alive!
No, Guy! No!
And so... I shall not kill you.
That sorry task I shall leave to the earth... and the darkness... and the terrified pounding of your own heart.
Guy, no! Not that!
Yes, my beautiful, my perfidious... my treacherous love... that.
No, Guy!
Guy!
Stay precisely where you are, Miles.
I've no desire to harm you.
What have you done, Guy?
Paid a debt of long standing.
No!
This has nothing to do with you.
I found that out earlier this evening.
In heaven's name, Guy!
Yes... in heaven's name.
Give me that shovel!
She's dead!
Thank God.
Kate, what are you saying?
Are you so blind?
Can't you see?
That's the key to the crypt.
She had no time to replace it.
I can't believe it. Not Emily.
Yes. Emily.
Sweet, beautiful, gentle Emily.
Once you told her how easy it would be... to use Guy's fear to kill him, she went to work.
First, the hiring of the grave robbers... to torment him... the cat in the wall... and finally the desecration of our father's tomb.
Oh, Guy!
I knew what she was doing... and I wanted to tell you... but you wouldn't have believed me.
I had to wait for proof.
You can see that, can't you?
But I waited too long.
I was too late.
Too late.
Are they ever going to get the heating fixed?
They are working at it, Professor.
Perhaps some of you scientists would like to give us a helping hand.
What are we going to do about lunch?
We haven't had breakfast yet.
Oh.
We'll call this lunch and go upstairs for breakfast.
Against all the evidence, Michael,
I'd say you had a very unscientific mind.
I'm not a scientist, I'm a teacher.
You're a scientist, and you're supposed to respect a natural order in all things.
Breakfast comes before lunch. Ow!
Mm.
And marriage should come before a honeymoon cruise.
You're on the wrong boat.
Michael!
Now, stop. This is supposed to be a serious congress of physicists.
Tell me, Miss Sherman, what is your position on antideuterons?
Now, listen here, what's your position on a July wedding?
Oh... July,
August, September or October.
Don't let me hurry you.
I just don't want to be the only common-law wife on campus.
Forget the campus.
Oh, will you stop brooding?
I like to brood.
Look, I wish you'd get that teaching job in perspective.
I know it's not what you want, but honestly -
Oh, no!
I'm greatly honoured. It's a unique distinction.
Enough. Will you stop it?
No, it's true.
It's an unparalleled appointment in the history of American science.
- Oh, stop it.
- No!
Most scientists just start out teaching, end up in Washington.
But Wrong-Way Armstrong starts in Washington and he ends up teaching.
- No, our agreement, remember?
- What?
You weren't going to blast off about Washington, and I wasn't gonna ask you again why you didn't want me to come on this trip.
- OK?
- Yeah.
- Professor Armstrong?
- Just a minute.
- Yes?
- A radiogram, sir.
- I'm sorry. This isn't for me.
- But, sir, if you please -
No, I'm sorry. It must be a mistake.
You're freezing.
Well, what shall we have for breakfast-lunch or lunch-breakfast?
Let's see, uh... corn flakes, soup.
Hello, Michael. Glad that heat's on again.
I'll say.
Good evening. I'm Michael Armstrong.
A radiogram arrived earlier for me.
May I have another look at it, please?
Yes, sir. One moment.
- Hello.
- Oh, Professor.
Did you perhaps see Miss Sherman?
I was supposed to have with her a luncheon date.
Maybe she had forgotten.
Well, I believe she had a cold.
Stayed in bed.
A cold? Aw, that's too bad.
Here you are, sir.
Oh, thank you.
Well, I think she's up by now.
Why don't you look in the lounge?
Good.
Well, uh... I couldn't have been awake this morning.
I'd like to send an answer.
- Please, sir.
- Thank you.
Darling, we've got connecting rooms.
That's Scandinavian efficiency.
Shall I unpack for you?
I'd rather do it myself.
OK.
Hello?
No, I'm afraid he's busy right now.
This is Miss Sherman, his assistant, speaking.
May I take a message?
Oh, just one moment, please.
Michael, it's some bookshop for you.
Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
He'll be right here.
Hello?
No, Operator. I was talking on this line.
Well, so much for your Scandinavian efficiency.
You've been cut off.
They said something about sending you a radiogram.
Not me.
How much longer are you going to be?
Aren't we supposed to have lunch with that Swedish professor, Hengstrom?
Yeah, at 1:30.
- Where?
- Here at the hotel.
Good, that gives us plenty of time.
What do you want to do?
Uh, look, I've gotta shave.
Why don't you take a stroll?
Hello?
Oh, it's you again.
Yes, we were cut off.
I see. What's the address, please?
And that's where?
And then follow the canal?
Yes, thank you. We'll find it.
- Michael, I'm going for that stroll.
- See you in half an hour.
It seems you ordered a book.
I'll pick it up for you.
- What?
- The bookshop, I'm going there.
No, wait!
Oh, Miss Sherman.
Oh, good morning.
- You are better this morning?
- Better?
Our luncheon engagement yesterday on the ship. You had a cold.
Oh, uh... Yes, much better, thank you.
Good. Then perhaps we can have our lunch now.
Oh, uh, well, we have a date with Professor Hengstrom.
- I'm awfully sorry.
- Yes, I too.
Look, at dinner tonight, why don't you sit at our table?
Perhaps.
Good.
Oh, could you tell me where the Elmo Bookstore is, please?
- Taxi?
- Oh, no. I want this address.
Oh, Hotel d'Angleterre.
No, the address underneath.
It is quite near. We will go together.
You seem to like him very much.
Like him? Of course. We're engaged.
- Didn't you know?
- No.
We plan to be married in a couple of months.
Here we are.
What's the matter, Professor?
Don't you approve of marriage?
Of course I do.
Uh, do you have a book for Professor Armstrong?
One moment.
Freddy?
Why didn't the professor come himself?
He's busy at the moment.
I'm his assistant, Miss Sherman.
I think we spoke on the phone.
Oh, yes. Will you come this way?
Excuse us.
Them religious books is in a hell of a shambles, Magda.
Thank you. How much is that?
On account.
We charge it, see? Diners Club.
Take good care of it, dear heart.
It's a first edition, is that.
Thank you.
- Who is this Professor Armstrong?
- Didn't hear you, love.
Who is this Professor Armstrong?
- What have you got there?
- English Bibles.
Take them to the stockroom and pray for him.
Thank you.
Oh, Professor Manfred, you know Professor Hengstrom, don't you?
Swedish Academy of Science.
Of course. We met on the boat.
Oh, well, we'll see you at dinner, then.
Table 12.
- Professor Armstrong.
- Excuse me.
I hope you're looking forward to our lunch.
This hotel has an excellent smorgasbord.
You know, Miss Sherman,
I've often wondered why one of the leading hotels in
Denmark should be called the 'Hotel of England' in the French language.
I suppose it's the ideal title for international...
Oh, by the way, Professor,
I promised to take Miss Sherman to lunch at Tivoli.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, but I do mind.
You're robbing me of the company of a beautiful girl.
Oh, well, go ahead. Enjoy yourself.
Oh, just a moment, love.
I want to leave this book with the concierge.
Be right back.
Thank you very much.
Well, Michael, will you tell me before we eat or after?
Uh, aren't you gonna try your martini?
What are you so upset about?
And what were those tickets you picked up?
Well?
Well,
I... have to go to Stockholm.
Oh?
And I have to go this afternoon.
But, I mean, the congress - what about tonight, you're giving your speech?
Well, this is more important.
I'm going to speak to the Swedish defense department.
The Swedish defense department?
Hengstrom and I were talking on the boat about what I was doing with Gamma Five, and he knew the project was cancelled.
And he began to do some sniffing around, seemed to think the Swedish government might be willing to back the project, so...
You're American. How can you work for a foreign government?
I can get clearance.
Why didn't you tell me you talked to Hengstrom on the boat?
Well, I was going to -
You must've known about this for a long time.
Is that why you didn't want me to come on this trip?
I did want you -
I thought we had an agreement.
To hell with the agreement.
You did everything you could to stop me from coming.
The thing with Hengstrom just -
You never intended to give a speech tonight, did you?
To hell with the speech!
Let somebody else give it.
Alright, what would you like me to do?
Cover the congress for me.
Take notes.
I'll be back in time for the wedding.
- In two months?
- Yeah.
- Or three?
- Yeah.
Oh, Michael, you certainly know how to make a girl feel wanted.
Darling, I don't know what's got into you, ever since the missile project was cancelled -
Yes, it was cancelled.
Now that was very important.
But I'm important to you.
Why can't I come to Stockholm?
Sarah, we'd never see each other.
You know, conferences, meetings?
But aren't I any use to you anymore?
- Well, if I wasn't gonna be so busy -
- But you're always busy.
Have I ever minded that?
Didn't you even stop to think I might enjoy it?
Oh, look, Michael, we could get an apartment.
I mean, I could look after you, shop, cook.
No. It just wouldn't work.
Well, that's that then.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Well, it's definitely established.
Fifteen suitcases gone astray.
They could be anywhere.
I have an open ticket.
When's the next flight for New York?
I've known them to turn up in Helsinki on that particular line.
Let's see what the day brings.
The Pan-Am flight left at noon, miss.
There is an SAS flight at 16:45.
Get me a seat on that.
I want to leave as soon as possible.
There's passenger Williamson's golf clubs.
We haven't seen those since Manchester.
What time does Armstrong's flight leave for Stockholm?
Armstrong?
You gave him a ticket this morning.
Aren't golf clubs classified as hand luggage?
Not since the Warsaw Convention.
There we are. Armstrong. A single ticket.
It's not for Stockholm, miss.
It's the 16:30 flight,
Romanian Airlines, East Berlin.
East Berlin?
But that's behind the Iron Curtain.
Yes, miss.
Young lady.
Excuse me.
What in hell's name are you doing here?
- Hello, Michael.
- Listen to me.
Now you stay away from me.
Don't talk to me.
When this plane lands, you take the next one out!
Anywhere! Go home!
Do you understand?
- Wo ist Armstrong?
- Dort.
Professor Armstrong, we will wait until the other passengers are off the plane.
I thought she didn't know.
She doesn't know. She can't know.
She just followed me.
- Apparently.
- We can go now.
Hey, lady, step aside.
Hold it.
If you will pardon me,
I must introduce him to our vice minister.
Shall we go, please?
The vice minister wishes to welcome to the German Democratic Republic, a distinguished American nuclear scientist,
Professor Michael Armstrong.
Professor Armstrong has decided to live and work for peace in the Peoples' Democracies.
But can't I talk to him at all?
It is not advisable at present.
Do you have a visa, Miss Sherman?
Oh, they said I could get one here for 24 hours.
I have told them you are here.
Let's see what can be done.
Gentlemen, there will be a press conference later. Be patient.
Danke. This way.
- Professor.
- Hello.
You have survived our welcoming ceremony?
More or less.
Now we can relax.
Heinrich Gerard, state security.
Yes, the infamous state security.
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me. Sit down, please.
- No, thank you.
- Oh?
Cuban.
Your loss, our gain.
Well, Professor, did you have a good trip?
Oh, so-so.
Uh, this is Mr Gromek.
He will be your personal guide.
- Hello.
- Anything you need?
I lived many years in United States.
If he gives you any trouble, come to me.
I lived on 88th Street in New York.
Oh, good.
Well, here we are.
I hear you... you brought a little excess baggage.
What?
Oh, yes.
A Sarah Louise Sherman.
Sarah Louise?
You should come to me for your information.
But... isn't it a little strange?
During all your conversations with our agents in the United States, you never mentioned that you were bringing an assistant.
- I didn't know she was coming.
- Really?
I gave her that cover story, the one about Stockholm, but I must've botched it.
- Isn't she your fiancée?
- Yes.
Then what did you intend her to do?
Go home, marry the boy next door, or what?
I hoped, vaguely that she'd understand my motives.
Maybe she wouldn't, but I hoped she'd join me later.
She has joined you, sooner than later.
So it would appear.
Women.
Oh, boy.
Let's have her in, shall we?
Come in, please.
Miss Sherman, my name is Gerhard.
How do you do?
Won't you please sit down?
May I introduce the vice minister,
Mr Strauss.
- Guten Tag.
- And Mr Gromek.
Well, Miss Sherman, what are we going to do with you?
What do you suggest?
Is she a good assistant?
Yes.
Is she a good fiancée?
Yes.
Then it would be nice for you both if she stayed here, no?
Well, that's up to Miss Sherman.
Well, Miss Sherman, how would you like to live behind what you call the Iron Curtain?
I- I don't know.
Do you want me to stay, Michael?
That's up to you, Sarah.
If you wish, I can call for a car and you could be in West Berlin in half an hour.
I don't know.
Look, could I talk to
Professor Armstrong alone?
By all means. There's ample time.
Why don't we all sleep on it?
Yes, I'd like to do that.
We mustn't keep the press waiting, Professor.
Perhaps Miss Sherman would like to accompany us?
Is that necessary?
I think she should find it interesting.
Alright. Let's go.
Oh, leave those.
Mr Gromek will take care of them.
This way, Professor, please.
Professor Armstrong will now read to you his statement in English.
There will be copies available for you in English and in German.
Sir, is it true you're defecting because Washington abandoned your anti-missile program?
I'll explain that.
Professor, is that the anti-missile missile?
The one that's supposed to make nuclear defense obsolete?
Yes, it is.
No questions.
Does that mean that your plan is to hand over your secret work to a communist country?
I have a statement, if you don't mind.
Professor?
Today... in my country, the United States, there are people in high places who do not want to see atomic war abolished.
Now, because of that, a project that I was working on for six years was cancelled by my government.
Uh... that project is more important than the considerations of loyalty to any one country.
As a result of that, I, uh...
As a result of that, I, um...
I am offering my services to your University of Leipzig, hopefully to work with
Professor Gustav Lindt, a leading authority in my field.
Together with Professor Lindt, we will produce a defensive weapon that will make, um... all offensive nuclear weapons obsolete, and thereby abolish the terror of nuclear wafrare.
- Thank you.
- One question, please.
That's all.
- Miss Sherman, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Professor.
- Fäulein Sherman.
- Herr Professor. Auf Wiedersehen.
- Thank you.
This way, please.
Hey!
How come all the English and American correspondents?
When we have big news, we invite all correspondents over from West Berlin.
What did you say your name was?
Gromek.
G- R-O-M-E-K.
Thank you very much, Mr Gromek.
Quite a reception, huh?
Big deal.
You still have that expressión, 'big deal'?
Yeah, we've got it.
Eighty-eighth and Eighth I used to live.
Do you know around there?
There was a pizza shop right on the corner.
Is it still there?
Corner of Eighty-eighth and Eighth?
Pete's Pizza Parlour.
I wouldn't know.
Some city.
Hot dog.
Do you still say that?
Hot dog.
Sarah?
Well, now you know.
You've got to get on a plane tomorrow.
Tell them you thought it over and want to go home.
Are you listening to me?
My God, you're a cool customer.
You must've been planning this for months, Michael.
How could you do it?
How could you tell those lies?
Well, I just -
I thought it would be better if you didn't know about this.
I still can't believe this is really happening.
It was only this morning
I found out you were coming here.
I didn't know what to do. I couldn't believe it.
I just knew I had to follow you. I...
By instinct, to protect you or something. I...
Then when I got on the plane,
I couldn't see you and thought,
''Thank God he hasn't come.''
And when you turned around, you looked as though you hated me.
Sarah, you know how important this work is to me.
I've got to go through with it.
My feeling about it runs a lot deeper than just, uh... patriotism.
Do you realise you're a traitor?
That's not the way I see it.
You're insane.
How can you talk to someone who's insane?
Sarah, if I can't explain it to you,
I can't explain it to you.
Michael, take me home.
I can't. I'm sorry. I can't, Sarah.
I love you very much.
Would you please take me home?
I'm sorry. I can't.
A- ha, so here you are.
Yes, a very nice room.
Are you comfortable?
Oh, yes, it's just fine.
Well, now we are all settled in,
I suggest we should all have dinner in the dining room.
- Thank you. I-I'm not hungry.
- You are tired.
Perhaps you would like something up here.
There is room service.
Yes, why don't you do that?
Karl and I will get a bite downstairs.
You can rest for a while.
- It's open, Michael.
- It's Karl.
Ju-Just a minute.
Come in.
Oh, a thousand pardons.
It's alright. I'm decent.
- A love letter, I have no doubt.
- Thank you.
Well, now to breakfast.
Perhaps you would like to join me in the dining room?
Thank you. I think I'll just have some coffee sent up to the room.
Excuse me.
Then perhaps I might call for you in one half hour?
There's something I would like to talk to you about.
Jawohl.
Danke.
Professor Armstrong, how does it feel to play the part of a dirty defector?
I saw you on TV in town last night.
You put on a good act.
I've been conditioning myself for a long time.
Come on. Let's take a ride.
What possessed you to bring your girl on a job like this?
I didn't. She followed me.
That's the whole point.
There are two of us involved in the escape now.
I can't get her to go home.
Does she know what you're really up to?
No, of course not.
That's good, because if she did, and ever made any kind of a slip, these people can play it rough.
I know that.
Look, mister, why can't you leave this intelligence work to us professionals?
Cos you wouldn't know what to look for.
The information I'm after is inside the head of a scientist at Leipzig University.
I've often wondered if you professionals know what you're looking for when you go in and steal secret papers.
Anytime I've had to do a job like that,
I just grabbed up the whole lot and let Control sort them out.
What I'm after can't be got that way.
It takes a scientist to pick a scientist's brain.
I read in this morning's paper in your interview yesterday something about Washington cancelling your anti-missile project.
I couldn't lick the final problem.
But this professor in Leipzig, he has?
Yep.
- So you're taking the short cut?
- I'm trying to.
Did Washington approve this crazy scheme of yours?
They don't know anything about it.
Then how did you make the Copenhagen contact?
Let's say I got friends in high places.
How long do you figure this whole thing's gonna take?
I don't know. One month. Two.
One week. Two. Depends.
What I need now is the name of your agent in Leipzig.
The name's Koska.
K- O-S-K-A.
You'll be contacted.
Your escape will originate from there.
Well, mister, this is where you get off.
Pleasant dreams.
Is there a-a back door?
Is there some other way out?
I'm gonna report you to the Minister of Culture.
What's wrong, Professor?
In one door and out the other?
You don't like our museum?
I've seen better.
Strictly for the birds, huh?
They still say that.
We used to say it all the time.
It's strictly for the 'boids.'
Well, aren't you going to introduce me?
Oh, this lady's a relative.
She's related to my mother -
Related to my mother's side of the family.
I just promised I'd stop by for a visit.
It's been difficult because my German isn't as good as your English.
You're like me. Everywhere, relatives.
Aunts, uncles, and wherever you go, it's presents, handouts.
Where's the present, Professor?
I was going to get one in Copenhagen, but I just didn't have time.
Too bad.
Sure, we'll have an apfelwein.
Why not? Danke.
- Come here, Professor.
- What for?
'What for?''
Come here. That!
What do you mean?
'What do you mean?'' That.
Looks like a sign. Hm?
I don't know.
Mm-hmm.
What kind of sign?
- Hmm?
- I don't know.
''I don't know?''
Maybe a Greek letter.
Professor!
Maybe... pi?
Mathematics.
Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, right?
Yeah. You're a very educated man, Mr Gromek.
I went to night school, Professor.
Special night school.
And they taught us all about Pi.
A dirty little two-bit organisation for spying and escaping!
Can't you do better than them,
Mr American agent?
It's the big house for you,
Professor, you'll get life.
That's lucky, because this dolly...
Big house.
I used to see all those prison movies.
You know?
Edward G Robinson.
Did you ever -
Cut it out. Don't be stupid.
I was trained by experts.
I can take you...
How do you say?
One arm tied behind my back!
Tell the cookie she should put that down.
She's gonna cut your fingers off.
OK. You had your fun.
Now we stop these games!
Come. Come here.
- Huh?
- That.
Come. Schnell.
Auf Wiedersehen.
- Excuse me, are you Professor Armstrong?
- Yes, I am.
Mr Gerhard of Security wishes to see you.
We have a car.
Well, morning.
Come in, Professor.
We've had quite an interesting talk with Miss Sherman, and she...
She has decided to come over to our side.
Your fiancée would like to work as your assistant in Leipzig.
You mean, you're going to work -
You mean, you're going to work with me?
Is there any reason why I shouldn't?
- Do you want to?
- I want to be with you.
You must thank Manfred, Professor.
Professor Manfred has a unique line in argument.
He combines mathematical logic with romantic inconsistency.
Miss Sherman, may I offer you a cognac?
Now a toast.
To your new life in your new country.
So, and now you leave for Leipzig.
- What, today?
- Immediately.
We have sent a car for you.
- We'll have to pack.
- Herein.
My dear Miss Sherman, you are a scientist now, not a porter.
All that will be arranged.
The indispensable Gromek will meet you in Leipzig with your baggage.
Professor, we seem to have lost Gromek.
Please.
Professor Armstrong, Miss Sherman, may I present Vice Rector Gutman.
How do you do?
Welcome to Karl Marx University.
I am very happy to see you.
May I introduce Professor Winckelmann.
- How do you do?
- And Professor Schröder.
We're very happy to be here.
Professor Winckelmann will show you to your rooms.
Your bags are already here.
Herr Haupt. Bitte.
Otto Haupt at your service, sir.
I'm your new security guide.
How do you do?
- And where is Gromek?
- He's disappeared.
Herr Gerhard is most concerned.
This is the new physics building, which is very comprehensive, as you shall see.
You have a very modern university.
All our universities are modern.
Michael!
Still can't understand how I fell down those stairs.
I tripped you.
I may have overdone it.
Who are you?
Didn't the farmer tell you? I'm Dr Koska.
I thought Koska was a man.
That was my husband.
He was a professor of mathematics here.
That is why he used the sign pi for our organisation.
We are not a political group.
We only help people take a long vacation from this lovely place.
Where is your husband?
He died last year.
Excuse me.
This is the university clinic.
Now, Gretel, remember your English.
We have here a gentleman from America.
I am pleased to meet you.
I am Gretel. Are you very well? Please?
Well, that's what your mother's trying to find out.
Now, Gretel, pack your viola and go down to the car.
I will be down very soon.
I had to reach you urgently.
You must move very quickly.
They are bound to investigate the disappearance of Gromek.
It's a pity he had to be killed.
And it will complicate things.
Well, a woman at the farm was going to bury the body and the motorcycle, so...
Let's hope they don't find anything.
I hear there are two of you to get out now.
I'm afraid so, yes.
I will need photographs of both of you for the false identity cards we have to prepare.
- Well, that is going to be awkward.
- Why?
My fiancée doesn't know anything about an escape.
Or escape plans.
She still thinks I'm a defector.
She doesn't even know anything about the whole idiotic mess.
I wasn't gonna tell her till I got what I wanted.
Well, you'll have to try to find some pretext.
How long do you have to be in Leipzig?
I have to get to one man - Gustav Lindt.
Lindt? But he leaves for Leningrad any day.
For how long?
I don't know.
You should try to see him right away.
You bruised one or two ribs.
Tomorrow, they will probably have you in for a screening.
They will want to ask you questions about your experiments.
If you please them, if you pass the test, they may allow you to work with Lindt.
How long do you need with him?
How long does it take to get a man's confidence?
He's got the key to a puzzle in his head.
I have to get the key.
And he will give it to you? Just like that?
No, not just like that.
I'm depending upon his curiosity.
It's a pretty strong instinct among most people, but among scientists a bloody obsessión.
I'm depending upon his eagerness to question me.
But you want information from him.
Well, that works two ways.
In order for him to find out what I know, he's gonna have to tell me what he knows.
And I'll just feed him hopefully the right kind of plausible information, so he thinks I'm on to his discovery.
It sounds as if it could be a long business.
I'm sorry to be on your hands.
Oh, you're not on my hands.
I don't want to see you again until you are ready to leave.
Sorry I had to put you through all this, but in our organisation, we have to resort to many bizarre means of communication.
Yes, that's - that's the right word.
Please.
Gentlemen, I have the honour to present our American colleague,
Professor Armstrong, professor of science and physics,
University of Chicago.
Ph.d, summa cum laude, 1956,
California Institute of Technology.
- Honorary degree.
- Ja.
We are all very familiar with Professor Armstrong's qualifications.
- Good morning, Professor.
- Morning.
Please sit down.
Herr Kollege, continue.
Professor Armstrong,
I have been asked by the committee of the faculty to put to you some questions.
Gentlemen, I'll be, uh... happy and pleased to provide whatever information I can.
First, as a gesture of good faith, the committee would like you to describe the progress of United States experiments with the missile known as Gamma Five.
Alright.
Let's begin with -
Uh, let's begin with the, uh... preliminary experiments in Chicago.
If there are any questions,
I'd prefer to answer them later.
Uh... starting -
Before this faculty interrogation begins,
Herr Haupt wishes to ask a question.
Bitte, Herr Haupt.
Did you visit a farm before you left Berlin?
Gentlemen, I -
I thought this was to be a scientific interrogation.
Herr Haupt has received instructions from state security in Berlin.
You must answer the question.
Yes, I went to a farm.
I wanted to look up some relatives.
Did I do something wrong?
Should I have gotten a permit?
Did you meet Herr Gromek at this farm?
Gromek? No.
- You're quite sure?
- Yes.
This faculty meeting must terminate at once.
I don't - I-I don't understand.
What is all this?
Your answer is not satisfactory.
We are not allowed to speak with you until the security people have made further investigations.
Gentlemen, that's ridiculous.
I came 4,000 miles to work with
Professor Lindt, now where is he?
I'm Lindt.
What's this rubbish about security?
Who gave the order?
Mr Gerhard, chief of state security service.
And does Mr Gerhard know that I've got to be in Leningrad at any moment?
Gentlemen, I must know about this
Gamma Five work before I leave!
Everybody has orders.
Wait a minute.
You. Is your assistant with you?
Yes, Herr Professor. Miss Sherman.
Did she also trespass on any forbidden farms?
Nein.
So, something is better than nothing.
She also worked on Gamma Five.
I want to talk to her.
Come on, gentlemen.
Yack, yack, yack, yack. You're like chickens.
Ah, Miss Sherman.
Please.
Miss Sherman, the faculty would like to ask you
- a few general questions about -
- Fräulein.
Were you not present at the United States
Gamma Five experiments in Chicago?
Yes, I was.
Start, please, by telling me what you know about this.
First I want to know, was this experiment successful?
Come now, Fräulein.
You must cooperate, Miss Sherman.
It is expected.
I have nothing to tell you.
But it was all agreed.
Isn't that true, Professor Armstrong?
Miss Sherman agreed to cooperate.
- I have nothing to say.
- Sarah.
You tell them. You tell them!
You joined them.
You're the one who sold out!
You tell them, Professor Armstrong.
Sorry, gentlemen. Miss, uh...
Sherman's been under a great strain.
Perhaps if I could be allowed a few moments with her...
Go. Go. Do something.
You cackle like hens. Do something!
But Miss Sherman. Sarah.
This is preposterous, don't you think?
You must show that they can trust you.
Surely, you want to help Michael.
- Isn't that so?
- Not any longer. I want to go back.
The police, the authorities, everybody.
- I shall get in terrible trouble.
- Karl, let me talk to her.
She's adamant. Besides,
I don't think the security people -
Oh, the hell with security!
You want her cooperation or not?
Give me five minutes with her.
After all, she is my girl.
Put that in the past tense.
Be very careful.
Oh, Michael.
Careful, Manfred.
Now, that's everything.
I would have told you before, except I wanted to wait until
I got what I needed from Lindt.
Looks like I'm not gonna make it.
So I've got to get to Dr Koska at the clinic, but you've got to go back into that room.
Now, I'll tell you precisely what information to give to Lindt.
But you've got to act as though
I persuaded you to go along with me.
You understand?
Oh, Michael!
Professor Lindt looks well pleased with himself.
That's because he's surrounded with such lovely company.
He seems to have taken to you.
Or was it the information you gave him this afternoon?
Perhaps it was a bit of both.
I was glad you were able to change your mind.
Your little walk with Michael seems to have had its effect.
Well, I had a chance to think things over.
Ah, well, thank you, Manfred.
I was able to combine mathematical logic with romantic inconsistency.
Just so.
There's Dr Koska over there.
- I'm gonna grab a dance, alright?
- Yes.
- Good evening, Professor.
- Hello.
- May I have a dance?
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.
- Put it here?
- Yes.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, I'm feeling fine.
I've been trying to get in touch with you all day.
I've been out of the city.
What has happened?
The faculty interrogation this morning?
Called off.
- For what reason?
- I don't know.
The, uh... security man,
Haupt?
Well, he came in and asked me if I'd been to a certain farm.
I told him yes,
I'd gone to see some relatives, and then he asked me if I'd seen Gromek there.
There was nothing I could do. I lied, I said no.
Everything stopped.
They cut off the interrogation just like that.
- Did they give you any reason?
- Uh, no.
But then, you see, I began to ask myself, how did they find out that I had been to a farm?
Well, the taxi driver. Very simple answer.
So, uh, he must have seen Gromek there too.
Was Professor Lindt at the screening?
Oh, yes, and he's inquisitive as hell.
When he found out that he wasn't supposed to question me, he called up Sarah and asked her to come in.
Now that they know you lied about Gromek, you're liable to be picked up at any minute.
I've got to get you both out and back to Berlin immediately.
Only to get this far after all these months' work?
I know. It doesn't make any difference now.
They are too close.
I know.
I suppose you have told
Miss Sherman everything.
Well, I had to, finally, this afternoon.
You won't be able to leave tonight.
Too many people involved.
It has to be tomorrow morning.
It will take all night to organise things.
- Is it that complicated?
- Yes, it is.
Both of you be in my clinic tomorrow morning,
Oh, Sarah, it's no use. It's too late.
Don't forget, Mr Armstrong,
Ah, Armstrong.
So, you're not out trespassing tonight.
We have some very nice farms around here.
Well, I decided to give it a miss tonight.
Michael, I think Professor Lindt needs a drink.
Yes.
Let us drink the wine and... discuss the harvest.
Armstrong, I think, Professor, the Vice Rector's waiting.
Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck.
Let us have some intelligent conversation.
Ahh, the Vienna Waltz.
Did I tell you that my sister Emily got knocked down by a tram in Vienna?
Uh... come on, Karl, what about a dance?
I'm afraid you must excuse me.
I'm not a very good dancer.
Rubbish!
You cannot refuse such a charming young lady.
I'm afraid you're hooked, Karl.
Herr Professor Doctor Lindt, you are neglecting your party.
I'm having a party with Armstrong.
Go, go. Get along.
Dance!
Uh, Professor.
What? What?
Well, you must be quite excited with what Miss Sherman told you this afternoon about Gamma Five.
I'll tell you, Armstrong, I have a rule.
I never discuss my work when I'm having fun.
And never, never over a drink.
Well, I suppose she told you that we concluded our experiment successfully.
I think I would accept that more readily from the horse's mouth.
Oh, yes, we've built Gamma Five.
Oh, really?
We must get together, and you can tell me about it.
I have too much beard.
I need a shave tomorrow morning at Kaninski's Barber Shop.
We had a very interesting talk... about farming.
It's ten after 10:00 already.
I was stupid enough to help him get together with Lindt.
Koska.
Ja.
They've found Gromek's body.
Look.
I wonder what happened to our security man.
He must still be in front of the barber shop.
This Gamma Five work of yours sounds interesting.
You're a brilliant young man.
You know, there aren't many of us, Armstrong.
Here. Here is where the work is done.
The rest is all mechanics.
You said you made already Gamma Five?
Well, yes. Mind you, we've only done preliminary tests.
- Why is that?
- We had trouble getting money.
But there's nothing the matter with the theory.
As far as I'm concerned, the problem's solved.
Solved? If you solved it, why didn't you publish the results?
- Security.
- Ah! Security.
On the theoretical level, you could've published something.
You mean like you did last year in the East German Journal of Physics?
- Oh, you read that paper?
- Oh, yes.
Then you know that this thing you're talking about
I happened to have discovered too.
Possibly.
I just think our methods were different.
How? How different?
Well, here's my workroom.
All my secrets.
It's probably the most secret room in the whole country, but, you see, no guards.
- I find it nice and familiar.
- Oh, yes.
Well?
Velocity, right?
And so.
You're not going to work with me, Professor, if that is the extent of your knowledge.
Well, I'm not through yet.
I'm afraid, Professor, you have very little to offer.
You know, Professor,
I came here because the people who allocate money in my country weren't intelligent enough to pursue a wholly original concept.
That works.
Nein. Da!
No, no, no, no, no!
Pfft! It will blow up.
Well, we built it, and it works, and it didn't blow up.
Four years ago we tried it at Alma-Ata.
It blew up.
Well then, your equipment was faulty.
Your concept was probably wrong too.
You misunderstood it.
I? Lindt?
Misunderstood?
Rubbish!
You come to me from the United States, and I -
I don't care if you come from the moon!
I tell you what you say is rubbish!
Look. Look.
''Achtung, Achtung.
Professor Armstrong und Miss Sherman...''
''Professor Armstrong and Miss Sherman, you're wanted at once in the Vice Rector's office.''
Huh? Not so?
What if you took it this way?
And this way?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Go! Learn!
- Ah.
- Why do you say ''ah''?
- Surely there's something missing.
- But it works!
In Russia, we built it. It works!
My God. That's brilliant.
You jumped a step, didn't you?
Of course it's brilliant. It's genius.
The Russians thought I was crazy.
They didn't know I'm Lindt.
''Professor Armstrong und Miss Sherman...''
They're asking all the students of this section to search for you.
Why? What have you done?
You told me nothing.
You know nothing.
I forbid you to leave this room!
What does he look like, this Professor Armstrong?
Like a professor.
What started that excitement down there?
The police have arrived.
They've come for you.
- Please, we've no time.
- Just a minute.
I have to get you to the centre of the city.
- I hope you can ride bicycles.
- Yes.
It's only a ten-minute ride. Come.
We're very late, but we can't rush it.
Ride slowly.
Just a normal outing.
Remember, you must reach our friends in Berlin before 7:00 tonight.
They say Herr Jacobi can be trusted to get you there. Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Herr Jacobi.
This way, please.
I am Mr Jacobi.
She is worried. You are late.
Look, I, uh... I've heard of organisation, but, uh... you mean to say that the bus line is on our side?
This is not a regular bus.
This belongs to our organisation.
But we travel the same route as the official Leipzig to Berlin bus.
But we leave ten minutes ahead of it.
You are not German.
What does it matter? They are friends.
Polizei.
- Polizei.
- Police now!
We've never had police before.
Twenty times we have made this journey.
Be calm. Calm.
They are endangering our whole enterprise because they are not only foreigners, but foreigners wanted by the police.
Which makes our whole enterprise much more dangerous than it has ever been before.
Who are all these people?
They are all friends of our organisation.
- Are we all escaping?
- Oh, no, miss.
We do not escape.
We are all round-trip passengers.
We are members of Pi.
We helps others get to Berlin, and then we come home.
But isn't that very dangerous?
For some people it is more dangerous to stay here.
Herr Jacobi!
I'm afraid it's a roadblock.
Do you have your identity cards?
Good. And don't speak.
There!
They were looking for the Americans.
We might be stopped again.
Herr Jacobi, what will happen when the real bus will come along?
- What will the police say then?
- Relax.
You heard Heinrich tell them they were running an extra bus.
- You alright?
- Yes, so far.
Well, she will only have to wait eight minutes for the regular bus.
We should be ten minutes ahead.
We will make up time.
Herr Jacobi.
Another roadblock.
Bandits. Army deserters.
- Is it a hold-up?
- Yes. They will want money.
Jewellery and watches are no good to them.
Soldiers.
Got it.
What's so funny?
Well, it's funny in one way, but perhaps in another way it's not.
You see, the military have decided to give us an escort.
I believe we're under arrest.
We have an escort now.
They say there have been a number of attacks along this road lately.
Look, we're the ones who are endangering everybody.
Couldn't we just get off now like ordinary passengers?
What would you do in the middle of the countryside like this?
Your next contact is in the city.
At least we should try to get you to the outskirts.
My only concern is that now we will have to behave like a regular bus.
How do you mean?
As you see, we pick up no passengers.
Now we will have to stop.
Even if we don't, the police up front will.
Herr Jacobi.
If the police see that second bus coming, we'll all be arrested.
Let me off! Let me off! Let me off!
Let me off the bus!
Fräulein Mann, if you wish, I will let you off the bus, but you will not say anything to the police.
Heinrich, stop!
And you, I hope you get caught for giving everybody so much trouble.
When we get to Berlin, who's my next contact?
You will go to the Friedrichstrasse post office.
Ask for a man called Albert.
I will give you the address.
Herr Jacobi.
It looks like we have to stop.
My God, we'll never make it.
He says the police have seen the other bus.
We've gotta get off.
You must go now. Quick! Quick!
Don't forget, the Friedrichstrasse post office. Albert.
Schnell! Schnell!
I wish I'd had the time to write it down.
Post office, post office. What the hell was it?
It was something 'strasse'.
Yeah, I know, and a man named Albert.
But, uh, which post office?
We shall have to ask.
- Let me. It's safer.
- Alright.
Post office?
Post office?
Uh...
Ah, Post Office. Friedrichstrasse?
Yes, Friedrichstrasse!
Excuse me, please. You wish information?
At your service, mademoiselle.
You are with that gentleman?
Yes, of course you are.
Come, please.
Excuse me, please.
I am the Countess Kuchinska.
I am Polish.
Allow me, please, to offer you both a cup of coffee.
- I'm terribly sorry. We're in a hurry.
- I know.
We're looking for the
Friedrichstrasse post office.
You will take coffee with me,
Professor Armstrong.
Come on. There is close to here a...
How do you say? Coffee house.
Come on.
Here we are. Here we are.
Do you have American cigarettes?
No, I'm sorry.
Then... you must smoke the Russian ones.
You see?
Look at these.
Half of it is paper.
Just a little bit tobacco in this end.
Disgusting! You wish one?
No, thank you.
Ah!
How exciting to meet you, Professor.
It is not every day one meets a spy.
Oh, please.
And his face in all the papers.
But don't look so worried, my darling girl.
You are quite safe with me.
I am not kommunistical.
It will be undrinkable.
Disgusting liquid they call coffee.
It is no good here.
You see,
I came here from Poland.
I wish... very much to go to the United States of America.
Unfortunately, it is necessary to have... friends there.
How you say? Sponsor.
Do you understand me, my dear girl?
Y- Yes, but...
Is this their best coffee?
And they are all ignorant here.
Now!
I am making you a proposition.
You two will promise me to be my sponsors for a visa to the United States of America.
In return,
I will take you where you wish to go.
Well?
Drink your coffee.
- Sponsors?
- Yes!
I'm writing to West Berlin, to American... visa office.
All I need is sponsor.
Will you help me?
Please?
You mean the East Germans will be willing to let you go?
Oh, sure.
They don't need an old woman like me.
They let me go if America take me.
But America don't take me without... sponsor.
Michael, why don't we?
If we help her...
- Come on.
- Alright.
Yeah?
You will be my sponsors?
Good.
Oh, thank you, my dear.
I knew you were my friend.
Now, I will give you my address.
You give me... yours.
Oh, good!
Oh, good! Wondefrul!
In celebration, I'll pay for the liquid.
Now, I help you.
I'll take you to Friedrichstrasse post office.
How is the name? Who do we want?
The name's Albert.
Bitte. Bitte.
Albert?
Albert? Ja. Ja.
Herr Albert.
Herr Albert?
Bitte Schön.
Herr Albert?
Ja. Ja.
Herr Albert?
What does it say?
It's a travel agency you have to go to.
Michael!
- Come on!
- Halt!
They are my sponsors!
My sponsor.
My sponsor... for United States of America.
It must be on the other side of the street.
Hold it.
Well, there's our travel agency.
Come on.
You picked a bad time to call, Professor.
We had company.
- It's alright, Sarah. This is -
- I'm nobody, ma'am.
Just city folk out taking a stroll.
Judging by what happened over there, we should be on the run ourselves.
But we thought we'd better hang around until you turned up.
Was it a raid?
Our little organisation is used to this.
We'll just have to set up shop someplace else.
So, you got away from the bus alright?
Yeah, but we heard firing. Was anybody hurt?
Hardly a soul. They scattered too well.
One little flesh wound, that's all.
That's a pretty good bunch you got there.
What about the bus?
That we don't have anymore.
Michael, that's one piece of business we must attend to as soon as we get back - if we get back alright.
Thanks.
Now, we don't have much time, so listen what the man says.
We're sending you out by sea on an East German boat in the costume baskets of a Czech ballet company.
It gives its last pefrormance tonight and goes to Sweden.
Remember, the boat is East German.
You won't be safe until you're ashore.
8:00 sharp, I will bring you to the theatre.
You will take your seats one minute after the house lights go down.
At first intermissión, you'll be taken through the pass door backstage by the baggage master of the company.
He will know you because he has your seat numbers.
Is he one of your men?
No, but he wants to defect too, so we're going to give him a little help.
Here it is.
You'll recognise him.
He has red hair which is not his own, and his name is Hugo, but don't give him that money until after you've landed.
Listen, if we don't get a chance to see you again -
You won't, mister.
From the time you reach that theatre tonight, you're on your own.
Shall we go?
- When the - Oh, my God.
- What?
- It's Gerhard.
- Where?
Back that way.
Fire!
Michael!
Michael!
Nein. Nein.
Good luck.
Professor Armstrong...
Swing the crane over here. Over here!
- We're Americans.
- Oh, welcome to Sweden.
Is there someplace we can dry out?
We have passports and money.
Come to our office.
We always keep a whole stack of blankets for refugees.
But why were they shooting at the baskets?
Thought we were inside them.
Could you ask him why he made the last-minute switch?
He said he heard the ballerina describing how they caught refugees in costume baskets on a previous trip.
He got scared this time because she was watching too closely.
Say, say, hello. Hello!
Oh, Michael.
The Scarlet Dove
Father, the crabs are here.
At least a hundred of them!
Don't drag the basket
Good evening, doctor!
Look, mother.
- Ulla, don't tease that crab.
I'm not teasing, I'm just holding it.
Boys, take the crabs up.
- Yeah, yeah.
Look, father!
Take it away, be kind.
The water is warm.
You couldn't believe that the summer is over already.
That tomorrow we have to pack.
You know, 
Ulla can swim very well.
I was swimming with the children.
Almost an hour.
You are almost like a child yourself.
I get older... you get younger.
I guess we have enough crabs.
Martta will make sandwiches and then there will be those sausages - the ones you like.
Are you going to dance today?
You could dance with me once a summer.
Hold on to me - so that some dashing young man won't kiss me in the moonlight.
Because you don't.
What are you looking at?
You, of course.
Just thinking of you - and that dashing young man in the moonlight.
The one kissing you.
What does he look like?
Is he blonde, and tall?
With passionate eyes, like yours.
First time that I hear you say 
I have passionate eyes.
But I told that to you
 on our wedding night
Sixteen years ago.
Don't forget everything so soon.
Look, does it show that
I've lost almost...- almost three kilos?
Now I can fit into my dress from last summer.
But you have the dress from this summer.
But it's important for a woman to fit into the last summer's dress.
You don't understand anything.
- No, I don't understand anything.
I only love you.
Remember that when you kiss that young man.
Should we take you to the cellar to cool off?
Oh, the beer, wine, schnapps and the whisky have to be taken to the cellar.
Oh how dreadful, 
I'll certainly be hungover tomorrow.
You will give me some pills then.
You make those cocktails too.
Oh, I wish there won't be a storm.
Helena...
Nothing, nothing.
Get lost, I'll make them!
Then go out and stay there.
Soon there will be a pack of hungry guests - who I have to feed.
And the kids are only being a nuisance.
And nobody has any thought of helping.
Martta is pissed off.
- Soon she will kick the bucket!
Then we will have a fun funeral.
A Funeral...
Will they live long enough?
They will live to see the pot. 
Now get out.
Go outside. Martta and mother have a lot to do.
You don't have anything to worry about - we have school day after tomorrow!
Torture of children, that's what it is.
What's wrong with the doctor?
- How so?
It's like something is bothering him.
Like he's thinking about something.
I haven't noticed anything.
It's me who usually notices things first in this family.
But what would he be thinking?
Maybe that the Mrs is young and he is starting to be old.
But he isn't old,
 he doesn't have any reason to think that.
Why would he think that?
No, he's tired from this heat.
Has the Mrs said to him that
 it isn't good lay in the sun too much? 
No. But being a doctor he should know it.
A doctor or a minister, they're all big children.
Father, the post is here.
Nothing but magazines and a letter - and it's for mother.
- All right.
Take Daisy inside, too
Daisy, come. Let's go inside.
Dearest
Dearest!
I must see you on Thursday.
It's very important. 
I expect you at a place you know well.
At 15 o'clock. Yours, K.
A letter for you. 
- Thank you.
Who wrote you?
- Who...? Paula.
Who's Paula? - Paula?
What's making you so nervous?
Nothing
I'll sweep the floor.
Who's Paula?
- You don't know her.
I met her on a trip to Copenhagen.
What does she want from you?
- She's just writing.
Friends have a habit of writing to each other.
How are you? I am well.
And things like that
Why are you asking?
Just for the sake of conversation.
These are just innocent questions.
Well, how is she, then?
- Who?
That Paula.
Well why do you wish to know?
You haven't even met the person.
That hardly stops me
 from asking how she is doing.
I haven't known many of the people, - from whom I have cut a stomach open.
What time is it?
Coming twelve.
Going somewhere?
No.
It smells burnt in here.
Like someone has burnt paper.
Where are you going?
To the city, 
I've a couple of meetings
It's Thursday after all.
Yes, it is Thursday.
It's not a pleasure going in this heat, but there's no helping it.
When will you return?
When should I come back?
Not before evening?
Not before evening, that's enough.
Enough. For what?
I mean, enough time to be back before the guests.
Yes, I won't be back before eight.
Then I won't expect you back before eight.
How can it be so hot, when autumn is beginning?
Goodbye, darling
Goodbye.
Father, are you going to town?
Can I come?
Can I come?
Are you hurt?
No, just resting.
Can you tell me, when is the next bus to Helsinki?
It should go within the next half-hour.
- Thank you.
Can I go with you for some of the way?
As you please. - Thank you.
The warm weather came a little late.
Could have used it at hay-making.
Why did you ask for a bus,
 driving your own car?
Looks like a brand new one.
Yes, there was a crash right there last week.
Two men died.
Another a neighbour of mine.
Many thanks.
Do the buses to Helsinki stop by the market?
Yes.
They all stop at the market.
Anything else? - What?
No, no. - Thank you.
Excuse me. May I call?
Please. The phone is over there.
And a half a kilo of butter.
- Excuse me...
What's the number for the centre?
Half a kilo of butter,
I don't dare to take more
Snappertuna 18.
From what number?
Excuse me, what number is this?
Which number? Oh, this.
- Yes, this.
210 - Thank you.
Hello?
Is it Martta? It's me...
Could I speak with the Mrs?
Left?
When?
Doctor, hello, hello?
This must be enough for the call?
- Thank you, it's enough.
I could see that you were drunk.
I don't want a date who reeks of booze.
I wasn't drunk.
Just had a little drink when it was offered.
I know your drinks. Step aside.
Pardon me.
Could you give me something to drink?
What's that, I'll take it.
Grape, 35 marks.
A straw or a glass?
Pardon? - Do you want a glass or a straw?
A straw like this, for sucking?
Can I get a glass?
Do you always have to joke around?
I got to be so ashamed because of you.
And beware of smelling like booze tonight.
What are you nagging about, we're not married yet?
Who's marrying you anyway.
You haven't bought me that nightie you promised.
From next pay.
- What kind of nightie?
Yup. A see-through one.
- What good it's to you?
You don't know? Or are you planning to spend rest of your life alone.
Give me a pack of fags.
- Which brand?
You should know?
- Yeah, yeah, here.
I'll go and sit over there.
- Go then.
Could I get a glass of juice?
- Juice, 30 marks.
Thank you.
Matches. - 10 marks.
I told you not to write.
He knows now. 
- Knows?
At least guesses.
He saw your letter.
I had to write...
Sir, buy some shoelaces.
Sir, buy some shoelaces.
I'm afraid. - Afraid?
What are you afraid of?
Are you ashamed to love?
Sir, buy shoelaces
- Would you mind?
Good day. - Good day?
Could I look at some binoculars?
And for what purpose they would be?
Well, I... that
Here we have one of the larger ones,
10x 50.
A perfect general type.
Could I have a look?
- Yes, of course.
What are those numbers you mentioned?
The first one is for magnification - and the other the diameter of the objective.
Well then isn't a binocular - that magnifies more, better?
Not always, for the brightness of the binocular - gets weaker when the magnification increases.
Here we have a more magnifying model, 20x50.
It's harder to hold though.
This is good.
Of course more magnifying one is better - if you think that it's bright enough.
The windows disturb of course.
I'll take this.
How much?
12 500. The case comes with it.
- Thank you.
Hey, bring her aboard.
Yes, you just bring her aboard.
I can't think any more.
I don't know what's wrong and what's right.
Help me.
We'll go together.
I won't let you go back.
I'll take you with me.
There's no other chance.
I can't live without you.
You belong to me.
There can't be anything else.
Only you and me.
Have you thought about everything?
Everything.
Planned it, like a crime.
It's necessary.
Perhaps unbearable for you.
There's no going back for you.
Not any more.
I can't do it.
I can't leave them.
How can I explain it to them.
I could never be happy.
You don't have to explain anything.
You just write.
Few words will suffice.
The ship leaves tomorrow at three.
Only take a small bag.
I'll reserve a cabin for you.
Under my own name.
Darling...
I should have never met you.
Remember?
The wind took your hat.
And you brought it back to me.
You were wearing a uniform, and you smelled of sea.
When I escorted you, you didn't tell me your name.
But I found it out easily.
And when I called you, -
I could hear from your voice that you wanted to see me too
Even if you told me no at first.
I should have never met you.
Dearest.
I wish we had a place to go.
No one is going to see us here.
Let's go.
Did I frighten you?
You look lost.
I thought I would ask the time, - but it's not like time means anything.
You'll burn your fingers.
Did you burn your fingers?
We could have met again somewhere more romantic.
In a gondola, or a in hut of leaves, while the nightingale sings.
At least it's going to be a full moon.
You may talk to me.
I'm not one of those women, who call for a police.
Where do we get off?
We? - Yes, you and me.
You're not used to this.
You don't want to forget her.
You dig into your sorrow like a mole.
My sorrow? - It's in your eyes and in your voice.
Forgive me, I'm not quite myself.
You don't find it peculiar to meet again like this?
Isn't it an odd coincidence?
Maybe it wasn't a coincidence.
Where are you taking me?
You'll see soon.
Far away.
You don't even know who I am.
I know who you are, you don't have to tell me anything.
Who are you?
I'm Heidi. I'm Ritva, Anneli,
Paula. I'm whatever you want.
You get to choose.
I'm everything you want.
Wouldn't you like to be Ritva?
Before I was twenty, -
I loved a girl called Ritva.
Good. I'll be your Ritva.
You be under twenty.
Do you know this place? 
- Yes.
Do you like this?
- I do... Ritva.
I'll call you Ritva.
You told me, that you know who I am.
I do.
You are a bank manager who has embezzled, - waiting for accountants.
You are a schoolboy, caught on a lie.
Come.
I don't even imagine, that I'm the first one to say, - that you are wonderful.
You say it beautifully anyway.
And it's wonderful to be with you.
A man shouldn't use that word too often.
It's not appropriate for men.
Which word? - Wonderful.
I make a lot of mistakes.
Only today, before I met you...
You have helped me, Ritva.
You have helped me more than you realise.
Helped? How?
Away from my foolishness.
Out of such depths - in which I would have never believed to find myself in.
A cigarette? - I don't smoke.
You brought me back my conscience.
What if I'm a lie, your bad conscience.
No, I was thinking of death.
You brought life.
This is silly talk.
Did you talk like this before you were twenty?
When you were in love for the first time?
It wasn't the first time.
I fell in love already at thirteen.
But the girl let me down.
She laughed at me.
You have been betrayed often.
You shouldn't have come to know any other women than your mother.
I'd like to learn to know you: - your life, - your friends, - your thoughts.
Look at me, and tell yourself what I am like.
You are good and beautiful.
You haven't told me that you love me yet.
I love you.
Why did you want to come here?
I want to swim. 
- Swim?
You didn't want to dance, then I want to swim.
At this hour?
- Time means nothing.
I'm a little tipsy and I want to swim.
You don't? - No.
A man who doesn't want to swim or dance.
Ritva...
Ritva?
Are you leaving me too?
Do you like my body?
Should I lose weight?
So that you would fit into a dress from last summer?
Why into last summer's?
Let's go to my place.
- Let's.
Why didn't you tell me not to swim?
I'm cold.
Better not to compare this to the house you live in.
Make yourself at home.
Not a room with a view.
There's the bottle, have a drink if you like.
Give me a cigarette.
- You said that you don't smoke.
Yeah?
What else did I say?
I love you, Ritva.
Stop that foolish talk about Ritva!
Turn off the light.
Or do you prefer making love in the light?
What's up with you?
What did I do?
You are beautiful.
I love you, Ritva.
Animal! Dirty, miserable beast!
Disgusting, greasy worm!
You don't love anyone!
Nothing but yourself.
You want to bawl out your misery to a first woman - and it happened to be me
To me you wanted to drown - all the rubbish you have collected.
I was insignificant enough for you.
You are being betrayed. 
You don't deserve anything more.
No man has deserved anything else.
All right, I won't take a payment from you.
Once a month 
I have to be allowed to hit.
You have already paid for what you want.
You can come now.
Go there.
Where?
- Where's your wife?
My wife has been murdered!
Help me!
Search for help!
My wife has been murdered!
Don't point it at me!
Can't they wake up that janitor?
The janitor is here already!
- All right
Search the stand throughout.
Save everything you find.
How long has she been dead?
It would be about time to know that.
Can't say for sure.
From two to five hours.
Two stabs with a knife, the other one straight to heart.
Died immediately.
Well, we'll know more after the autopsy.
But it has to be done soon.
What the hell! 
Who let the press in?
I told you not to let them in here!
No one let us in.
We have our own routes.
Well now, I know that face.
Listen here, if I get to read some rubbish tomorrow...
You just read the comics like this far.
Some day I will wring your neck.
Then for once we would both be at the crime scene on time.
Give me that knife.
And you are...
You were the victim's husband.
Would you show me some papers for identification.
Driver's license or some such.
I hope you haven't been doing any driving in the last hours.
I can smell brandy.
What's this?
Maurila, a handkerchief.
Well now, you are coming with us. 
Maurila, you come with me.
Turunen, you take care of things here.
Aitamaa, Olavi. A doctor of medicine and surgery.
I am Mankala, inspector Mankala.
Do you happen to remember - that you cut my wife's gallstones a few years back?
Maurila, if that typewriter won't begin to work, - you'll be made a traffic police to the market square.
Yeah, this isn't working.
I'll write by hand.
Doctor Aitamaa, you were met by your wife's body - under suspicious circumstances, in your hand the knife your wife was killed with.
Knife in hand and a pistol in your pocket.
You don't think that I...
That thought is very near...
Have I been arrested?
- Yes. For interrogation.
But I can explain everything.
I didn't kill my wife, - but I know who did.
- Then who?
A tall, young man with sunglasses.
I saw him with my wife.
A tall, young man with sunglasses?
Listen now, doctor, - we won't get anywhere like this.
And I'm going to solve this case.
That man was my wife's lover.
We'll come to him later.
You just start from the beginning.
And remember - that it is most unusual to find a doctor of medicine - by her dead wife, with a knife in his hand.
I had for some time suspected that my wife has a lover
Today... or yesterday she received a letter.
I noticed, that it was from that man.
My wife burnt it.
I wanted to be certain.
I went to the city.
And then happened what
I had thought... they met each other.
An amazing story.
Well now, let's summarise.
You left to shadow your wife - to be certain that she was being unfaithful.
You followed her into town, where you saw her meet a man - with whom she went here and there.
And finally you saw them go to the scene of murder and... - make love to each other.
That was enough for you.
You left, and walked about.
Then you met a young red-haired woman - whose name you also don't know.
You spent a couple of hours with her, doing this and that.
You left her in her own bed and quickly found yourself to be - by your dead wife's body, - a knife in your hand and a pistol in your pocket.
Would you believe this story even yourself?
Doctor Aitamaa - you are a learned, civilized man.
How can you degrade yourself with this kind of behaviour?
What purpose did you have taking that gun with you?
You meant to shoot your wife and her lover - but for some reason you settled for stabbing your wife twice, - and now you're making up stories for me.
You are wrong, you have to believe me.
If I have to believe you, - you have to prove that you are speaking the truth.
Your only witness is that red-haired woman, - that scarlet dove, with whom - you claim to have been when the murder was committed
Are you still claiming to not know her name?
How is it possible - that you went as far as her bed, - without even knowing her name?
You don't really need a name for that.
I don't know her name, but I know where she lives.
And that's where we're going.
And Lord help you,
Aitamaa, - that we find the woman from that address.
So! Matinkatu 17.
No house.
No woman.
Aitamaa, you lied.
Hey, watchman.
When was the last time there was a building here?
They took it down couple years back.
An old shack it was.
Full of whores and booze.
They haven't started to build another one yet...
What the hell?
Karra, circle around!
Alarm all the cars, quickly!
Hey, close that window.
I'm not wearing anything.
Doctor Aitamaa!
I remember you!
I may be old, but I still have my memory.
It's half five in the morning.
Isn't this a peculiar time for a visit?
Are you not well? Oh my good man, sit down!
What has happened?
Oh my good man, what should I do.
I should have some brandy here for medicine.
Genuine pharmacist's brandy.
My good man, what should I do?
It's half five in the morning.
Drink that.
Dean,
I apologise for coming
But I had not other place to go to.
You married us. My wife and me, sixteen years ago.
They suspect me for murdering my wife.
They are after me.
I couldn't go anywhere else.
Helena is dead!
She has been murdered!
Did you do it? - No, but they don't believe me.
I'm sorry, my heart is not what it used to be.
Really, I shouldn't complain - when all that has happened to you.
Oh my good people.
That was a horrid tale.
It is like you are on the cross.
But what can you do?
You cannot stay here.
You have to give yourself up to the police.
You cannot stay here.
I want to meet that woman I told you about.
And I want to meet that man, who murdered Helena.
I do understand you - but the only sensible thing to do is to go to the police.
Wait
See, it's your picture. 
It's all here.
Do as I beg of you.
Good man, come to your senses.
A wife of a famous doctor murdered - 
Husband suspected for the killing on the run
(praying)
You will go to the police?
- No
You do understand, that you're only making it worse?
Your hands are dirty and so is your face.
Wash yourself.
Bathroom is on the right. 
You must understand, that my duty is to notify the police  -- that you have been here.
I will call the police ten minutes after you have gone.
May God protect him.
And forgive me.
A doctor's wife murdered -
Husband arrested, now on the run
Ritva, you know me don't you?
For God's sake, say that you know me.
What do you want?
Erkki, Erkki come here.
I don't understand what this man wants.
724. Tampere to the eight.
Could I order a call? 
-Yes?
Snappertuna 18.
- What kind?
A quick one. - Please wait a moment.
You can wait on the bench over there.
Kuopio 14701 to the fifth.
Snappertuna 18, to the ninth.
Snappertuna 18, to the ninth!
Martta, is that Martta?
It's the doctor.
Doctor, where are you? Is it true? is the Mrs dead?
The police are here.
Talk, doctor, where are you?
Martta, give my best to the children.
Tell that I love them. 
Tell them that mother is dead, but I didn't kill her.
Tell them...
The ship leaves
tomorrow at three
At three
Hey... hello, you didn't pay!
I told you that we're late.
-Yes but we'll make it.
The card if you please...
- The card?
The boarding card and the tickets are with my wife, that lady over there.
When does the bar open?
- As soon as the ship leaves.
Dear God, where's that brown suitcase?
I put it just there.
Come over here, check the tickets.
Tell them to come quick!
Officers
You are wanted for your wife's murder, doctor Aitamaa.
There's a police aboard, who will certainly be happy - to meet you.
Should I get him?
Why did you hate Helena so much,
 that you killed her?
Only you, doctor Aitamaa, claim that I killed her.
Only you, doctor Aitamaa.
Why did you hate her?
You are wrong.
- Why?
I lover her!
- Why did you kill her?
I loved her, more than anything!
She loved me, 
I loved her!
Listen, I wanted her all for myself.
All for myself.
But she didn't want to leave you, you and the children.
I wanted her, I loved her.
No, I'll tell everything!
Well now, doctor Aitamaa.
Isn't this pretty.
If this is a middle-age crisis -- then it's beginning nicely.
Listen, we have to go now.
Martta wants to know if the crab water has enough salt
And the cocktails have to be made.
We have to go.
Olavi, they're coming already.
Hello, welcome!
Hello, Helena!
Hi!
Welcome.
Oh it's nice to see you alive!
Alive? - Yes, I mean lively.
In good health and all.
Of course I'm in good health -
I haven't partied in days!
After all I'm a judge, not a drinker.
Well, I might be a little crabby tomorrow, with all the crabs we're eating today.
But I'm not about to die from that.
- What would kill you anyway?
I brought my secretary along, 
I hope you don't mind.
She would have been all by herself in a big city. - Call her in.
Miss Huurre.
Don't be so shy.
She's also useful, - as she is driving me back to town.
Welcome, Miss Huurre.
Good evening, doctor.
We have met.
We have met? Where?
- Don't you remember?
In the judge's office.
Oh yes, of course.
Excuse me, your name doesn't happen to be Ritva?
No, I'm lrja. But I can be
Ritva too, if you want.
Welcome
You are simply stunning today!
May I present?
Miss Huurre, my wife.
Welcome
I woke up because I heard voices.
Father...
What are you doing down here?
- I heard voices.
You have to go back to bed, you're not well!
Evening, professor, how is the professor doing?
Better than him!
Where's that champagne?
Right here.
A glass for the professor!
That's nothing yet - but should I tell you the dream
I had last night?
That's enough dreams and champagne.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Don't spill!
Good night, father
Good night, professor.
Sleep well!
By spoiling the ending, you ruin the suspense from others!
What shall we do now?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that we start.
Will you be kind enough to follow me?
What I'm going to show you will be mainly the traditional things.
Up here I can show you the detail in the production, which we are rather proud of showing.
What you're seeing now is a model, petal by petal.
And this is an art which has survived here at the factory for almost 200 years.
And you will see the garland there, it takes two days to complete.
As you see, the flowers are modeled petal by petal and stamen by stamen.
Even in very small flowers, you can find as many as 10 to 15 stamens.
The figurine, which you see being ornated with flowers here, was first made as a gift from Danish women to our Danish king.
Please follow me farther up here.
As we walk farther down here,
I can show you overlay painting represented by...
You can move around here, I think that everybody will be able to see.
Why don't you come a bit closer and have a look at how things are painted?
And now we can proceed to the next department.
Please follow me here.
I'm sorry.
Can I pay for this?
You can dial the number yourself.
Thank you.
Miss Kusenov, where's your father?
Oh.
Fine.
All right.
Now listen to this.
Do you know a department store here in Copenhagen called Den Permanente?
Den Permanente.
That's right.
It closes at 5:30.
I want you and your father and mother to be there at 5:15, shopping.
As soon as you arrive there, be aware that we will be outside.
Tamara!
Get your heads down, quick!
All right.
All right, they're gone.
Go right on up.
Thank you.
All right, thank you.
Are you all right now?
It was very clumsy, this operation.
What?
This, in front of the store.
Very clumsy.
Well, you got away, didn't you?
It wasn't the way we would have done it.
Give that...
When you contact Wiesbaden, ask them how long a wait there'll be on that C-135 to Washington.
Hello...
Hi...
This is Mr. and Mrs. Kusenov and their daughter, Tamara.
This is Mr. McKittreck and Mr. Blake.
Madam.
Would you come this way, please?
Well, what's he like?
He's a darling man.
You'll see.
He's what you wanted.
He's really a big one.
They must be raising hell in Moscow today.
Is that the White House?
No, that's the Capitol building, seat of the government.
I'll show you the White House further along.
There it is.
It's nice.
- Good morning, Howard.
- Good morning.
This is where you'll live for a while. Come along.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
What is this?
We'd like you to be comfortable here and to feel at home.
If there is anything at all we can do...
Is it your house?
No, but I'll be coming here quite often.
Mr. Kusenov, we would like you in here for a few minutes, please, if you don't mind.
All right. Yes.
All three of you, please.
Why?
I beg your pardon?
It isn't necessary for them.
We will want all three of you, please.
One at a time.
Mrs. Kusenov, please.
Now what's the matter, Mike?
Couldn't that wait till tomorrow?
Why?
Well, they've had a pretty rough 24 hours.
They need to relax.
Didn't they relax on the plane?
I always do.
Here he is.
- Hmm?
- Devereaux.
Good.
I ask you not to be difficult.
Then let him show some respect.
Respect is something he rarely shows.
He is second in command...
I am not such an imbecile that he has to tell me what to say and what not to say.
No, I do not need him at military meetings.
- Yes, you do.
- Huh?
I'm sorry. You've been here from Paris only a few months.
He has been here in Washington several years.
And he is too close to the Americans.
I agree.
But the closeness has value.
He's built up the best intelligence organization in the western hemisphere.
He is very expert, and he is a dedicated man.
And I, too, sometimes wish that he would show some respect.
Mr. Devereaux is here.
Yes. Let him come in.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, D'Arcy.
Good morning, General.
Received a message from Paris.
A high Russian intelligence official has defected to the Americans.
How long ago?
We don't know.
Why didn't you know about this?
Because the Americans didn't tell me.
How did Paris know about this?
Did the Russians tell them?
It's peculiar, don't you think?
A Russian intelligence officer defects, and someone in Moscow rushes over to the phone and calls someone in Paris.
Who? Why?
What?
No, Andre. How Paris got its information is not our concern.
We're being asked to find out where the Americans are hiding the defector and how.
Why?
Huh?
What will Paris do once we have found out?
Pass the information back on to Moscow?
Andre.
And so two men will arrive to liquidate him?
What are you trying to say?
Nothing, General.
I just wonder how Paris got the information.
Yes, that's right.
He's here. I'll tell him.
These are six classified top secret documents of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
NATO. I am an authority on NATO.
That's what you keep telling us.
They're numbered and they are initialed.
And we want to know which of them crossed your desk in Moscow.
This one.
This one.
This one.
They are fakes, those two, to see if I really know, to test me.
You are childish.
These are fakes.
When did you become a deputy chief of KGB?
This is of no concern to you.
We would like to be the ones to decide that.
No. I will decide.
What the hell do you think you're here for?
I asked for sanctuary and protection for myself, my wife and my child.
And you got it.
But I gave you no understanding.
Look, the way you're going, you may find yourself on the front steps of the Russian embassy tomorrow.
And that would be the end for me.
But you would never get another defector.
Colonel Kusenov, does the word
"Topaz" mean anything to you?
In what context?
Just the word "Topaz."
It's a gem, a stone used in jewelry.
In intelligence matters.
Where have you seen this word?
What does it mean to you?
It's for you, Mike.
I'll be right there.
Nothing.
You have never used or heard it used?
Topaz as a code word?
No.
Colonel Kusenov, here is a list of...
- Who is it?
- Your secretary.
Yes, Peggy, what is it?
From the French what?
Andre Devereaux?
What did he want?
Oh!
All right. Call him back and say yes, and find out what time.
Right. See you later.
What did he want?
He called and asked me to dinner.
Well?
I had dinner with him only two nights ago.
Now, why did you suddenly ask Mike to dinner?
Because he adores your food.
And you want something out of him.
I promise you, it's going to be a short evening.
Oh, I wish we could go home to Paris.
You could easily have a job in the foreign office.
Who said so?
Claire D'Arcy.
Diplomats' wives should not talk.
All wives talk.
She also said that you are too involved with the Americans.
D'Arcy's an ass.
Andre, you are French.
You are not supposed to be mixed up in this Cold War between the Americans and the Russians.
You are neutral.
No one is neutral.
I don't want you to be killed.
Okay. I'm going.
And you two secret agents can settle down and be secret agents.
I wish you wouldn't use such words, my love.
Why?
Who do you think you are fooling, my master spy?
Everybody in Washington knows that you are not a commercial attaché.
Everybody in Washington knows that the chief of Russian intelligence is the chauffeur who drives a car for...
Everybody in Washington does not know these things, and I will thank you not to repeat them.
Go to bed.
Nicole, where did you hear that about the chief of
Russian intelligence?
From my butcher.
I'll be glad when Michele gets here and I can talk to someone who is not looking over his shoulder.
Is your daughter coming over from Paris?
With her husband.
He's covering the opening of the United Nations for a Paris newspaper.
And we are going to see them in New York and to have a marvelous holiday.
And we are not going to see a single solitary spy.
You might stumble over a few if you go to the United Nations.
We are not going to the United Nations.
Michele and her husband are going.
We are going to have fun, right?
Right.
I seem to gather, Nicole, that you don't care much for the work we do.
How do you guess?
You should be used to it by this time.
A wife never gets used to it.
But I like you, Mike.
For an intelligence man, you are very nice.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for a beautiful dinner.
- Brandy?
- Yes, thanks.
She wants you to quit.
You thinking about it?
No.
I understand you have a Russian defector.
What is his name?
Boris Kusenov. We have him at a safe house outside Washington.
Don't you think I knew what I was getting into when I was asked to dinner?
Then why did you come?
To tell you everything you want to know.
Provided I don't pass the information back on to Paris.
Mmm-hmm.
McKittreck says I'm taking a big chance.
Am I?
Mike, you and I have done things for each other that no other agents in this town would do.
And I'd like to keep it that way.
Colonel Kusenov, we would like to know everything you can tell us about one subject. Cuba.
Cuba. The technicians.
The Russian technicians in Cuba.
How many are there?
My estimate, 4,500.
By now, possibly 5,000.
Military?
Military, civilian, construction crew.
Mostly technical and electronic experts of the highest order.
What are they doing there?
They came bearing gifts from Russia to Cuba.
What kind of gifts?
The KGB is carefully divided.
Cuba was never in my field.
I cannot give you facts.
Damn it.
Kusenov, you made an agreement with me!
Yes, I know.
I made my bargain with the devil.
Facts. Yes, I will tell you where you will find your facts.
There is a Cuban named Rico Parra.
You know him.
A leader of the Cuban government.
He was in the movement from the beginning.
That's correct.
He was in Moscow recently for conferences, then flew directly to New York as head of the Cuban delegation to the United Nations.
I met him in Moscow.
What were the conferences?
To draw up an agreement, or call it a trade pact, or call it an aide-mémoire.
An agreement between the Soviet Union and Cuba, setting down exactly what the Soviet Union is now supplying and will supply to Cuba.
Offensive weapons?
Have the Russians brought offensive weapons into Cuba?
I told you,
I cannot give you facts.
But Rico Parra has the trade pact.
He has the aide-mémoire.
It's all there for you to read, if you can obtain it.
Who else might handle these papers besides Rico Parra?
Ah!
You have become smart.
Yes, there is another man.
Luis Uribe,
Rico Parra's secretary.
He is a security risk.
How do you know?
I have used him.
But the Cubans don't know.
He can be bought.
But he is of no use to you.
Why?
He hates Americans.
Does he hate
American money?
He would never take it from an American.
You can believe me.
So now I've given you my information.
What will you do with it?
- Michele!
- Andre!
Mother!
- François!
- Good to see you.
Hello, François.
Hello, Father.
- You look wonderful.
- You too.
You have done something to your hair.
Let me see.
Do you like it?
- My husband wants me to cut it.
- No, I like it.
- Agreed.
- Come along.
How long can you stay in New York?
When do you have to go back to Paris?
In five days.
Then we will stay five days.
There's so much to see and do.
New York is marvelous.
And we will do it all.
Well, it all starts so well.
Oh! It's them.
Thank you.
Hello, Nicole, Andre.
I hope you don't mind my dropping in like this.
I wanted to be sure the flowers were in the room when you arrived.
Michele, you remember
Mr. Nordstrom?
Oh, yes.
It's been a couple of years.
François Picard,
Michael Nordstrom.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Your bags are all in, sir.
Andre?
Yes.
Thank you.
I understand that you're here for a Paris newspaper.
Yes. For the opening of the United Nations.
François, we have to change for our dinner.
Hmm?
Oh, yes. Excuse me.
I do apologize, Nicole.
Thanks for the flowers, Mike.
Now, before you say, "What do you want" or "Get the hell out," consider that I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to be.
You can't do this to Nicole.
I have to, Andre.
- How did you find us?
- Well, you told me...
Never mind.
You both told me you were going to be in New York. It was...
Never mind.
What do you want?
There is an arrangement in writing between Russia and Cuba that we must see.
Now, Rico Parra is in...
I can't talk to Rico Parra.
- He hates my guts.
- I know that.
Rico Parra has a secretary named Luis Uribe.
Why don't you do this job yourself?
We can't. Uribe can't be approached by an American.
No. I'm sorry.
Just one of your people here to photograph those papers.
Just a taxi ride to Harlem, that's all we're asking of you.
This Uribe can be bought.
Andre, do this for us.
You know I wouldn't be here if there was any other way.
François, the sketches you made at the United Nations, did you do the Cuban delegates?
Some, yes.
Did you make a sketch of a man named Luis Uribe?
I'll see.
There he is.
Could we have this page?
If it's for a good cause.
I would hate to have to do it over.
You'll get it back.
Okay. You can have it.
Could I ask you what this is about?
I am your son-in-law.
You're also a newspaperman.
Take care of the women.
I'll get to the colony as soon as I can.
You're going out?
Have your drinks. I'll try to get there before you start your dinner.
And tell Nicole not to worry.
I'll let Michele tell her.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
The money.
You understand, this can't have anything to do with us.
If anything goes wrong, it's your operation.
I know.
I'll head back to Washington.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Yes.
I would like to see Mr. Dubois.
Whom shall I say?
Franco-American
Finance Company.
Oh, hello. Come in.
Come in.
It's a long time since you came yourself.
It was that sudden.
I have an urgent and vital job to be done tonight.
I hope you are free.
Always free for you.
Can we go into your office?
No, that's all open.
We'd better go in here.
You might find it a bit chilly.
You remember his name?
Yes. Luis Uribe.
Why does he hate Americans?
I was told he lost a son at the Bay of Pigs.
Oh.
This is all pretty iffy. I won't have much chance to organize anything.
You'll just have to improvise.
Oh, lots of luck.
What about your camera?
Always ready and loaded.
This way.
Be sure you let him know you are French, not American.
Better than that. I'm from the island of Martinique.
That makes us practically related.
Good.
Here is my little one.
How do you propose to get up there?
I think I'll be a reporter.
I'm loaded with press cards.
Who do you think I ought to work for tonight? Ebony? Playboy?
The Jersey City
Post Ledger?
Ebony.
I think they identify better with Playboy.
Ebony.
Oh, man, are you square.
Okay. Let's go.
Oh! One tiny matter.
The money.
Benny, work on this cross, will you?
And don't brighten it up too much.
I'll try not to.
Where will you be?
Along in here, across the road.
Watch yourself, Philippe.
It's the best thing I do.
What do you want?
I have an appointment with Señor Parra's secretary. Uribe.
Go ahead.
There he is now.
Thanks, Mac.
I said no.
Now, go on.
But Rico told me he would see us.
Yes, he told us he would see us this morning.
Well, I tell you tonight, he will not see you. Now, get out, both of you.
Who are you to tell us...
Look, I said he will not see you!
Rico! It's me,
Matteo Gomez!
And Tomas Bosch.
Rico!
I said get out, both of you!
Where are those papers now, exactly?
In a red leather case on the floor, next to his desk, locked.
If I get Parra away from his desk for a few minutes for an interview, can you get the case and bring it here?
He will not give you an interview.
Then I fail.
But I'm not going to fail in your bathroom. Come on.
Wait one minute.
Who is he?
It is all right,
Hernandez. Please.
Get out.
Get the hell out of here!
Fools! You want to get us all arrested? Get out!
But, Rico, you said you wanted us to show that we're not afraid.
That we're not afraid of the Americans.
So you're going to bomb the Statue of Liberty?
- Get out!
- Señor Parra.
I wonder if I could have just a few minutes of your time.
- Who are you?
- Wait one minute.
Comrade Rico, this man is from Ebony magazine.
If you will speak to him for a minute.
I give no more interviews.
What is the matter?
Are you anti-Negro?
Leave him alone.
There are no color barriers in Cuba.
We are a free and democratic nation.
All men are comrades.
Then you will talk to me.
After what your American newspapers said about the Cuban delegation?
I am not the American newspapers.
I would like you to come out on the balcony with me and let me photograph you waving to our people, to my people.
Will you do that?
And what will you print about Cuba?
Whatever you tell me. One statement to go with the pictures.
What is this?
This is my camera.
It's a funny little camera.
It does very good work.
How about one this way?
No, no. Keep waving, please. Keep waving.
I think you've had enough.
No, just two more, please.
Two more.
Thank you, Señor Parra.
Now, what do you want me to say to go with the pictures?
Tell your people, we are a small country now, but soon, very soon, we'll not be afraid of anybody, not of anybody.
Good.
Something is happening.
No, I did not say that.
Only write what I say.
Good. Thank you,
Señor Parra.
Comrade.
Comrade.
Comrade.
Orlando, I want two copies of this.
Orlando.
Where is the red case?
Uribe took it.
Uribe.
Why? He has no key.
I have the only key.
Hernandez.
Have you got your gun?
Come with me.
Excuse me.
Give me your gun.
Get him!
Come with me!
There he is!
Sorry, señor.
All right, Benny.
I'll finish it.
Is it okay?
It looks fine.
Does Rene D'Arcy know that you're going to Cuba?
Yes, of course.
Does Paris know?
I assume so.
Andre, I don't want you to go.
I'm afraid for you, for your career, for your life.
I've got to.
I promised.
I started all this, and I'm going to finish it.
Let the Americans do their own dirty work.
They can't.
They have no organization in Cuba since the Bay of Pigs.
All their agents are dead or in jail.
And so they asked you?
Yes.
It can be no one but you?
I want it to be me.
Those papers we photographed the other day in New York scared the hell out of me.
Not just the Americans. Me.
I've got to see what the Russians are up to in Cuba.
There is a woman in Cuba, isn't there, named Juanita de Cordoba?
Where did you hear that name?
Where else?
From Claire D'Arcy.
Who got it from her husband, who got it from your French office in Havana.
I don't want that name used, mentioned ever.
Why? What is she to you?
She's in the Cuban underground.
She sometimes works for me.
Ah.
What else does she do for you?
Nicole, she is the head of a network in Cuba.
I shouldn't tell you these things.
It is dangerous to talk of her, even to hint that you know...
But I do know. That's the trouble.
I wish I didn't.
I know that you go to Cuba four or five times a year, and that she's beautiful.
I go to Cuba four or five times a year because it is my job.
That's all.
Now I don't want to talk about it.
Will you come down with me?
Good-bye.
Nicole?
You'd better wait.
I'll send the boy out.
Give him my overnight case and the typewriter.
And take this and the suitcase in the back to the residence.
What time will you be in Havana tomorrow?
I'll call you when to send a car for me.
- Juanita.
- Hello.
Señor Parra.
Monsieur Devereaux.
You're back soon.
I'm always happy to return to Cuba.
Hmm.
I'm sure you are.
And to come here to pay my respects.
I'm happy to see you, Juanita.
Thank you.
Nylon things from the United States.
I hope your government won't mind.
I didn't inform the customs.
And how are things in Washington?
Routine.
Nothing exceptional.
I was in New York only 24 hours ago.
Oh?
How are things in New York?
See any good shows?
No. Routine.
Nothing exciting.
Will I see you tonight?
No. Not tonight.
Well, you'll be at the rally tomorrow?
Fidel expects you.
Mmm-hmm.
Is there a rally tomorrow?
Mmm.
I'd like to listen to Castro.
I'm sorry we can't have you with us on the platform.
No, no. I like to be part of the crowd.
Señor Devereaux.
Get my things, will you?
Monsieur Vatel knows which ones.
Yes, sir.
I am very glad to see you, sir.
- Please take this in for me, Tomas.
- Yes, señora.
Thank you.
You sent no word.
Tried to phone you from Mexico City between planes.
Didn't the office call you?
Less than an hour ago, when he was here.
You picked a hell of a time to come.
Security's tight. This island is crawling with Russians.
I know. I have come to take a look at them and what they're up to.
I haven't been able to send any information out to Miami in weeks.
Well, I'm here now to do all I can.
So, Rico Parra is still your faithful companion and protector.
And landlord.
Did he come to collect the rent?
How is your wife?
Maybe we ought to start all over again.
I think we'd better.
I don't get this.
The French don't give a damn what the Russians do in Cuba.
The Americans do.
Well, that's going to be tough.
Cuba's locked up.
The Russians have it like this.
I'm going to need help from your organization.
No use. Most of my people are in hiding.
The only thing you can do is stay with me for a few days.
Then go home.
Let's get down to the business of opening our present.
Our present?
Yes.
Yours and mine.
A radio?
A Geiger counter.
This will tell us if the Russians have brought in nuclear warheads.
There's a tape recorder inside.
Clever.
You'll have to find out what streets in Havana they use to transport the missiles at night.
That's a job for Tomas.
And this one?
We have got lots of cameras.
Not like this one.
Remote control.
You can put the camera half a mile away.
And take pictures of what?
The missiles, of course.
At San Cristano?
We'll never get near there, darling.
We have tried.
I'll show you how in the morning.
Now, the other things
I need.
What units of
Soviet troops are here, any new types of aircraft, and the caves.
Where are the biggest caves?
The biggest ones are at Managua.
Good.
Is that all?
I think so.
Oh, I nearly forgot.
A non-electronic present.
Oh, is that beautiful!
Thank you.
Let me show you how this works.
It's the radium in the clock figures that's causing it.
Not yet 10:00 and you've done nearly a day's work.
That's organization for you.
I showed Tomas what to do with the typewriter.
I know.
He'll do the job.
And now you'll go into Havana and behave like an innocent commercial attaché.
And you go to the rally with your landlord.
See you tonight.
Adiós.
Please sit down,
Mrs. Mendoza.
We are leaving now.
No, no, sit down.
Is everything ready?
Yes, señora. Just this last, the long-distance lens.
- Good.
- And look, señora.
Very good.
And here.
- Cover them up.
- All right.
We must make sure Pablo does not eat the camera.
Here, here, señora.
From here I can get a clear view of everything that's going on in the Port of Viriel.
Aren't you too near the road?
I promise you, it is safe.
Then here is your picnic.
Have a good time.
You will take care of Mrs. Mendoza?
God bless you.
Thank you.
Take care of your man.
I will.
Ricardo, take a look.
There's someone up there.
It was a man and a woman.
Manuel, Enrique, Rafael.
You others, stay here.
How long have you been here?
Some time.
You can see, we're broken down.
Have you seen any other car go by in the last minute?
Yes, I saw one a few moments ago.
It went down the road.
What kind of a car?
I think it was a black one.
Who was in it?
A man and a woman,
I think.
Ricardo! It's them!
Pablo! Pablo!
Carlotta!
Take 'em.
Señor, you're making a mistake.
We don't know why you're taking us.
Follow us.
There is a man. The night the papers were photographed in New York, outside the Theresa Hotel.
Where?
Are you sure?
He was as close to me then as you are now.
Shall I have him picked up?
No. Not yet.
Well, that's understandable.
After all...
May I join you for coffee?
Rico, let me give you some dinner. Dolores!
Just coffee, thanks.
I've had dinner.
Too bad.
It's beautiful chicken.
Oh.
Black market.
You might have phoned.
It was a sudden urge.
Señora?
Ask Tomas to bring some coffee for Señor Parra.
Sí, señora.
Please sit down.
I've just come from having a long talk with my ex-secretary Uribe.
You know Uribe?
No.
You know of him?
No.
Why did you dismiss Uribe?
He turned out to be unsatisfactory.
Still, he was persuaded to tell me what I wanted to know, before he went on his journey.
Journey?
The journey from which no traveler ever returns.
What had he done?
It seems he was working for the French.
And the French, I suspect, were working for the Americans.
So you had a sudden urge to come here.
What does that have to do with Andre?
Just because he's French?
The night in New York when Uribe gave documents to a Frenchman to photograph inside the Theresa Hotel, there was another Frenchman outside the hotel.
There may have been several.
Mmm.
Well, the only one
I give a damn about is the one who was so conveniently knocked over when the French spy escaped.
That was smart.
What's this about?
Were you in New York?
Yes. For fun.
You are putting two and two together and getting eight.
And the things you learned from those papers about Russia and Cuba are the reason why you're suddenly here.
And that makes nine.
I was in New York.
I did go up to Harlem to see the show you were putting on.
And it was a very good show.
The rest is coincidence.
Now, this is what
I came to tell you.
If it were not for her, if it were not that it might involve her, you would disappear tonight.
You would be with Uribe.
Your country would receive bewildered apologies, but you would never be heard from again.
She is a widow of a hero of the revolution.
She is loved and honored in this country.
You are an intelligence agent.
Your association with her can put her in grave danger.
I want you out of the country on the next plane early tomorrow morning.
And if you have been collecting information about what the Russians are doing in Cuba to help us here, don't think for one minute you will take it out with you.
You will not.
You will be searched at the airport, completely.
And if anything is found on you, you will be arrested.
And what can happen to you after that is something you know about.
Now, if you don't mind cutting your dinner short,
I'll take you back to Havana to pack your bags.
No, you will not take him back to Havana.
He is my guest.
He will have his dinner and he will enjoy my company for as long as he pleases.
And when he's ready to go back into Havana, he will phone the residence for a car to come and get him.
You're being a damned fool.
You've made up this story because it's what you want to believe, because of me.
I don't believe he had any contact with your man Uribe, and I don't think anyone else would.
If you're doing him any harm,
I will raise such hell, and you know I can.
And next time you decide to drop in on me like this, please telephone first.
Tomorrow morning.
Come in.
I have brought the typewriter.
It is done.
Good, Tomas.
And the car is waiting for you.
May I show you?
What time did the missiles go through Havana?
Just before 3:00 in the morning.
On long trailers with soldiers and jeeps and many, many trucks.
And the thing clicked?
Oh, how it clicked.
Not from the missiles, but when the trucks went by, covered with canvas, then.
Click, click, click.
Look. Just the way you showed me.
The tapes are right in the center of the spool.
They would have to undo yards of ribbon to find them.
Good boy.
Where is the information about the Russian troops, the caves and the installations?
Here. All neatly typed out and miniaturized as a microdot on the bottom period.
All right.
Now, you will give me your own razor and extra blades?
Here is your new razor and the cartridge for the blades.
How do you fit the film in there?
We just fold each one.
Very good.
Something for you to read on the plane.
Thank you.
No. Not now.
I will take these down.
- Come.
- No.
No farewells at the front door.
I shall say good-bye to you here, where I own you.
If things get worse for you here, we'll get you out.
I have ways.
I'll never leave here.
I'm Cuban.
I love my country.
No matter what,
I have to see it through.
I shall worry about you at the airport.
I'll get through.
I don't know.
Will you phone me before you get on the plane?
Be sure.
There's something
I have to tell you.
Tell me now.
No. But before you get on the plane.
All right.
Go.
Go.
You found out?
Yes.
Who were they working for?
Ask her.
Well, who?
You ask her.
Who were you working for?
Who sent you to spy at Viriel?
Who?
Cordoba.
What? Say it.
Juanita de Cordoba.
Guerrero, get down to the airport. I'll call you.
You'd better get out there.
Search everywhere.
Turn the house inside out. Everything.
Look in her bedroom.
What's all this?
You will not touch my bedroom!
Rico, stop this!
Come down.
No, no! Keep out.
You cannot go in there!
Tomas, stop them!
No!
Dolores!
You know some people named Mendoza?
Yes.
They have been saying terrible things about you.
I do not believe them.
Muñoz believes.
I can't.
They were tortured?
If you torture people long enough...
I do not want to believe them.
Hey, Rico. We have found it.
In the pantry.
A darkroom for cameras for developing pictures and all kinds of machinery to make them small.
And it's all true. They've been operating from this house.
Get me the airport.
You know what this is?
For razor blades.
It is where they hide the film.
Hello, Guerrero.
Do you still have the Frenchman?
Nothing? All right.
I'll tell you where to find it.
In a small package of razor blades, the injector type razor.
The small, thin ones that slide out!
Call me back!
You know where.
So it is true.
I have to believe now.
The things that you have done against us, against what we are trying to do.
Why?
Because you make my country a prison.
No. You cannot judge.
Not you.
You shouldn't have done this.
To fool me, to work against me.
You're part of it.
So now we'll have to do to you what we did to the Mendozas, to find out the names of all the others and all the things that you have done.
And we will find out.
The things that will be done to your body, this body.
Yes, Guerrero.
What? Nothing?
No film?
But what was in the razor blade case?
Razor blades?
Guererro, what do you mean you had to let him go?
All right.
All right!
They let him go.
Hello. Who's this?
Oh, Señor Devereaux.
Señora de Cordoba?
I'm afraid not.
Something has happened.
She's dead. Shot.
Señor Parra?
He is gone.
That's quite a pile of mail.
Has Nicole gone away?
Yes, yes.
I didn't tell you.
She thought she might go to Paris for a while, as long as I was going to be away.
She didn't see as much of Michele in New York as she hoped.
That was my fault.
I'm sorry about that.
No, no, she got a bit homesick for Paris anyway, and she didn't know how long I would be in Cuba.
The amount of junk mail that accumulates in just a few days.
Come and have a drink.
You sure you wouldn't like to be alone, unpack, call Nicole?
No. Besides, you should be able to phone your office in a few minutes.
They must have that stuff from Cuba processed by now.
I won't be a minute.
I'll just get some ice.
Ah, Rene, come in.
I've come to...
You know Mike Nordstrom?
Rene D'Arcy.
Yes. Hello.
Hello.
We're just about to have a drink.
Will you join us?
No, I only dropped by to see you now that you're back.
- If I could speak to you alone.
- I'll go.
No, no, please.
We can go to my study.
Here, make yourself a drink. Come, Rene.
You left quite a few complications behind.
Yes, I know.
So it is done, whatever you have done.
The Cuban government has protested your activities directly to Paris.
I am here to instruct you to be on the next plane to Paris tonight.
You'll report to the director general.
Well, the end of
Washington for me.
I've been recalled.
I'm sorry.
You know how grateful we all are for your contribution.
It confirms our information from other sources, including the U-2 photos.
What do you think will happen in Paris?
Oh, a board of inquiry,
I suppose.
Why I went to Cuba, what I did, who I did it for, why I did it for you, and what I found out.
I want you to take a ride with me out to the safe house.
While you were away, the Russian came up with some revelations that'll shake you.
What about?
The leaks in Paris.
He spelled the whole thing out for us.
I want you to listen to him before you face those people over there.
Thank you, Mrs. Fawcett.
I will serve the coffee.
Mrs. Fawcett makes wonderful coffee.
Will that be all?
Yes, thank you,
Mrs. Fawcett.
Monsieur Devereaux?
No, thank you.
Mr. Nordstrom.
Black with one sugar?
Mr. McKittreck. Black?
Could I offer you a cigarette?
No. You are smoking.
And now again, Topaz.
These gentlemen have asked me to repeat to you about Topaz. Why?
Please do us a favor.
Tell him what you told us.
Then you succeeded in getting them the information from Cuba?
Yes.
And now they are afraid that you will be obliged to pass it on to your government.
And what is Topaz?
Topaz is a code name for a group of French officials in high circles who work for the Soviet Union.
I don't believe there is an organized ring.
The head of the ring has a code name Columbine.
I do not know him, but I know he is important and powerful.
Second man in line is Henri Jarre.
- Jarre!
- Yes.
Henri Jarre.
He was my direct contact.
Any vital document that passed across his desk came to me.
Do you know him, Andre?
Yes. He's an economist at NATO.
Then it is believable?
It's possible.
It's more than possible.
It's true.
So, now you will want to talk, you three, and I will go for a walk in the garden before the sun goes down.
Blake.
Monsieur Devereaux, you are faced with the same problem I had.
Whether to obey your conscience or to obey your government.
Let me give you a piece of advice.
Don't go home.
These people will give you a new life, a new job, everything.
Think it over.
Well?
Our government is preparing to take any action against Cuba or Russia that circumstances demand.
Any leak to the Russians of what we know at this time could be fatal.
If the Russians learn we're on the move because of all the information we have, they could make those missiles operational almost immediately, pointed at every big city in America.
And that means
France will be involved.
We have to inform our allies of our intentions.
When?
An American mission will arrive in Paris in three days.
And I am supposed to keep my mouth shut and uncover Topaz at the risk of my own skin?
That's quite a job, my friends.
Let me understand something.
Nobody up high is to know that we are here with Andre.
Otherwise,
I shall have to leave.
It is understood, Jean.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
I am not afraid.
It's a matter of protocol.
He has not seen the director general.
That is true.
And for myself,
I don't see how we can help.
Jacques, when you spoke to Jarre...
Ah! Here he is.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Andre, how are you?
I'm glad you came, Henri.
Good. We are all here.
Let's sit down.
Now, this is a serious matter for Andre.
Very grave.
And he has asked us to give him whatever advice we can before he faces the director general.
It is not so much the director general.
It is the whole board of inquiry he has to look out for.
There is nothing
I can tell them.
Nonsense. You went to Cuba on a mission for the Americans.
You obtained certain information for them. That's true.
Yes.
And you refuse to pass it on to your own government.
I cannot, my friends.
Believe me.
Why not?
Because there are leaks in our government, and I don't know where they are.
I think I must go.
No, Jean, stay.
No one will be compromised,
I promise you.
Andre, to be a man of principle is one thing, but a man doesn't cut his throat on principle.
I have no desire to cut my throat.
Then tell us, your friends.
That's why we're here.
Be reasonable, Andre.
We are trying to help you.
Yes, my friends.
Slowly. Slowly.
Let Andre tell us in his own way.
Have any of you, in your official work, had any hint of a spy ring called Topaz?
No?
What kind of a ring?
There's a number of Frenchmen, compatriots of ours, high in official circles, working for the Soviet Union.
I go.
Jean, sit down.
I need you.
I have nothing to do with spies.
I'm concerned with exposing them.
This is a fairy tale.
How do you know about this ring of spies?
The Americans have a Russian defector high in KGB.
We know that.
Yes, that is known.
I saw him.
I was allowed to talk to him.
He told me.
A spy ring called Topaz?
Yes.
What is the name of the defector?
Boris Kusenov.
But, Andre, that's not possible.
Why?
The KGB official of whom you speak,
Boris Kusenov, has been dead for over a year.
This man who has been planted on the Americans is obviously a double agent.
And he has taken in the Americans, and he has taken in you.
How do you know that?
What makes you think that?
It's a matter of record.
I have it in my file.
You know you're not supposed to come here unless I ask you.
I've been calling your office all afternoon.
I even called this number.
I hate to seem impatient, but I am expecting a visitor.
I apologize for this invasion of your privacy.
Why did you permit Devereaux to include me at that lunch?
If I had not, he would have wondered.
If you had not come, he would have wondered more.
But he knew. You could see that he knew about me.
No. He wasn't sure.
He was trying to find out.
And you, who behaved so well at the beginning, then did something extremely foolish.
You said that the Russian defector was dead.
It shook him.
It stopped him.
For the moment. By now, he's checking with the Americans.
By tomorrow, he will know that we are lying.
What will we do?
Nothing.
Let me give you something to settle your nerves.
A cognac?
You don't think Devereaux should be treated seriously?
An ominous and subtle suggestion,
Henri.
But these things are not done in panic.
You'll forgive me if I don't join you, for I am expecting a guest.
If I am
Devereaux's target now, how long before he will become a threat to others?
Jacques, this is not the first time we have been faced with a problem that demanded the final solution.
Now, if you will finish that cognac...
They are beginning to publish things in the newspaper that make me nervous.
Ah.
What things?
Those little hints of possible leaks in the government, in NATO?
Pay no attention.
It's nothing.
Nothing for you. Nobody would think of you in your position.
But me...
And now some journalist has called to ask me for an interview.
About what?
NATO.
That's perfectly innocent.
Give it to him. Did you refuse?
No. I said I would.
Very intelligent.
Jacques, if Devereaux has information from the Russian defector that I think he has, he must be stopped now.
Believe me.
How bloodthirsty you are.
What, Devereaux dead?
A grieving widow?
And an official investigation?
I hate to seem impatient, but I'm expecting a visitor.
You can find your way out.
Shall I call you after the interview?
What time will it be?
Call me afterwards.
Thank you for coming.
Why shouldn't I come?
I'm a free woman.
Good evening.
François Picard.
You're early.
We said 8:30.
No, we said 9:00.
I'm very sorry.
If it inconveniences you...
No, come in. Come in, as long as you're here.
Thank you.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Could I give you something?
No, thanks.
First, I want to thank you for permitting me to come.
Don't mention it. Yours is a very good newspaper.
Not like some of these...
But I don't know exactly what you want of me.
Nothing extraordinary.
I'm just inquiring into the workings of NATO, and since you're one of the top officials...
Do you mind if I sketch you while we talk?
It's one of my specialties, to sketch the people I'm interviewing.
The newspaper likes it.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Just relax,
Monsieur Jarre.
I am relaxed.
Good.
I only wonder what questions you want to ask.
They are very simple.
For example, you're a civilian official of NATO.
How does your authority compare with the military?
The importance of people in NATO has nothing to do with whether they wear a uniform or not.
Very good.
Then you are among those who make the decisions.
Yes, of course.
Even if they are military?
Military considerations are always subject to politics and the relations between countries.
I see.
And so you have access to all decisions that are made, military as well as political?
I did not say that.
I'm afraid you assumed too much.
I'm very sorry.
But we can assume, can't we, that in your position, you've access to confidential files?
I beg your pardon.
I don't see how that can be of interest to you.
Oh, Monsieur Jarre, the readers of our newspaper find such things fascinating.
For them, to know that a civilian like you can have access to military secrets...
You cannot print that I have access to military secrets.
Even if it were true, it would be classified information.
What a shame.
But you said before...
I said that I help make decisions.
That is different.
Okay. It's too bad.
But you see, sir, it is a rule for a newspaperman not to be dull.
Surely I can print that files marked "top secret" cross your desk every day.
Why do you stay on this subject?
What are you trying to find out?
Well, everyone knows that there are leaks in NATO.
What has that to do with me?
I'm just trying to clear up a discrepancy for my article.
What discrepancy?
Well, you see, sir, it is our information that a head of the Russian NATO desk,
Boris Kusenov, has defected and is now in Washington.
But we are also informed that you claim
Boris Kusenov is dead.
Could you clear up this discrepancy?
This is not a newspaper interview?
No, but I wouldn't mind publishing it.
Who sent you?
My father-in-law.
Who is he?
Andre Devereaux.
He sent you because
I don't know you.
And because I'm a journalist.
I can probe.
There is nothing to probe for.
Your mission has failed.
Oh, no, sir.
This cannot be escaped.
Boris Kusenov is alive and has stated you were his direct contact.
The Americans have NATO documents that you gave to him with your name on them, your initials on them, even notations signed by you.
Those documents can be on the desk of the head of our government in eight hours.
I do not think
I have failed.
What do you want of me?
Information.
And in return?
You'll be given time to disappear.
We know you'll be welcome elsewhere.
I am not going to talk to you.
Will you talk to Devereaux?
May I call Devereaux?
Yes.
Call him.
He must come here.
I'll talk to him here alone.
Understood.
Yes. Come in.
Hello, Michele?
Let me talk to Andre, quick.
Andre, listen.
It's done. Yes.
Alone?
Well, stay until I get there.
Then you can wait for me outside.
François.
François!
What is it?
I think we have been cut off.
Jarre, Jarre.
Here it is.
There is no answer.
Something has happened.
- I'm going over there.
- I'm coming.
No, you stay here.
I'm coming with you!
Here you are.
Good. There.
His car is here.
He must still be upstairs.
What's the matter?
Look. Look.
Jarre.
Michele? Is that you?
François?
Sit down.
I'll get you something.
What's the matter?
François.
What's happened to him? What's happened to him?
He disappeared.
He went to do a job for me.
What kind of job?
To interview a man in our government named Jarre.
He was working for the Russians.
Andre, I had a headache.
François!
Be careful.
What is it?
Well, to be honest,
I've been shot just a little.
Come on. Sit down.
There.
Mama!
- Oh! Take it easy.
- Wait, Michele. Wait.
It's nothing,
I promise you.
Hurts a little, but I don't even think it's bleeding.
What do you mean, not bleeding?
Go get some alcohol.
We haven't got any.
Then eau de cologne.
That's alcohol.
And a bandage.
Is the bullet in?
Let me have a look.
No, it just grazed you.
I told you, it's nothing.
Nothing! You disappear, it's nothing!
Could I have some whiskey?
You are shot, it's nothing!
Here, cognac.
Thank you.
What happened?
I don't know.
I was talking to you on the phone, remember?
Then I heard Jarre let some men into the apartment.
And then someone must have hit me on the head.
Feel that.
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.
And the next thing I knew, I was sitting in a car between two men.
They stopped to make a phone call, because they didn't know what to do with me.
They thought I was still unconscious.
When the car door opened, I jumped out and ran. There were two shots.
You might have been killed.
Did you go around to Jarre's apartment?
Yes. He's dead.
Dead?
Shot by those men?
They made it look like suicide.
A window was open, and his body was lying in a courtyard.
Who could they have been?
Messengers from Columbine, the head of Topaz.
Why?
I must have shaken
Jarre at that lunch.
He became a risk.
Ah.
Then Columbine must have been there, too.
Yes.
But who?
- It hurts.
- It can't be helped.
Don't you think we should get a doctor?
No, not yet.
It may involve us with the police.
Oh, I just remembered.
I might get involved.
How?
My sketchbook.
I left it there.
No, I brought it away with us.
Here.
Thank you.
Look, Michele, portrait of a dead traitor.
And if you had arrived later, you would never have seen him.
Come and lie down.
I'll get you a blanket.
Oh, Andre.
There is one thing I didn't tell you that's important.
When the men stopped to phone, just before I got away,
I heard one ask the other for a phone number.
It was Babylon-8583.
You are sure?
I'm positive.
Babylon-8583.
I can have it tracked down in no time.
You don't have to trace that number.
It's a small house hidden away on the Left Bank.
Jacques Granville.
Horrible. Horrible!
Mr. Ambassador, how are you?
Good to see you.
How do you do?
Good to see you again,
Mr. Ambassador.
- Hi.
- How are you, sir?
Anything on Topaz?
Who's running it?
Jacques Granville, a friend of mine.
- A friend?
- Yeah.
Up till
But I can't nail him down.
No proof.
I brought this old picture along.
It'll help you recognize him.
He's bound to be at your meeting with our people this afternoon.
That poses a problem for us, doesn't it?
How can we tell the French about Cuba when...
Mike!
Thank you.
Take care.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
Gentlemen, will you be kind enough to take your seats at the end?
All right. Yes.
Thank you.
What do you suggest we do?
What I suggest we do is to tell them right away.
Gentlemen, one moment, please.
Just a moment.
Look, Jacques,
I am very sorry, but the Americans would rather that you are not present.
There is no time to explain now.
I'll explain later.
This is John Cameron Swayze in Boston.
A turnout of Bostonians unsurpassed in numbers and enthusiasm...
...roars its welcome for Al Shepard followed by Gus Grissom...
...sharing the popular tribute with their fellow astronauts of Project Mercury.
There's Johnny Glenn.
Joy in this usually reserved city of Boston is unconfined.
Recognizing Glenn's morale-boosting feat...
...that proved three men will have their say in space when the chips are down.
There's a pandemonium of pride as the
Mercury astronaut arrives at City Hall...
...to be welcomed by the mayor and other privileged dignitaries...
...a moment long to be remembered by all who witness this stirring event.
Leaving the municipal center, the tempo is stepped up...
...and the triumphal motorcade is cheered by additional city multitudes.
At the Hilton, where the luncheon in honor of Glenn...
...and his astronaut associates will be held...
...a thousand notables are seated to supplement the public tribute...
...as Boston toasts another "well done" for Al Shepard and Johnny Glenn.
Come in. We're all finished.
- How long has she been dead?
- Four or five hours.
Rape?
There's no semen, but she's been mauled and bitten.
All these taxes, and they still can't deliver the mail on time.
They're too busy blowing everything up with money.
Well, I heard on TV that they're cleaning up some African jungle.
Imagine, with parts of Boston the way they look.
I guess Mara's stuck at the hospital with another case.
No, she's home.
I heard her take the milk in.
Did I ever tell you, when I was nursing, about Mr. Peavis?
- He was from Worcester, and I...
- You told me.
If... If she was home, she'd come out and get her mail.
Mr. Harris, did you see Mrs. Edwards go out this morning?
Nope.
The only thing he ever hears is the racetrack reports.
Maybe she's sick.
You know she gets those terrible migraines.
Mara? Are you there?
She wouldn't leave her door open.
Mr. Harris!
Mr. Harris!
Usually in a homicide where nothing's stolen...
...it's a personal enmity, a grudge killing.
Two cases of personal enmity against two harmless old ladies...
...in the same neighborhood in one week?
Come on, captain.
Looks like a nut's loose.
Nuts don't ransack apartments.
Nothing was stolen. Was there?
Oh, let him have his story.
Maybe the nut was looking for something imaginary.
- Uh-huh. Like what?
- How do I know?
A fire engine he thinks someone stole from him...
...when he was 3.
Don't you watch television?
You know what that's called?
Double-square knot. Surgeon's knot.
Not a very commonly used knot, is it?
So the women were strangled with a double-square knot.
What are you trying to tell us, that it was a doctor or an Eagle Scout?
Okay.
What about the sex?
What did he actually do to them?
- What's the difference?
- People like to read about it.
Let them read paperbacks. We withhold till we check out confessions.
- Do you have any?
- We have a group we rely on...
...to confess to any homicide committed in greater Boston.
I'll see you later.
Thanks, captain. Gentlemen.
Teletype from the Lynn Police.
They found a 68-year-old retired nurse by the name of Louise Penny...
...strangled.
Was she raped?
With a wine bottle.
We've got a full-blown maniac on our hands.
I've got him all set up for you.
Now, this regular, the one in the bar, his name's Arnie Carr, isn't straight.
I don't have any real straight ones, but he is special.
How special?
Well, what he does is...
...he talks the whole thing in dirty words, you know, until he's ready.
That's not so unusual.
You're telling me.
But when he's ready, nothing happens...
...until he gets his hands on my throat and squeezes.
- That's 20 bucks I gave you!
- Well, all right. Just wait a minute.
Saturday, when that nurse got it, he was supposed to come around.
He didn't show.
And before, the day Mrs. Hodak was killed, the same thing.
Now, that's never happened before.
He's never broken an appointment.
He's always exactly on the button.
He's the kind.
I'll try and talk to him.
Is he smart enough to know he doesn't have to?
Hm. He's married. He's scared to death.
Mr. Carr, I'm Det. DiNatale.
I have some questions for you.
Questions?
Know a girl named Cloe?
- I don't know any hookers.
- I didn't say she was a hooker.
You broke two dates with her last week.
Yeah. Well, I went out of town.
- Where?
- Hyannis, Providence.
- What do you do, Mr. Carr?
- I sell paint.
Can anyone place you in Providence and Hyannis...
...prove that you were up there?
Well, I don't know. I'd have to think.
Think.
I don't understand why it's so important if I broke a couple of dates with a girl.
- Is that a crime?
- Adultery is.
I bet your wife would think so.
You leave my wife out of this.
Listen, is the girl in any kind of trouble?
If you want anything from me, as long as it's off the record...
...I'll give it to you.
- The girl's not in any trouble.
I want to know why you get turned on by putting your hands around her throat.
- I don't hurt her.
- Then why do you do it?
I... I don't know.
Do you like to think about women being frightened?
They know I don't mean it.
You pay them to pretend to be frightened?
They get plenty out of me for it.
Now, you write down for me where you were...
...and who you talked to on these two dates.
I want the names, the places and the time...
...anything that you can remember.
- Who is it?
- The plumber.
The owner told me to come over to look at your sink and your toilet.
- He said you might get new ones.
- They never said anything to me about it.
I don't know about that, lady, but you're on my list.
I'll phone them.
Maybe you could come back.
I don't know when I'll get back.
But it's okay with me if you don't want to be bothered.
No. No, it's all right.
So long as you're here, you should look.
Well, you know, you can't be too careful these days.
Emma Hodak, Mara Edwards,
Louise Penny, Bertha Blum...
...all highly respectable women...
...innocently admitted this deranged man to their homes.
Allow no strangers to enter your home under any pretext.
An emergency telephone number, RI2-1818...
...has been established.
This line is open 24 hours a day.
Do not be embarrassed nor afraid to report any person...
...no matter how insignificant you may feel your suspicions are.
Thank you.
All right.
I hope you've all got the picture.
Each of you is getting a list of known sex offenders.
Bring in the people you usually ignore: peepers, the men's-room queens...
...the exhibitionists, subway jostlers, the dirty-word specialists.
I know it isn't easy to question habitual sex offenders and certified nuts...
...but nail them and talk to them.
You don't have to have an ironclad case.
We're not interested in misdemeanor convictions...
...only homicide suspects.
Now, let's get with this.
If we don't find this man, I'm afraid this is going to keep happening.
That's it.
- All right. Everybody out!
- Get out of here!
Make a straight line. Get over there.
- Come on. Get out of there.
- Come on. Let's go.
Go on. Get out of here.
Get out of here!
Line up over here! Come on!
- All right, everybody out.
- Let's go.
Make a straight line. Come on, get out.
All right, baby. Come on.
I called you 15 minutes ago and they still aren't here.
I told you before, I'm a nurse.
Three of those women were nurses.
This man has been here three nights in a row, peeking.
Please. Thank you.
At it again.
All right, pal, let's go.
I love you.
Hello?
Is this Mae?
- This is she.
- How are you tonight, Mae?
Oh, it's you. Uh, I'm fine.
- I didn't recognize your voice.
- Why not?
Sergeant, this is Grace Lockwood at 73 Grove.
We have him on the phone again.
She'll try and hold him as long as she can.
You'll sit on a chair, and I'll sit across the room.
You wear panties, Mae?
Sometimes.
What color?
Black.
Knit or solid?
Knit.
Then we'll have a drink, Mae.
What do you drink?
Martinis.
It's on group two, terminal 94.
I like a sweet drink. Maybe Kahlúa.
Do you know why, Mae?
No, why?
Because I got a special way of...
I'd rather not say at this time.
There certainly seems to be a little similarity.
Do the similarities appear to be striking?
Are there more than just one?
Yes. There are several factors involved...
...which appear to be similar in all of the cases.
This is the Cambridge police chief now.
Chief... Chief, could we talk with you for a moment? Chief?
- Can you give us anything more on this?
- What else is there?
A 67-year-old nurse has been sexually assaulted and strangled...
...by a Boston maniac.
Let's pass it around, Dave.
It's the fifth victim.
Two belong to Lawrence and Lynn.
I stand corrected.
This two-fifths Boston maniac.
Anne Nealy is another nurse.
Think it's someone working in a hospital?
Or someone who worked in an old people's home. They're all old.
Or working in an orchestra.
They all liked music.
Someone in a laundry. They were all clean.
How did he tie the knot? Like the others?
Corroborative evidence.
We're holding it back.
- How did he tie it?
- Double half hitch.
Same as the others?
If there is more than one man operating, they sure went to the same school.
This is the fifth strangling...
...and the fourth police department to become involved.
And many of us wonder...
...if perhaps a split in jurisdiction is less than helpful.
Is there a central file where all investigating offices can consult?
And can detectives from one city cross into the lines of another at will...
...to pursue investigations?
The answers to these and other relevant questions...
...is an unhappy no.
How do you feel about the Boston Strangler?
I feel a little bit nervous.
I've been reading the papers and...
- A lot of apprehension?
- A little. Yes.
- How about the evening?
- I take every precaution.
No, after 9:00, I'm pretty close to home.
Well, I really think that we should be well protected...
...and have our doors locked, everyone.
I make sure that I'm home early, you know. So I close the doors.
- If the doorbell rings?
- I won't answer it.
You won't answer it?
I answer it, but don't open the door.
Just what they told us to do about the locks...
...not going out alone at night.
What is your personal feeling about it?
Well, of course I think he's a sick man in the first place.
I mean, anybody in their right mind wouldn't do anything like that.
What precautions are you taking?
I don't go out at night.
I think it's a very, very sad situation.
- How about the evening?
- I don't go out by myself.
Are you taking any precautions?
Yes, I am.
It's a situation that makes one very uneasy, is it not?
It certainly is.
- We hope they find him.
- I hope so.
The police, are they doing their utmost?
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you very much.
It looks like she's been dead for at least 24 hours.
Any rape?
No, but she's been mauled just like the others.
And mutilated with this, stabbed through the heart.
- I don't think she let him in this time.
- How do you know?
Burglar's tool.
He must have used it to slip the lock.
We found it under the body.
You know, that was beginning to get to me...
...the way they let him in.
They're all scared, but they still open their doors.
- Nobody thinks it'll happen to them.
- They don't want to get strangled.
That's not exactly what they have in mind.
Old ladies in Boston?
In Boston.
Think what it must be like in New York.
"Taxation through payroll deduction...
...compulsory arbitration of labor disputes...
...confiscatory taxation itself.
Yet, in the area of condemnation of private property for public use...
...in the egalitarian tradition...
...of the greatest good for the greatest number...
...the present administration found widespread public resistance...
...vindictive and sometimes violent.
Today, under the leadership of Attorney General Brooke...
...the very mention of eminent domain no longer produces sentiments...
...in the most conservative citizens verging on anarchy.
As his captain,
I've had the honor of working with him...
...to break the backlog in the courts of land-damage cases...
...and to help persuade..."
- You're doing this on radio?
- Yes. What's wrong with it?
- Well, it's scholarly.
- I was trying to popularize it.
- What time do you go on, Jack?
- 8 a.m.
8 a.m.?
Well, it might make a nice valedictory address for you.
- Am I going somewhere?
- No, I want you right here.
Just an added bit to your duties, that's all.
What added bit? I like eminent domain.
I know you do.
It's legal and technical and orderly and remote.
- What have you got in mind for me?
- The stranglings.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, come on, Jack.
You must have some contact with the everyday world.
- You do read the newspapers.
- Only the editorial pages.
- Don't you look at television?
- Can't. It hurts my eyes.
Do you know I actually see that electronic beam scanning the tube?
- What about the stranglings?
- They keep happening.
Of course, compulsive homicide, inner-motivated.
- You only catch them by fluke.
- Not good enough.
Fortunately, you have four police departments to absorb public criticism.
- Commonwealth can stay out of it.
- I don't intend for that.
There's an absolutely urgent need to coordinate the investigations.
We've got to do it.
But what part do you want me to play in this, Ed?
I want you to coordinate the investigations for the commonwealth.
Set up a Strangler Bureau.
No.
This is not a favor I'm asking...
...and the budget hasn't any money to pay you for it, but...
...I'm putting it to you as I see it: public service.
I teach law. I write about law.
My practice has almost disappeared while I've been working with you.
That's my public service.
I'm not even remotely qualified for this.
You have one of the best minds I know.
You're highly respected.
You're a uniquely competent administrator.
In spite of that scholarly pose, you're tough enough.
Forgetting all that,
I'm against it on principle.
- You want the stranglings to go on?
- That's not fair.
I don't want to throw out the baby with the bath.
The more centralized police authority becomes, the less I like it.
- Spoken like a scholar.
- Which is what I hope I am.
God sits on your shoulder, doesn't he?
That's a regional and ethnic disability
I inherit from my ancestors.
Well, shall we have some more tea?
- It's so cold outside.
- It sure is.
My hands are frozen.
I can hardly move my fingers.
I just hope it doesn't snow again.
I hope not either. Ruin the weekend.
That'll probably be ruined anyway.
I can't reach my keys. Are yours handy?
Yes, I have them in my pocket someplace.
Boy, these packages are heavy.
She's got it double-locked again.
She must have stepped out to get the steak.
That butcher likes her.
I can understand while she's in the house...
...but when she goes for the mail or the garbage?
He's only interested in old ladies anyway.
The Strangler's seventh victim...
...Liza Gordon, was young, unlike the others, who were old...
...Negro, unlike the others, who were white...
...and living with two other girls...
...unlike the others, who lived alone.
From now on, no woman in greater Boston...
...regardless of who she is or how she lives, can feel secure.
Let's go to the statehouse, where Mr. John Bottomly...
...head of the newly-created
Strangler Bureau...
...is setting up headquarters.
Mr. Bottomly? How are you, sir?
Hello there, Mr. Dreier.
Mr. Bottomly, at this early stage of the investigation...
...what will your first steps be?
Yes. Our first job is to copy the files of each of the homicides...
...in each of the police departments involved...
...Boston, Cambridge, Lynn,
Lawrence and Salem...
...and reconstruct them in master files in these books here.
I see.
Mr. Bottomly...
Mr. Bottomly, is there any significance to the fact...
...that half of that bulletin board is empty?
A medical psychiatric board is one of three divisions of this operation.
I've talked informally with its members.
And they feel chances are these killings will continue until we find our man.
There's talk of finding these demented people...
...and treating them before they get to the point of killing.
- Now, do you have an opinion on that?
- A lot of talk is exactly what it is.
What more can you expect from a society that itself spends 44%...
...of its tax dollar on killing?
- Anything else?
- Yes. Why did you take this on?
I was ordered to by my employer, the attorney general.
- Ordered to, Mr. Bottomly?
- Don't you find that credible?
If you say so.
I'll amend it.
He challenged me and I was sucked in.
- Thank you very much.
- Right.
Elsewhere in the nation on this day...
Miss Ridgeway owns the house and rents rooms. Yankee family.
She lives with a lady, Alice Oakville.
They're married to each other.
The pigeon is a tenant named
Terence Huntley. He's a faggot.
I can't wait.
Good morning. I'm Det. DiNatale.
Detective, I'm simply delighted to meet you.
And this is Sgt. McAfee.
And this is my good friend, Miss Oakville.
I'm not going to tell you anything first.
I want this to have the same effect it had on me.
Alice, what did I say to you the day Mr. Huntley hung that painting?
You said, "Alice, look at that.
You mark my words.
The next woman he strangles is going to be a Negress."
That was the day before Liza Gordon was strangled.
Did you have any reason to be suspicious of Mr. Huntley previously?
Alice, tell the detective about seeing
Mr. Huntley on Gainsborough Street...
...where Mrs. Hodak lived.
I met him on Gainsborough Street...
...just three days before Mrs. Hodak was strangled.
He was just staring into store windows at those junk shops.
Isn't he an antique dealer?
What's that got to do with it?
Do all antique dealers collect books like this?
The Collected Works of the Marquis de Sade.
This and four others about Thuggees.
I'm sure you understand the significance of that.
Absolutely.
What's a Thuggee and who is de Sade?
Thuggees are a sect of Indian ritual murderers who strangle their victims.
The word "sadism" comes from the Marquis de Sade.
All Terence Huntley is interested in is strangling and torture.
I've seen some put-ons, but that one's carrying it too far.
She's coming this way.
- Are you Terence Huntley?
- I am.
John Bottomly. We've been having trouble contacting you.
- I heard you were trying to reach me.
- The Bottomly in the Strangler Bureau?
That's right.
Terry, you hound. You've been hiding your lamp under a blanket.
Bushel.
This is Cedric Ewing, Harold Robin.
- Very happy to meet you, Mr. Bottomly.
- How are you?
And very impressed.
Excuse us, we have a date with a gunnery sergeant.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
I didn't know who you were until just now.
I never answer calls unless I know the people.
Why not?
Because I'm too vulnerable.
If you're rich and gay...
...people continually harass and blackmail you.
Have you any idea why I want to talk to you?
Whenever there are unsolved sex crimes, the police crack down on us.
I think it's ridiculous.
Be that as it may, we have an informant who insists you're the Strangler.
Oh, my God. Miss Ridgeway.
Do you protect stoolies even in this exotic atmosphere?
Every suspect has to be checked out.
I thought you'd prefer me to a detective.
The old school tie.
Or is it that you're really a little curious about us?
Let's say I'm slumming.
I didn't think that you'd make a remark like that.
I was rude. I'm sorry.
I believe you are.
What did you want to ask me?
Have you any business on Gainsborough Street?
Oh, the flower.
I beg your pardon?
The one that plays the girl's role is the flower. Alice Oakville.
Yes, she saw me on Gainsborough Street.
I buy things from secondhand shops there.
Here are the dates and times of the seven stranglings.
List, as well as you remember, where you were in each instance.
Send it to me at the statehouse.
You know that Miss Ridgeway is a rejected lover?
I don't, frankly.
We were lovers. I broke it off.
She is a woman scorned.
Apparently, things aren't as upside down as they seem.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
She played the man's part, I the woman.
There was nothing I could say, so I didn't say anything.
- See you after the credit-union meeting.
- No, you get some sleep.
As a matter of fact, we both should.
- I'll see you tomorrow night at the plant.
- Okay.
- Good night.
- Good night, sweet.
Now, Lloyd, I told...
Hello, Luis.
Has your attorney explained to you that you don't have to answer our questions?
I don't mind answering intelligent questions.
- What were you doing with this?
- Saving it.
Anyone who strangles a woman can't be all bad.
Stop it, David.
- And this?
- I'm sick, you know.
More likely drunk. How much have you had?
That's what they teach in the academy:
Catch them off guard with irrelevant questions.
Where did you buy this?
Also irrelevant.
Immaterial and incompetent.
What are you made up for, David? You wouldn't be playing Othello, would you?
Bravo. Intellectual civil servant.
I am Othello.
Othello strangled his wife because she was unfaithful to him.
Mine wouldn't have had time. We were only married yesterday morning.
Then you would've had time for number eight. She was killed in the afternoon.
Ah. Marry in the morning, murder in the afternoon.
Of course. Sheer omnipotence.
You've been looking at my case history.
They say I have...
...mess... Mess... Messianic delusion.
- Do you think you have?
- Leave the matter of your sanity...
...to the doctors, David.
Are you prepared to charge him?
They're prepared to go on in hope that I'm gonna spill something.
Don't you know desperate men when you see them?
Jack?
- We'll hold him.
- For having a newspaper clipping on me?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
For carrying a concealed weapon.
Also, assault and battery on your wife.
My wife won't charge me.
You want to bet?
Ready for you, Mrs. Parker.
Police brutality.
We don't do that anymore.
I'm sorry.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Col. Brumley.
Oh, hi.
Well, um...
You're even prettier than I remember from that party, Dana.
It's funny,
I can't seem to remember that party...
...but I do remember you.
Give me your coat.
There are so many parties on Beacon Hill, aren't there?
It's just like one big sorority house, isn't it?
Just like a big sorority house.
Will you have a drink, colonel?
Call me Lyonel. And Coca-Cola, please.
It's malaria, you know, from the Pacific.
It's doctor's orders.
Most of the doctors I know are half-gassed by 5:00.
You have a lot of physician friends?
You're kidding.
Didn't I tell you I was a nurse?
I don't think so.
I'm attracted to nurses. They...
...have a nice sense of, um...
...reality.
My, you are a trim one.
What's that?
That's a gun, colonel.
You see, I'm a policewoman too.
Julian!
This is Lt. Soshnick and Sgt. McAfee.
In that case, I would like the drink.
So this is the famous Col. Brumley, huh?
My, my, my, what a time we've had finding you.
Do you think he looks like a colonel?
I am not really a colonel, you know.
Wholesale groceries, isn't it?
Well, he doesn't look like a colonel...
...but he sure doesn't look like a pickle salesman either.
Produce.
Lyonel, do you know that impersonating an officer is a crime?
- Not if you don't wear the uniform.
- He may be right.
How do you find them?
Um, in the phone directory.
Or, uh, if they're pretty, like Dana,
I follow them home.
How long has this been going on?
About, um, six months.
One of the ladies says you have a little black book.
Oh.
You have been a busy little beaver, haven't you?
Gainsborough Street, Park Drive, Salem.
Mention any one of the neighborhoods, he's been there.
How many names have you got in here?
About 500.
How many have you scored with?
At least two-thirds.
- In six months?!
- Uh-huh.
You have any idea why you do this?
Just sort of a hobby.
You know what gets me...
...is here is a city with the women in it supposedly terrified of the Strangler...
...and this pickle salesman, a total stranger...
...talks his way into their beds without any trouble at all.
I wouldn't say that.
- He could've killed any of them.
- Maybe he did.
- I couldn't kill anything.
- We'll check you out.
Check him out, hell.
Find out what kind of diet he's on...
...and have it mimeographed for the rest of us.
It's done. Better wake June up.
June?
June?
Mr. Bottomly, would you like to make a statement now?
No, I'm sorry. No comment.
Mr. Bottomly, this is the ninth victim.
Your office must have something to say.
- The same m.o.?
- The same.
My God, you'd think after eight of them they'd stop opening the door.
June Williams, 19.
What do we tell the press?
We ought to tell them the way it is.
Horrify them into keeping their doors closed.
I don't want the press to find out about the broom business.
The only one who will know, outside of us, has to be the Strangler.
He won't be in for a few minutes.
We've got time for a sandwich.
Yeah.
I've got to tell you,
I thought you were kidding about this.
I haven't found anything to kid about since I left eminent domain.
But what the hell is ESP?
Extrasensory perception.
Seeing and hearing things that have happened without being there.
Sort of like a delayed mental telepathy.
I don't believe in ordinary mental telepathy.
Science takes it seriously.
I've checked Hurkos.
He's helped police around the world, from Miami to Scotland Yard.
There are facts.
Coincidences. They could have got the same thing by opening a fortune cookie.
We've got nine dead women...
...and every suspect and every clue that 2600 police have come up with...
...has exploded in our faces.
Where's the money coming from?
The commonwealth can't be springing for this.
No, a rich friend of the attorney general's paying Hurkos.
Rich and eccentric.
Look, I'd read the entrails of a crow on the statehouse steps...
...if I thought we'd come up with one lousy little clue.
This Mr. Chiari has a cottage in Rockport...
...and Bobbie Eden was in Rockport the night before she was killed.
- Does any of that check out?
- Absolutely.
Listen to the rest of it:
"I prayed for a sign that I was right in accusing Mr. Chiari...
...and last night it came.
I woke up, and a blue ball of fire was flying through my room...
...writing the name Chiari on the ceiling."
Anything else?
This came in yesterday from a Catholic nursing school.
They got it from a Eugene T. O'Rourke.
"My reason for writing is to say that I'm a bachelor...
...and I would appreciate it if you could suggest a nurse...
...who might like me as much as I'd like her...
...and if so, we could begin a friendship that might lead to the altar."
- Pathetic.
- Very sad.
Except...
...he's been fired from a ladies' shoe store for groping a customer.
His landlady says he sleeps on bed springs without a mattress.
Just the springs?
Some order of French Trappist monks where he was living...
...threw him out for acting like a nut...
...trying to torture himself, washing in the toilet, that kind of thing.
He's had shock therapy.
Spend some more time on him.
Which one is the swami?
Texas character is a bodyguard.
I'm John Bottomly.
- Hurkos.
- Dick Matheson.
- Det. DiNatale.
- Everyone say Peter to me.
If you all don't mind,
I'd like to see your IDs.
No reporters, huh? How you manage that?
All we had to do was get every newspaper, radio network...
...TV station and international wire service to look the other way.
That's why we brought you into Providence.
If Peter strike out, public don't know.
- Nobody yell "big fake," right?
- Right.
Right this way.
Is this the way you want them?
Each pile covers one of the killings.
You got the ladies' stockings, panties, bras, that stuff?
On the way.
Okay, we start on pictures?
All yours.
Tricks you play, huh?
This one phony-baloney. This not belong.
You show Peter up?
Now we try real one, eh?
This top one is house, house where murder take place.
Underneath is dead woman.
Like this.
Pretty good, eh?
- It's all right.
- Sorry I'm late. Car wouldn't start.
This is Sgt. Phil Lisi.
- Phil.
- Hello.
You're not late because of car.
I tell you what happen.
You phone girlfriend.
"I can't come over this morning.
I've got to see this nut, Hurkos."
She say, "Come over for one cup coffee."
Right, Phil?
So you go there.
She bend over to get coffee...
...you grab her, push her on kitchen table and zoink!
Then you come here.
That's why you're late, right?
- You're a dangerous man, Peter.
- I tell truth, what I see.
Hey, Phil, open that.
Let Peter see ladies' things.
Don't take so big, Phil.
Maybe half men in room have girl on way to work.
Maybe Hurkos big fake, huh?
I see him.
Not too big.
Five feet six, seven...
...130, maybe 40, pounds.
He... He not sleep in bed.
He is on floor. No, no, no.
On mattress. No, no.
Just on springs, sleep on springs.
He loves handbags.
I see handbags, women's handbags.
Lots of handbags.
He use them for sex.
But it make... Make him feel bad, not good.
He...
I need map. Boston, quick.
He live here.
Cambridge.
This man priest.
No, no, no, not priest, but live with priest.
Dress like priest.
Priest, they... They care, but he... he hurt himself.
He make dirty, he wash hands in toilet.
They throw him out. They...
I stop now.
Soshnick.
We need a search warrant for a Eugene T. O'Rourke.
Here's a letter O'Rourke wrote...
...and these are my notes after I checked him out.
Twenty-three-year-old girl in Cambridge.
- That's number 10.
- O'Rourke lives in Cambridge.
I got something, eh?
You got something.
Hey, look at this.
Strangler's knot.
Yeah. That would be one way to tie them, wouldn't it?
Don't fight it too hard, Julian.
I don't recognize these floor plans, but...
...crosses have been placed just about where the bodies were found.
It would be absolute insanity if the way we got to break this was Peter Hurkos.
God, look at this book of yoga exercises.
Four, five, six, seven...
...eight, nine, 10 bodies!
What else do you want, an invitation to the 11 Th?
Eugene T. O'Rourke.
Do you know an attorney?
Uh, my brother is a lawyer, but he won't talk to me.
We'll get you one, if you want one.
It's your right.
It isn't a lawyer I need, I'm afraid.
I can't remember when I wasn't like this.
I...
I, uh...
Go on.
I can't. I can't.
I thought I could, but I can't.
I should be put away.
You know they gave me shock therapy?
You know they made me leave the monastery?
Why did they make you leave?
You don't know what it's like.
I know you've looked at everything here.
You looked in the closet.
You saw the handbags.
That's what I think of.
That's all I think of.
I know I'm unclean.
I wash in dirt...
...to punish myself.
I do other things too, terrible, disgusting things.
What do these X's mean?
I took a correspondence course in art...
...and I had to put the X's down to see where I'd have to do it over again.
Why did you blot out 10 of these women?
I didn't like those pictures.
Why do you have all those things knotted together?
I'm collecting them for Our Lady of Victories.
Where did you buy this?
- Oh, that's not mine.
- No, you lost it.
Where did you buy it?
What are you saying?
I never saw that before.
Listen, Eugene, we know all about you.
Everything.
Now, God wants you to tell us the truth.
God knows how you've been hurt, and he wants you to tell us the truth.
God wants your salvation as much as you do.
Now, tell us the truth.
But I'm trying.
This is very hard for me.
- It's a terrible, dirty thing...
- No, not about the handbags, Eugene.
But about what?
Start at the beginning.
How did you kill that first old lady,
Mrs. Hodak?
How did you get into her apartment?
You can't feel any worse than you feel now.
You'll feel better.
Oh, you think that I...?
That I...?
Oh, I thought you wanted to help me!
We do want to help you.
Go away.
I never hurt anything in my life...
...except myself.
If I arrange it, will you commit yourself to a hospital...
...so you can be helped?
No.
You don't really want to.
You're just tricking me.
Under Massachusetts law, Mr. O'Rourke...
...any doctor can commit you...
...for 10 days' observation without your permission.
I can't stop you if that's what you want to do.
We'll give Mr. O'Rourke a chance to think things over.
- On your feet, Eugene.
- What are you doing?
- You said we should have him commit...
- I said a doctor can commit him.
We'll find one at Boston City.
He doesn't want to go.
The papers will be signed right here.
- But if we start now, we can get him in...
- You'll get what?
I'm developing my own ESP.
We've made a beautiful landing at a wrong airport.
Phone in, get the doctor here.
You can come in now. We're all finished.
She was a student. Psychology.
Worked part-time in a hospital.
- Was she raped?
- The doc said no.
That's our man again for sure.
Everything locked from the inside,
Strangler's knot, no actual rape.
Stab wounds in a perfect circle around the breast...
...and then a bull's-eye.
This kind of mutilation goes with the queer.
Look at this.
She was doing her master's thesis.
Factors Pertaining to the Etiology of Male Homosexuality.
She knew him. She let him in.
He sat in this chair talking to her.
These look like soot marks.
He must have brought it in on his shoes.
Did she have a boyfriend?
Three, but two of them are faggots.
We think the other one was banging her.
So what? Everyone's banging everybody.
It's a horny world.
Shake them down, you'll probably find all three have good, solid alibis.
No, no. This is our man.
She let him in, all right, but she didn't know him.
He's probably not a homosexual.
If we don't find him fast, we'll all be riding three-wheel bikes...
...and emptying parking meters.
Thus was the life and the death...
...of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Leaders of a hundred nations come in tribute:
De Gaulle of France...
...Prince Philip of Great Britain...
...Erhard of Germany...
...the great among men.
A gathering such as this has never been seen...
- Can't have it.
- ...in America.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
Oh, shh, shh, shh. Be quiet, Michael.
Don't be sad, Daddy.
Come here.
A riderless horse, stirrups backward for the fallen chieftain.
- Irmgard...
- I just can't believe he's dead.
I can't either.
I'm going to check out the furnace.
I left when it happened.
Now, Al?
I might as well.
I want to get some air anyway.
Try to be back by 6:00.
Dinner will be ready.
Okay. See you later.
Kennedy's coffin, borne on the same caisson...
...which carried the body of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
It is a day of national mourning in his own land.
It is a day when men around the world...
...wonder how this thing so needless could have happened.
Men wonder...
...and find no answer.
They can only pause in silence to mourn his passing.
- Hi.
- Yes?
Um, super sent me to check your bathroom.
I didn't think anyone was working today.
Yeah, isn't it awful?
But I had this house marked down for today.
Can't you come back in a day or so?
Well, yeah, I guess so.
Sorry to bother you.
No, wait.
I don't want to miss getting the bathroom fixed.
It's in there.
Uh-huh.
- Yeah. That looks kind of bad.
- I know. That's what I keep telling them.
Yeah.
Even the tile is falling apart.
- Who is it?
- Painter.
Owner sent me over to look at your walls.
He didn't say anything to me.
- Well, you're on my list.
- Have the owner phone me you're okay.
If you don't want the work done, it's all right by me.
All right, come up.
Hey, hey. What are you doing?
- Hey, is that your car?
- Yeah.
Will you do me a big favor and move it?
I got furniture to drop here.
Okay.
Hi. I'm looking for an apartment.
The manager's apartment's over there, number three.
But there are no vacancies.
Now, don't scream, and you won't get hurt.
Miss Cluny?
Yes?
This is John Bottomly, who wants to talk to you.
I'm here because the man who attacked you may be very important to us.
We think the man might have been the Strangler.
Oh, my God.
You're very lucky to be alive.
What was the last thing you remember before you woke up in this bed?
I was ironing.
I remember I was ironing some small things.
I don't like ironing.
You don't remember anything until here?
Um, I remember that I couldn't move.
I kept trying to move and I couldn't.
- What stopped you?
- I don't know.
- It was like I was paralyzed.
- Paralyzed completely? Your whole body?
I don't think so.
I could move from side to side.
I kept trying.
Try to remember why you couldn't move your hands and feet.
All right.
Miss Cluny...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
He just broke into my house!
Mr. DeSalvo, your attorney,
Mr. Asgeirsson here...
...tells me you're resisting his representing you.
I strongly urge you to follow his counsel.
But I don't need an attorney.
I haven't done anything.
How did you get here? You suppose the officers have nothing to do...
...but go around framing innocent people? Why should they?
Yeah. That's what I'd like to know.
Why should they?
This standard burglar tool was found on you when you were arrested.
- Do you deny it's yours?
- He admits it's his ruler.
Why shouldn't I admit it?
I bought it in Jordan Marsh.
Next thing I know...
...these cops knocked me down for no reason at all.
Mr. DeSalvo, these officers, Mr. Taylor and four other witnesses...
...state that you were pursued for two blocks before being captured.
I don't care. They're lying.
Nobody chased me anywhere.
I, um... I think there's a very strong possibility...
...that Mr. DeSalvo is mentally disturbed.
Do you agree?
It's possible.
Mr. DeSalvo, by law...
...you'd have a preliminary hearing within the next 48 hours.
I don't think you're up to it.
The law provides that you may be committed to a state institution...
...to determine if and when you are competent to stand trial.
Boston City Hospital.
I dreamed about rags being torn, just torn over and over again.
Were the rags tearing themselves up?
Were they in someone's hands?
No, they were just rags.
- You haven't minded being hypnotized?
- No. It makes me feel rested afterwards.
I'd like to put you under right now while you're thinking of those rags.
Now, follow my hand with your eyes.
Keep it in focus.
Your eyes are getting tired.
You want to sleep.
You want to go back to your dream to help us, to see those rags...
...and remember who was tearing them.
I bit his hand.
I can see it. I can taste it.
I bit his hand hard.
- Are you under now?
- No!
Can you see beyond the hand, his face, his body?
No.
Try.
I can't.
You know what I mean?
- But I don't belong here.
- Mm-hm.
- I guess everybody says that, don't they?
- Mm-hm.
You know how I got here?
Uh, some cop knocked me down outside Jordan Marsh's...
...and they found this ruler on me.
They said it was a burglar's tool.
How do you like that? It was just a ruler.
I use it in my work.
You know, I'd like to be able to tell this to somebody.
God, I'm afraid to breathe.
It's fascinating.
DeSalvo's preliminary diagnosis...
...indicates the possibility of a classic multiple-personality situation.
In such cases, does the patient know he has two personalities?
No.
You mean he actually doesn't know what the other part of him is doing?
Well, "the other part of him" is the wrong phrase.
It's hard to accept, but there are actually two totally separate personalities.
I mean, literally, actually, two separate people enclosed in one body.
And they take turns using the body.
Excuse me.
Dr. Nagy.
Oh, it's the dispensary.
Thank you.
The wound was a human bite.
He claims he caught it in some machinery.
- He's lying.
- He may not be lying.
If this diagnosis is valid, he wasn't bitten. The other man was.
One valid definition of sanity is someone who isn't in an insane asylum.
Where does he work?
Pyne Furnace on Bradford Street.
There was soot on the floor of Terry Evans' apartment.
It could have come from a furnace.
Check his work record against the stranglings.
See when he was off work or on outside jobs.
All right.
Number seven, October 5th...
...Liza Gordon, 215 Huntington Ave.,
Boston.
October 5th.
DeSalvo checked out from a job at Rollins Place at 2 p.m.
That's 15 blocks from Huntington.
She died at approximately 2:30.
He could have made that easily.
Number eight, October 19th.
Bobbie Eden, 205 Park Dr., Boston.
Time of death, approximately 7:30 p.m.
He had an emergency repair job a couple of blocks away.
405 Park Dr.
He checked out at 7 p.m.
That's eight out of eight he was available for.
Number nine, November 1 st.
June Williams, 448 Charles St.
Approximate time of death was noon.
Worked all day in the shop.
Wait. Lunch, 11:30 to 12:45.
Killed her during lunch.
We're not a mile from Charles Street.
Number 10, November 10th.
Terry Evans, 24 Essex St. in Cambridge.
Time of death, approximately 1 p.m.
Worked in repair shop, 10 to 12 noon.
Serviced furnace at 38 Hudson St.,
Cambridge, 3 to 6 p.m.
He had time to squeeze in number 10.
Number 11, November 25th.
Pat Bruner, 4 University Rd., Boston.
November 25? That was the day of the president's funeral.
Everything was closed.
He was available.
Call the hospital and put more security on him.
What did you tell the children where I am?
They haven't asked.
What? What do you mean they haven't asked?
- They're only...
- Yeah?
They're only little children.
They accept things.
But...
...don't they miss me?
I talked to Mr. Asgeirsson.
- Why are you talking to him?
- Don't get excited.
Don't get excited?
They tell me he's gonna defend me.
For what?
Albert, I'm just telling you what he said to me.
You want to know, don't you?
Don't. Don't get angry.
I'm not saying this.
I don't believe anything.
What did he say?
He asked me to try to talk to you.
He...
He thinks you should plead guilty to housebreaking.
Cut it out!
You, uh...?
You believe them?
Albert, I don't believe anything.
I don't know what's happening.
He said...
...if you admit it, it won't matter if they find out.
Find out what?
That you are sick.
You believe them, then?
I love you, Albert.
I love you, Irmgard.
Albert's survival depends on his absolute certainty of his innocence.
If he accepts your interrogating him...
...it'll stir up all the terrible rumblings going on inside of him.
Isn't that the idea?
To get him to hear those rumblings get louder and louder until he can't stand it?
Phil's right. He's got to be questioned.
I think you want to question him because you want to question him.
You got the smell of prey and want to close in for the kill, just like any cop.
My motivations are my affair.
I wouldn't let you question him...
...if he was charged with the stranglings and was in jail.
I won't allow it when he's in a hospital and mentally incompetent.
- You don't care if he's the Strangler?
- Of course.
But I'm here to protect him, not help send him to the electric chair.
Suppose I find out without legal risk to Albert?
You can't.
I'm willing to sign a paper guaranteeing that anything I get out of him...
...will never be used against him in court.
- What's the point?
- I have to know if he's the Strangler.
We all have to know so we can breathe again.
You would honor it, but what about your successor or some gung-ho DA?
You sign for Albert, I sign for the state.
If another prosecutor tries to use any evidence I get, or even a confession...
...it would be thrown out because it was deceitfully exacted from Albert.
This is a medical problem, not a legal one.
You don't appreciate the danger to Albert as a patient in this hospital.
If you force Albert the family man...
...to acknowledge the existence of Albert the Strangler...
...he'll go over the edge.
We haven't got one piece of evidence that can be used in court.
No fingerprints, no witnesses, nothing.
It's the only direction I can take.
He could become catatonic, hide from himself...
...withdraw totally.
We've got a ward full of them.
Nobody knows where they withdraw to, but they're not here with the rest of us.
That's quite a responsibility.
It's bad enough if he's guilty, but...
...what if he's innocent and you push him over the edge?
Would it keep him in here for the rest of his life?
Almost certainly.
Then it's the next best thing to a conviction.
Mr. Asgeirsson was to see me.
He told me I don't have to talk to you.
He's right. You don't.
You don't have to talk to me.
And if you do talk, nothing you say can be used outside this room.
- Bottomly is what you said?
- That's right.
I'm sorry.
He doesn't make me remember anything.
He just looks like anyone else to me.
Look at his hand.
It makes me feel frightened somehow.
But he's still no one I've ever seen.
Is it the best you can do?
I'm sorry.
All right. Thank you for trying.
Do you remember what you did the day before you were arrested?
Um, I worked.
Is that the day you hurt your hand?
What's my hand got to do with anything?
I'll be absolutely honest with you.
I want to hear what you say happened, then we'll check what did happen.
If what you remember is different from the facts...
...I'll assume the doctors are right, that there's something wrong with you.
Go ahead and check.
I fixed this furnace in South Boston.
A lot of the hot-air pipes were leaking...
...a lot of hot air mixed with raw gas.
And the valve was jammed.
And I couldn't turn it off.
So I tore up some rags to try to...
I, uh...
...tore up some rags...
...to see if I could stop the leaks.
I could smell...
What happened then?
I tried to force the valve shut with my wrench.
I put it on the valve nut...
...and the wrench slipped off.
My hand...
Go on.
What about your hand?
I guess it got caught in the fan.
You guess? Don't you know?
Uh, yeah, I know. I...
I, um, got it caught in the fan.
Look, I'm tired.
Yeah, all right. That's enough for now.
But...
...understand your predicament. If the hospital releases you, you'll stand trial.
I'm sure you'll be found guilty of breaking and entering...
...the Taylor apartment even though it's a miscarriage of justice.
If you don't stand trial, the hospital will keep you because they think you're sick.
So one way or the other, you're not going to be free.
Look, I'm not stupid.
Don't you suppose I know that?
What am I supposed to do?
I can't yell anymore.
My wife won't even listen to me.
Listen to me.
That's why I'm here.
Maybe the two of us can find out what happened.
If I weren't so worried about how to take care of Irmgard and the children...
...I don't think I would give a damn.
Remember the day the astronaut,
Alan Shepard, came to town?
They had a big parade for him.
Yes. Yes, I remember.
Uh, I think I saw the parade.
Where were you?
Let's see. I think I was in front of the Statler Hilton Hotel. Right.
Tell me what you saw.
What has that got to do with anything?
We've been through this before, Albert.
I want to check what you remember about things with the facts.
We have your work record.
We can find out if what you remember is true.
- Yes, but why would I lie?
- I'm not saying you would lie.
I'm saying if you do lie, you don't mean to.
I think that may be how you got yourself in trouble.
Oh.
Well, uh, let's see.
I was standing in front...
...of the Statler Hilton Hotel...
...a little back in the crowd.
I remember...
...I wanted to get home early that day because...
...I promised Judy I'd fix her dollhouse.
So I left the parade before it was over.
I get in my car.
I wanted to get out of the parking lot before the crowd broke.
Tell me about Judy's dollhouse.
It was just a kid's dollhouse.
You see, I, uh... I built this...
...kind of playroom in the basement...
...a couple of years before in my house.
And Judy...
...wanted the same thing...
...in her dollhouse.
Kids are...
...funny that way.
You know what I mean?
Was it much of a job?
Um...
Well...
You needed special tools.
Small, small ones.
- Do you feel ill?
- It's just that I can't remember things.
It's very tough.
Of course it is.
We won't do any more today.
Sit down, Albert.
All right.
How are you feeling?
I don't feel so good.
You've been walking and talking in your sleep.
Yeah, I know.
They've told me, but I don't remember.
I don't remember it.
Do you want me to stop Mr. Bottomly from seeing you?
I can, at least for a little while.
Let you catch your breath.
No.
It bothers you though, doesn't it?
It's awful.
- Then why do you want to go on?
- I don't know.
Can you tell me what the feeling is when you talk to Mr. Bottomly?
What's it like?
I don't know.
I'm always feeling like...
...something is going to happen and it never does.
But you like the feeling?
Oh, yeah, I like the feeling.
It's all right.
It's just scary. It's...
...like driving a car too fast.
You know what I mean?
When it doesn't happen...
...this something...
...how do you feel?
Well, then I feel lousy, like the bottom is falling out...
...like everything is going away and I can't reach it.
You know what I mean?
I mean...
Let me tell you. It...
I remember when I used to go to confession when I was a kid.
I'd be walking toward the box, feeling great...
...because I was gonna tell the Father what I did...
...stealing out of my mother's purse or something worse.
You know what I mean? I mean, for real.
And then, all of a sudden, I'd lose it.
I mean...
...I could actually...
I could see it coming out of my head, kind of floating out of the box.
Then it'd be gone, and I couldn't talk to him.
I'd feel awful, and that's the way I feel...
...about Mr. Bottomly.
But you do feel good...
...when you think you're going to be able to tell him something, don't you?
But scared.
Well, like...
I suppose it's because I didn't tell him anything.
Albert, tell me this. What do you think would happen to you...
...if you found out what this something is and you told him?
I'd die.
- Morning, Albert.
- Morning.
Let's go back to the day of the president's funeral.
You remember what you did that day?
- I guess we all remember that day.
- Tell me about it.
What's the point?
I could tell you anything.
You got no facts to check. Pyne Furnace was closed like everybody else.
What we did on days of crisis, Pearl
Harbor, V-J Day, the assassination...
...tell us a lot about ourselves.
That's a crock. You're not kidding me.
You got something I don't know about.
You've got something I don't know about.
- We're just trying to trade information.
- Suppose I call it off.
You won't do that, Albert.
You're an honest man.
You want to know, don't you?
Will it make me feel better?
Do you promise it'll make me feel better?
Of course it will.
Did you watch TV that day?
Yes.
- Did you feel very badly?
- At first, I didn't believe...
...that he was dead.
But after I knew it really happened,
I felt bad.
- Very, very bad.
- Did you watch it all day?
It seemed the only thing to do...
...to give respect.
You didn't go out?
You're right. I went out and drove around.
I didn't want to look anymore.
Go on, Albert.
Well, I parked for some reason.
- Did you get out of the car?
- No.
Was there mail that day?
- I think so. Why?
- I remember looking for it.
You looked for the mail when you went home? Are you sure?
Where else could I look for my mail?
What's the matter?
I... I saw something.
What?
I don't know what it was, but it...
It scared the hell out of me.
What did it look like?
I don't know now. It came in my head and it's flashed out again.
What's...?
What's happening to me?
Something touched you off.
You're having an anxiety attack.
- Want the doctor?
- No.
I don't need a doctor.
I'll fight it out myself.
I must...
...be losing my marbles.
You're not, Albert.
But you know now there's something wrong.
- Will you admit that to me?
- Yeah.
Yeah, something. All right.
Something.
- Want some?
- Mm-mm.
What are you doing?
Reading law.
Just law generally?
I've always found it comforting.
Some people read automobile books or rifle magazines.
But it isn't working?
Nope.
I think he's about to crack.
I'm glad.
He's suffering.
You don't seem to be jumping for joy either.
No, but I don't have to face anything that monstrous about myself.
That monstrous?
What are you facing in yourself that's just a little bit monstrous?
At this hour of the night, you look at yourself, and...
...the truth has a way of...
...lying there on the rug in front of you.
I'm enjoying this.
It's a big game on tonight.
Don't like myself for it.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I know I didn't marry
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.
It's a hell of a thing to find out at my age...
...you're not what you thought you were.
What time do you have to start on him in the morning?
Early.
Then come to bed.
Michael punched a boy in the nose.
Michael did that?
What did you tell the boy's mother?
I told her if he couldn't play with Michael nicely...
...he couldn't come over anymore.
Michael picks fights. I saw him.
Judy, your mother didn't ask you.
Michael still picks fights.
- How are you doing in school?
- Show Daddy your report card.
Hey, not bad.
Thank you. I miss you, Daddy.
When are you going to not be crazy anymore?
Who said Daddy was crazy?
Michael's friend. His father said that Daddy was in the crazy place.
How's, uh...?
How's Mr. Pyne?
He said he'd write you. He knows you couldn't do anything wrong...
...that you must have had some kind of breakdown.
He's sending your salary anyway.
Wait!
- What's the matter?
- You hurt Mommy!
- Where does the kid get ideas like that?
- I saw you!
- What are you going to do?
- Put him under sedation.
- No, not now.
- You are looking at a sick animal.
So did the women he strangled.
I want him now.
She's against me.
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know why.
She's afraid of me.
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.
Did you touch her?
I saw myself touch her.
It popped into my head.
How could she know that?
What popped into your head?
For a second, I...
Well, not... No, no, not really me.
I mean, it was...
Oh, it was...
It was someone inside of me, wanted...
Didn't want her there.
But...
Not me. Not... Not...
I mean, not me. I love Irmgard.
And you saw this other person, this other you, going for her?
- You told the doctor about this?
- No.
You cut them off, don't you?
Well, I don't... I don't know if I do.
I try to. It...
It, uh...
These things keep popping in and out of my head, you know.
They don't make sense.
Albert, do you remember what you did New Year's Eve?
New Year's Day?
Yeah, I watched the Rose Bowl parade with the kids.
Then we had dinner around 2:00.
We usually...
...eat early on a holiday.
Remember what you did the day after New Year's Day?
- I worked.
- Where?
On Charles Street. A furnace job.
- What time did you quit?
- Oh, about 3:30 or so.
What did you do then?
Uh...
Then I went home.
- No?
- You sure you went home?
But...
I don't know, man. I don't know.
I don't know what's...
I don't know what's happening to me.
These things you see that pop into your head...
...now is the time to make sense out of them.
- I know, but what if...?
- You didn't go home.
Okay.
If you say so.
What did you see the other day when you felt sick in here?
- I can't.
- You want to know?
You want to feel better?
Face it. What did you see?
Uh...
Mailboxes.
- Yours?
- No.
What else?
- A dark hall.
- What else?
- I can't.
- Come on!
I can't.
- A woman's breasts.
- Whose?
- I don't know. I can't see her face.
- What was she doing?
Her blouse came off in my hand.
Albert, now. Now is the time, Albert.
Go back.
You left the furnace job.
Now what do you do? Think.
Reach out.
No, I can't. Nothing. No.
- You don't want it to come.
- No.
- I'm trying.
- No, you're not. Face it.
Where are you?
What did you do after you left the job?
Come on. Look at it.
Have some guts for once.
I'm, uh...
- I'm going down the street.
- What?
In a car, I'm going down the street.
Where are you going?
Anywhere. I just...
...find a place to park the car.
Right. I parked the car...
...and walked to the house that was there.
Miss McLean? Oh, Miss Williams.
I'm a plumber.
The landlord sent me over to check a leak in the walls.
Well, I don't know if I'll be back tomorrow.
Well, okay. Right.
Oh, fine. Great.
Oh, yeah. I can see the leak.
Now, don't scream.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Take those off.
That too.
Turn around.
Turn around and give me your hands.
Uh, I don't want you to scratch me.
All right?

Take cover!
There's some more, over there!
Back up, around the other way.
[SPEAKS IN POLISH]
What's the odd smell in this house, inspector?
The smell of war,
Major Grau.
Good morning, inspector.
Major.
I'm sorry to call you at such an ungodly hour.
Not very nice, I'm afraid.
The work of an amateur butcher, I should say.
Why have you called me?
The dead woman's Polish, isn't she?
This is not a case for the German authorities.
Her name was Kupiecka.
Maria Kupiecka.
Kupiecka?
Oh, yes, she was a prostitute and a good friend to us.
She was also a German agent.
Killed by a Polish patriot?
Providing the Polish patriot was also a sexual degenerate.
Patriotism has been known to have its vicious side.
One hundred knife wounds goes beyond normal patriotic zeal.
One hundred?
That's just my guess, sir.
It would be impossible to count.
As you can see, the focus of the murderer's attack was on the woman's sexual organs, using what appears to have been a large clasp knife...
Thank you, doctor, there's no need to be vivid.
[SPEAKING IN POLISH]
Find anything?
No, not yet.
Who reported the murder?
A voice on the telephone.
A man. He heard screams at about 11: 10.
Identify himself?
No.
Who lives in this house?
One of you...
One of you heard a scream and telephoned the police.
One of you knows something about the way in which this woman died.
If that person does not tell us everything he knows, we shall assume that her death was political.
That she was killed by a member of the Polish underground and that you are all accomplices.
In which case, it will be my sad duty to turn the whole lot of you over to the Gestapo.
The man who telephoned the police has one minute in which to make himself known.
I heard the scream.
This one terrible scream.
And then, well, I...
I hid in the lavatory.
Then later, perhaps 10 minutes later,
I telephoned the police.
That's all.
You did not give the police your name.
That means that there was something you didn't want them to know.
What could that something be?
Well, there's a...
There's this crack in the door to the lavatory.
And naturally, you put your eye to the crack and you saw...?
I saw a man coming down the stairs.
Describe him, please.
Well, it... It was dark.
Describe him, please.
I couldn't see all of him.
Just the lower part, the trousers.
Why are you so frightened by what you saw?
Because it was a uniform, sir.
Like yours.
Like mine?
A German officer?
The man's a liar.
German officers can commit murders like anyone else.
Is that all you noticed?
That the trousers were like mine?
Exactly like mine?
No.
Not exactly, sir. No.
There was a...
There was a red stripe running down the leg.
He's lying.
Are you aware that only German generals wear the red stripe?
Yes, sir. That's why I was afraid.
I see.
It's impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
A German general.
Well, well.
I don't think we need to take this testimony too seriously.
After all, it was dark on the stairs.
Sir, I swear...
I swear, I'm telling the truth.
And I believe you, until there's evidence to the contrary.
Why would he tell a dangerous lie?
I want a complete investigation.
But what happens if the murderer really is a general?
What happens? Well, justice is blind, my dear inspector.
Justice cannot see the red stripe or the gold braid, but justice can sometimes hear the cry of a murdered woman.
If a general is responsible, why, we shall have to hang him.
Don't worry, Liesowski, the responsibility is mine.
Good night.
LIESOWSKI: Well, Inspector
Morand, you can't blame me for not quite remembering a case that occurred almost a generation ago.
But as they say, it's the long arm of the law.
It's... It's 23 years ago.
My God, how time passes.
When I left the police, right after the war
I managed to keep some of my files.
Always glad to help a colleague.
Ah, here we are, inspector.
"Kupiecka, Maria.
Murdered. Unsolved. "
The suspects were...
Oh, yes. Yes, now I remember.
A German general was seen allegedly leaving her room.
And of all the generals in Warsaw, only three had no alibis for the night in question.
Here, this is the Lichnowsky Palace. 
It used to belong
to the Polish kings. 
Then later it became a museum. 
As you can see,
today it's still a museum. 
During the war,
the German headquarters
in Warsaw was located here. 
As I was saying,
we were quite thorough, I thought,
in the way we eliminated suspects. 
Had to proceed tactfully, of course. 
They were generals, after all,
and it was war. 
And Poland was occupied. 
SOLDIER:
Ready for inspection, sir.
One of them was
General von Seidlitz-Gabler,
7th Corps commander. 
He was a Junker of the old school. 
He lived like royalty in the palace,
with his wife and daughter. 
The night of the murder,
he was not in his quarters. 
His chief of staff,
Major General Klaus Kahlenberge
also had no alibi that night. 
Of all the generals,
he was the least disagreeable. 
An interesting man. 
No wife, no children. 
General Gabler, a message.
Yes?
A message from General Tanz, sir.
Thank you, Fräulein Neumaier.
It seems we have failed to keep proper order in the city.
You have read it?
Oh, yes.
And because of our notorious incompetence...
Incompetence?
They don't realize that this is a garrison post, that I am given only the dregs of the army, the misfits.
Well, that was General Tanz's word.
"Incompetence. "
Not to mention subordinates who shirk responsibility.
And because of our failure, the Führer has ordered
General Tanz to solve the problem of Warsaw.
How?
Meticulously.
In three phases.
Using the most drastic means, I suppose.
Drastic?
Monstrous.
LIESOWSKI: Lieutenant General Tanz
commanded the Nibelungen Division. 
He was the youngest
Wehrmacht general. 
A hero at Leningrad, a pet of Hitler,
a remarkable officer. 
We Poles detested him. 
He arrived in Warsaw on the day
the woman was killed. 
He, too, was unaccounted for
that night. 
First roadblock, set up there.
Yes, sir.
The sniping last night came from a street two blocks away.
The entire quarter is to be sealed off.
We shall take a leaf from the fisherman's book.
First, we'll mark out a wide perimeter, then we'll start combing the outlying streets.
That should set the fish in motion.
Of course, they'll try to make off in the opposite direction, but we'll have roadblocks there to cut them off.
By the time we've closed the net, we'll have them exactly where we want them.
With their backs to the ghetto wall.
Excuse me, general, what about the civilian population?
The latest estimate, this section of the city contains about 80,000 inhabitants.
One can hardly talk of a normal civilian population in this place.
I regard the experience to be gained from this operation as absolutely indispensable.
Hold it at 20.
Now, about those flamethrowers, sir, to be on the safe side, I've requested three times as many as needed.
What are you scared of, children?
I think they're hungry.
What food do we have?
Some sandwiches, sir.
Bring them to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, you're quite right, they do look hungry.
Poor little devils.
Your lunch, sir.
Open.
Yes, sir.
Filth.
[CHILDREN YELLING]
Your hands.
Look at those nails.
Not even Polish children should be given such muck.
Make a note.
Food and sweets to be carried at all times for the children.
It does no harm to win their confidence.
As for him, he's relieved as my orderly. Home leave cancelled.
Filthy pig. Last week he offered me an unwashed glass.
Now he enters my sight looking as though he just exhumed his grandmother with his bare hands.
Absolute cleanliness, that's what
I demand from the people around me.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
As for our immediate requirements, see they're fully met.
Once they are,
I shall seal off the district and put the inhabitants through a sieve.
All 80,000?
General Tanz, forgive me, but just as a matter of curiosity, what do you feel is the exact purpose of this exercise?
You've read the memorandum.
Oh, yes. Yes, I have...
And what does the memorandum say?
That phase one is intended to intimidate the population to search houses, to find and arrest resistance.
Then that is the exact purpose of the exercise.
An excellent plan, by the way. Much like my own when I first came here, only I was never given the ultimate authority to implement it.
But am I to understand that if there is resistance during phase one, you would then go to phase two and even to phase three, which would mean the destruction of the entire city?
You are to understand exactly that.
Well, uh, isn't that somewhat excessive?
Excessive.
You will be aware that we are
30 miles from Moscow.
We are moving ahead on a 5000-mile front.
Every available soldier is needed if we are to conquer Russia.
Yet here in Warsaw, three divisions are rotting, because of a few thousand criminal
Poles and Jews hiding in slums.
It is excessive to permit this state of affairs.
[KNOCKING]
Who is it?
You have my full list of requirements.
Eleanore, come in. Come in, my dear.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
My wife arrived early this morning from Berlin.
How was Berlin?
Eager to hear the good news that always follows in the wake of a good soldier.
When I heard you were with my husband, I came straight here.
I wanted to tell you myself what an inspiration you've been to us all at home.
I am flattered, ma'am.
Oh, no, I'm not flattering you.
I'm honoring you as you deserve.
If you're not too busy,
I shall need your help with the arrangements for the soiree tonight.
In your honor, General Tanz.
I'll look forward to it, ma'am.
Oh, incidentally, our daughter,
Ulrike, is here in Warsaw.
She'll be at the soiree too.
Yes?
Well, you remember her, don't you?
In Berlin, at the garden party at General Jodl's house.
Oh, yes, I do remember her.
My compliments, ma'am.
Sorry. I suppose that was obvious.
But you know how mothers are.
Anxious to become mothers-in-law, I should think.
A splendid officer, no doubt of that.
A mother would be proud to see her daughter...
Married to a war memorial?
Excuse me, ma'am.
I shall continue to study
General Tanz's plan.
With sinking heart.
I detest that man.
What does he mean,
"with sinking heart"?
Oh, the black book.
What were you saying, my dear?
I don't dare say anything when you've got your book out.
One must protect one's reputation.
Another mess like the one you've made here in Warsaw and you won't have a reputation to protect.
What's the date?
The 13th.
Fortunately, I still have some influence at Supreme Headquarters.
Indeed you have, for which I am grateful.
How nice that you are here at last.
I want to talk to you about Ulrike.
And I want to talk to you about the soiree tonight.
I think you should know that this morning Ulrike was extremely rude to me.
Considering where you are sending her, I'm not surprised.
[KNOCKING]
Excuse me, general, but there is a Major Grau from Intelligence.
He would like to see you.
What does he want?
He said it was personal.
He's most persistent.
Tell him, some other time.
Yes, sir.
By the way, what did you do to your uniform last night?
Do? To my uniform?
Yes, there was a stain on the jacket. A red stain.
But since you obviously didn't cut yourself shaving, it could only have been lipstick.
Shall I match the color with the seductive shade Fräulein Neumaier wears?
Don't be absurd.
Anyway, the evidence is destroyed.
I've sent everything to be cleaned.
Aren't you glad that I am here now to look after you?
Of course I am, dear Eleanore.
We are well-suited, aren't we?
[DOOR SLAMS]
I wish you'd remember to knock.
Sorry, sir.
Major Grau of Intelligence just rang from downstairs, sir. He asked to see you.
What about?
He wouldn't say, sir.
Tell him I'm busy.
I already told him, sir.
I took the liberty.
Good.
Well?
Apparently, he rang the motor pool this morning.
Wanted to see the log for last night to see if anyone had used the car.
I told the officer in charge that no information could be released without clearing it first with us.
Good. Yes, that's very good.
Thank you, sergeant.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Yes?
Sir, um, about my cousin Hartmann.
Your cousin Hartmann?
Yes, sir.
You have his record, sir.
On your desk, sir.
Oh, yes.
He's just out of hospital, sir.
He was wounded at Voronezh.
He's on temporary duty in Warsaw.
I had hoped that we could make his duty with us permanent.
And by some extraordinary coincidence, he's waiting in your office to see me.
Yes, sir.
Show him in.
Thank you, sir.
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal.
Reporting as ordered, sir.
At ease.
Well, it's a distinguished record, corporal.
I see from your press clippings,
Otto is obviously keeping a scrapbook for you.
I see that you are
"the reincarnation of Siegfried, a German hero from the golden age. "
Do you feel like Siegfried?
Well, I'm not at all certain, sir, how Siegfried felt.
Well, that's a sensible answer. I see they've given you the Iron Cross.
He killed 40 Russians single-handed, sir.
Splendid.
Well, now, as to your future,
I imagine that, as a university man, you'd want to become an officer.
Therefore, I shall be happy to send you to...
Erm...
You don't want to go to officers school?
I should prefer to remain a corporal, sir.
Actually, general, he doesn't mean that.
What he means is...
What do you mean?
I mean, I don't want to become an officer. That's all, sir.
I'm shattered.
My world is toppling.
What is the point of being a general when corporals prefer to be corporals?
He's still a bit shaky, after the hospital.
Yes, apparently.
Now, your cousin suggested that you join us here at headquarters, but I should think you'd be anxious to get back to the fighting.
No?
No, sir.
General, what he really means is...
Leave us, sergeant.
I, um...
I don't seem to understand you, corporal.
I want to survive, sir.
I want to live through the war.
Well, naturally. We all do.
But we are soldiers, we must fight.
Yes, sir. And I have.
And you don't want to go back.
Is this the " reincarnation of Siegfried"?
I'm sorry, sir, but I have a horror of death.
Even in a good cause?
Let me see now...
According to your papers, in civilian life you were a student at Dresden?
Music conservatory, yes, sir. I studied piano.
Music, piano, yes. Yes.
Yes. I think I have an assignment for you.
But one which requires great courage.
Only a man who has killed...
How many was it? Let me see.
Yes, 40 Russians single-handed, would be equal to the task.
Now, what about Chopin, wasn't he Polish?
Didn't he write the Polonaises?
Can you play them?
Yes, madam.
You don't sound very enthusiastic.
Well, madam, they were patriotic pieces, celebrating the glory of Poland.
Well, the glory of Poland isn't precisely what we're here to celebrate.
No, madam. So I thought that perhaps we might play...
Wagner.
I remember the Führer saying to me after a performance of Parsifal,
"There's no such thing as too much Wagner. "
After Parsifal?
I must say, it's unusual to find a fighting man who also knows about music.
Thank you, madam.
Oh, no, don't thank me, wait until I've thanked you.
And I won't until after the soiree.
I dislike being a bore, major.
You never bore me, Engel.
But I can't help wondering what you're trying to prove.
Just what do you think you're doing?
My job.
But if you say anything to any of them, he'll know...
The murderer will know that you're after him.
That's the point of the exercise.
Good evening, sergeant.
Sir.
But look, sir, why do you care who killed that bitch?
She's better off dead anyway.
Have you ever heard of the Eumenides?
The what?
Greek mythology.
A number of disagreeable ladies, sometimes known as the Furies.
They believe that spilled blood calls out for vengeance.
That's how justice began.
Well, we don't want it to end, do we, just because there's a war on?
Wait for me here.
I'm afraid I won't be long.
Mad.
MAN:
Grau.
Colonel Mannheim.
What on earth are you doing here?
You must be out of your mind.
If the generals won't see me,
I must come here to see them.
Well, God help you, Grau.
I won't.
Better have some champagne.
You'll need it.
You may be right, sir.
General Tanz, to my mind you're a model man in every respect.
Except one.
You've not married.
May I ask why not?
No opportunity. Greatly regret it.
Well, perhaps you've allowed opportunities to slip by.
My dear, General Tanz is a young man whose life has been spent as a soldier.
His generation has been denied the pleasures of domesticity.
We live in a period which makes great demands upon us.
Consequently, there is little time for what is commonly known as private life.
Quite right. Champagne, general?
Water.
Water?
A glass of water for General Tanz.
Ah. Here comes Ulrike.
You remember her from Berlin.
Good evening, general.
She's been with me over a year now, as a soldier.
An excellent soldier.
Thank you, Father.
I must say, I still find it hard to get used to the idea of young girls in the army.
We're building a new world order, and women should not be exempt from playing their part.
I knew you would understand, general.
Ulrike has now decided to become a nurse in a military hospital run by an order of nuns in Bavaria.
We're very proud of our girl.
Tell me, general, is it true that in the battle of Leningrad you used frozen bodies instead of sandbags for your artillery?
The story is exaggerated.
Oh, I am sorry.
Some soldiers lie and rot in the battlefield.
I thought it most imaginative, putting the dead to work, you might say.
Nobody rots with me.
Your water, general.
Thank you.
My compliments. I liked the bit about the frozen bodies.
Oh, thank you, general.
Be careful.
Ulrike has a most original way of expressing herself.
Needless to say, I shall miss not having her with me.
Then why let her go?
Come along, general, let's have some supper.
You'll join us, too,
Kahlenberge?
Courage.
Is not enough.
How dare you speak like that to General Tanz?
It serves you right, Mother, for what you're doing to me.
Whatever I do is for your own good.
I think only of you.
Only of me?
You have changed.
When did I begin to interest you so much?
Good evening.
You've become vicious.
Yes, it's the war, Mother.
Well, the nuns will soon improve your manners.
Suppose I refuse to go?
You will be ordered to go. I have seen to that already. You have no choice.
You really are a terrible woman, Mother.
I suppose we deserve each other.
Colonel Mannheim!
Good evening.
Yes, I'd love to dance with you.
In my memoirs,
I keep a record of everything.
Yours will be the place of honor in the Warsaw chapter.
GRAU:
General von Seidlitz-Gabler?
Sir.
Oh, yes, you are Major...?
Grau, Intelligence.
Under Colonel Mannheim.
I tried to see you today.
In fact, I tried to see each of you, without much success, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry, major, but general officers are sometimes busy, you know?
Of course.
What was it you wanted to see us about?
Last night, a prostitute was murdered.
A prostitute? That's an occupational hazard, isn't it?
When you hear the details, I'm sure you'll agree it's a unique case.
Unique?
You can't be serious.
We live in an age in which bodies lie around streets like cobblestones.
What's so unique about this case?
All right, all right, come to the point, major.
Last night, a woman was murdered.
Yes, general, in Bulkowa Street, number 27, fourth-floor apartment,
Maria Kupiecka, a prostitute, also one of our agents.
She was stabbed to death most brutally. Cut to pieces, in fact.
A charming story.
But what has that to do with us?
Preliminary investigation has established that each of you was... well, unaccounted for last night.
To whom should we be accountable, major?
I fail to see what my...
What our movements should have to do with you or with this woman's death.
Well, the murderer was seen leaving the woman's room.
In that case, you must know who he is.
Not exactly. The face was not visible, but the uniform was.
It was the uniform of a German officer.
In fact, a German general.
This is a serious charge.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Oh, yes, sir, my duty.
Then consider your duty done, major. Good night.
Are you, by any chance, using perfume?
I occasionally use a strong eau de cologne after shaving.
Good night, sir.
I will, of course, want to see each of you tomorrow, if I may, in line of duty.
It is quite possible we've been misled, but we don't want to leave any loose ends dangling, do we?
Until tomorrow.
Good night, generals.
Astonishing behavior!
Who invited him?
Not I.
Socially, Major Grau has not been a success.
I'm sorry, general.
I should have had him arrested.
Why? He was merely doing his duty.
Yes.
Well...
Now, there are some officers
I should like to present to you.
Some sauerbraten, general?
Make yourself comfortable, inspector.
This is my third restaurant in Berlin.
That's if you count the sausage shop I had down by the station right after the war.
We were really on our arse then.
Now look, Germany is booming.
We made it.
Well, come along, inspector, do sit down.
One large Munchen, please.
Now, then, you asked me about General Kahlenberge.
Well, I don't suppose there was anyone who knew him better than me.
Hartmann's doing a good job, isn't he, sir?
Yes. What?
Oh, yes! Apparently.
OTTO: Of course, inspector,
as I said before,
I haven't seen Hartmann
since the war. 
Don't want to see him,
after what he did. 
But I'll say one thing, he had the most
extraordinary effect on women. 
I don't know why. 
Well, he wasn't what you'd call
really handsome. 
Too skinny. 
But whatever it was he had,
it work ed out all right with women. 
I think they must have got together almost from the first moment they met. 
Well, things were like that
in the war. 
I remember once in Paris,
meeting this girl in the Metro. 
Well, anyway, you didn't waste time,
not with knowing maybe tomorrow
you'd be sent to the fronts or the damned Allies would drop a bomb on you. 
Oh, worry, I didn't mean that
about the Allies. 
After all, where would we be now
without Americans?
Nice.
I'd forgotten how nice.
Would you say there were no girls in Russia?
Girls? I was too scared.
I'm hopeless when I'm scared.
Well, it's a good thing
I don't scare you, isn't it?
Yes, it's just that this room makes me nervous.
Nervous?
Mm.
Oh, you have no sense of history.
Do you realize this used to be the bed of the king of Poland.
Did it really?
Mm-hm.
It's like sleeping on the floor.
It's freezing in here.
Ah, but the king and the queen never slept. They just made love.
They were never cold.
Do you like the war?
Do I like the war?
Good God, no. Do you?
If it weren't for the war, I'd be on the marriage circuit now, living on some army post, making conversation with dreary young officers.
Instead of making love with dreary young corporals.
Oh, not dreary. Not at all.
In fact, the best so far.
Oh?
Do you specialize in corporals?
No.
Only heroes like you.
Just think, all this bravery in my arms.
It must be very inspiring.
What's the matter?
You know, we mustn't like each other too much.
Why? Because I'm a corporal and you're a general's daughter?
No. It's because...
It's a man, a girl, a war.
Two boys I knew are already dead in Russia.
It's funny.
In the dark, you feel just like them to me.
And you like this war?
No. I like this.
[CLOCK CHIMES]
[ENGINE BACKFIRES]
No, no!
What's wrong?
Nothing. I thought they were firing at me.
You're shaking like a leaf.
I'm all right now.
What's it like having people try to kill you?
Noisy bastards.
Good morning.
Good morning, king of Poland.
What's it like having people try to kill you?
Well, what do you think it's like?
Terrible.
Yes.
I'm glad...
Well, I'm glad that you're here.
So am I.
But you'll be going back soon,
I suppose?
Not if I can help it, I won't.
Can you bear the truth?
Probably not.
I'm a fraud.
Impossible.
When they opened fire on us at Voronezh, I ran away.
It's as simple as that.
Then, I've no idea how, I was hit.
It was like a door slamming in my head, and I thought I was dead.
Next thing I remember waking up in the hospital and there was this general congratulating me on having killed 40 Russians single-handed.
You see, they were all killed that day, the whole company.
Everyone was killed except me, and I suppose it didn't look too good in dispatches, a whole company being wiped out, so they decided to make a hero of the survivor.
The one who ran away.
So now what do you think of all that bravery?
Well, that's a lovely story.
I think it's marvelous.
Marvelous?
Yes.
For once, the joke's on them.
Come, make love to the queen of Poland.
I must say you are, well, unexpected.
It's lucky we met.
What's lucky is right now.
You know, when this war is over...
Mm-mm. It will never end.
Well, what happened?
Did you see them?
Generals Gabler and Kahlenberge are in conference and cannot be disturbed.
I told you they wouldn't see you.
Where's General Tanz?
Look, why don't we forget about this?
It's not as if we don't have other things to do.
Where's General Tanz?
In the old city, conducting a tactical exercise.
I don't trust him.
Naturally, in the field, he must use his discretion.
He has no discretion.
He is ruthless.
Now, now, you exaggerate.
He will only go to phase two if phase one should prove to be a failure.
What is a failure?
Well, if the Poles, the Jews try to retaliate.
What constitutes retaliation, a rock thrown at his golden head?
Is that sufficient warrant for the demolition of the city?
You always overstate things,
Kahlenberge.
General Tanz is a responsible officer...
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
Sorry, sir. Colonel Mannheim to see General Kahlenberge, sir.
We'll discuss this later.
And don't worry about Tanz.
I'll take care of him.
Colonel Mannheim, sir.
You wanted to see me, general.
Yes, yes.
Yes, I did, colonel.
I wanted to see you about...
Damn it, what was it about?
Yes.
Yes, I remember now.
You have an officer on your staff, a Major Grau.
Halt! Halt!
Major Grau to see General Tanz.
Major Grau?
Just a minute, sir.
Get me CP,
Colonel Sandauer, urgent.
Roadblock 4 calling CP.
Roadblock 4 calling CP.
Can you hear me? Over.
Get your hands up.
Hands up.
SOLDIER 1: Colonel Sandauer on the line, sergeant.
Colonel Sandauer, there's a Major Grau here.
Wants to see the general.
My orders were...
What? Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
You may pass, major.
Stop!
Go ahead.
Well, at least you have one friend.
So it would seem.
Hands up!
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Have them over here.
Over here. Over here.
Get back!
Name?
First name?
Profession?
Halt!
Major Grau.
Go ahead, sir.
Wait for me here.
This is Wehrmacht's radio unit assigned to the Reich's general government of Poland.
This broadcast is coming to you directly from Warsaw.
A few yards from where I am, I see
General Tanz, the hero of Leningrad.
He is conducting maneuvers in the streets of the city.
An entire area is being temporarily evacuated in the interest of public order and safety.
Sector one reports phase one successful.
Sector three, no resistance encountered.
Thank you, Sandauer.
ANNOUNCER: The soldiers, of course, are dedicated to their commander.
He is a superb craftsman of war and his presence alone inspires men to extraordinary valor.
The exercise is being carried out with meticulous precision according to plan.
The population is extremely cooperative and friendly.
SANDAUER: Sector four reports phase one operative.
Sector two, flamethrowers ready to action.
Phase one to continue until further orders.
Yes, sir.
All sectors, from commanding general, phase one to continue until further orders.
Main sector, flamethrowers ready, sir.
Go ahead.
Forward march.
General Tanz?
A few more minutes.
SOLDIER 2: Halt!
SOLDIER 3: Stop!
Get him!
Stop! Fire!
[GUNSHOTS]
Sandauer!
SANDAUER: Sir?
Stand by for phase two.
Phase two, sir?
Stand by for phase two.
Yes, sir.
Notify all units.
Phase one completed.
Stand by for phase two.
Yes, sir.
CP to all sectors, stand by for phase two.
Phase two!
Phase two.
Yes, sir. Phase two.
Phase two.
Fire!
Fire!
Now the major may put his questions.
He's gone, sir.
That maniac is blowing up half the city.
Let's go.
Did you say there was no real resistance?
No, I was there.
One shot from one sniper, that was all, and he blows up the city!
Now, now, we're not the generals.
It is their business, you know, not ours.
We're here just to keep the papers moving.
And yours have arrived.
Congratulations.
For what?
You've been promoted to lieutenant colonel.
Promoted?
And transferred to Paris as of this date.
Lucky fellow.
Transferred, but why?
Who signed the transfer?
General Gabler, naturally.
What are you doing?
I'm going to find out where the order originated.
On whose recommendation here.
Calm down. I've already checked.
General Kahlenberge.
He recommended your transfer.
Did he indeed?
You must have made quite an impression last night.
It would seem so.
Thank you, colonel.
It's just as well, you know.
That's a matter of opinion.
Above all, Major Grau, not too much zeal.
I have a zealous nature, sir. I can't help it.
Yes, inspector, I was in Warsaw with General Tanz.
And I resent those cheap journalists who try to make him out to be some sort of inhuman monster. He was not.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Forgive me, inspector. We hire a lot of foreigners nowadays.
We can't get Germans any more, not for real work.
I've seen General Tanz in the field, with the wounded, the dying.
He was extraordinary.
Compassionate, gentle.
Do you know that after Leningrad,
Hitler ordered the general not to expose himself to enemy fire.
Of course, he found this a great hardship. He was only happy in battle.
[KNOCKING]
Yes?
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Ah, gracias. Gracias.
I'm also learning Spanish.
Well, soon everything will be automated.
Except the manager, of course.
And then in July 1944, we were transferred to Paris.
The Allies were in Normandy by then and Hitler ordered us to stop them in front of Paris.
We nearly did too, except that the army was betrayed, as usual.
But we mustn't talk politics.
It's bad for business, isn't it?
You asked me about Paris.
It was a paradise to us,
particularly after Russia. 
I remember that summer
as though it were yesterday. 
The empty streets,
the heat, the quiet. 
Everything cheap. 
By the way, I was in Paris last
summer, and my God, the prices. 
When they gave me my hotel bill,
I couldn't believe it. 
But in July '44,
Paris was still our city. 
I suppose that's a tactless thing
to say, but we did love Paris. 
In any case, General Tanz and I
were due to arrive on July 20th. 
But at the last moment, the general
decided to come a few days early. 
So I sent a messenger to 7th Corps
headquarters at Versailles
to say that we would be in Paris
on the 17th. 
I think you know why I'm giving you
the exact dates. 
As it turned out, it was a good thing
we arrived when we did. 
However, there were those
who were not at all pleased
to learn of our early arrival. 
Thank you, that will be all.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Oh, I shall be with General Gabler in the War Room.
What about my pass?
Is it all right?
For God's sake, relax!
Operation Hartmann, phase one, will begin tomorrow, 18 July, at 0915 when the lance corporal reports to the railway station.
With a car.
With a car duly requisitioned from the motor pool.
Phase two, the lance corporal will then meet the secret consignment from Berlin.
Then?
Then phase three.
A 24-hour pass for the lance corporal will begin tomorrow at noon.
You've got it?
Here.
A corporal and a general's daughter.
You know, you really are asking for trouble.
But it's your funeral, not mine!
OFFICER: The British second army has been advancing towards the left, trying to cut off two of our panzer divisions from our main supply route.
During the last 48 hours, the enemy has succeeded in crossing the Ohm River, here and here.
However, we were able to stop them here, with help from the
12th SS Panzer Division, which is counterattacking at the moment.
Well?
Now what do we do?
To be precise, what do you do?
We. You're in this too.
General Gabler.
The field marshal will see you at 4:00.
Thank you, major.
I admit that it's inconvenient for you.
It's a good deal more than that. Why?
Just why is General Tanz arriving three days earlier than was planned?
You suspect something odd?
He comes straight from Hitler.
Isn't that odd enough?
I want to hear this.
The American 1st Army occupied the town of Saint-Claude.
Our troops are withdrawing to new positions south and southeast.
GRAU: General Gabler,
General Kahlenberge.
I never had the opportunity to thank you for my promotion.
I'm sorry. Grau,
Intelligence, Warsaw 1942.
Oh, yes, yes.
Good to see you again, colonel.
You once had the vision to transfer me to Paris.
We do our best to give pleasure, colonel. Good day.
I understand we're soon to be joined by General Tanz.
Quite like old times.
Excuse me.
I just wanted to greet you.
General.
Tiresome fellow.
Strange, isn't it?
Everybody seems to be aware that Tanz is coming here.
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
Obviously not.
It's always disagreeable when the cat gets back to find the mice have been playing.
We could, of course, distract the cat by suggesting that he take a few days off to play a little too.
Particularly after all...
After all that you've been through, my dear general, these past few months in Russia,
I know it must have been perfect hell for you.
I want 4,000 men by the end of the week.
And you shall have them.
Your Colonel Sandauer has been working closely with General Kahlenberge.
We are scraping the sides of the barrel, but you'll have 4,000.
Meanwhile, why don't you take a few days off?
Rest a bit, see the sights of Paris. It's your first visit.
I want only combat troops, no decaying old men or children.
Yes, sir. We are making good progress, General Kahlenberge and I.
After all, it may be your last chance to see Paris.
It may be anyone's last chance. Such a pity.
A necessity.
But of course.
Of course it's necessary.
Stern measures, the only thing people respect.
All I'm suggesting is that you leave everything to us.
A commander does not...
And your excellent Colonel Sandauer.
We've arranged a suite for you at the... Kahlenberge?
At your hotel.
At the Excelsior.
You'll have a car, a driver and whatever else strikes your fancy.
One must relax occasionally, general.
I can't afford to.
You give me no alternative but to compel you to enjoy yourself.
Must I order you?
Because if I must,
I'm afraid I shall have to.
Yes, sir.
Evidently, you are not ready for me.
Very well.
I shall devote one day to seeing the city.
I shall return to headquarters at
0800 hours on the morning of the 19th.
Heil, Hitler.
GABLER:
Heil Hitler.
Well, that wasn't so bad.
You now have one day's grace.
We need two, until the 20th.
Come and have dinner with me and Eleanore tomorrow.
Ulrike's arriving.
This is bad luck.
Naturally, she forgot to say which train she'd be on.
I assume you are with us now.
In spirit, of course, but...
You'll have to make up your mind. Soon.
Making up one's mind is one thing, speaking it is another.
You worry too much.
Patience is one of the few virtues that I possess.
At ease.
Sergeant, get me the military governor's office on the telephone.
Corporal?
Sir.
I have an assignment for you.
Come in.
Get me the military governor's office.
For General Kahlenberge.
You're to stay with him every minute of the day.
24-hour call, do you understand?
Yes, sir.
He may want to go out at night.
Do you know anything which might interest General Tanz?
Nightclubs or girls, that sort of thing.
A few, sir.
But I don't really know what the general's taste is, sir.
Let us hope that whatever it is, it is not you, corporal.
However, if it should be, remember that you're serving the fatherland.
I'll try to remember, sir.
Should he ask you to take him to his headquarters, you are to telephone me.
Either here or at my hotel.
Yes, sir.
You'll report to Colonel Sandauer for specific instructions.
Sir?
What is it, corporal?
I'm sorry, but I was supposed to have a 24-hour leave starting tomorrow.
That's impossible.
Could I have one hour free in the morning, sir?
No.
Sir.
Hartmann?
Sir?
This is important.
All right.
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes. Childhood diseases?
Measles.
I can't remember.
Nothing serious, I think.
Chickenpox.
Bed-wetting?
No, sir.
Fear of the dark?
No, not particularly.
Venereal disease?
No, sir.
Good.
Now, what about books?
Books?
Do you read books?
Yes, sir, I read books.
What?
War and Peace. 
Nietzsche,
The Decline of the West.
Books on psychology, pathology?
No, not much.
Show me your hands.
All right. Now, you'll have a room assigned to you in the general's hotel.
He'll want to see the principal sights of Paris.
You will prepare an itinerary and submit it to me.
When not in the field, the general goes to bed at 11:45.
He seldom drinks or smokes, so you will probably have an early evening.
Now, this is my private number, in case you should need me.
Need you, sir?
If anything out of the ordinary should happen, ring me immediately.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Incidentally, avoid all cemeteries, tombs, any mention of death.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Inspector Morand, please.
Third floor, room 158.
Who shall I say is here?
Thank you. I can find my own way.
[SPEAKS FRENCH]
Welcome, Colonel Grau, to the spider's web.
How did you know it was me?
What other German colonel would enter unannounced?
Almost any SS colonel would.
Actually, I saw you reflected in the window.
Impossible, it's too dirty.
I hope you're not allergic to dust.
Old crimes, colonel.
They generate a good deal of dust.
Unsolved crimes.
The dust has settled.
We can always unsettle it.
Is that why you came?
Do sit down, colonel.
I must apologize for the heat, but it's nearly August, when most Parisians leave Paris.
Let's hope Germans have the good sense to do the same.
Saint-Lô fell to the Allies this morning.
BBC?
Coffee?
No, thank you.
You have dossiers on everyone, don't you?
On everyone interesting.
German as well as French?
At the specific request of German Intelligence, we keep an occasional eye on interesting Germans.
Like me?
I have always found you interesting.
Thank you.
What about German generals?
Well, what about them?
Generals are interesting?
Then, to the degree that they are interesting, we keep an eye on them too.
Good. Here are the names of three generals.
I want to know everything about them.
Everything may be too much.
What specifically are you looking for?
One of them is a murderer.
Only one?
But murder is the occupation of generals.
Let's say what is admirable on the large scale is monstrous on the small.
Since we must give medals to mass murderers, let us try to give justice to the small entrepreneur.
Nicely put. I shall be glad to help you if I can.
I realize that nothing is free in this world, even between colleagues.
Especially between colleagues.
In exchange for your information,
I shall arrange for the release from prison of three French resistance.
Thank you.
Have you a favorite suspect?
Not really, no.
You see, on the night of the murder, each general had something to conceal.
The night of the murder was...?
December the 12th,
1942, Warsaw.
And just as I started my investigation,
I was transferred to Paris.
By the murderer?
Possibly.
For two years, I've wanted to reopen the case.
Now I can. As of today, all three are in Paris.
General Gabler.
He's partial to the sort of girl who was killed.
Oh, a girl. A crime of passion, as we say.
Passion, yes, but only in the sense of your distinguished Marquis de Sade.
Oh, a sex crime, I see.
Is that why this case excites you?
The girl was also a German agent.
She may have been killed because of something she knew.
That's why Kahlenberge intrigues me the most.
He seems to have no private life and yet he disappears from time to time.
No one knows where or why.
And General Tanz?
A perfect maniac.
I saw him destroy an entire quarter of
Warsaw for the sheer pleasure of it. 
On the Eastern front,
he was known as The Butcher. 
He lost most of his division
in Russia. 
He revels in death. 
Which is why, in a curious way,
I don't think he's the man
I'm looking for. 
Anyone who has the power to destroy
a city whenever he chooses
does not need such minor sport
as killing a girl. 
I could be wrong, of course. 
Hartmann?
Yes.
I'm Sergeant Kopatski, the general's orderly.
For the time being, that is.
I forgot to take his laces out before cleaning his shoes this morning.
For God's sake, where are your gloves?
You'll get finger marks on it.
I haven't got gloves.
They never told me.
Take mine.
These are the general's holiday rations.
One bottle of cognac, one Thermos of coffee at 40 degrees centigrade, two hundred cigarettes.
Does the general drink?
Like a sponge, only he never shows it.
Put the briefcase on the back seat.
On the right side.
Whenever he leaves the car, clean out the ashtrays.
He smokes like a chimney.
Clean everything in sight.
Clean everything out of sight, including the engine.
If you don't, he'll tear your head off.
It's now one second to 9:00.
Here he comes.
I've given him full instructions, sir.
Name?
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal, sir.
Show the general your hands.
Well, don't stand there like a fool.
Put your gloves on.
He seems to know Paris.
He's prepared an itinerary of the sights of the city. I have endorsed it.
I shall see you tomorrow morning at headquarters.
Yes, general.
Sergeant Kopatski is relieved as my orderly.
This morning he smeared polish on my shoelaces.
Fourteen days confined to barracks.
Yes, general.
We've just passed the Place Vendôme, sir.
The column is 142 feet high and was erected in 1810.
It's made of bronze from 1200 cannon captured at Austerlitz.
There's a statue of Napoleon on the top.
In front of us, sir, the Tuileries Gardens.
The Tuileries Palace used to be in the middle of the gardens.
In 1792, at the time of the French Revolution, the Paris mob attacked the palace, forcing the king and queen to escape.
It was burnt down in... in 1871.
We are now coming into Place de la Concorde.
One of the most beautiful squares in Paris.
It was here, in the middle of the square that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were beheaded during the revolution.
The guillotine was there, in the centre, where the obelisk is now.
Keep your eye on the road, corporal.
Yes, sir.
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
Fräulein Gabler?
Yes.
I'm Sergeant Kopke from your father's headquarters.
How did they know which train I was on?
They didn't.
May I?
You see, I'm Hartmann's cousin.
We got no secrets, Hartmann and me.
More like brothers, really.
He's all right, isn't he?
All right? Never better.
No, it's just at the last moment he was assigned to drive General Tanz.
Only for today. That's why he couldn't meet you.
Well, how are things in the fatherland?
Any cities left after all the bombing?
A few, yes, here and there.
There's one good thing about Paris.
It's an open city, no bombs.
I hate bombs.
This way, Fräulein Gabler.
I have a car for you just outside.
I'll take you to your father's hotel.
Hartmann's staying there too.
With General Tanz, just for tonight.
So I suppose you'll run into him sooner or later, in the lobby or something.
The gallery is shut to the public, sir.
But special permission has been granted for you to see the paintings.
Most of them have been confiscated and assembled here before being sent to Germany.
General Tanz.
You've been notified.
Yes, corporal.
Here's all the information.
On your right, sir, paintings by Boucher, the 18th-century
French master.
All these paintings have been selected for Reichsmarschall Goering.
What's in there?
Paintings requisitioned from private collections by the reichsmarshcall. 
What kind of paintings?
Modern, sir, and some impressionists.
Decadent?
I suppose so, sir.
HARTMANN:
Light.
Toulouse-Lautrec, Le Divan.
Renoir, Nude, painted in 1910.
Gauguin, On the Beach, from his Tahitian period.
Another Nude by Renoir.
Soutine, Le Garcon d'etage.
Degas, The Tub, painted in 1886.
Van Gogh, Vincent, Self-Portrait. 
Sometimes called
Vincent in Flames, painted while in an insane asylum during the last years of his life.
Here, sir, a painting by Cézanne.
How dare you touch me?
Excuse me, sir, but...
Never do that again!
OK, I can lick you.
OK, you think you're such a big shot, but you're a little nut.
Bang bang, you're dead!
May I help you, please?
May I help you, please?
We're looking for a Jerry Nichols.
- Does he work here?
- Oh, yes, indeed.
Where is he?
Well, I... I'm afraid you won't be able to see him now.
He'll be in class another, uh...
...hour and a half.
I'm sorry, lady. We don't have the time. Where is he?
Well, I... I told you, he's teaching his class...
Where is he, lady?
He... He's up... upstairs.
Now you just sit there, relax, take a little nap.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Do you understand?
Shh.
Good morning.
Miss Watson?
May I help you?
"...In a little grey house made of logs.
- "The great, dark trees of the woods...
- Jerry Nichols?
Just down that corridor, the last door on the right.
Stood all around the house, and beyond them were other trees."
All right. Now, since each spark plug...
Oh, excuse me, fellows.
Uh, Eddie, you wanna take this?
Feel the points here in this distributor cap... and then pass it on to all you geniuses.
- Hello? This is Mr Nichols.
- Mr Nichols?
Two men are coming after you. Miss
Watson thinks they're gonna kill you.
Oh, I see. Thank you.
You don't understand, Mr Nichols...
Should I call the police?
Try to get help?
No. No, don't bother.
It's all right. I... I know them.
Mr Nichols!
I know them.
Class is dismissed.
I said, class is dismissed!
Jerry Nichols?
Stop pushing, man!
Get out of here!
Porter.
- One scotch and water.
- Scotch over there.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
One carrot juice.
It's the eyes. It's good for the eyes.
Yeah, you can see better.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
OK, Charlie.
Charlie, ever since we got on this train, you've been like a dummy.
- What?
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
You know, Lee,
I've hit a few guys in my time.
True.
Now, if they had a chance, they always ran.
But he just stood there and took it.
First thing you told me was never to think about a job, Charlie.
Another thing: I recognized him the minute I saw him.
Well, he was a hotshot race driver named Johnny North.
Everybody knew him. So what?
Only thing that counts is we're 25,000 ahead of the game.
Yeah, that's another thing:
25,000 for a simple hit.
We walk in.
We put him down. We walk out.
- That's a lot of money for a simple hit.
- Not for me it isn't.
And he knew we were coming.
That dame must've gotten to a phone,
'cause he was tipped off.
But he just stood there.
That's one.
Twenty-five thousand for a simple hit.
I never got more than ten in my life. That's two.
Now, I happen to know that Johnny North was in on a big mail robbery in California.
Supposed to have gotten away with over a million bucks, left the other guys holding the bag.
So we get a contract to knock him off. OK?
What happened to the million?
He spent it.
Nobody spends a million.
No, he didn't have the money.
Otherwise, we would've leaned on him.
Makes sense.
I'll tell you something else that makes more sense.
Whoever laid this contract wasn't worried about the million dollars.
And the only people that don't worry about a million dollars are the people that have a million dollars.
Only we don't know who hired us for the job.
So... maybe we find out.
I don't know, Charlie.
We did the job, we got paid.
Lee, you're 27 years old.
You got muscles and great brains.
You'll go a long way in this business.
But I'm getting old, my hair is turning grey, and I'm tired of running.
Now, if I had a half a million bucks,
I wouldn't have to run.
Charlie, didn't you say North had a partner down in Miami?
Yeah. It's funny. I was thinking of spending a few days down there.
We could change trains in Chicago.
- I always liked Miami.
- Yeah, it's a nice place.
Just give me a few minutes, will you?
Hey, get outta there.
- We want to talk.
- Well, you'll have to wait.
I'm sorry, uh...
We don't have the time.
What's the pitch?
- North.
- Johnny.
- What's the deal?
- He wants a deal.
No deal.
Now you guys get out...
It won't hurt you to be polite.
Why don't you step in here?
- All right, where is it?
- Where is what?
Where do you keep it?
Here.
- Have a drink.
- It'll loosen you up.
I don't know where Johnny is, what trouble he got into...
He's dead.
- He's dead?
- All the way.
- When?
- A few days ago.
Now what about Johnny North?
- I don't wanna talk about him now.
- Well, we do.
What do you wanna know?
Everything you know.
You were his mechanic.
His partner, 50-50 down the line.
But you split up?
Everybody splits sooner or later.
- When?
- When he couldn't race anymore.
- Why couldn't he race anymore?
- He was in a smash-up.
When was that?
Four years ago, September.
What kind of a guy was he?
I don't know.
I thought I did. He just suddenly went out of his head.
How out of his head?
He was the best natural driver I ever saw, and he couldn't handle a... a situation.
Who were his friends?
You're looking at him.
What was it he couldn't handle?
Dames. The kind that hang around the pits.
Dames or a dame?
- It just takes one.
- This one?
- Hmm?
- Yeah, that's her.
- What's her name?
- Sheila Farr, "the wrecker".
Where can we find her?
- I don't know. Turn over a rock.
- You don't like her?
I've seen a thousand of 'em.
Gotta be where the money is.
Anyone that can handle the wear and tear on her mink coat...
Mmm, nice-looking chick here.
A lot of people thought so.
Big operators. I had eyes.
Think I could get that through to Johnny?
How long did he know her?
He'd met her just before the accident.
Exactly how long?
I don't know exactly how long.
Leave me alone, will you?
Sylvester, unless you want to renew your partnership with the late Johnny North,
I suggest you tell us everything and anything we want to know.
How did he meet her?
It was out in California.
The big race.
We had a good chance.
Johnny was hot, the iron was hot.
I was clocking him.
Isn't it a handicap making him drive with his brakes on?
Are you kidding? That was great time.
A minute 38 flat.
He'll have to do a lot better than that.
- Well?
- The floats still need adjusting.
- The engine's burbling in the corners.
- I'll take a look at her.
- How'd she do?
- Just great. One minute 38 flat.
Hey, that's not bad, you know.
That's not bad...
- That's not bad at all.
- You'll like that one.
She thinks you oughta be entered in a six-day bike race.
- Is that what the lady says?
- That's what the lady says.
Ma'am, you dig fast cars?
Haven't seen any lately, Johnny.
- Oh, you know me?
- I saw you win at Orlando.
You don't think I'm gonna win here.
I can't say I'm too impressed.
- Do you have a name?
- Sheila Farr.
Pretty cool, aren't you, Miss Farr?
Only when there's nothing to be excited about.
Er, have you ever been in one of these?
Nope.
- Think you'd have the guts to?
- Sure.
Earl, lock her up.
You've never ridden in one of these?
No.
Earl, she's never ridden in one of these.
Well now, Johnny, maybe some other time, eh?
- Earl's worried about you, Sheila.
- Oh, thanks, Earl.
- Johnny, I gotta work on her.
- So do I, Earl.
Now hang on tight. This time my wheels are not gonna touch the ground.
Hey, Johnny! Johnny!
Fast enough for you, Miss Farr?
You still think I should be entered in a bike race?
You had no competition.
But I liked it.
- Well, I didn't.
- You'll get over it, Earl.
- You don't scare easy.
- Neither do you.
Why don't you take her out again and twist her wheels off!
- Did you really think you'd scare me?
- You can be scared.
- Would you like to try?
- You're a nutty dame.
I'm also a hungry dame.
Why don't you take me to lunch?
- Your car?
- Mm-hmm.
- Fancy.
- I like things that way.
I bet you do.
All right, I'll take you to lunch.
Slide over.
- Well, I thought I'd drive you this time.
- Slide over. Nobody drives me.
Hey, Johnny! You...
You have money written all over you.
What do you want with me?
- A hamburger and a beer.
- No, no. I'm serious.
You know my story. I'm pretty.
- What does that make me?
- Somebody I admire.
- Somebody I'd like to know.
- Put it in English.
All right. You're a winner, and I don't like losers.
I've been around them all my life.
Little men who cry a lot.
I like you.
Do I have to write a book?
- Do I make you nervous?
- So far, yes.
Oh, come on.
Neither of us scares easily.
We haven't had an opportunity to...
Nothing scares me.
We'll see.
Did I do something wrong?
No, I did.
I, er, raced out of my class.
But then again, I thought
I'd be racing against... if you'll pardon the expression - a lady.
Oh, you don't think I'm a lady?
Let me put it this way:
You got muscles, you got a fat head and you probably have two left feet.
You're too, too kind.
But then I will try to be a lady.
Oh, a lady doesn't have to try.
Oh, what do you say, old buddy?
I'm glad to see you're still in town.
If you're not doing anything tomorrow, how about getting acquainted with our car?
How long has it been?
Three days? Four?
Come on, you don't need me,
I'm nothing but a chauffeur.
There's $15,000 first-place prize money tomorrow.
If that ain't more important than some cheap, thrill-hungry dame...
- Knock it off, will you?
- Kid, I've been around.
I know a dame when I see one.
The makeup, the fancy car...
Watch your mouth, will you?
What is it with guys like you?
"Race the car, rev it up.
Make it go faster, chauffeur.
Bust your neck, chauffeur.
Kill yourself, chauffeur."
Nobody owns me, Earl. You know the trouble with a guy like you?
You don't care if I live or die, as long as I win the race.
And she does?
That's right.
I'm important to that lady...
OK, she's special.
But everything we got is in that car.
Oh, come on, Johnny.
Where are you goin'?
To the moon.
Would it annoy you if I ask you to get back before dawn?
I always get back before dawn!
Pop, you get a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow's gonna be a tough day on you.
I'm sorry, Earl.

Well, I'm giving it serious consideration.
Well, take your time.
Don't rush into anything.
- You're too much.
- So are you.
You're east, west, south... and my North.
That's the trouble. I'm Johnny
North... in a pad like this.
Oh, what difference does a place make?
Plenty. I'm a mechanic.
That's all.
You're a nut.
That's what you are.
I'm a mechanic. I've got good reflexes, so... they let me drive.
I love your reflexes.
No, I mean it now.
I got grease under my fingernails,
I got calluses on my rump... and I got a wallet that wouldn't make a down payment.
Nobody's asking you to.
You're a nut. We're both nuts.
Say I win the race. I still end up with less money than a plumber.
Are you kidding?
You should do so good.
What's the sales tax on this place?
Forget it.
It's none of your business.
Isn't it?
Will you stop talking about it?
Where is the money coming from?
Say I inherited it. Or maybe
I'm a member of the jet set.
Do you think I give a damn about all this?
I've lived in a walk-up.
How do you feel about me?
You don't know?
I want to hear it.
I love you. I love you.
'Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
'and welcome to the first running of the
Western Grand Prix for sports cars.
'This promises to be a very exciting race.
We have a tremendous crowd.
'Over 100,000 people out here with us today.
'The cars are now on their final laps of practice.
'Tremendous action in the pits,
'and we're very fortunate the weather is good for us.
'We've got a good sunny day and very, very minute winds.
'We should have some good action,
'because the winds certainly can hamper the cars...
'if they're blowing at 20 or 30 miles an hour.
'People just jammed all over this raceway.
'Still a few cars left on their final practice laps.
'And we certainly know that this will present some of the finest drivers
'from all over the world, driving equally capable machinery.
'We've got Cobras,
Ferraris, Maseratis,
'Coopers, Lotuses.
'Some of the finest cars.'
Great. Maybe you can catch a few winks during the race.
I never felt better.
In the last four days, what have you had, seven hours sleep?
Pop, you worry too much.
Who's worrying?
I drop 15 grand every day or so.
- You know why we're gonna win this one?
- Outside of the car, clue me.
Because my share of $15,000 is just exactly enough to get married on.
'It is virtually impossible to make a pass as these cars...'
Hi.
Where's your tool kit and your oil can?
You do dig racing, don't you?
No. Just racers and winners.
From a devoted fan.
"Johnny, the winner."
It's a little early, isn't it?
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about the race when I had it engraved.
Never mind saying thank you.
Just kiss me, you fool.
'...down to the finish line, which would complete the first lap.
'And then it just goes on and on, and if you're not on your toes...'
- You find her?
- Naturally.
I figured she'd be here.
Naturally.
- Over in the pits.
- Let's go.
In the pits with the drivers?
There's more action there.
- Take a look at that.
- It's very nice. Come on, Johnny.
- You know my partner, Joe Gloom?
- Good luck, Johnny.
You'd better believe it.
- How's the air pressure?
- 35 in the rear. Front, 42.
'We'll be off and running here in a matter of minutes.'
Miss Farr, he's up against 30 of the hottest drivers in the business, and every one of them is gonna be in better shape than he is, thanks to you.
Well, thank you, Mr Sylvester, but he's a big boy now, and I like him... very much.
'They're bringing the cars up to the starting grid now.
'All these drivers are getting their cars onto the starting grid.
'We'll be off and racing momentarily.
'All the pit crew and well-wishers are down there checking their final checkout...
'the safety of the cars and so on...
'and we certainly have a crowded raceway this weekend.
'Tremendous group of people, the weather's fine,
'and the starter looks like he's ready to start the race.
'We'd like to clear the grid, and momentarily, we're off and running.
'Just a few seconds...
And there they go.'
'Jumping into the lead is car number 98, John North,
'in the Sylvester Cobra, as the rest of these cars get through turn one.
'Through the S's they come.
'Going off the course, Ken Sweet taking evasive action, gets off and on.
'I don't know how he did it, but it was beautifully done.
'Car number 75,
Sweet, back and running.
'All the cars now up on top of the hill.
'Negotiating turn six...'
For a man who's out of shape, he seems to be doing all right.
Easy, boy, easy.
'Off the course at turn 7A, and we're waiting to see now
'if Hammond can get back and running in that yellow Cobra.
'There he goes. Now back and running, car number 96.
'Still in command, North, in car number 98...'
You tell that boy of yours to ease off, Sylvester.
- This is no jalopy derby.
- It won't happen again, sir.
- It better not.
- No, sir.
'Now he's back in traffic.
'He must have lost it just a little in turn nine.
'Now back in command.
North once again in command...
'in the Sylvester Cobra, number 98, running very nicely,
'as are the rest of these cars here today.
'Perfect weather, perfect course conditions.
'Heat just right. Not too much heat, not too little heat.
'Let's see how they do as they negotiate up through the S's once again.
'This is the part of the course that is really dangerous.
'Trying to negotiate a pass as they go through the S's...
'is almost a physical impossibility.'
Miss me, Sheila?
You're not allowed back here.
I'm watching the race.
Is it North?
He looks pretty good out there.
Leave me alone, Jack.
- You're not allowed back here.
- Sure we are.
It's all right, Earl.
This is Jack Browning and Mickey Farmer.
They're, er... They're old friends.
I still don't want anybody in the pit who ain't workin'.
Why don't you stand over by the fence?
You can see all right over there.
See you later.
'Car number 98, the Sylvester Cobra.
'Round turn nine he goes,
'four-wheel drifting that car as he comes around turn nine.
'Beautiful, beautiful to see.
'Now they come back up through the S's once again.
'Sylvester in number 98.
North in the Sylvester Cobra...
'being pressed now by Hammond.
'Hammond being pressed.
'And North coming up to turn six once again, very nicely.
'Now he's in traffic.
He lost it just a little,
'and now he's picking up his traffic between turn six and turn seven.
'He went very hard and fast through those curvy S's.
'Coming wide now.
North getting closer to the bales.
'Wow, that looks like a horse show there.
'See if he gets back and running.
Now he starts to go. He's in gear.
'He's got enough hay in that cockpit...
'I've seen cars go into hay bales, but not with that amount of hay.
'He can't find the gearshift for the hay.
'Down the back chute for turn nine, going very hard and fast.
'Car seems to be vibrating.
He's got wheel trouble.
'Right rear wheel is bent.
'Could be from contact with the hay.
'I think that this man will go into the pit stop.
'The car's starting to shimmy.
He's in the pack.
'His hand goes up, signifying that he is going into the pit area.'
- He's coming in.
- 'A very wise decision.
'That wheel is shimmying something fierce.
'Let's see if they can pull it off, change the wheel,
'or maybe there's something else that's bent or damaged.
'You just never know.
'The rest of the drivers are continuing in the race at a very tremendous pace.
'Get me a new right rear and check the suspension.
'Around the turns they go into seven.
'All cars on the course. Everything moving along very nicely.
'They're working feverishly in the pits to get that North car back and running.
'Let's see what happens.
The rest of the cars now on turn nine.'
It's bad, Johnny. The lower "A" arm is bent. The shook mountings are torn loose.
Bodywork's awful close.
It may rub, Johnny.
All right, baby your right rear, watch it on the right-handers.
'Summoned by his pit boss.
Now he goes.
'Now he's back and running in number 98, the Sylvester Cobra. He's a tiger.
'John North back into the race.
He's got a lot of time to catch up with.
'Smoke is still coming off that right rear wheel.
'Let's see if he can keep going.
He's in the pack now.
'He's got Hammond behind him in number 96.
'Rogers in number 99.
They're going into the S's.
'Let's see if he can make a move here or whether he's going to hold his position.
'I certainly hope he stays where he is.
'Tremendous contention.
Up through the S's they go.
'The race progressing with a tremendous pace.
'North coming very close now.
He's pressing number 244.
'Let's see if he can pass him.
Is he gonna pass him?'
Johnny!
'The car is in the air and continues rolling six, seven times.
'Oh, not that!
The car burst into flames.
'We're watching to see if the driver's OK.
'North gets out of that car, believe it or not,
'staggering away from the car.'
- Johnny!
- Easy, Sheila. You can't help him.
'It's good the wind was blowing, blowing the flames away from him.
'He is dropping.
'This is a race where we should expect an accident of this magnitude.
'Emergency vehicles are being dispatched.
'The ambulance is right here,
'and they are getting to North just as quickly as they can.
'The car is a shambles.
Just looks like a bonfire.
'They're moving North onto the stretcher,
'and they will take him to the hospital.
'We'll certainly get the word back from the hospital as soon as we can
'and let you spectators know what his condition is.'
- Johnny, you all right?
- 'How he walked away from that car...
'I can honestly tell you I don't know.
'But he's on his way to the hospital now,
'and we'll certainly keep you spectators posted.
'We have a tremendous race going.
'It's a fantastic thing that car is where it is.
'It's just unbelievable.
I've never seen anything like it.
'How he got out of that car is...'
Ow!
Anything you want, Johnny?
It's me, Earl.
Ugh... Oh, how long have I been here?
I don't know exactly.
A couple of days, maybe.
How are you feeling?
About medium rare.
I would say you're lookin' good, but I can't see you.
I'm having the same trouble.
I... I talked to the docs.
Everything's knittin' fine.
What about the eyes?
The eyes?
Didn't they tell you anything?
No.
Your eyes are OK.
Thanks, Doc, but my left eye hurts. How bad is it?
They gave me some double-talk about peripheral vision, depth perception.
You know, the insurance jazz.
Bad enough to cause me trouble?
Could be. So what?
So you just don't drive in competition.
- I'm a driver.
- I know, Johnny. The best.
I used to be too, till I tried to shove my foot through an engine block when I piled up.
It happens to most of us, Johnny.
You knew that when you got started.
One thing you gotta remember .:
Half the shop is yours.
We're gonna build the hottest irons in the world. Between the two of us...
Between the two of us.
Has she been here, Earl?
You're sure a glutton for punishment, aren't you?
- Have you seen her?
- I've seen her.
I figured I would've heard from her.
Some people, they just can't stand hospitals.
You know that?
I'll tell you what I know, and you might as well know it too, right now.
She don't belong to you, Johnny.
She never did.
There's a guy named Jack Browning.
What kind of a guy?
A guy that's got it made.
Pays all the bills.
He just snaps his fingers and she comes running.
- You're a liar! You're a liar, Earl!
- Take it easy.
Johnny, I checked it out.
I talked to him.
In Mexico, it was a bullfighter.
In New York, a boxer.
In California, a racer named Johnny North.
But she always goes back to him.
You just gotta get it through your head, kid.
You were for kicks. That's all.
I'm sorry, Johnny.
- Maybe I'm different.
- All right, Sheila liked you.
How well is she gonna like you when she sees you with a pound of grease in your hair workin' on somebody else's car?
- Get outta here, Earl.
- Johnny, it ain't the end of the world.
Earl, get outta here, will you?
Hi, Johnny.
You know, they wouldn't let me in to see you.
Yeah, sure, sure.
What are you wearing today?
Mink? Beaver, maybe?
Hey, what's the matter?
Just take a good look.
This is what a loser looks like.
I don't care what you look like.
You don't, huh?
You want the other guy to sign the cheques.
You keep me around for kicks.
Maybe I could be your chauffeur.
You know what they say about fancy dames and their chauffeurs, don't you?
Johnny, I know how you must feel.
I feel great. I feel smart.
I had to get my eyes boiled before I could see. I'm not a toy!
I don't wanna be just something to do... until something better comes along.
What has he been telling you?
Who? Earl?
Earl never tells me anything, except about boxers and bullfighters.
Maybe next time it'll be a football player.
This Browning of yours must be a very understanding man.
Johnny, I never lied to you.
What difference does it make whether you lied to me or you didn't?
As long as Old Faithful is there with his cheque book.
As long as you could get your kicks.
What do you think I am?
You don't know? Then ask Browning.
He oughta know.
He's paying for it.
Oh, man.
I never saw him again.
I heard things.
He never had a prayer passin' his physicals.
So he bootlegged a couple of races under another name, and they caught him.
I heard he worked the pits and cheap county fairs.
Then I didn't hear anything... till today.
Is that all?
You said Johnny was dead.
How'd he die?
Johnny North choked to death on one question... too many.
- You got to eat, Charlie.
- Thank you.
You know how many proteins you oughta have every day?
Not starch. Proteins, I mean.
Do you know how many?
So we didn't find out anything.
We're in Florida here, aren't we?
Right here.
Well, maybe... maybe Pete'll call.
It's a long shot. But I used to know Mickey Farmer.
No, I think we dead-ended, Lee.
Here, do you want my steak?
It's a fine steak.
Fine. We come 1,000 miles for a fine steak.
- It's a fine steak.
- Fine.
Excuse me, Mr Strom.
I have a call for you.
All right. Hello?
Yeah. Yeah, Pete.
Yeah, that's the one.
Oh, good. Good.
No, no. I just thought it was the same Farmer.
OK, buddy boy. Thanks.
Mickey's running a gymnasium up in New Orleans.
Charlie, if he was in on a million-dollar job, he might give us some trouble, you know.
He knows me.
I had to lean on him once.
You know 'em all, don't you?
You never know 'em all.
Hey, I bet you'd eat everything in the place. Give me my steak back.
Charlie, there's only a slim chance North could tie in with him. You know that.
- Slim chance or no, we're gonna find out.
- For a million bucks.
No, it's not only the money.
Maybe we got that and maybe we don't.
But I gotta find out what makes a man decide not to run.
Why all of a sudden he'd rather die.
Inhale down.
Exhale.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Now do that for about ten counts.
Boy, you sure don't need that.
Well, gentlemen, thinking of getting yourself in shape?
You certainly came to the right place.
Now, take you, sir.
You look a little anaemic.
A couple of months of regular exercise... and you'll be in great condition.
- You talk a lot, don't you?
- Mickey Farmer.
Oh, excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a hustling business.
Mr Farmer's in there, taking a steam.
A couple of gentlemen to see you, Mr Farmer.
What's the matter? They can't wait?
- All right, muscles, back to work.
- Hello, Mickey.
- What d'ya say, Charlie? Long time no see.
- Yeah.
- I'm just gettin' outta here in...
- Sit right there.
Just relax.
We wanna talk to you.
- Is this the control for that thing?
- Yeah. Why?
We ran over an old friend of yours.
Johnny North.
North? Friend of mine?
Johnny North. He used to drive.
Oh, yeah, yeah. That North.
I seem to remember him now.
- I think I met him once.
- That's funny.
We heard he got away with a big bundle, and we thought maybe some of it belonged to you.
- Did you find it?
- Did you lose it?
We wanna know all about the big job.
If you don't wanna lose a lot of weight in a hurry, you better...
Fellas, hey. Come on, huh? Please?
Please.
- Please!
- You were in on the big job.
Who else?
Well, there was... There was me and there was... Jack Browning and...
George Flemming and...
Johnny North.
- How'd North figure?
- Hey, look.
I worked hard on that job, you know.
If I tell you everything...
Mickey, you will tell us everything.
Well, Jack... Jack's dame wanted him to take her to the... to the track, you know, where these old heaps just bat each other around.
'Baker's in front with number 32, Farnsworth, running second.
'Hanson is third. And coming up fast on the outside it's the preacher!
'The preacher is hotter than a baker's oven, comin' in real hot.
'Now into the turn... the first turn... the preacher goes high and wide.
'Hold on and... Whoa, Nellie!
'Up to the wall and off, and the preacher's still in fourth place.
'Baker again in the chute. Driving hard on the outside is Farnsworth.
'Coming into that wing, movin' in there tight.
'Pulling in there again, the preacher comes on.
'And it's Baker coming down.
Baker is signalling...'
I should've stayed in the hotel and slept.
Fresh air'll do ya good, Mickey.
You look a little peaked.
- I'll be right back.
- That'll be nice.
You know, Jack, I know you got a real thing about her, but there ain't a dame alive that can drag me to a mess like this.
- She likes races.
- So do I!
But, I mean, horses.
A daily double.
Mickey, you should learn to enjoy the simple things in life.
There are two kinds of kooks - the ones that race these wrecks and the ones that watch 'em.
'Take those cars off the track.
Let's get ready for the next event.
'Come on. Let's get it on the road down there, you stewards.
'Get busy. You boys in the pits, warm those cars up. Get 'em outta there.'
'All right. Come on, now.
'Line up. Remember, once you get in there, stop your engines.
'Ladies and gentlemen, give these drivers a round of applause.'
Hello, Johnny.
You could say hello.
Are you surprised to see me?
I didn't think you'd enjoy this sort of thing.
I don't, but I heard you were here.
Johnny, you're too good for this... this show.
Then get away from me and you won't see me.
How's your friend Browning?
He's a friend.
'The Disaster Derby.'
That's me.
Is there some place
I can get in touch with you?
Slim's Garage down the road knows where I'll be.
There's something coming up.
May be a spot for a good driver.
Oh... I'm always interested in a good job.
- Then I'll call you.
- Fine.
Better luck this time.
Here comes George.
OK, start timing.
He sees the sign.
Waits.
Backs up.
Now he turns into this road.
Let him get outta sight.
Give him five seconds.
Then Mickey and I jump out, grab the detour sign, cut this road off.
That'll take maybe a minute, all told.
The mail truck takes three minutes to get to where George and the other car will be.
That means we've gotta get back there in close to two.
That's a tough road to make in two minutes.
- I think I can handle it.
- Then you better get started.
What's the matter with you, George?
I told you to keep it at 25 all the way.
- That's where I kept it.
- Hey, Jack.
If we can't catch up with that truck and pass him by the time he gets this far, we're in real trouble.
- What was my time?
- Just a whole minute behind schedule.
You've got to face it, Jack. You're not driver enough. What we need is a pro.
Anyone in mind?
- Johnny North, for instance?
- He could do it.
What's more, he could hop the car up and easily pass the truck before we get here.
She's got a good point there, Jack.
Are you sure you're just thinking of the success of the job?
That's all I'm thinking about.
Talk to him.
If you can get him in with his eyes open and his mouth shut, I'll meet with him.
Yeah?
Hi.
Oh.
Is that all I get after all the trouble I had running you down?
If I knew you were coming,
I would've set fire to the place.
Why didn't you return my calls?
- Oh. Did you call?
- You know I did. Five times.
And don't tell me you didn't get my messages. I know better.
I'm glad to see you.
I'm sorry you came.
I've missed you.
- What do you want?
- A guy.
The same guy I wanted the first time I saw you.
That guy is dead.
That guy was so in love with you he couldn't see straight.
You're somebody else's girl now, or didn't he tell you that?
You didn't tell me. All right, so I like nice things, expensive things.
- Doesn't everybody? I can do without.
- Yeah, sure, sure you can.
I'm doing without you, and I don't like it.
Johnny, am I worth anything?
I always thought I was when I was with you.
You said you had a job for me.
As far as you're concerned, that's all I'm interested in.
Strictly business?
That's right. Strictly business.
Would you drive?
It's dangerous.
Now I don't understand that.
Would $100,000 make you understand?
- What are you mixed up in?
- I'm mixed up in you.
Drive one more time. One more race.
If you win, you win $100,000.
Who do I race?
The police.
Some people I know need the best driver in the world.
Johnny, don't send me away.
I want you to mean this.
I've always meant it.
I want you.
I'll fill you in on all the details if you can handle this job.
Until I'm sure, you don't get word one.
- That way, nobody gets hurt.
- Suits me.
The actual truck keeps a 25-mile speed all the time.
I don't know whether it can keep it up on this side road.
Truck'll corner better than most passenger cars.
I'll tell you when to go.
We wait a few seconds.
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.
If you're as hot a driver as Sheila says you are, you'll find out soon enough.
OK, Flash, show me what you can do.
A minute and 32 seconds.
All right. If you want in, you're in.
But you're in all the way, understand?
You can push a car, I'll say that.
She handles like a barge.
Let me nail down the shocks, work the box over, and I'll cut another 15 seconds off the time.
You can start right away.
I'll fill you in tonight.
Here comes George.
- Think he knows what he's doin' there?
- He'd better.
Come on, you...
- Hi.
- Where's Jack?
My, Mickey, aren't you the worrier?
What d'you say, old pal, old buddy?
Hi.
- How's it coming?
- We'll win the race.
I believe it.
You look great.
You look familiar.
Johnny.
Can I see you for a minute?
Now, take it easy, Johnny.
Jack's funny about things he owns.
- So am I.
- Just a word to the wise, kid.
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, sure. I know what you mean. Sure.
All right, we'll go over it one more time.
Are you sure you can concentrate on dry business details, Mr North?
Oh, we've gone over this before.
And we'll go over it again... and again.
North and I wait here in the car in uniform.
At 10:43, we place the detour signs here.
The mail truck'll be along at 10:45, give or take a minute.
As soon as it's outta sight, we move the signs from here to here, cutting off the country road.
Mickey?
Er, at exactly 10:46, George and me fake an accident here.
When we get there, we block the northbound lane so the mail truck can't pass.
They see an accident, the police car, they stop and we grab them.
- What happens to the drivers?
- I approve of larceny.
Homicide is against my principles.
Keep that in mind, Mickey.
We'll wrap 'em up safe and sound, Jack. Don't worry.
Just be sure.
We transfer the registered sacks to my car. North and I take off.
How do we know how much money'll be in the truck?
We don't, exactly.
The truck picks up the weekend receipts from the resorts up the coast.
It averages over a million. The whole job shouldn't take more than two minutes.
Then we drive the truck and the drivers into the woods... and get rid of all the fingerprints.
Then we meet at Curley's in Ridgeview on Friday.
OK. How's your end of it going?
Fine, fine.
She'll do what I want her to.
I'm talking about the car.
So what? What's the point?
I like what you're doing with the car.
Just stick with that.
You get back to the hotel and stay there.
- I like it here.
- Go on. Get moving.
I said... I like it here.
Well, I can change that in a hurry.
You touch her again, I'll kill ya!
After the job, we'll settle this, North.
Let's settle it now!
- OK.
- Let him go.
I know we agreed not to meet again after we make the split.
I'm willing to make an exception in your case.
Sheila, my car is outside.
I'll see you later, Johnny.
- I meant what I said.
- You worry about the car.
- Hey, what's up?
- Beats me, buddy. Some kinda roadwork.
Oh, boy. That's just great.
I got a schedule to keep in Evansburg.
It won't take you much longer on a detour.
But I'm late already.
Look, Officer, a lot depends on this.
Well, I tell ya what.
We just put the signs up.
They probably haven't started yet.
Let him through, Eddie.
But keep movin', or you may have to sleep in there somewhere tonight.
Don't worry, Officer.
Thanks a lot.
Here he comes.
Right on schedule.
I'll do all the talkin'.
What is it this time?
Who knows? They're always tearin' up something.
Look, you can hit the state highway seven miles through there.
Turn right, it'll take you right back into this one.
We've gone that way before.
It's a lousy road.
- How long will this be closed?
- Couple of weeks, I hear.
Swell. Thanks, Officer.
Hey! Just hold on a minute.
Get 'em outta the way!
You're holdin' up the U.S. Mail!
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Put your hands up!
- Turn off the red light.
- Yeah.
- Clean as a whistle.
- Yeah.
- You did all right.
- Thanks.
- Pretty good pay for half an hour's work.
- Open that door.
Go ahead!
I said open that door!
- And that's the truth. I swear it.
- How do you know it's the truth?
You weren't even there when North took off.
George and me picked Browning up maybe five minutes later.
Man, he was all ripped up.
Where's Browning now?
Browning? I don't know. California someplace, I think. I don't know.
After the caper blew, we all kinda broke up.
How about George?
He's dead. He got shot in a liquor store job.
How 'bout that?
We had our hands on over a million, he gets knocked off pickin' up a few bucks to eat on.
Mickey, if I were you,
I'd forget that this ever happened.
I'd forget that we were here.
I'd forget everything.
You have a very nice place here, so why don't you live to enjoy it?
Yeah, but if you're on to something...
Mickey.
OK, Charlie.
I forgot all about it.
Then there's no sweat, Mickey.
No sweat...
No sweat.
Yes?
'A Mr Strom and another gentleman to see you, sir.'
Mr Strom? I don't know any
Mr Strom. What's it about?
'Tell him that we're friends of a Mr John North.'
'They say they're friends of Mr John North.'
It's all right, Miss Leslie.
Close the door.
Very nice, Mr Browning.
Very nice, indeed.
I always like to see a man get ahead in this world.
If you have business with me...
Yeah, we've got business with you.
Johnny North lives very modestly, erm, for a man of his means.
- Johnny North?
- Lee, I think he's catching on.
Um-hmm.
We hit Johnny North last week.
Then we had a long talk with Mickey Farmer.
George Flemming is dead.
You know who that leaves?
You and the dame.
And a missing million bucks.
- Oh, and, er, me and my partner.
- Mm-hmm.
"Browning Development Corporation."
You've come a long way... from being an ex-mail robber.
I'm makin' out.
But I've done it the hard way. Would you like to take a look at my books?
Which set?
We don't read well.
You said you hit North.
Was it a contract?
That's right.
Why? Who bought it?
We figure you did, Jack.
Are you crazy?
Sure, I wanted North.
He double-crossed me and made off with the whole bundle.
And maybe I would've killed him if I could've laid my hands on him.
But first I'd have gotten my money back.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Where's the, erm, Sheila Farr dame?
You boys dug deep.
I don't know where she is.
You better find out, Jack.
Did you see her after the job?
Sure, I did. At Ridgeview.
Her and Mickey and George.
Only when she found out that...
Johnny'd gotten away with the money, she blew up and took off.
- My, my.
- And you were the number one brain.
It didn't sound funny to you that she throws you over... right when she needs a meal ticket?
Johnny North runs off with a million dollars.
He's got eyes for her, and from what
I hear, she's got eyes for him.
You must've landed on your head when you got kicked out of that car, Jack.
Otherwise, you'd put two and two together, you know.
- You think that cheap little...
- We don't think anything, Jack.
- Where is she?
- Now wait a minute, you...
You wait!
You wait... and you think.
The last I heard, she was stayin' at some hotel here in town.
Have her call us here in four hours.
Four hours?
- She may not even be in town anymore.
- She'd better be.
Listen, you boys are leaning on me pretty hard.
Jack, we've hit guys for a lot less than a million. You know that.
Now, just tell her to do what we said.
- I'll do what I can.
- That's good. Oh, and by the way, when you talk to her, would you pass this on?
"You try to get cute with us...
"And don't try to run.
"Nobody can."
If I were you, I'd get hot.
You already lost a minute.
You think Browning was giving us the straight goods?
That depends on whether the phone rings or not.
I figure if we worry her enough to call, that she's got somethin' to worry about.
Yeah, but what do you think?
I mean, what's your guess?
Will she call?
I would. But I'm not a dame.
Yeah.
Anyplace you say, lady.
Sure.
Your hotel tonight at 9:00?
Fine. You're smart, lady.
We'll get along just fine.
What are ya...
What, are ya losin' your marbles?
You're asking for a setup.
I like to give 'em that feeling of confidence.
She won't be expecting us for another six hours.
Oh, Charlie.
Charlie.
You're always on top, aren't you, Charlie?
I'm still alive.
Gentlemen?
Do you have a Miss
Sheila Farr registered?
Er, yes, sir. She's in 725.
- Just checked in?
- A couple of hours ago.
Thank you.
Who is it?
Just a minute.
- What do you want?
- He's Charlie. I'm Lee.
You weren't supposed to come until 9:00.
That's right. We're early.
- Now see here...
- Shut up and sit down.
Charlie, Charlie!
Don't bruise her, Charlie.
She's got a lot of class.
All right.
You've proved you can be rude.
- Now what do you want?
- The money.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Nobody ever knows what we're talking about, Charlie.
A man stood still while we burned him... and I'd like to know why.
Now I figure if you phoned us after talking to Browning, then maybe you had some answers.
And also, you might know where the money is, since nobody else seems to.
Jack must have told you what happened to the money.
Yeah. Browning says that, er, you have it.
I'll tell you what.
I'll make a deal with you.
You throw the bundle to us, and we'll make sure Mr Browning never disturbs you again. Fair enough?
I tell you, I don't have the money.
What did you say? Where is it?
Can't you get it through your heads?
Johnny North took it.
He slugged Jack and got away clean.
- You mean he struck him?
- He certainly told you about it.
Well... Struck him, eh?
I wonder. I...
- Kinda...
- Oh! Oh!
I don't like your story, lady.
- Would you tell me another one, please?
- I tell you, it's true.
That's exactly what happened.
If... Johnny didn't have the money, then it's lost.
Nobody ever loses a million dollars.
Throw her out.
That's a long way down, Charlie.
Maybe she can remember the truth on the way.
Shut up, lady! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up sweet!
I wanna set you straight, because you got it all wrong. This is no game.
Now I want the truth, or so help you God, you're goin' out that window express.
Do you understand that?
The night before the robbery,
I went to Johnny's room.
- What's the matter?
- Jack'd kill me if he knew I were here.
After the hold-up, they're planning to cut you out.
It was Jack's idea, but Mickey and George went along with him.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get to them before they get to me.
No, Johnny. Listen, they'll just...
They'll kill you!
What do you want me to do?
Stand there and take it?
Wait a minute! Now just wait a second. Come here.
I was thinking on the way over.
The way he's got it planned, there'll be just the two of you in the getaway car.
That's right. Just the two of us.
And more than a million dollars.
- It'll be dangerous.
- Living is dangerous.
Promise me you won't kill him.
I'm not a killer.
I love you, Johnny.
So much.
- Did it go all right?
- Did it go all right? Take a look.
Johnny.
Oh, Johnny!
Johnny! Johnny!
We did it.
- Have you got the clothes?
- In the car.
Where do we go from here?
And by tomorrow night, we'll reach that motel I told you about.
And nobody'll find us. Nobody.
From now on, kid,
I take orders strictly from you.
Oh, man. Let's go.
Thank you, baby.
Mickey and George are gonna be lookin' for you.
Get it over with, Jack.
Well, we can't waste any more time.
- We got the money. Let's get outta here.
- What about him?
He'll find a hole someplace.
I'll put some people on him.
They'll catch up with him sooner or later.
What if we botch it up again?
It won't be botched this time.
Come on, baby. Let's go.
At least you're all right.
Thank God.
Jack finally ran him down where he was working and... and then he hired you.
Thank you, lady.
It, er, doesn't bother me anymore.
What doesn't?
Why he just stood there when we...
You see, the only man that's not afraid to die... is the man that's dead already.
And you killed him four years ago.
You didn't need us.
Charlie, offhand, I would say
Browning tried to cross us.
- Yeah, it looks that way.
- We gotta do something about that.
That's right, we have to take care of that.
Lady, would you get dressed?
We're leaving.
Where are we going?
We're gonna visit Jack Browning.
What's your name these days, by the way? Mrs Browning?
- Yes.
- I thought so.
Now get in there and change, eh?
- Sheila?
- I'll be right there.
Bring my briefcase!
- Did you get them?
- I got one. I'm not sure about the other.
I was never so scared in my life.
They almost killed me.
I'm sorry, but it's all right now, baby.
Come on. We've got to hurry.
Don't bother.
Oh, God.
I... I told you you couldn't run.
Please.
I... I didn't want to.
He made me do it.
I couldn't help myself.
Please.
I... didn't want to have anything to do with it.
I... I had no choice.
Lady, I don't have the time.
No. No.
George Radcliffe, please.
Silence.
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give... shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Mr. Radcliffe, you are a citizen of the United States, are you not?
Yes, I am.
And you have been living in London how many years?
About five.
During which you have been and still are... an executive of the Jason Roote
Air Freight Corporation.
An employee, Sales Manager.
Mr. Radcliffe, on the night of
Wednesday 1st September... you were in the offices of Jason
Roote's Air Freight Corporation?
Yes.
You had been asked to work overtime?
No, I was doing personal work.
You had not been asked to work overtime?
Employees never worked overtime unless they volunteered.
It was company policy.
Did you know that evening an unusually large sum of cash... would be turned in by drivers who had made COD collections that day?
Anyone who'd been in the main office during the day could've known.
Anyone?
How, anyone?
Daily shipment information was posted on a bulletin board.
And anyone reading that board would've known... that over *60 000 in cash would be on the premises that evening?
Anyone who could decipher the code we use.
The man who posts those listings would have to know the code.
Yes.
Would you tell us who, on Wednesday 1st September... was in charge of posting?
Donald Heath.
Would you speak a littlle louder?
Donald Heath.
So, on the evening of
Wednesday 1st September... there were three known persons on the premises.
Yourself, the deceased and Donald Heath... an otherwise disinterested employee... prone to error and absenteeism who, on that particular evening... had volunteered to work overtime.
It had nothing to do with money...
I had to try and make it up,
I was trying to catch up.
Silence.
Mr. Roote and yourself were aware of one another's presence?
Yes, he dropped in my office.
Did Donald Heath also drop in?
No.
No.
Mr. Radcliffe, you saw Donald Heath at his desk in the main office.
Yes.
Did you speak to him?
No. His desk was at the far end... and when I passed through, he was bent over as if...
You did not pause as you passed?
No, I went right to my office.
I'd run out to get a sandwich.
I knew I wouldn't be gettling home till pretty late.
As I was coming back, I remembered
I hadn't called my wife... to say I wouldn't be home for dinner.
I wanted to call her quickly, to tell her to eat and to apologise.
As I started dialling,
I heard Roote call me.
Is that you, Cliff?
It could not have been
Donald Heath?
He wouldn't call me Cliff.
Martha, guess who didn't come home for dinner tonight?
I have to work over my market reports from the States.
One of these days you'll lose your pants.
Not me, I use my wife's money.
You Americans have no scruples about your wives going without pants.
I don't know. A couple of hours, maybe less than that.
I always like you to wait up.
Bye.
Had your supper?
I had a sandwich.
I had to wait for those CODs.
Did they come?
Would you like to help me count them?
See how it feels to stand in cash up to your...
Don't rub my nose in it.
Come in and have a drink before you go.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey!
Heath!
Help!
Help, officer!
Stop him, he killed a man!
Officer!
You pursued the man, you caught him.
Thank you, Mr. Radcliffe.
Mr. Radcliffe, when you came upon
Mr. Heath... down in the boiler room, did he have anything in his hands?
Yes.
Would you tell the court?
A bottlle.
He was not holding a satchel containing *60 000?
No.
Thank you.
No doubt you've become aware during the trial... that the boiler room was searched and searched again and again... but neither the satchel nor the *60 000 were ever found.
Yes.
Yet you are certain the man you saw... run from the office of the deceased, a satchel in his hand... and the man you came upon concealed in the boiler room... a bottlle in his hand... you are absolutely certain that these were one and the same man?
Yes.
Please, think carefully.
You could in no way be mistaken?
There was no one else there.
The officer and I made sure of that.
I don't know what happened to the money.
Forgive me. I'd no intention of ruffling you.
But do you not think it possible that the man with the satchel... entered the boiler room and went out through another exit... while Heath had been down there... for the whole time of the robbery and the murder?
Might not such an explanation be possible?
No.
Well, you may as well step down.
You didn't have to come, Martha.
The jury is taking a long time.
It's the money that's worrying them.
Even in the Old Bailey you can't get away from money worries.
I wonder what he did with it.
Why doesn't he give it up?
It might mean his life.
It's the only thing that could make a man give up that kind of money.
Your shoulder?
Quite a deal.
This could be it, Martha.
Who is he?
My future partner.
If nothing goes wrong.
Yes, sir, we have.
We find the defendant... guilty.
No.
No, I swear to God.
You've got it all wrong.
Radcliffe!
Radcliffe!
God in Heaven, Radcliffe!
Please, tell them the truth.
You know I didn't do it.
- You know.
- Silence.
Sorry.
Tell them, Radcliffe. It wasn't me.
It must've been you.
It was you, Radcliffe!
I didn't do it, it was him.
He did it!
You did it, Radcliffe!
It was you, Radcliffe!
Cliff, let's go home.
Martha, if you don't mind, I want to take a look at something. I...
I want you to see it too.
Now, there it is.
That whole string of buildings beginning with the dark one... all the way over to where that white ship is.
That's what I meant when I said "quite a deal".
It now belongs to International
Freight Forwarding... but if we can pull off this deal...
We?
Morris Brooke, the fellow I talked with in court today.
He's in a position to...
He can take over International, but he needs someone to put up...
Wait here a minute, will you?
What do you want?
Why do you ask?
You were following me.
You were in Court.
Yes, I have been following you.
Why?
Simply drawn, Mr. Radcliffe.
Irresistibly.
What are you?
That warms it.
It's been years since anyone cared enough about Jerry Clay to ask.
I'm a counsellor-at-law.
Take it, it's worthless.
The bar "retired" me.
What do you want?
To thank you for your superb performance in court today.
How admirably you told your tale... standing there like truth carved in brass.
No. My interest is purely professional.
They can't retire a man's interest.
No, that they cannot, Mr. Radcliffe.
Reduce me to earning an honest living, as a handyman... they can do.
But reduce my interest in...
In what?
What does a man do, after he condemns another to life imprisonment?
Does he take tea?
Go to church? Make love?
I've this compulsion to watch a man's behaviour at such a time.
You might call me an intellectual peeping tom.
Cliff!
Some kind of a nut!
Did you hear what he said?
You looked about to kill him.
What did he say?
Nothing.
You're cold?
I'm warm now, with your arms around me.
Are you tired of living the way we live?
No.
You don't mind always going without everything?
I have some things.
We're talking about different kinds of having.
I've never minded being without what you call everything.
I have.
Yes, I know.
It's almost over.
This being without.
Thanks to International and Morris Brooke.
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for this chance?
All those years in the States after the war with nothing happening.
Coming over here and more nothing.
That man Brooke.
You said he needs someone with a certain amount of money?
And a knowledge of the freight business.
You have the knowledge.
And the money. I haven't been playing the stock market... just to be playing with something.
Has something good happened?
I've made a killing.
I've put your plane ticket in your briefcase.
As usual, Mr. Colettle will meet you at Orly.
The conference is at
25 Rue d'Astarge.
I've put it in your notebook, along with some other reminders.
What's this name?
Castor. As in oil.
He's the bandit who's making this air freight sector meeting necessary.
I put "skids" beside his name, meaning put them under him... before he undersells you and all your competitors.
Good evening, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Incidentally, you were dissatisfied with your hotel last year.
No, the year before. Was that just because Mrs. Radcliffe wasn't along?
How do you remember every littlle thing I tell you?
You pay me well.
Mrs. Radcliffe isn't going?
I'll just be gone a couple of days.
I didn't leave you a reminder to send her flowers.
You don't have to remind me to do that.
I know.
I have that kind of wife.
She has that kind of husband.
Happy night out, darling.
Well, have I forgottlen one of our anniversaries?
Miss Osborne wouldn't let you.
I gave her a complete list, the very day you hired her.
I add to it from time to time.
You look mighty special tonight.
Something on?
No, pure lark.
Care to indulge me?
Is that a crow's foot near your left eye?
Take me somewhere elegant and dim and tell me it isn't.
I was kidding about the crow's foot but you do look a littlle...
Are you upset underneath all that finery?
Oh, no. No, no.
I'll wait until you finish up, then we'll go for dinner...
Then ride home. Relax and read about world tension...
I've got to go through this before we leave.
Miss Osborne...
Cliff. Have you read this story?
I haven't seen the news.
They've been talking about it on TV all day.
They've even shown films of the place it was found abandoned.
What was found?
A mailbag, full of lettlers.
One of the bags stolen in that train robbery five years ago, remember?
The bag was untouched.
They assume the thieves hid it and never got back to it.
Do you know what the postal authorities did?
The lettlers were all perfect, unopened.
They simply marked them "delayed" and sent them on.
Very British. Miss Osborne, send a wire to the Merchant Bank...
Cliff.
One of those lettlers was for you.
Did you bring it?
No.
Why not?
Are you going to be angry?
Because you've opened it?
Cliff, I resisted for hours, but there it was... and the newscasters were drumming about it... and it was addressed to our old place.
What was it, a bill?
No. No, it was very personal.
Check that, before you claim it's been paid. I may be mistaken.
It was about the murder,
Jason Roote's murder.
Where is it?
I threw it away.
Where?
I thought the first thing you would ask is why?
In the waste basket in your room.
Alright, why?
Because of what it said.
What did it say, Martha?
"Radcliffe, you killed Jason Roote.
I have no feelings for Heath, let him rot... but I do feel for that *60 000 you helped yourself to.
My feeling should be worth get it to me within 10 days or I will go to the police."
Signed by Jeremy Clay,
Box 211, London.
I think you believe it.
Cliff, don't even joke.
It's nothing but blackmail.
Who's the clown that found the mailbag?
He threatened to go to the police if he didn't hear from you... but you never got the lettler so he couldn't... and he obviously didn't go to the police.
He didn't write again or call, did he?
This is really bothering you, isn't it?
No, no.
Well, yes, a littlle bit.
I'm not in the habit of gettling lettlers... saying my husband is a thief and a murderer.
You didn't receive this one.
Anyway, I figured out the dates, they prove that it isn't true.
The trial was six years ago, the robbery, five.
So, the lettler was writtlen a year after the trial.
If this blackmailer knew about you, why did he wait so long?
If he knew I was a thief and a murderer?
Cliff, please! He waited because at the time of the trial... you had nothing to be blackmailed for!
There was no reason to think you'd stolen the money.
And killed Roote.
Then, he must have read about you and
Morris buying out International... and figured...
And figured I'd mourned Roote... then used his cash to buy this big plush world we live in.
It was about a year after the trial, wasn't it Martha?
And they never did find the money... and that puts me smack in the middle of one hell of a coincidence.
Yes Cliff, but that's all it is, isn't it? A coincidence.
A hell of a coincidence.
Dinner at the club all right?
Yes, of course.
Will we have to wait?
Your usual table is...
I'm sorry we didn't expect you tonight.
Would 35 minutes do?
We'll wait in the bar.
Would you care to...
Thank you.
The usual.
You're not going to let a lettler spoil your dinner, are you?
Let's not talk about it anymore.
I threw away the lettler, you got rid of the spool...
I think we'd bettler go home and talk more about it.
Mr. Radcliffe.
The drinks.
Well, hi!
Your old friend Mrs. Harris would love you to join us... at the dark end of the bar.
I'm St John.
Lilly's here.
We were just...
Let's say hello, she'd be awfully hurt...
Shattlered! But never show it.
She shattlers only internally like a mind.
Darling!
Nobody told me you two were free tonight!
How are things in paradise?
Did you meet my Mr. St John?
Manfridi, these are my Radcliffes
George and Martha, buy them drinks.
We have...
Manny's my latest young man.
I support him while he writes his ponderous plays... in return he keeps me from going old... while my husband does the diplomatic circuit.
Have you heard from him lately?
Only by cheque.
Isn't it terrible of me?
I love having everyone suspect everything.
Do you think I do it to feel superior?
Knowing I'm innocent... and watching all those inferior people suspect the worst.
Suspicious people are inferior, aren't they?
Not all, not to begin with anyway.
Believe it or not, I'm innocent.
I've just been gettling Manny to write... one of those angry dramas about young people... fighting out problems on a mussed bed.
I deplore anger!
The most I allow myself is petulance.
Admittledly, it's feminine... but feminine emotions are easier to understand.
Don't you agree, Mr. Radcliffe?
I don't know, my wife doesn't get emotional often.
Be quiet, Manny, buy me a drink.
Should we dine together?
Just the four of us?
We were just on our way home.
Just the three of us.
Cliff's going to Paris in the morning.
Your not going?
No.
Well, we'll do a bit of shopping together. I'll call for you at 10.
While we're shopping you can tell me about all this.
Night.
Going already?
Good night, Mr. Saint John.
St John.
Trouble in paradise...
Why didn't you call me as soon as you read it?
Read what, Cliff?
That lettler that accuses me...
Really!
I'd forgottlen all about it.
You had the lettler memorised you must've read it over and over.
Why didn't you call me?
I didn't think I should read a thing like that over the phone.
Martha, look at me.
Look.
Do you really think...?
Of course not.
You're my husband and I love you.
You couldn't be a murderer!
Because you love me?
I couldn't love you, if you were guilty.
You couldn't think I was guilty, if you loved me.
I love you!
Good evening, Betty.
Martha.
The lettler gave you a shock.
If not, you'd have called and we'd have laughed...
Yes, I know.
That's the way I wanted to feel.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't funny.
If anyone got hold of it...
No one will, let's never mention it again, let's forget it.
No, we won't forget it. Until your convinced that it's a rottlen...
I am convinced.
You convinced me.
Martha. This whole business has been dead for years.
Even the fellow who wrote the lettler never followed it through.
It's all dead.
You've got to kill it too.
Should I go to the police about it?
Blackmailers have a terrible edge.
Whatever they say, everybody believes it just a littlle bit.
What would that suspicion do to me?
My business, my life, everything...
I'm not going to let it happen.
Nobody's going to let that happen.
Understand that.
Martha.
Cliff, you have to be up early.
You know how we are when we start talking.
All at once it's morning.
We never did get around to dinner.
I'm not hungry.
Why don't I bring up some sandwiches we'll sit and talk and...
No. Cliff, please I...
I can't.
I can't believe this.
We've been married too many years, we know everything about each other.
Could a woman live with a man sleep with him... and not know he's a murderer?
Do murderer's make love differently?
Cliff.
Cliff, I'm sorry.
And your right.
I'd know, somehow.
Come to bed.
If you doubt me now, you've doubted me for a long time.
Maybe, since I made all that money.
Maybe before that, since the trial.
No.
George Radcliffe, please.
What's the mattler, Martha?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I have that work to finish up.
I think I'll sleep in the study so I won't disturb you.
Jeremy Clay.
Clay, Clay...
Information? Do you have a listing for a Jeremy Clay?
Thank you for the information.
Good night.
You've cut yourself.
Why don't you use an electric razor?
My father gave me this on my 13th birthday.
Did you need it at that age?
I've always more than my share of those male things, hormones.
Yes, I've noticed that often.
Anyone hearing us make this small talk would think we'd slept together.
Are you packed?
Last night.
Didn't you work?
I'll try on the plane.
I didn't go to sleep right away,
I almost called you... but I thought you were working.
I heard you on the phone.
You want to know who I called, don't you?
I wanted to last night.
I'm not very proud of it.
You're acting like a wife who has just begun to suspect a mistress.
Only your suspicions are worse.
My suspicions?
Aren't you? Suspicious?
I don't know.
If I'm acting like I am... it must mean I am.
At least a littlle.
You can't be a littlle suspicious.
It's like virginity, you either are, or aren't.
I'll cancel my shopping and go to Paris. I want to be with you.
No, you need a few days alone to think.
But I don't want to.
Well, do.
And before I get back have it all straight in your mind.
I will, Cliff.
I don't know, but you bettler try.
I don't want to have to prove anything. I want you to believe me.
I don't need proof.
Sometimes, we all need proof.
Even if we shouldn't.
Will you throw that in my bag?
Of course you haven't told me the whole thing, I don't blame you.
Heaven knows, I talk.
But I think the last place in the world to allow a man to go off to... even when relations aren't strained, is Paris.
Of course, being a woman, all I know about that side of Paris... is what men tell me. But if
I had a husband like George...
If I even knew a man like George,
I'd be on the next plane.
George is in that taxi, Martha.
Please don't play pranks.
Pranks?
George is in Paris.
I saw him in that taxi.
No Martha, George is not in Paris.
What do you want?
Who gave you the right to come barging in?
I was given this address for Jeremy Clay.
By whom, may I ask?
Someone helpful.
Pity we can't all be that way, helpful.
I can help you.
Follow me.
Thank you.
Jim?
I'm sorry I can't ask you to sit down.
Do you know where I can find
Jeremy Clay?
I said I did, didn't I?
Sit on my half of the bed.
You see why my wife left me?
She said she didn't mind going without board... but at her age, she wasn't going without bed!
Lusty creature!
Look, I'm late...
Bibliomania, that's what I have.
Where can I find Jeremy Clay?
We'll come to that later. I started my collection with Bibles... and then worked from holy selectivity... all the way down to what is known as books of an unexpurgated nature.
The kind that nice folk think you can only buy in Paris.
Which brings me to Mr. Clay.
He had a strong fancy for such literature.
When he lived here, he used to pop in and leaf through them.
Where is he now?
Finally married.
Not wisely, but fairly well.
The woman who owns a bookshop, the next street across the road.
Lovely hot chestnuts!
You wanted to see me?
I just wondered if Mr. Radcliffe got off all right.
He seemed to.
Was his plane on time?
Yes, I think so.
Did you see him board the plane?
No, I let him off at the check-in.
Oh, yes. Thank you, Jim.
Taxi!
London Airport, quick!
Mr. Radcliffe, calling from Paris.
All right, Betty. I'll take it.
Hello, Cliff.
No, I was awake.
How does Paris feel?
You're the sort who should never go to Paris without a woman.
Yes, of course I miss you tonight.
I missed you today too.
It's probably only one of Lily's pranks, but... she said she saw you in a taxi today, in town.
You think Lily would play a prank?
Are you still on, Martha?
I've got to get this conference started. I'll call in the morning.
Cliff, wait.
I can't seem to simply ask you directly... if you were in London today.
I'll call you in the morning.
Good night.
Yes, Betty?
That gentleman is here, madam,
Mr. Radcliffe's associate.
Mr. Brooke?
Yes, madam.
I'm sorry to barge in without calling.
I know you prefer to respect the formalities.
Why are you in London?
Business.
It must be vital to pry you out of New York.
Very vital.
George is in Paris.
I know. Miss, take my bags to the guest room, please.
These jet flights are fast and practical... but they do tend rather to wind one up.
My hat and coat, please.
Would you care to unwind me,
Martha? A drink would help.
When you've aired the guest room would you bring my robe?
Yes, madam.
Some people manifest their chilliness the way others generate their heat.
You're the perfect hostess.
Even if you don't care for a guest, you remember what he drinks.
How did you know George was in Paris?
He told me.
Last night, when he called?
Did he call me last night?
How did you first meet George?
How? I'm not quite sure I remember.
Quite naturally, I suppose.
I'm a promoter and George, a gambler.
It was natural we'd meet sometime, someplace.
When?
Do you mean the precise day?
Yes.
The day I had something grand to promote... and George had something grand to gamble with.
You'd make a very poor witness.
You never answer directly.
Am I supposed to be in the witness box?
I bettler go to bed.
What a lovely way to end a conversation.
A perfect hostess would show me to her room.
I'd rather not be perfect.
You can't help it.
Now, please, Morris.
I think you enjoy it.
What?
Treating me with passionate animosity.
You make even animosity sound provocative. Come on.
You needn't fawn over me, but you might show a glimmer of gratitude.
After all, I took George by the hand and led him into the plush life.
I cannot imagine anyone leading George by the hand.
Not now, perhaps. But once, he was a desperate fellow.
You mean before the murder?
Whose murder, dear?
Jason Roote.
There are many ways a woman can show gratitude.
Morris, please stop it.
I'm after a bit of sweetening.
My drink, I mean.
You know, if I told Cliff...
He'd smack my hand.
He'd kill you.
George?
Come to think of it, he did once say he wouldn't hesitate to kill me... if I double crossed him in our deal at International.
But he wouldn't do it over anything as casual as passion.
Excuse me, madam.
Here's your armour.
I thought...
That meeting can be finished anytime.
This has to be settlled now, Martha.
Finished.
That's why I came back.
I feel so bad.
Oh, I don't feel so bad now.
I was in London.
I don't care.
I was looking for Clay, to make him...
Don't talk.
To make him admit he was lying.
You know he was.
Admit it to you.
Did you find him?
He wasn't there.
You'd like to hear it from him.
That's the kind of proof that would convince you.
No. I feel convinced, Cliff.
I feel convinced, now.
That lettler wasn't enough to do this to you, Martha.
You've always thought
I killed Roote.
No. No, I...
Please, don't move away.
I won't. If you don't want me to.
I love to hold onto you, Cliff.
I love you.
You always have.
I always will.
I promised.
That first time... when we rented the littlle cottlage in East Hampton.
West.
Was it West?
[Skipped item nr. 656]
May I help you?
Would I be permittled to look at the files of a murder trial?
If you give me the details...
This lever will adjust the focus for you.
And to raise the columns, use this dial on the left.
You did not see Mr. Radcliffe return to the office?
No, that part must be like he said.
He must have gone past while I was...
While you were doing what,
Mr. Heath?
Searching in my desk for a medicine bottle.
You kept medicine in your desk?
Have you a recurrent illness,
Mr. Heath?
Yes.
I'm an alcoholic.
And in your medicine bottlle, you kept...?
Whisky. I'm not trying to deny...
No. You seem to be trying to build your defence on your alcoholism.
- You found the bottlle?
- Yes.
- And?
- I knew Mr. Roote was in his office.
- Indeed.
- But, I had to...
I couldn't go on and work my overtime without at least...
I didn't want to be seen by Mr. Roote...
- So I did like always.
- Which is?
I slipped out and went down to the boiler room.
Before Mr. Roote was killed.
Of course, no one saw you slip out before Mr. Roote was...
I don't know.
Maybe somebody did.
Maybe Mr. Radcliffe did.
He saw me at my desk.
Maybe he saw me slip out before the murder.
Mr. Heath.
Throughout my questioning and that of your own counsel... you have deliberately and blatantly attlempted... to cast suspicion on George Radcliffe.
He was up in the offices.
I was down in the boiler room.
We all know he was in the offices.
We also know that Mr. Radcliffe and a police officer... pursued you to the boiler room.
Then he was chasing someone else, not me.
Somebody he knew, maybe.
Maybe an accomplice.
That must be it.
Him and this other man...
Mr. Heath, are you asking this court... to even consider that George Radcliffe... could be involved in a plot to rob and murder... a great friend, and as we heard... a friendly benefactor?
Mr. Heath. After observing this inhuman, immoral effort... you're making to save your neck...
I doubt if there remains in court one person... who can believe in your protested innocence.
I can.
Yes?
Mrs. Heath?
May I come in?
I thought I'd never forget your face.
Any of those faces.
Funny how I almost did.
What do you want?
Please, may I?
I thought nothing could brighten this place except Donald walking in.
Free, cleared.
But I was wrong.
You brighten it.
With your clothes, your hair... your complexion and your jewellery.
Mrs. Heath...
How did you find me?
The...
The welfare people.
I didn't live here at the time of the trial.
We had a nice littlle place in Stretham.
Donald's never seen me here.
Would you like your husband to see you in a place like this?
What do you want?
I want...
I want you to tell me something.
As a favour?
No, I'll pay.
What do you want me to tell you?
The truth.
You can't buy that.
I know.
Want some tea?
I always drink tea when
I feel like being sick.
Donald tried to keep things down with whisky.
Your husband is in prison.
He may never get out...
If you would just tell me...
I mean, if you know... and believe me when I swear
I'll never tell anyone...
If you'd just tell me...
What?
Your husband.
Was he...?
Was he what?
I'm sorry, I can't seem to...
Can't seem to be able to say it?
Why can't you ask me that simple question?
Was my husband guilty?
What does it do to you to come here and ask me that?
Does it make you want to be sick?
I'm sorry...
What's going on? Why do you come here asking questions?
Something opened up an old sore?
I have no...
You were in court.
You heard everything.
You saw.
You saw my husband weep.
Those tears washed away what was left of his manhood.
They also washed him clean.
Innocent.
Women know innocence.
Your husband didn't weep.
He sweated a littlle.
And sweat doesn't clean.
You knew even then that he was guilty.
Women know guilt too, you know.
You've lived with it all these years, why can't you go on?
It never even crossed my... mind.
They said they'd review his sentence if he told them where the money is.
Do you think he'd let us live in this garbage pit... if he had that money?
Do you think he likes jail?
If he knew where the money was, if he could touch it... he'd tell.
Donald would tell.
He's cured, you know, of that drinking business.
He's got a half nice colour to his face.
Like when I first knew him.
Your husband's got a nice colour to his face all the time.
The money he's got.
You can buy sunshine.
Even in London.
What are you throwing away, Lucy?
You have to believe your husband is innocent, don't you?
You have to blame someone else.
I blame the rats.
Here, look.
Hungry rats always get the bait without gettling caught.
[Skipped item nr. 785]
I said you couldn't buy the truth.
I meant you could have it free.
Now you've got your truth, what will you do with it?
Drink it down and sleep it away at night?
You think drink will kill it?
Or love? Try it.
Lie in his arms, let him love you.
Let him touch you with his hands.
Murderer's hands!
Let him kill the truth the way he killed Jason Roote... and my Donald.
And maybe someday he'll kill you too.
Where've you been?
What are you doing in this place?
Martha! What are you doing?
Cliff, I...
She looked so terrible, I...
So you wrote out a cheque?
How would this look if it got into the wrong hands?
Listen. Don't you realise, my testimony sent Heath to prison?
Now, I give his wife money.
What kind of money?
Conscience? Hush?
What kind?
What kind do you have?
This could ruin us.
What kind of money? Tell me, where did you get that money?
We'll talk about this at home.
No.
Right here. Now.
Cliff, where?
I told you, I made a killing.
I know that phrase. Down the years it's made bad dreams.
In the stock market.
I explained it to you.
That day, by the river.
The day I showed you International.
Yes, I remember, the day of the trial... you explained.
Yes, I know.
You didn't understand?
Yes, I...
No. Oh, Cliff, I don't understand stocks and take-overs.
Did you explain?
What did you explain? Tell me.
I have the papers at home.
Notes, receipts...
I'll show you how I did it.
Tell me.
I borrowed. I bought.
It was a gamble.
I put us in hock for the rest of our lives, Martha... on a tip from a man
I'd never even seen...
I'd only talked to him by phone.
I had to take the chance.
Brooke was waving that deal in front of me. I needed a lot of money.
It was a gamble, nothing more.
It sounds so...
Why can't I believe you?
You still can't?
Take me home. Show me the papers, the receipts, anything.
I wish I didn't have to be shown, but...
I hope I can find them.
Maybe they're in my office, in the files.
Then just take me home.
I'll get them tomorrow.
Yes, tomorrow.
Suppose I can't find those papers?
Well, we'll just forget the whole thing, won't we?
Will you?
No.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I know.
You'll go on searching, talking to people like Mrs. Heath... maybe even the police.
You'll kick up enough suspicion to get the case reviewed.
Nobody can prove
I killed Jason... but while they're trying,
I'll be destroyed.
We'll be destroyed.
I just can't let you do that.
I needed that drive.
The old American cure-all, a long drive in the country.
Want to stretch your legs?
Come on, feels good.
No, I'm all right, Cliff.
Stretch them for me.
Come on, Martha.
We never did buy that cottlage in East Hampton.
West.
Remember how we wanted to own it?
A place to run to if we ever had to run.
Let's go home.
There's no hurry.
No, I want to.
We're doing shocking things to your liquor supply. Come and help us.
Hope you saved one for me.
Where's Martha?
Lily...
No, George, you may not come with me.
Cliff?
It's Lily.
Lily. Come in.
Locked bedrooms always make me feel guilty.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm just tired.
You're not going to bed at this hour, are you?
No, I'm going to soak.
I...
I suppose I didn't see George in a taxi after all.
Did I?
It was George.
You go soak.
I'll sit somewhere and we'll talk.
I don't feel like talking.
That psychoanalyst I went to in '35, you didn't know me then... he always said, when you don't feel like talking...
I don't remember his exact words, but he implied a fear of talking... had something to do with a fear of giving, sexually that is.
Do you suspect George of giving?
No. Taking.
Oh. Martha, what is wrong?
I don't know. Me, I suppose.
If you're all ready to blame yourself
I know exactly what's wrong... but it isn't necessarily true, you know... that it's always the wife's fault if the husband strays... even some unmarried men stray.
Are you sure?
No.
You only suspect?
Yes.
Suspicion. The black plague of our middle years.
The things that can make you love men!
What? Oh.
It's just a thing that grows between a man and a woman who live together.
What are you talking about?
His razor. I always wash it for him.
But I left in such a hurry this morning.
Well, there is one consolation.
Eventually, whatever they're doing... and regardless of whomsoever they may be doing it with... it's over.
Yes, it must be nice to have it over with.
Do you mind?
You'd like me to go?
You're wonderful, Lil.
I'll call you in the morning.
All right.
Perhaps, even before morning.
Run out of girl talk?
Run along and say our goodbyes to George, Manny.
He's gone. Taken the other fellow to the airport.
You got it straightened out?
Did my best.
Thanks.
So, nothing can hurt us?
Nothing ordinary could hurt us.
Anything out of the ordinary, prevent.
I didn't hear you come in.
Oh, Cliff, help me.
How?
Help me.
How?
I feel in the middle of some place high and empty.
I'm frightened.
I've always been so closed in,
Cliff.
I've always had strong arms around me. Even you.
We didn't even know each other and you put your arms around me... and all these years you've never taken them away... right from that moment until now.
They're still around you, Martha.
No.
No, I've moved out of them.
I can't find those papers.
I must've left them at the office.
Never mind, Cliff.
You don't want to see them?
I don't care.
I don't want to care about anything.
A littlle while ago... for just a moment...
I even thought I might kill myself.
Stop it!
I know you, Martha.
You couldn't.
That wouldn't make things right and you have to have things right.
You want Donald Heath free and the real murderer put away... and you think
I'm the real murderer.
So you won't slit your wrists, you'll turn me in.
I don't think I could.
Not tonight. Maybe not for a year, but it'll come.
Do you expect me to live with that?
I don't think I could turn you in even if I knew for certain.
I'd find some way to live with it.
Maybe you can live with it,
I can't.
Then I'll just have to find out for certain.
How? Asking questions... raking things up like a ghoul in a graveyard? Forget it.
I can't.
Martha. You don't know about murderers.
Should I?
What if Heath is innocent?
That means the real murderer has got away with it for six years.
Do you think he'll let someone rake it up?
Do you think he'll let you...?
How do you suppose he'll protect his freedom?
He'll kill me.
Yes?
Can I help you, madam?
Mr. Is Mr. Clay here?
Jeremy Clay?
In the back.
Pay me when you leave.
Thank you.
Come in.
I'm Martha Radcliffe.
We received your lettler.
After all these years, you've decided to do something?
We've only just received it.
It was in that stolen mail bag.
I thought he didn't answer because he was brassy... calling my bluff and all that.
He never even received it.
That takes the bun.
It was a lie, wasn't it?
Your lettler. Blackmail.
Does he intend doing anything about it?
Somebody has to do something.
Blackmail is a vicious crime.
Punishable by law.
But you know what, Mrs. Radcliffe?
I don't think your husband is going to tell on me.
Do you plan to?
Yes.
Then I shall be punished.
Not only for blackmail... but also for withholding evidence.
You see, I didn't come forward at the trial, as the saying goes.
I knew the truth.
I couldn't have attlempted blackmail otherwise, could I?
What truth?
Your husband murdered
Jason Roote.
That's why I was afraid to press him.
One is careful about harassing a murderer.
Oh, Cliff...
I admit many times
I was tempted to press him.
I could've used the money.
I even strolled by that cosy cottlage of yours in Regent's Park.
I paused by the gate, looking, pettling the brass gargoyles...
Brass. Everything about your husband is brass.
Does he know you're here?
No, he's left.
Left you? Left you alone with all this terrible knowledge?
I don't believe you.
Think clearly.
If I'm arrested for blackmail, he'll be arrested for murder.
I'll tell them everything.
They won't believe you, any more than I.
Everything, in splendid detail.
Exactly how he did it.
Exactly how I saw him do it.
You saw him do it?
I'd no right to be there.
I didn't work there anymore.
They were glad of me, at first.
After all, a former lawyer does make a rather elegant handyman.
You were there?
They were glad of me. Until they caught me helping myself... to that fine store of bourbon whisky
Mr. Roote kept in his office... then they had to let me go.
Now and again, I'd steal back, at night.
Not that I ever drank the stuff.
I merely sold it and spent the money on more exotic vices.
And you let them convict an innocent man?
You'd rather I let them convict your husband?
I did feel a twinge for poor Heath.
He told the truth in court.
Pity the truth always sounds so untrue.
If he hadn't been so mad for a drink, he might've had me for a witness.
As I was stealing up the stairway he was stealing down.
Come in for a drink when you've finished.
Now, what do you do?
I've already thought of killing myself.
It seemed the easy way.
To lie down in burning water... they say you don't feel the sharp edge.
Now, that is morbid.
Why not forget it all, including my lettler?
I've no heart to rot in jail.
I don't imagine Mr. Brass has either.
Be thankful I didn't come forward.
You should have.
It would've all been over by now.
But I didn't. And we've all lived happily ever after.
We'll continue to, won't we?
Or won't we?
Mr. Radcliffe, Mrs. Radcliffe called several times.
Get me on a plane to New York.
Tonight, if possible.
Mr. Radcliffe, your wife.
It sounded urgent.
Yes? Oh, yes, he did, just this moment.
It's Mrs. Radcliffe.
Martha?
And I believe him.
You called me back to say that?
I couldn't not say it, Cliff.
Now Clay has you convinced
I'm a murderer... you think you can live with it.
I want to.
I married all of you, Cliff.
I'll never mention it again.
I'll never even think of it.
No?
I'll put it away, wherever people put things like this... wherever these things are hidden.
Of course, you'll never tell anybody.
No, never.
Cliff, I swear.
Cliff, stay!
How can a man live with a wife who might turn him... any time she feels like it?
Cliff.
Cliff, I had to believe Clay.
He wasn't lying. He wouldn't admit being there just to build up a lie.
He said he was there?
Yes.
He saw it happen.
That's unfortunate for him.
He bends it into the net!
One up to Wolves in the 15th minute.
Hello, Lily.
Lily, I'll call you back.
I came back.
Yes, I knew you would.
I can't leave things like this.
There's just too much to lose.
Yes.
You look very tired.
Why don't you go to bed?
Have some hot milk, or a pill... really put you under.
I don't need anything, Cliff.
I'm too tired to resist.
All right.
Good night, Cliff.
Coming up?
Cliff?
Cliff?
Oh, Cliff, I'm so sorry.
It breaks my heart...
Telling you I was there was as good as saying I killed Roote.
Sooner or later, you'd see.
Then where would I be?
Relax. This is the easy way.
Remember? You said,
"Lie down in burning water..."
Lord, I wonder if women get naked when kill themselves this way.
Don't tense.
There.
I told you too much today.
I always tell too much.
Let me get them underwater...
No pain...
Afterwards, the clothes...
Afterwards.
Talk!
I can't.
Talk you...
She knew.
I told her I was there.
I'd gottlen away with murder for years, but I was free.
I never got a penny out of it.
Never a penny, but I was free.
I tried to hide the money.
When you chased me,
I threw it behind the boiler.
I threw it, but I missed.
God, I always miss.
The money burnt into ashes... in the boiler.
In the boiler...
I was so sure it was Heath.
I've condemned the wrong man.
So did I.
Ladies and gentlemen, you now know who killed Jason Roote.
Please do not reveal this secret to anyone.
My name is Johnny Barrett.
I'm a reporter on the Daiy Globe.
This is my story... as far as it went.
When was the first time you got this urge, Mr. Barrett?
- There must have been a first time.
- When I was 14.
And when I was much younger - that's when I got the feeling.
What gave it to you?
Her braids.
Tell me about her braids.
- I got excited.
- Go on.
I grabbed her braids.
Is that when you hurt her?
I never hurt her.
Did you pull on her braids?
I caressed them.
- Just -
- Did you pull on them?
Do you think I'm a fetishist?
Hell, no, Johnny!
- Let them bring up that word - not you.
- Yeah.
You'll be facing the best psychiatrists in the state.
They'll know when you're shamming.
I feel sorry for Doc Fong.
Professionally he knows he's playing with dynamite.
But he just couldn't turn down his closest friend, Swanee.
They were in psychological warfare back in World War II.
Today, the doc's a topflight head-candler, and Swanee's my boss... managing editor of the Daiy Globe.
The role you'll be playing will be stronger than your strongest imagination... so don't ever weaken.
It'll be a daily duel between the insane and your own sane mind.
And as for the doctors there... lower your mast for an instant and they'll know you're a phony.
Never let them forget you're living on a sexual powder keg.
He's all yours, Swanee.
- Think he's ready?
- As he ever will be.
Well - the next move is yours, Cathy.
Caressing my braids.
Kissing them.
What a disgusting story.
What happens if they find out
I'm not really his sister?
I'll handle that.
Johnny -
Johnny, you've got to be crazy to want to be committed to an insane asylum to solve a murder.
Even if I don't crack this case, honey, my experiences alone...
- will make a book, a play or even a movie sale.
- But -
Every man wants to get to the top of his profession.
- Mine is winning the Pulitzer Prize.
- Johnny -
- If this story doesn't do it, nothing ever will.
- But their sickness is bound to rub off on you.
I said the same thing to you when you started singing in your skin.
- Remember, Cathy?
- That's different.
But those hookers didn't get to you, did they?
And those lunatics are not gonna get to me.
He's right.
Reporters have impersonated coal miners, school teachers, hoodlums.
Those reporters went in for a purpose.
Not to win a journalistic halo on the cover of Life.
And not to win a cash prize and get their pictures in Time and Newsweek.
Oh, come on, Cathy.
All you have to do is play your part.
I'm fed up.
Fed up playing Greek chorus to your rehearsed nightmare.
Why don't you smuggle aboard a rocket and write the memoirs of an astronaut?
- You have any cigarettes, Cathy?
- Why don't you give up this psychoanalytical binge?
Because it's what people buy.
Mark Twain didn't psychoanalyze
Huck Finn or Tom Sawyer.
Dickens didn't put Oliver Twist on the couch because he was hungry.
- Oh, come on, Cathy.
- Good copy comes out of people, Johnny... not out of a lot of explanatory medical terms.
Oh, stop it, will you?
You're on a hopped up, show-off stage.
Get off it.
Don't be Moses leading your lunatics to the Pulitzer Prize.
- Would you care for a cigarette?
- You make me sick!
Sick at the thought of you playing games with your mind and riding that crazy horse.
He has been conditioned for a whole year to ride that horse.
You've got to saddle it and get me off and running, that's all, Cathy.
Scratch me in this race, Johnny.
We made a deal.
My whole instinct is to kick myself hard for ever having gone into this deal with you.
What I should do is to land a righteous punch in your supercivilized nose.
Oh, Cathy, you're an intellectual, well past the age -
Don't you dare analyze me!
Johnny?
Johnny.
Johnny, I'm in love with a normal reporter holding down a normal job.
Mm-hmm, normal.
Do you think I like singing in that sewer with a hot light on my navel?
I'm doing it because it pays more than shorthand or clerking or typing.
- I know that, Cathy.
- I'm saving money so we can have that normal life.
- That's all I want.
- I know all about that.
But I'm scared.
I'm scared when I see how calm
Dr. Fong and Swanee... and you can be about this whole crazy scheme of yours.
Oh.
I'm scared this whole Jekyll-Hyde idea's going to make a psycho out of me.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Cathy.
Cathy.
Do you think I'd ever let anything happen to you?
But you've just gotta go through with your part, honey.
You're the only one we can trust.
Thank God.
Cathy. Cathy.
Then go back to your dive!
Dive?
That dive is holy compared to your ideas of work.
Hamlet was made for Freud, not you.
I want
Somebody
- To love
- Johnny, Johnny
Someone to care
- For me
- Johnny, Johnny
Johnny, Johnny
I need
Somebody to hold
Someone who'll hold
Just me
I'd like someone
Who'll always be tender and sweet
And kind
Who's mine
All mine
I need
Somebody to kiss
Someone who'll kiss
Just me
I want somebody to miss
Someone who'll miss
Just me
I know
That somewhere
There's a someone
Who's true
I know
- The lover I want
- Johnny, Johnny
Darlin', my love
Is you
Well, I told Mr. Ford that the only way for a stripper to strip... is for me to take off all my clothes.
- Did Johnny phone?
- No.
Scared this whole Jekyll-Hyde idea... is going to backfire and make a psycho out of me.
But their sickness is bound to rub off on you.
I said the same thing to you when you started singing in your skin.
- Remember, Cathy?
- That's different.
But those hookers didn't get to you, did they?
And those lunatics are not gonna get to me.
She's gonna blow her top if that guy dumped her.
How can a girl love a guy that much?
Tell him it's Cathy.
Yeah?
Put her on.
Oh, Swanee.
Change your mind, Cathy?
Swanee, it's been four days.
You called the shot.
Swanee, I haven't heard from him in four days.
If you love him, you'd go the limit for him.
Well, good evening.
What can I do for you, young lady?
My brother won't let me alone. He -
How old is he?
Thirty.
- Are you married?
- No.
Does he live with you?
No.
Has he ever tried to... attack you?
He's tried.
Has he ever hurt you?
Yes.
Have you ever brought charges against his sickness?
- Why not?
- Ashamed.
And now?
He said he'd... kill me if I -
Are you ready to sign a formal complaint that he's mentally unsound?
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes.
What's your brother's full name, please?
John Barrett.
County General Hospital.
The psycho unit, please.
Dr. Menkin?
Kane, 16th precinct.
John Barrett.
Attempted incest with sister.
Soon as we pick him up we'll send him over for emergency admission.
How dare you jackass me down here on her say-so!
I'm a reporter for the Daily Glofbe!
Call my boss. He'll vouch for me.
We checked with him.
He gave you a clean bill of health.
- That's more like it.
- But his word doesn't carry much weight...
- since your sister signed a formal complaint -
- Formal complaint?
Now what can you expect from a stripper?
Sis, come in here and explain how you dreamed this whole thing up.
Please. Mr. Barrett, please.
- Sit down.
- Uh -
Please?
- Your father living?
- No.
- Did you like him?
- Of course.
- Any brothers?
- No.
- Any other sisters?
- Just Cathy, and that's enough.
- Mother living?
- No.
- Did you ever want your mother?
- What?
What are you saying?
That's a filthy thing to say to me!
Please.
We're here to help you.
You, uh -
- You love Cathy, don't you?
- She's my sister.
- You love her like a woman, don't you?
- I would never let a meathead have her, no.
Mothers and fathers have the same fears.
- You understand me, don't you?
- Of course. Of course.
Tell me, when was the first time you felt differently toward your sister?
Well, there must have been a first time.
When I was 14.
Look at the way his eyes lit up.
He's got me talkin'.
He's a happy little rascal.
Maybe younger, when I was 10.
Now if you'd just ask me what made me feel different... this story will write itself!
What made you feel differently toward her?
Her braids.
Tell me about her braids.
I caressed them... kissed them.
Did you pull on them?
I'd never hurt her.
The next question's gotta be about fetishist, according to Doc Fong's script.
Oh, I don't like this.
He's stalling too much.
If he doesn't come through with that question,
I'll fall right on my typographical face.
Do you know what a fetishist is?
There's no contest in this.
Sure, I know.
As a reporter, did you ever cover a story... where a man became intensely excited whenever he saw a woman with long hair... long, loose hair?
Yes.
- Did he make love to her?
- Yes, he killed her.
You don't want to wake up some fine morning to learn you killed your sister.
Oh, now, Doctor, I'm no epileptic with some kind of fetish for hair!
- Of course, Cathy - Now, her hair is different.
- I understand.
- I figured you would. Yes.
- I understand.
Didn't you threaten to commit suicide if she ever got married?
Didn't you threaten your sister if she wouldn't let you make love to her?
- That's different.
- Why?
- Because she's different.
- Why is she different?
- Because!
- Because why?
Because I want her, and nobody's gonna keep her from me!
I want her, Doc!
Cathy! Cathy!
Cathy! Cathy!
Cathy! Cathy!
Cathy!
Cathy! Cathy!
Cathy! No!
Overlapping Voices]
Personality synthesis. Test emotional state. emotional tendencies. personality synthesis.
Emotional state.
You were a healthy lover, until you started this crazy idea.
And now it's consumed you.
You made a nervous wreck out of me.
Well, reverse the situation, Johnny.
What if I -
I were going away on a trip that could separate us for weeks... or months?
Would you help me... put a gap between us?
The drama critic on your paper... said my "Chablis-tinted hair...
"is like a soft halo...
"over wide-set... inviting eyes".
And my mouth - my mouth was a lush tunnel... through which golden notes came.
Stop it, Cathy.
And my movements... evoke the most inflammatory passions... in all -
I miss you, Cathy.
My yen for you goes up and down like a fever chart.
- I love you, Cathy.
- I don't like being alone, Johnny.
But you made me be alone, Johnny.
And I have a right... to find another Johnny.
No!
Let me have his frequency table.
Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Shows a culmination of internal sexual conflict... generally of old standing... and based on a constitutionally determined chaotic sexual pattern.
There's no doubt.
"His pattern of symptoms...
"in a mental disease is familiar.
"We've got to resolve the underlying...
"sexual conflict.
"Whenever he wants his sister physically...
"he is taking the form of a mental breakdown... an acute schizophrenic episode".
Well, what does it mean?
Means I'm a pretty good teacher, and Johnny's a smart student.
- So far, so good.
- I don't mean that.
Aren't either of you concerned about his breakdown?
What breakdown?
Well, taking all those tests is bound to make him sick.
You're right.
That is something to worry about.
On the contrary,
I think he's caught the perfect mood - a borderline psychosis, exactly as we rehearsed.
And if the superior court judge buys his performance, he'll be committed.
140 I.Q. classification.
Very good, Mr. Barrett.
Means superior intelligence.
Oh, my name's Wilkes. I'm sorry.
You'll have to get used to no belt, no shoelaces.
New patient. John Barrett.
Barrett, eh?
Barrett, put it back.
Barrett -
Ward B, bed 2.
Come on, Mr. Barrett.
Come on.
Barrett, uh?
So you're a 140 I.Q. journalist.
- Where's your typewriter?
- Easy, Lloyd.
The last reporter I had on this floor was Ben Franklin.
- And that egghead gave me more trouble than -
- Come on, Mr. Barrett.
Born phonies, all you newspapermen.
You came at the make-friends hour.
Patients who behave are permitted to congregate in this corridor.
They call it "the street".
Gives 'em a chance to make new friends.
The women have their "street" too.
I used to work in the female wing, but the nympho ward got too dangerous for me.
Well, this one's yours, Mr. Barrett.
Am I the only loony in this ward?
No, Mr. Barrett.
Your roommates are in the street.
Oh, if you don't mind, we never use words here like...
"nuts", "bugs", "screwy", "goofy", "loony".
We'd like it very much if you didn't use them either.
I'm sorry.
I'm a greenhorn inmate.
- You're a patient, not an inmate.
- This is an insane asylum, is it not?
Not exactly. This is a mental hospital, and we're dealing with mental hygiene.
After Dr. Cristo takes you in hand, you'll be a different man.
He has one of the finest records in the country.
- I really don't belong here.
- I understand.
You won't cause any trouble though, will you?
As you did when you attacked the county hospital psychiatrist.
- I forgot myself.
- We're here to help you to remember not to forget.
- I phone my sister?
- No. I'm sorry.
I'm hungry!
Lloyd will show you your place in the dining room.
- Lloyd?
- What's the matter?
Lloyd, the keeper that called me a phony?
Well, he's no keeper.
He is an attendant like me.
Lloyd doesn't like me.
Don't mind him. He doesn't mean anything with that chip on his shoulder.
It's just his way of fighting everybody because he can't cure the patients.
Well, make yourself at home, Mr. Barrett.
I made it! I'm in!
Ever since my voice changed, I wanted to be in the company of the newspaper greats.
And this long corridor is the magic highway... to the Pulitzer Prize.
Maybe I'm looking at the killer right now.
Three witnesses -
Stuart, Trent, Boden.
- How do you do? I'm Pagliacci.
- Johnny Barrett.
Welcome to Ward B, Mr. Barrett.
If you expect a demonstration of insanity - forget it.
What are you in here for, Mr. Barrett?
Stuart.
Farm boy from the Bible Belt. playing Civil War games.
Believes he's General Jeb Stuart,
Confederate hero of the Civil War.
Mr. Pulitzer.
Come on. I'll show you to your table.
This is your place from now on, Brisbane.
Yes, sir.
- Just behave yourself.
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
They don't give us any knives or forks around here.
They're afraid we'll hurt ourselves.
- Take your anti-convulsions.
- I don't like it.
Gimme, uh, the -
Gimme the, uh - the tranquilizer drug.
No, no, no, no. Gimme -
Gimme - Gimme -
Gimme the - the -
That one. That one.
No, no, no. No, th-that one - that one there.
The white one. Yeah.
I hate my meat already chewed up!
I can eat a steak the size of a cow!
- What am I, an infant?
- Drink this.
He ate my vitamins!
Stuart.
He took my vitamins!
Gimme back my vitamins!
Gimme back my vitamins!
Stuart, bring your brigade up around the right here.
We'll flank McClellan's forces.
Then we hit Antietam and hit 'em hard.
You will address me as "sir".
A lieutenant general never serves a major general.
What lieutenant general?
Nathan Bedford Forrest.
At ease, General.
Report to my command post.
Where are you bivouacked, sir?
Come on, gentlemen.
We're going back to the wards.
Where are you bivouacked, sir?
A mile north of Gettysburg - Ward B.
Better leave your brigade behind with me, General.
I'll be there, sir.
Now march!
All the men want me, Johnny.
But I want you.
And you - you want the Pulitzer Prize.
I
Want
Somebody
- To love
- Johnny, Johnny
Someone to care
For me
I need
Somebody
Somebody to hold
Figaro
Thank you.
I was in the middle of an aria.
And I pitched forward on my face like this... and died of a heart attack... caused by overweight.
A knife is a messy weapon!
It was a knife that killed Sloan in the kitchen.
Do you know why so many people came to my funeral?
They wanted to make sure I was dead.
Who used a knife on Sloan?
I took my time killing my wife.
Did you know that a man named Sloan, a patient here, was killed with a knife in the kitchen?
Still an unsolved murder.
I despise butchery!
I didn't want my wife to die like Sloan... so I gently sang her to death.
Good night, Mr. Barrett.
He remembered Sloan's murderer.
They do have flashes of sanity.
Breakfast bell! Wake up, John!
Wake up! Jonathan, up.
La, la, la, la
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
- Wake up, John. Wake up. Wake up.
- Good morning.
Now that's better.

Ah, you started as a copy boy, I see.
Yeah, when I was 14.
- And supported your sister.
- Mm-hmm.
Did you sleep well?
I'm an opera lover now.
Pagliacci's harmless.
I want to help you, John, but I need your cooperation.
I understand.
Why didn't you cooperate with my staff this morning?
They want to hurt me.
Do I want to hurt you?
Oh, I've had my eye on you every minute since I've been here.
- Do you know who I am?
- Of course.
Who am I?
Dr. Cristo, clinical director, head of the medical staff for seven years.
Married, two children. golf.
Don't you know?
Now it's time to ask me about voices.
You hear voices?
Yes.
My head hurts.
I gotta get outta here.
Call my paper. They can't go to press without me there. Is Cathy all right?
That's why you're here, John... to make sure she will be all right, you understand?
Why did you fingerprint me?
I've committed no crime.
You're not in prison, John.
He told me I shouldn't love her as a woman.
Who told you?
The man on TV.
He looked right at me and told me it was naughty.
Now, how would he know?
He's never met Cathy.
- Does he talk to you often?
- Every time I turn on TV.
Could this man be your father?
My father wouldn't get sore if I played around with Cathy.
And besides, what's he doing on TV?
He's dead.
I am impotent.
And I like it.
- How you feeling, Mr. Barrett?
- Fine. Just fine.
Hydrotherapy - is that what you call this treatment I'm getting?
That's right.
- Cathy come to visit me yet?
- Your sister?
- Yeah.
- Not yet. She'll probably come on visiting day.
- Confidentially, Mr. Wilkes -
- Yes?
Come here. Come here.
Do you really think that all this nerve-calming treatment's... gonna help me forget how much I want her in my arms?
We know about his fetish for your hair.
But did he ever try to cut it off?
Once.
With a pair of scissors or a knife?
Scissors.
Did he kiss you when he tried to cut off your hair?
No.
Well - Uh -
Yes.
Did he ever attack any man who showed an interest in you?
Yes.
- Do you love John?
- Oh, yes.
More than just as a brother?
What do you mean?
Well, often these cases are developed through encouragement.
What do you mean?
Forgive me for saying it, Ms. Barrett, but there's something very strange about this case.
And you don't appear to be too cooperative.
I -
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Dr. Cristo. I -
When I received your call, I - I thought something had happened to Johnny and I -
Well, I just wasn't prepared for this -
- Inquisition?
- No.
But you thought of the word, didn't you?
Yes.
Was he jealous of the way you revealed your body to other men?
Relax, Ms. Barrett.
May I see Johnny now?
You'll have to wait for visiting day.
How is he getting along?
- He's in dance therapy now.
- Dance therapy?
- I got an idea how I can help my buddy.
- I'd do anything to help.
All right.
Have the fellow play "Dixie".
Joe, would you please play "Dixie"?

I heard about you getting wounded at Shiloh, sir.
Does it hurt much?
I'll get the mess sergeant to fix you some baked apple.
Baked apple. I -
I haven't had any baked apple since I was in Japan.
How far is that from Shiloh?
Japan isn't in this country.
It's far away in Asia.
Is that Buddha still there?
I keep seeing it in color... and it keeps looking at me.
The Great Buddha of Kamakura.
I want to climb a parallel up to his head... and look at the people down below praying for my battalion.
I keep seeing monks in a parade... and little girls dressed like baby geishas... going to prayer... to ask Buddha to take care of me when I go back to Korea.
I get up there on that playground.
It's on the roof of the world.
And the wheel keeps going round and round... and round!
Like those Commies kept going round and round us on that hill in Korea.
Toy train.
Toy train. No.
Train.
Mount Fuji.
No. Another train.
And another train. And another.
And another! And another!
And another!
We were supposed to sandbag a train in Korea.
But we were captured.
I remember it was cold, and they marched us in the snow.
Who are you?
Johnny Barrett.
Well, what is this place?
It's a mental hospital.
What am I doing here?
You were a Commie in Korea.
- That's a dirty lie!
- You became a member of the Kremlin Club.
Don't you call me a Commie!
You wrote your father that the Russians were your friends.
Now you tell me something, boy.
Why should I write my Pappy?
He can't read.
He's a tenant farmer.
He can't read or write.
I remember.
I remember I helped Pappy sharecrop another man's land.
But that's before I ran away from home and joined the army.
But, now, why did I run away from home?
I like my home.
That's a downright lie.
Downright lie.
I know why I went over to the Commies.
Ever since I was a kid... my folks fed me bigotry for breakfast and ignorance for supper.
Never - not once - did they ever make me feel proud of where I was born.
Now, see, that was a cancer they put in me.
No knowledge of my country.
No pride.
Just a hymn of hate.
I'd have defected to any enemy.
Because, you see, it was easy.
My brains was cabbage.
They taught me everything from cabbages to commissars.
And they gave me a woman.
And she called me "mister".
And she made me feel important.
What changed your mind about the Reds?
The Dogface.
I was having a ball waving a red flag until I met a sergeant from the First Division.
He was a G.I. retread from World War II.
Fought through North Africa and Sicily... and all through Europe up to Czechoslovakia.
And after he was captured in Korea, well, then he was transferred to my camp... and then...
I was assigned to help brainwash him over to the Commie side.
And this sergeant -
Kolowicz.
That was his name.
Kolowicz.
He told me things that...
I never dreamed of.
Things that - that I wanted to wrap up gentle and proud-like and... go to sleep thinking about.
Things that give me a feeling like -
Things my folks should have told me.
And I wanted to go home.
So, yeah, I stopped wavin' the red flag.
And the Commies said that I was sick in the head.
So it was easy for me to... get on the next prisoner exchange.
And they brought me back and they gave me a dishonorable discharge.
And nobody talked to me.
And everybody spit on me.
And Pappy spit on me.
The newspaper reporters just kept hounding me, hounding me... hounding me and hounding me... hounding me and hounding me.
Stuart... sorry, but... could I ask you a question?
Do you think they'll let me out of this place now that I'm all right?
Did you see the man that... killed Sloan in the kitchen?
Yeah.
I saw him.
I was under a table with two other men.
What was I doing under a table?
I didn't see his face, but...
I know he had white pants.
White pants.
White fence.
A stone wall.
A bend in a stone wall!
Lee!
We've got to help General Lee!
Come on!
Let's get those damn Yankees!
Come on!
White... pants.
- Does he ask for me?
- All the time.
You have nothing to worry about.
He likes tea, you know?
With lemon in it.
And oatmeal.
The killer is an attendant or a doctor.
Stuart couldn't see his face, but he saw white pants.
Tell Swanee that one of the other two witnesses will open up.
I feel it.

Stuart couldn't see his face, but he saw white pants.

You know, if he went down into a coal mine on a disaster story... he'd come up with a little coal dirt on his face, wouldn't he?
He's getting sick.
He's doing great.
He's been there only six weeks... and narrowed the hunt down to a hospital employee, didn't he?
Something the cops couldn't do.
If you don't phone Dr. Cristo right now and get Johnny out of there tonight, I will.
Oh, Cathy, you're becoming a nervous wreck.
I'm more worried about you outside than I am Johnny inside.
- Phone him!
- You phone him!
Call Dr. Cristo, and you lose Johnny for good, and you know it!
Have a stick of gum.
Have another one. Come on.
Chew two.
Open your mouth and chew 'em.
I got five. Come on.
Chew. Chew 'em good.
Put 'em in your mouth.
It's very good for you. Here.
It's very good for you. Chew these up.
Chew 'em.
A little more.
That'll be just enough.
Chew. Come on. Chew, chew, chew.
See, you chew, and your jaw muscles, they get tired. See?
And then the other muscles, they get the message and they get tired too. See?
And before you know it... you're sleeping.
And when we're asleep... nobody can tell a sane man from an insane man.
Huh?
Good night, Mr. Barrett.
Good night, Mr. Pagliacci.
Did you make Johnny change his mind?
I tried, but he's just too close to the story now.
That ex-G.I. Stuart has been transferred to another floor... but Johnny is certain that Trent or Boden will open up.
- Was Dr. Fong with you?
- Uh-huh.
What did he say?
That it's natural for Johnny to show mental strain.
- What else?
- Well, that's it.
Do you want me to check with Dr. Fong myself?
Well, he is afraid that the force driving Johnny can boomerang.
Meaning he could snap? Is that it?
Now, don't jump to conclusions.
Look, if I pulled him off now, he'd still suffer from some kind of depressive psychosis... because he'd never know what would have happened... if he had stuck it out long enough to contact the other witnesses.
You mean if he quits now, that depression sickness could hit him?
Yes.
But if he cracks the murder, he'll be all right, won't he?
Yes.
Do you seriously believe that?
Yes!
You're crazy!
Oh, no. No, thank you. No.
There is nothing in there that will hurt you.
Last time I went into a strange room,
I was attacked by amazons.
That's a secret dream most men have.
Mm-hmm. Well, you try it sometime, tell me about.
Come on, Mr. Barrett.
Hmm.
Something wrong?
No.
Just saw the twitch in one of your muscles.
The one in my head?
Tell me, John.
Is your desire for your sister still as strong as ever?
I'll tell you what, Doc. You level me off, and I'll share all my dreams with you.
I'm cold and sweaty!
Chill sweats are usual in your case.
What is my case?
You're suffering from a form of dementia praecox... incident to the age of puberty... characterized by childish behavior... hallucinations... and emotional deterioration.
"Somebody's sleeping in my bed," said the Papa Bear.
Come on. Get up.
Go to your own bed. Go on.
What are you in here for, Mr. Barrett?
"God-haunted Ghost and the Street of No Return".
Oh, Cathy, what a story this is going to make!
Don't you dare strike me!
I'm pregnant. I've been carrying my baby for five months now.
"God-haunted Ghost".
Not bad for a lead.
If only Stuart had held on a little longer.
Another two seconds, and I'd have cracked this yarn!
Trent.
Only Negro student in a Southern university. collecting pillowcases.
- Trent!
- Yes, sir?
- A pillowcase is missing.
- I don't have it, sir.
- It's from your bed!
- I don't have it, sir.
- Want to go back into the hole?
- I don't have it, sir.
- Let him keep it.
- Keep out of this, Wilkes.
Dr. Cristo said not to get him excited.
You know what that pillowcase means.
It's all right, Trent.
We know you don't have it.
Thank you, sir.
Come on, Lloyd.
He does that every day.
He's reaching out for his nerves.
- Friend of yours?
- No. He's a nigger-lover.
Didn't make his kid spit on a black boy.
God punished him.
That's why he's in a catatonic stupor.
Watch this.
Now he's the Statue of Liberty.
What are you doing here?
- Visiting a friend.
- So am I, friend. So am I.
The hole is for dangerous and troublesome people.
- They put me in by mistake.
- So I heard.
- No, you didn't. I just told you.
- That's right.
I know why you're shining up to me.
You want to carry my sign.
- No, I don't.
- Calling me a liar?
No.
Go make your own sign and carry it.
You coming to the meeting?
What meeting?
I forgot.
Do you know the conductor of the state symphony orchestra?
No.
I do.
He comes here now and then as guest conductor of our own hospital band.
I like him, but, uh, he's mixed up.
How do you mean?
He permits a black boy to play with white musicians.
Imagine - a black boy!
Oh, they're all right as entertainers, but -
Let's get him before he marries my daughter!
Trent! Trent!
Trent! Come on!
Trent! Come on, snap out of it!
Trent! Come on!
All right, break it up!
What's the trouble?
- There's no trouble!
- What are you hatching up now?
- He's not hatching up anything!
- I'm talking to him!
Leave him alone.
Is everything all right, Trent?
Yes, sir.
No trouble now, Trent.
Promise?
Yes, sir.
Let's check the back ward.
Come on, Lloyd.
Thank you, friend.
It's all right, friend.
You, uh, ever been on the Mississippi?
No.
You like to watch the paddleboats go up and down the river?
I'd like that.
Yeah, I'd like that.
I know the captain.
Mark Twain is a friend of mine.
Come on.
Mark Twain!
Whoo! Whoo!
I like this trip.
So do I.
What's that?
A sign of the invisible empire.
That's a cyclos - from the Greek word kuklos.
It means circle.
This baptizes a new organization - the Ku Klux.
Sounds good.
No.
Ku Klux Klan.
Sounds more mysterious, more menacing, more alliterative.
Ku Klux Klan. Say it.
Ku Klux Klan.
- KKK.
- KKK.
It'll catch on quick. It'll drive those carpetbaggers back north.
Scare the hell out of 'em, tar and feather 'em, hang 'em, burn 'em.
- Who are you?
- Your friend.
- I don't know you.
- I got here firstest -
With the mostest men.
General Forrest.
Nathan Bedford Forrest.
General... you going around taking credit for founding the KKK.
I'm the founder. I'm the Grand Wizard.
What's our code word?
"Secrecy".
General... if Christ walked the streets of my hometown, he'd be horrified.
You've never seen so many black people... cluttering up our schools and buses and cafes... and washrooms!
I'm for pure Americanism!
White supremacy!
Listen to me, Americans.
America for Americans.
We got to throw rocks and hurl bombs.
Black bombs for black foreigners!
So they like hot music, do they?
Well, we'll give them a crescendo they'll never forget!
Burn that freedom bus!
Burn those Freedom Riders!
Burn any man who serves them at a lunch counter!
Burn every dirty, nigger-loving pocketbook integrationist!
Collect a lot of blackjacks and good long lengths of pipe.
We'll show those rabble-rousers they can't breathe our white air... and go to school with our white children.
We'll get some infallible liquid and pour it on 'em!
We'll pour it on their homes and burn 'em!
Pour it on their pickaninnies and set them on fire!
Call out of the members of the White Citizens' Council.
Call out the KKK!
Yes, we'll sponsor the Africans north!
Get rid of every black mother, son and daughter!
America for Americans!
- Keep our schools white!
- Keep 'em white!
That's right! Keep 'em white!
- I'm against Catholics!
- Hallelujah, man! Hallelujah!
- Against Jews!
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Against niggers!
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Against niggers!
- Hallelujah!
There's one!
Let's get that black boy before he marries my daughter!
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
Wednesday...
August 30, 1954.
Wednesday, August 30, 1954.
The U.S. Supreme Court decreed the nation's schools must be racially desegregated... with all deliberate speed.
I'm a boy in the Amazon jungle.
A brown boy, not a black boy.
Someone is scraping my thigh with the teeth of the piranha fish... to change my blood to white blood.

It's the KKK.
Run. Run. Run for your life, Trent.
I can't see his face.
Here comes the KKK. Run! Run!
Run for your life, Trent.
I can't see his face. I can't see his face.
Here comes the KKK. Run. Run!
I can't see his face. I can't see his face.
Run, Trent! Run!
Run, Trent! Run!
Run, run, run!
Always in color.
It's that same nightmare, always in color.
Strange how I always get my mind back after that dream.
What's your name?
Johnny Barrett.
I know all about that trouble you had in that Southern university, Trent.
You don't sound sick to me.
We were in a race riot.
You leading, and me trying to save your neck.
So you know I was a guinea pig in a classroom, huh?
The whole country went to school with you every day, Trent.
No. I failed.
Well, people were counting on you.
Oh, I wish I'd had the guts to have stuck it out.
I was brought up to have pride in my country.
Called it esprit de corps.
It's inside me. I love it.
It's even a blessing to love my country, even when it gives me ulcers.
And those ulcers will stop... the day all schools must get an education... before being allowed to open their doors.
Do you know who killed Sloan with a butcher knife in the kitchen?
I can't blame the students.
They were brought up to hate the color of my skin.
It's their - their blueprint for delinquence, the birth of lynchings... the disease carried to those yet unborn.
Those poor, sick children... are taught to depend on their parents' claws... instead of their love.
And the irony of it is that many Negroes are mulatto... and integration is well established down south.
Remember Sloan, who was killed in the kitchen with a butcher knife?
I remember the first day
I went to school.
A woman held up her child so he could reach out... and beat me with his little fist.
Sure, I remember Sloan.
What was the name of the doctor that did it?
It wasn't a doctor.
It was an attendant.
I even had a private teacher to help me to - to make sure the university wouldn't flunk me.
Do you know his name?
Of course. I saw him kill Sloan, didn't I?
Did you know that my house was attacked by night-riding shotgunners?
- Will you tell me his name?
- Sure.
You know... if I hadn't quit school...
I'd have gotten very, very sick.
Tell me his name!
Get that nigger!
He's not going to school with my daughter.
First the classrooms, then the school dances.
You know what after that.
Trent! Trent!
Go to your own home!
Go to your own school, nigger!
- Go to your own schools!
- Trent!
- Go to your own black schools, nigger!
- Trent!
- Go to your own black school!
- Trent! Trent!
- I'm for pure Americanism! White supremacy!
- Trent! Listen to me!
- I'm for pure Americanism! White supremacy!
- Snap out of it! Listen to me!
Get that freedom bus!
Burn that freedom bus!
- Burn those Freedom Riders!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
- Burn those Freedom Riders!
Trent, shut up! Trent, shut up!
Visiting time over.
That close. I was that close to getting the killer's real name... and, boom, he went nuts again.
Right back to the hole.
But there's still Boden.
I'll reach him.
I'll get to him, and this time
I'm not gonna waste one of his sane moments.
I'm gonna ask him right out all about the murder.
Boom! I'll get the answer.
You realize, Cathy, I'm sitting right on top of this story.
You all right, Cathy?
Oh, Johnny.
Don't ever do that!
Don't you ever kiss me like that again!
What?
You know what I mean.
No, I don't know what you mean, Johnny.
You tell me.
What do you mean, I should never kiss you again like that?
- What's the matter? What is it, Johnny?
- I'm sorry, Miss Barrett... but you're exciting the other patients by shouting!
- Miss Barrett!
- Johnny, what do you mean? No!
Miss Barrett!
What's the matter with her?
You're wanted on the phone, Cathy.
Mr. Swanson.
Cathy? Didn't you hear me?
Mr. Swanson's on the phone.
- Yes?
- You went to the hospital today, huh?
Dr. Cristo sent for me.
Well, why did he send for you?
Because he wanted my permission... to give Johnny electric shock treatments.
Have you lost your marbles?
Johnny can't take that kind of punishment.
He'll crack. They'll find out he's a fake.
Oh, I hope they do.
Then it won't be me who will expose him.
He'll expose himself.
Well, you should have refused the electric shock.
After all, he knows the killer is an attendant... and he's bound to find out his identity from Boden at the rate he's going.
At the rate he's going...
I don't know if he'll know his own identity.
What are you talking about?
He's beginning to think... that I'm really his sister.
Cathy!
What's the matter with my voice?
Why can't I talk?
What is it, John?
Why can't I talk?
I'll try again.
Fine.
I'm fine.
Was there anything wrong a moment ago?
No.
You're not holding anything back from me, are you, John?
No, sir.
Think another shock treatment might help?
Not unless you strap me in the chair and throw the switch yourself all the way.
I've learned my lesson, believe me.
No more race riots in the corridor, huh?
The way I feel now, a midget could whip me.
All right, John.
You can stretch your legs in the street during make-friends hour.
I beat 'em all.
They didn't learn a thing.
Hey.
What happened then?
Why did I lose my power of speech?
What happened to my voice?
Witness number three:
Dr. Boden, American physicist,
Nobel Prize winner.
Worked on the atom bomb, the H-bomb.
The most brilliant scientist alive today.
Went insane working on nuclear fission - missiles and rockets to the moon. drawing.
Now has the mentality of a child of six.
- Hello.
- Hello.
You been away?
We played games.
- You want to play with me?
- Mm-hmm.
Good. We'll play hide-and-seek.
- I'd like that.
- All right.
You hide your eyes and count to 10.
Okay.
One, two, three... four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
Now I wonder where he could be hiding.
Yes.
Keep it up, John.
Maybe you can help him.
We can't.
- Wonderful.
- All by myself.
- He's coming along just fine, isn't he?
- Oh, yes.
- Good.
- See? I can do it all by myself.
Hi. Guess what.
I got Dr. Boden making a portrait of me.
It's really a professional job.
He was a wonderful artist at one time, you know.
Einstein's hobby was the fiddle, and Boden's hobby was drawing.
Still has the mind of a child, but his hand - his hand has the stroke of an adult.
Imagine me, your Johnny... giving therapeutic treatments to Dr. Boden.
Oh, you look so much better than you did the last time.
Well, you tell Swanee, Boden's apt to snap back to sanity at any moment... and when that happens -
I'll crack that jigsaw.
What about my perjury?
Dr. Cristo will be delighted.
Don't you see, Cathy?
The killer could score another victim if he's not exposed.
And the judge will understand why you lied.
Dr. Boden.
Dr. Boden wanted.
Dr. Boden wanted at the Pentagon.
Dr. Boden wanted at
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Dr. Boden wanted at Newfoundland.
Dr. Boden wanted.
Dr. Boden -
Dr. Boden wanted at
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Dr. Boden wanted at Newfoundland.
- Dr. Boden wanted at Newfoundland.
...at the Pentagon.
Not again.
Rockets were fired off in Newfoundland in 1953.
I detected the first hint of the radiation belt, didn't I?
Let me alone. I'm through.
He's rational!
Hey, not now.
Oh, God, don't let me lose my voice now!
Hold still, John.
You're moving too much.
You know, John... we've become too sophisticated in the art of death.
Please, please, let me ask him.
I've got to ask him!
There's a sense of doom, crises.
I'll - I'll write the question.
No-No, it's liable to snap him back to childhood.
I-I've got to get my voice back!
We have too many intellectuals who are afraid to use... the pistol of common sense.
Don't panic!
John, how can I finish your portrait when you keep moving around?
Don't panic now!
Your voice came back in the ward, didn't it?
Don't panic. It'll come.
Ah.
I'm getting it.
Yes, my boy.
I got fed up with man taking a daily hammer and sickle-coated pill of venom.
If I keep saying it over and over and over in my mind... the words will have to jump out of my mouth!
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?
I'm a pure scientist.
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?
Let the Russians claim bigger satellites.
Now, if they are the first to... discover the mating habits of sea horses... must we then race them to discover the inner structure of a grasshopper's brain?
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?
We should take advantage of our ignorance... and quit living like tigers - tigers in bomb shelters instead of homes.
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?
Today, with all this talk of the panic button, we're right on the brink of disaster.
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?
Today everybody's giving the human race two weeks to get out.
Now, I cannot live with a two-week notice.
Well, so I quit living.
Who killed Sloan in the kitchen?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, I remember Sloan.
You know, uh, for an insane man, he had morals.
I was down in the kitchen with two friends, and we were under this table.
Who killed him?
And we saw Sloan confront this attendant.
What was his name?
And Sloan threatened to expose him to Dr. Cristo.
And do you know why?
For taking sexual advantage of feeble-minded women... in the ladies' ward.
Who killed Sloan?
Wilkes.
Wilkes! I've broken the story! Thank God!
Take a look, John.
It's a perfect likeness.
What's that?
Well, it's your portrait, of course.
You must be crazy.
That's not me.
I only draw what I see, John.
That's not me!
Oh! I don't - I don't want to play!
I don't want to -
I don't want to play!
- That's not me!
- I don't want to play!
That's not me! That's not me!
Will you -
That's not me!
That's not me!
That's not me!
That's not me!
Ah, that's not me!
That's not me!
Not me!
That's not me!
- I don't want to play.
- That's not me!
- That's not me!
- I don't want to play anymore with you.
I - I'm not gonna play... with you anymore.
Dr. Cristo...
I know who killed Sloan in the kitchen.
You've been hearing stories from a patient.
No, no, no. I'm telling you,
I remember.
So you call the paper and tell Swanee that I know.
I know who the killer is.
It's Dr. Cristo.
No.
It's Cathy.
No.
I killed Sloan.
Yeah, I killed Sloan.
I killed him.
- Wilkes?
- Yes, sir?
Keep him under restraint until further orders.
Killed Sloan.
Are you sure you killed Sloan?
Sure, I'm sure.
No.
Cathy did.
Cathy killed Sloan.
Why are you interested in Sloan?
Wilkes killed him.
Who told you I killed him?
Dr. Cristo.
No. Cathy did.
Cathy killed him.
Cathy killed Sloan.
Cathy did it.
Cathy killed Sloan.
Hmm.
Why should Cathy kill him?
Somebody do something about my head!
Help my head!
It hurts!
Why aren't you taking a little walk in the street?
With these on?
- What's wrong with them?
- It's embarrassing.
That's a good sign.
How's the headache?
Gone. I lost it in the hole.
- You know who I am?
- Dr. Cristo.
That's Mr. Wilkes, Mr. Lloyd, and I'm a different man.
Who killed Sloan?
I wish I could remember the name.
Watch it now.
This may be a trap!
Two attendants here.
Could be one of them.
Who?
Sloan.
Who's Sloan?
Remove it.
Well, I think it's time you got a little exercise, John.
Thank you, Doctor.
Wilkes, relieve Kellogg in Hydro, eh?
Yes, sir.
I think you're making progress, John.
Real progress.
He gave me the name of the killer.
He named the killer, and I can't remember!
I just don't understand!
He handed the story to me right on a platter!
Right on a platter.
He gave me the name. I've got to -
Why can't I think of a name?
Name!
I can't remember the name of the killer!
- Did you feel that?
- What?
It's beginning to rain.
I like the rain.
That was such a sour note, John.
You were way off-key.
I remember. Wilkes. Wilkes!
Dr. Cristo, you've got to listen to me.
You've got to let me out of here. Please.
Call my paper. Talk to Swanee.
He'll tell you why I'm here.
- Now, John, don't start that again.
- Wilkes killed Sloan. I swear it!
Get Wilkes. I can prove it!
- I thought you killed him, John.
- Doctor, I'm not nuts!
I'm here for the paper!
I'm a plant!
Now forget all about Sloan, huh?
Mmm.
Why don't you keep Pagliacci company?
Have him sing La Boheme for you.
Yes, sir.
Where did Cristo send Wilkes? Where?
I remember.
Hydro. Hydrotherapy!
I remember! Hydrotherapy!
Who killed Sloan?
Tell me, or I'll tear 'em off!
Tell me, or I'll tear your ears off!
Who killed Sloan?
Who killed Sloan?
Who killed Sloan?
Tell me!
I killed Sloan!
Now, if you don't mind...
I'd like you to call my paper... and ask Swanee to confirm that I was a plant here.
That is a load off my mind, Doc.
He was sane enough to write that story.
He has been sane for weeks.
Don't you stand there and tell me that there's nothing you can do for him.
Why?
Why is he like that?
Oh, God in heaven.
Well, a man can't tamper with a mind and live in a mental hospital... and subject himself to all kinds of tests and expect to come out of it sane.
John is a catatonic schizophrenic.
What a tragedy.
An insane mute will win the Pulitzer Prize.
He is not insane!
John... hold out your hand.
Johnny!
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!
J -
Oh, Johnny.
Johnny, it's me!
It's Cathy, Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny, it's Cathy. It's me.
No.
No, no, no, no!
Oh, Johnny, no!
Patients who behave are permitted to congregate in this corridor.
This is the beat of a human heart.
Sit very still and listen.
Is your heart beating in this same rhythm?
You are experiencing the heartbeat of a dying man.
And it is with death and dying that we concern ourselves.
What happens at the point of death.
What happens afterwards.
What happens after death
to someone who does not choose to... stay dead?
Someone like... Morella.
Whoa.
Ma'am... I have to get back to Boston.
Yes. Leave the trunk here, then. I'll have one of my father's servants carry it in.
Yes, ma'am.
Giddap.
Is anyone there?
Father?
Father?
Who are you?
Father?
- What?
- It's Lenora, Father.
You... are my father?
Yes.
What do you want here?
Shocked?
Disgusted?
No.
Are you all alone here?
I was... until you came.
- Father, I came to see you.
- Now you've seen me. Are you content?
That's all? That's all you have to say to me after 26 years of separation?
- Father, I came all the way from...
- I know.
I know you don't love me, father, that you put me from your life, except for 21 years of board and tuition money.
But I had hoped that we'd enjoy one brief visit together before I left your life entirely.
I have no way of getting back to Boston at the moment. May I stay?
Do as you wish.
Morella, my beloved wife, your murderer has returned.
Get away from her.
Father, has she been lying here all these years?
Do you hear me?
- Why did you come here?
- Don't touch me!
I'm not a helpless baby this time.
I'll go when I... when I choose.
When I...
Oh, my God! My God!
Why did I come here? Why?
- Try to understand.
- Oh, I understand.
No. You understand nothing.
You understand nothing!
When she died, I died with her.
All that remained of me was this... this walking corpse, this shell, this ghost of flesh.
She was my life.
And... I killed her.
- That's it, isn't it?
- Yes!
Oh, no.
No. She thought you did.
She said so on her deathbed.
She was so young.
So alive.
To die just a few months after giving birth to you - she couldn't accept it.
I hated you.
Oh, dear God, how I hated you!
I wanted to kill you.
I went into your nursery and I took you out of your cradle and I almost hurled you out of the window!
I wish you had.
What?
You're ill.
I have a few months left to live.
We're both dead now, Father.
I'm sorry.
In my 26th year, my father is finally concerned about me.
Did you ever stop to wonder just once in all those 26 years:
"Where is my daughter?
What is she doing? Is she happy?"
No.
Why should you wonder that?
After all, I'm only your child.
- I'll be leaving very soon.
- Lenora.
- No! No!
- Forgive me. Forgive me.
- No. No.
- Forgive me.
How long have you been alone?
I don't know, Lenora.
Go on, please. What happened then?
There's not much more to add.
It came as no surprise to me that my marriage ended in failure.
I'd failed before in my relationships with men, many times.
Many times.
I... cannot give, you see.
Yes.
How did she die, Father?
How did she die?
There was this party, and...
I knew that she was too weak to withstand the strain of it.
Yet she insisted.
She had to have this party.
She had to dress up in her finest gown and dance and sing.
Less than an hour after the party had begun, she collapsed.
I picked her up in my arms and I carried her up to her bedroom.
I put her on her bed.
Her face was white.
Oh, dear God, how white!
She was enraged, furious!
Even dying, she was enraged.
"It was the baby," she said.
She swore she'd avenge herself.
"It was the baby." She kept saying it over and over again. "It was the baby!"
And then... before even the doctor could arrive, she was dead.
Why did you not bury her?
I did, but I could not leave her there.
I could not.
The thought of imprisoning her beauty in a box, of putting her underneath the ground...
I was deranged, Lenora. Insane with grief.
I only wanted to kill myself.
I almost did kill myself, a dozen times.
I'll never know what kept me from it.
No, I... I could not bury her.
And now?
There's no reason not to do it now.
Will you stay for a while?
Please.
I know it's too late to make amends, but perhaps together we could find some sort of an answer.
Perhaps.
- Then you'll stay?
- If you really want me to.
Yes.
Then you've come home at last.
At last!
Help me!
Go away... Leave me...
Lenora, what is it? What can I do?
- Lenora, what's wrong?
- Let go...
Lenora!
Lenora!
Oh, no!
No!
How I envy you.
Sleep.
Now you are released.
Come back, Lenora. Come back.
Lenora?
Lenora?
Morella! Oh, my God!
Where's Lenora?
What have you done to her?
All these years I've waited to return.
All these years
I've waited to avenge myself.
And what is it that happens just before death
which leads inexorably to that death?
Our second tale provides one roguish answer to that question
in the story of a man who hated a cat:
The Black Cat.
Why don't you watch where I'm going?
♪ Who dat... knocking at the door?
Montresor?
Montresor?
Come down here.
And keep that beast away from me or I'll kick his head in!
I want some money.
There is none, Montresor.
"There is none, Montresor."
Always lying, it's a fact.
As if I wouldn't know you had more nest eggs than a chicken.
Get away from me, you repulsive creature!
And stay away from me!
Where's my money?
There is none, Montresor.
All right.
I'll find it.
Oh! Montresor!
If you don't give me the money,
I have to find it myself.
Oh.
Oh, I know where it is.
I know.
If I ever catch you again, you mangy, insufferable brute, I'll... I'll...
I'll tear your head off!
By the root!
Oh, you won't bite me.
Give me my money!
There is none, Montresor.
You haven't worked in 17 years.
Will you?
Has it been that long?
Oh, stop your silly tactics.
What about your sewing money?
- We need that for food.
- Food!
That's exactly what I want it for.
I drink my food!
Give me the money.
Thank you for looking into your heart.
We will starve now. That's all we have.
You've got a lot of money hidden all around the whole house. I know that.
He was so romantic... once.
I said get out! And stay out!
You pig, you. You... you dog!
How dare you throw me out!
If only I had a pistol.
If I had a pistol, I'd...
I'd probably sell it and buy myself more wine.
Oh, but really...
After all I've done for her, she should have given me more money.
There's just no gratitude.
Sir, would you help a veteran of the Revolutionary War?
Out of my way!
Pardon me, ladies, but could you spare a coin for a moral cripple?
Disgraceful!
Do you have some money for a dying man?
Go sleep it off.
No gratitude.
Hey.
I want money!
- Scum!
- You dirty money-grubber.
Just no gratitude.
No kindness.
Top of the morning, everybody!
My, what a nice bunch of gentlemen!
Look.Look.
Beautiful.
One moment, please.
Gentlemen. Quiet, everybody.
As we promised before, a treat for everyone.
A demonstration in expert wine tasting by none other than...
Mr. Fortunato Luchresi himself.
Bravo! Bravo!
As you know, gentlemen,
Mr. Luchresi is without doubt the foremost wine taster in the civilised world today.
Huh?
That's nonsense!
I can tell the taste of any wine just as well as he can.
Liar!
If we may proceed...
I said, I can tell the taste of any wine... just as well as anybody!
Afraid to try me, huh?
You coward!
You poseur.
I say call the police!
One moment!
Please.
Sir, unless you are intent on mere rabble-rousing, you have just made a most grave and serious accusation.
An accusation which I am prepared to follow up with action.
That is, if you care to take the risk.
We will take the risk.
- Oh?
- Oh, yes, yes.
My name is Fortunato Luchresi, at your service.
Montresor Herringbone!
What are we waiting for?
Bring on the wine.
Bring on the wine.
Pinot Noir, Burgundy,
Clos de Vougeot.
Vintage... 1838.
- Quite passable.
- Correct!
Give me more. Don't be so stingy.
Burgundy. Volnay, 1832. And... it's from the better slopes of the vineyard.
It's... it's very good.
Correct.
I don't believe it.
Mmm.
Mmm... Bordeaux... Cabernet...
Chateau Margaux.
Vintage... 1837.
A bit heavy for a Margaux.
Correct!
Mmm. Mmm!
Château Petit-Village...
It's very good.
Correct.
Well, I must say, you seem to know your wine, sir.
I should, I should.
However, I feel I must comment on your most unorthodox method of tasting.
Huh?
The accredited procedure is, of course, to partake of a small mouthful, like this, whoosh it around in the mouth like that, and then inhale like this, thus releasing the aroma...
You do it your way and I do it my way.
Châ...
Château...
Châ... teau...
Savignon!
It's very good.

Here I am, young and handsome.
- Oh!
- Oh.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
A very good friend of mine.
The best friend I ever had in the whole wide world.
What was your name, friend?
Luchresi.
Fortunato Luchresi at your service, ma'am.
I am Annabel Herringbone.
I was just trying to help my friend home.
He had too much to drink!
Asseyez-vous, Sam.
No, really, I must be going.
Asseyez-vous, Sam.
Thank you.
Come on and sit down, friend.
Siddown!
- You... you live in the city, Mr. Luchresi?
- Yes. Yes, I do, Mrs. Herringbone.
My, what a lovely cat!
Well!
- You like cats?
- Oh, I adore them, yes.
I have several of my own at home.
He's... resting.
Yes, he's... resting.
Oh.
I think he's ill.
Oh.
I tell you this: With women... with women you have to assert yourself.
Take my case, for instance.
I tell my wife to give me some money.
I want to go out for the evening.
Well, sir, it used to be that she gave me trouble.
Argued with me and tried to withhold what was rightfully mine.
But now she just gives me all the money I ask for, and I can stay away the entire night doing exactly as I please - which happens to be drinking.
- Since when?
- Since when?
Huh?
Seems to me... since that day I went to that wine sellers convention and met...
And he assisted me home and I...
I introduced him to my wife.
- Good night, my treasure.
- Good night, beloved.
Let me look at you again.
Until tomorrow night, heart of my heart.
Oh!
Good evening, dear.
You gave me such a start.
- Why?
- I didn't expect you home so early.
You didn't?
I thought it would be nice if I came home early and we spent some time together.
But I see you've already gone to bed.
Oh, yes. I... I was very tired.
Exerting yourself?
Exerting?
I had a very strenuous day.
And a more strenuous evening, I assume.
I beg your pardon?
- Isn't it a little too late to beg my pardon?
- I... I don't know what you mean.
You lie! You dirty, faithless little trollop, you!
You lie!
So you know.
How long has this been going on?
Long enough for me to realise that our marriage is a farce, a mockery!
You can no longer wound me with your cruelty.
I have found, at long last, love.
How touching.
Mock me if you will, but this is the end.
You and I are finished.
I'm going to leave you and become Mrs. Fortunato Luchresi!
You are?
Congratulations.
Good afternoon, Mr. Herringbone!
- How very nice to see you again.
- And how nice to see you again!
- And how well you look.
- Thank you, sir. And yourself as well.
- Thank you. Come in.
- Thank you.
- After you, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
And how nice of you and Mrs., uh...
Mrs. Herringbone to invite me for dinner.
Oh, we're enchanted to have you, sir.
Most delighted, I assure you.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Ah, the cat!
The cat. What a charming fellow he is!
- Yes, isn't he?
- Yes. And is Mrs. Herringbone about?
Oh, yes. She's very, very busy preparing our dinner.
- May I offer you some sherry?
- Oh, I'm delighted, sir. Delighted!
- Amontillado?
- That's correct, sir.
Ah, but what an amontillado!
A wine to conjure memories of taste buds in transport.
I'm terribly happy you like it, sir.
To your health.
- And to yours, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- A draught from paradise.
- That it is, that it is.
Let me fill your glass.
Look, mine is always empty.
- Well, I cannot resist.
- That I've noticed.
- I beg your pardon?
- No, nothing, nothing.
To your long life.
And to your long life, sir.
Right now I have a better chance than you have.
- You spoke, sir?
- No, no. Nothing.
- Let me fill up your glass.
- Well, just a bit more.
Where did you get this...- pardon me - this excellent wine?
Oh, I've had that in my cellar for a long, long time.
- Indeed?
- Saving it for a very special occasion.
- Oh, today?
- Yes, sir.
- What occasion? Surely not my presence.
- That's part of it.
And what is the other part?
Your death.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'll give you three guesses.
- Surely you can't mean to?
- Wall you in, yes.
- But why?
- Ask your treasure, your heart of hearts.
- What?
- Ask Annabel!
Annabel? I...
Ann... a... bel?
You... you killed her.
You notice everything, don't you?
Help!
Please, let me go. Help!
Don't make so much noise. I don't like it.
- You're insane!
- That may be, but... very clever.
The way I put that drug in your amontillado with the consummate skill of a Borgia.
And this whole arrangement.
- They'll never find you behind this wall.
- You can't mean it. You can't mean it!
Haven't I convinced you of my sincerity yet?
I'm genuinely dedicated to your destruction.
Help! Help!
Help!
What kind of a man are you, anyway?
Make love to my wife and doesn't even talk to me!
It's an excellent jest, sir.
We'll have many a good laugh about it in the future.
I Will. I Will.
God...
For the love of God, Montresor...
Yes.
For the love of God.
Nice professional job.
She must have it hidden somewhere.
Eureka!
Everybody back to the counter!
Montresor is buying again!
Gentlemen, let's have a toast, huh?
To my precious wife, without whose money this most splendid evening would be impossible.
Where she is now, she won't need it anyway.
♪ Who dat knocking at the door?
Is dat you, Sam?
Argh! Argh!
Aaargh!
Give me back my head!
Keep that cat from my head, will you?!
Keep that cat from...
Give me back my head!
Aaaaargh!
Huh!
Go away!
I said... go away!
- Mr. Herringbone?
- Yes.
- We knocked, but no one answered.
- The door was ajar, so we looked in.
Then when we found the house in such a state...
In such a state?
Oh, yes. I...
I remember I was searching for something last night.
We thought there'd been some trouble, so we came right in.
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm all right!
We've received a report from a Mr. Wilkins.
He's the bartender at the Red Lion Tavern.
You know Mr. Wilkins.
Claims you spent a rather large amount of money last evening.
Well, it's my own money.
Can't I spend my own money?
Further, that you said that your wife wouldn't need the money where she is.
Might I ask, sir, where your wife is?
She's gone. She left with her lover.
I don't know where she is, nor do I care.
Are you ill, sir?
No, I... No.
You don't happen to have a little whisky on you, boys, huh?
No, sir.
You see, I've had hallucinations lately.
Been drinking a little bit too much last night.
I see. Do you mind, sir, if we search the premises?
No. Where do you want to start?
I think... the cellar.
The cellar.
Oh. Are you coming down, Montresor?
- Did you hear anything?
- No.
- No.
- I didn't think so.
Well, here we go, gentlemen.
Yes. Come on down.
I...
I think I'll drink a little less in the future.
Now he decides.
- Shut up.
- What?
Nothing, nothing.
I just keep mumbling.
I had too much to drink.
- We had better make a thorough search.
- Search?
Don't you find everything all right and in order?
Go ahead, search everything you want. I don't care.
Montresor! What a thing to say.
Naughty, naughty, Montresor.
Keep quiet!
Whoo-ooh!
Whoo-ooh!
Right behind here, Mr. Policeman.
We're right behind the wall! Right behind it.
Are you blind, Mr. Policeman?
Whoo-ooh! You're not paying attention. You're getting cold. This way.
Now are you satisfied?
What do you think?
I buried them down here?
That's exactly what he did. Exactly!
Where would I have hidden them?
Under this floor?
Or... or maybe in that wall, huh?
Look! Look how solid it is!
Look at it! Look!
What in the name of God?
- You can hear it too?
- Hear it?
What's behind there?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Well, we'll see.
What exactly is it that occurs at the moment of death?
Especially to a man who, in that moment, is not permitted to die.
As in the case of Mr. Valdemar.
There is no pain.
No...
Dairy.
You are at peace, mind and body at peace entirely.
Yes.
Then listen to the sound of my voice.
Carefully.
Pain vanished.
Mind and body in a state of peace.
You understand this, Valdemar?
I... under... stand.
Then sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
When my hand passes across your face, waken.
- Are you all right?
- Perfectly, my dear.
- The pain, it's gone?
- Vanished!
What is your finding, Doctor?
- Well, you seem to be in good condition.
- Seem to be? But I am!
Oh, come now. Admit the truth of it:
Mesmerism works! It works.
I've never doubted that it works, sir.
Only its advisability in certain cases.
It would certainly seem to be advisable in the case of Mr. Valdemar.
Or would you have me suffer untold agonies of pain in order to observe strict medical protocol?
- Ernest!
- My sweet Helene.
Forgive me, both of you, for my most untimely sense of humour.
But this is a joyous moment.
Smile!
Come. Let us drink.
Let us drink to mesmerism, the ministration of the gods.
I'm sorry, I can't drink to that.
Then drink to the health of my beautiful wife.
- To the very good health of you both.
- And to Mr. Carmichael.
Sir.
How blessed to be free of pain.
For that part, sir,
I am truly happy. Please believe me.
It's for the other aspect of mesmeric influence that I feel concerned.
- Which is, Doctor?
- Perilous toying with the human mind.
But, my dear Dr. James, what is perilous about it?
Mr. Valdemar has received nothing but advantage from its applications.
And, as we all know, he is dying of an incurable disease.
- I wish you'd stop refer...
- Helene, Helene.
The issue must be acknowledged.
Within this skull - as well you know, Doctor - there is tissue which is dying even as I speak.
I am physically doomed.
I do not say this out of bitterness or despair.
However, there is one favour I would ask:
To escape a pitiful and painful decline to death through the auspices of Mr. Carmichael.
- Would you deny him this, Doctor?
- No, sir.
And yet, you know, he will accept nothing for this blessing, save some trifling favour on my deathbed.
- Sir?
- Favour, Ernest?
I should not even have mentioned it. It's so slight.
No, please. I want to know.
Well, my dear, it's simply...
You tell them, sir. You can explain it so much better than I.
Mr. Valdemar has consented to be mesmerised in articulo mortis.
- Which is to say...
- At the point of death.
I fear it sounds more dreadful than it really is.
What does it mean?
Ernest, why?
To ascertain just how long the actual moment of death can be forestalled.
A momentous experiment.
Momentous? Monstrous would be more the word!
Sir, I appeal to you, withdraw this offer.
The deathbed is no place for lunatic experiments.
My dear young friend, what can it matter whether I die 10 or 20 minutes beyond that point when I shall die at any rate?
What could be less important?
I owe this gentleman a great deal.
A great deal.
I could not dream of refusing him such an insignificant request.
As you say, sir.
- I fear I must leave now.
- So soon? I am sorry.
Good night, Doctor.
Thank you for attending me.
My dear, show our friend to the door, will you?
Yes, of course.
A bit more wine, Mr. Carmichael? Hm?
Oh! Thank you.
Elliot, this experiment...
Do everything in your power to dissuade him from it, Helene.
I've no proof that it's dangerous, no proof whatever. I only sense that it might be.
What is it, Elliot? Why is it that since that man entered our life
I can't think, I'm uncertain...
Oh, he helps Ernest.
I can't argue with that.
He seems to relieve him of all pain. To see him suffer is more than I can stand.
- But at the same time...
- You distrust Carmichael?
Yes, I do.
Still, it's true that he asks for nothing.
Perhaps he asks for nothing because he desires everything - including you.
You can't be serious.
- You haven't seen him looking at you?
- Yes, but...
Of course I've no right to say this, really, for I too look at you.
Elliot, please.
You know how I feel.
I love my husband and respect him.
- No more than I do.
- I know that.
So let us think of nothing else but Ernest and our respect for him.
- Good night, Helene.
- Good night.
Ernest.
Hm? Oh. Yes, my dear?
Won't you reconsider?
- Regarding the experiment?
- I fear him.
Fear Carmichael? But, my dear, think of the pain he has spared me.
If only you could see the change in him when you're under his control, Ernest.
All the fawning ceases. He no longer calls you Mr. Valdemar. It's just Valdemar.
- He tells you what to do, what to think.
- Please, my dear. No more.
Let us forget it.
It is established and of no importance.
What is important is you.
I wish with all my heart that following my death you would marry our good Dr. James.
No, no, no. Please, my dear. Let me finish.
I know that there is a bond between you.
All honourable. I know that too, and I love you both for it.
But I... I am going to die soon, Helene, and it would make me very happy to know that you would not be alone, that you would marry again.
Oh, my dear. Your happiness means more to me than anything.
Anything!
But I refuse to die until that happiness has been assured.
It... it approaches, does it not?
No pretence, please.
It approaches.
No, my dear. No sorrow. I...
I am content, believe me.
Have you informed Mr. Carmichael, as I requested?
- He is below, sir.
- Then fetch him, if you will.
Quickly. Go quickly.
Have a care, sir.
So... the time has come, Mr. Carmichael.
It will be to you, sir, I promise, no more than sinking into a dreamless sleep.
Best hurry, Mr. Carmichael.
Now, no despair, I implore you.
It is peace I go to.
Freedom from this ghastly pain.
Your hand, Doctor.
I charge you this... upon your soul:
Watch over my Helene.
- Swear to it?
- I swear to it. Rest easily, sir.
I do now.
With all my heart I thank you... for having added to my life one great, sweet measure of devotion.
No...
You may proceed, Mr. Carmichael.
Look at the turning wheel, at the changing of the colours, and sleep.
Deep... deep sleep.
Your body losing all sensation.
Your mind enveloped in darkness.
Nothing can disturb you now as you drift ever deeper into darkness... and sleep.
Sleep...
Sleep...
Valdemar.
Do you hear me? It is my voice.
I... hear.
Are you asleep?
I... am... asleep.
Valdemar, raise your right arm.
Lower it.
Is there any pain?
No... pain.
I am... dying-
Oh!
Please... do not wake me.
Let me... die.
I will not wake you, Valdemar.
Deep... deep sleep... from which there is no waking... unless I say.
- You understand, Valdemar?
- I... understand.
You may examine him now if you wish.
Do you so fear me?
I have but released your husband from his pain once more.
- Would you have had me do otherwise?
- No.
- Then do I... personally offend you?
- Please, Mr. Carmichael, not now.
Valdemar, return to your sleep.
Return to your sleep, Valdemar!
- I command you!
- Stop it!
Valdemar.
Do you hear me?
Do you hear the sound of my voice?
Are you asleep now?
I... have been... asleep.
But now... I am... dead.
You are asleep, Valdemar.
No.
Yes, yes, yes. You do but sleep.
Raise your right arm.
Raise it, Valdemar!
I command you! Raise your right arm!
He does not. He does not.
He is dead.
Yes, he is dead.
But still aware.
- Release him.
- Release him?!
Valdemar, do you hear me?
I hear.
Tell me, where are you?
Darkness.
- Stop it!
- That will do, Mr. Carmichael.
Where, Valdemar? Where?
Stop it!
- End the control, Mr. Carmichael!
- No!
Valdemar, tell me what you see.
- Your surroundings, what are they?
- That will do!
Are you insane?! Do you not comprehend the import of what has happened?
His body is dead, but his mind lives on, controlled by me!
- Which control will now end! Let him die!
- No!
Be gone!
Where am I?
What place is this?
I see only darkness.
People.
Multitudes of people.
No...
No-o-o-o!
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!
Valdemar, be still.
Help me.
Be still, Valdemar.
I will let you go when I am finished.
Your whisky, sir.
Leave it there.
Get out!
Valdemar.
Valdemar, do you hear me?
Be still.
Be still!
Release me.
Release me.
Give me peace.
Be still!
Release me.
Let me go.
I will release you when I am ready.
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.
- Is Mr. Carmichael upstairs?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Come. I promise you an end to it, Helene.
HOW?
Come.
Now, tell me this.
Come in.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm here to order you, Mr. Carmichael...
Not request, but order. You will end the mesmeric control immediately.
- Will I, Doctor?
- You will.
And how do you propose to enforce that order?
With this.
- You wouldn't dare.
- Do you choose to take that risk?
If you kill me, Valdemar will remain in the same state indefinitely.
- Perhaps for ever.
- No!
- I shall count to three, then I shall kill you.
- Elliot!
- You must be out of your mind.
- One.
- No.
- Two.
- Elliot, no!
- Wait a minute.
- I want you to hear something first.
- Nothing from you, sir.
Did I say it was from me?
If you will, come with me.
Valdemar.
Tell them what you told me just now, about Helene.
I do not wish for her to marry Dr. James.
I wish for her to marry Mr. Carmichael.
- No!
- You heard him, madam.
- You control him. His words are yours!
- That is a lie!
- Is it?
- Yes!
Elliot, please, you must leave now.
- What?
- I want you to go.
- But that was not your husband speaking!
- It was his voice.
- But not his will!
- I don't know that.
- Helene, in the name of God!
- Elliot, please go.
There's nothing more to be said or done.
I just want you to go now.
Very well. But I shall be back.
And God help you if you do her harm in any way.
- Well, madam?
- I believe Dr. James is quite correct.
It is not my husband who would have me marry you.
- You heard him with your own ears.
- It was not him.
However, I will make a bargain with you, Mr. Carmichael.
I'll marry you... upon the stipulation that you set my husband free.
I need make no bargains with you, madam.
- What?
- You will marry me in any case.
No. Not unless you end his torment.
Edicts, madam? Orders from you?
Allow me to enlighten you.
I am in command here.
You will do as I say, or I will leave Mr. Valdemar exactly as he is and never, do you understand me, madam?, Never let him go.
I've coveted you these many months, hungered for you.
And now you shall be my wife.
I shall take what I desire.
- Your body and your soul, if I demand it!
- I've heard enough!
No! Stop it! Let me go!
Let me go! You're hurting me!
Help! Help me!
Let me go! Help! Help me!
No!
Argh!
Helene! Helene!
Ugh!
Se駉r Don Pedro,
I 'v e found the answer.
Le漵 have some wine.
Perhaps this midnight oil will mark our vigil for the last time tonight.
Come, se駉r, please,
I 'd like to show you something.
You're sad.
Le漵 drin k this fine wine.
We'll all soon come to rest in the eternal night.
How could you be so careless?
If he had read the end, the events which are to follow would ma k e no sense.
Luckily,
I arriv ed in time.
Strange things are happening here, se駉r.
I 'v e seen it with my own eyes,
I even had it in my own hands.
It must be all due to the e vil spirits.
I understand, se駉r, that your mind is rebelling against inexplicable phenomena, but be so kind as to explain in detail.
What are you looking for, se駉r?
There was a book here.
I saw the gallows.
Where has it gone?
Here?
There's never been a book like that here.
Demons again? they are tiring,
I admit.
U nfortunately, the world is full of them.
I ncantations stop their mischief.
Nonsense.
Don't you believe in incantations then?
No.
What if I prove it?
Only if I can perform them my self.
Go on, se駉r.
This is not the place for philosophical disputes.
I am so glad to see you, brother.
When did you get back?
This is Alfonso Van Worden, captain of the guard.
Captain, my sister Rebecca.
Don Pedro Velasquez.
Se駉ra.
I will do my best.
I am glad to con vince you of the power of the supernatural.
Of course.
From Aristotle came the principle that in the mind...
Se駉r Alfonso, I implore you to tell me what you thin k of everything you'v e experienced since arriving here.
I wouldn't know where to start.
I must have been put to sleep with a potion and ta k en to the gallows.
Then you got under the Z ota brothers' gallows?
And found them both hanged?
Do they, byanychance, have the habit of coming down?
Very often, usually at night.
Your hand shows that you are possessed with love for the demons.
Such people have no fear of humans.
I am afraid of nobody.
I am afraid for you.
I am so glad they came.
Gaiety and fun will prevail now.
I am sorry, se駉ra, but I have different plans.
Whatever your decision, you won't refuse to spend a few hours in our compan y.
Your brother is greeting a gypsyso warmly.
A gyps y?
You'll see in a while what a gypsyhe is.
Welcome, Se駉r Alfonso.
How do you know who I am?
Our camp moves from one place to another, and my daughters k eep their eyes and ears open.
An enchanted place.
The people of the Sierra are afraid to go near.
I have no reason to tell them they're wrong.
It is better that most of my retinue was left outside.
Se駉r Av adoro, in this errant life you must have encountered manyunusual adv entures.
I have.
Then tell us, and Se駉r Velasquez will teach us how to experience poetry without the help of ghosts.
I do not succumb to ghosts, but I fear your magic power, se駉ra.
I reck on that from one end of the world to the other, the story of love is always the same.
I thin k you will enjoyhearing about my youthful adv entures.
Some are surprising,
I could even sa y, miraculous.
Whenever I go back to those long gone times of my life,
I hear the noise of avariety of passions and a mix ed roaring of storms.
You seem wiser than others, and I have a delicate problem.
Will you follow me?
I am the lover of a certain young person.
She tends, I thin k, to be fickle.
When you see a woman whose dress suits this, you'll see whether she goes to church, or in another direction.
Here.
You'll get another if you do well.
You're her husband, not her lover.
I 'm pa ying you to discover treason, not who I am.
Sharpen your sight, i漵 time forvespers.
I 'll wait at the inn.
Of lovers.
Of lovers.
What is this?
Your beauty troubled me.
Somebody suspects you of betra ying him.
Follow me.
You will giv e this to Caballero Toledo.
Noble caballero.
My conscience forbids me ta king pa yment from both sides.
What is my fortune?
We'll get married under a big chestnut tree.
Nature will accept ourvows.
The rosyglow of dawn will bless us.
I 'v e lost Caballero Toledo 's address.
He in vited me to a grand feast.
On the other side of the square.
U ntil we meet again.
Ma ybe.
Se駉r Toledo, a lady wanted me to giv e you this little tok en.
I appreciate your wit, my friend, and honor.
Would you like to become one of my serv ants?
Tha漵 impossible,
I was born a nobleman.
I chose the position of beggar as it does not dim a nobleman's jewel.
An answer worth y of a Spaniard!
Le漵 have a drin k.
H uman life is fragile.
Whythese dark thoughts, se駉r?
I am a sinner.
I used to leave one mistress for another, but I concluded that
I was losing too much time that wa y, so I started a new affair before ha ving brok en off the last, and while planning a third.
Spanish women have something... insistent.
I swore love to each.
The punishment for brea king oaths is terrible.
I ndeed, in the other world.
Yesterda y, a friend from Malta visited.
H is name is Aquillar, a noble person and a good Christian.
I cannot understand how, being endowed with such contradictory characters, we have liv ed in such friendship.
Aren't you drin king?
I 'v e nearly finished the bottle.
You haven't touched your glass.
What are you thin king about?
I was thin king of the sun which I saw toda y, whether I would see it again tomorrow.
You doub tless will, if there is no mist.
I maynot liv e to see tomorrow.
Are you planning a duel?
I could act as your witness.
You are the last man
I would as k for this favor.
Good heavens!
You took up your old squabble with my brother?
Shall I lose my friend or my brother in one duel?
I have an ominous feeling... wait until midnight.
If I die, I will come to warn you about the penalties a sinner faces after he dies.
I didn't want to see you, but avoice from heaven ordered me to come.
Were you killed?
I was.
I s there a purgatory in the other world?
There is one.
And tha漵 where I am!
Who died?
Tell me, who died?
Toledo fell unconscious.
I 'm sorry, but my duties are calling me.
At such an interesting point!
Doses of suspense are the sign of a master.
All that has made me confused.
I 'v e lost the feeling of where reality ends, and fantasyta k es over.
You meant to saypoetry.
I do not know what you are aiming at.
I will tell you something that is based on the principles of geometry.
Wanting to define an infinite number,
I write a horizontal eight and divide it byone.
If I want to express infinite smallness,
I write a one and divide it b y the horizontal eight.
All these signs giv e me no idea about what I want to express infinity... greatness...
I n the cosmos, infinite smallness is an infinite root of the smallest part of an atom.
So I am defining infinity, but without comprehending.
Well, if I do not comprehend but I can define it,
I am getting near poetry, which seems to be nearer to life than we suspect.
Empirical science leads to lack of faith.
Only an uneducated man who sees a thing every da y thin k s he understands it.
A true researcher proceeds among riddles.
He errs, but he gets nearer his goal every da y.
Se駉r Av adoro, will you finish Toledo's story?
I remember he was disturbed byavoice from the other world.
Yes.
H is tender soul was very sensitiv e.
So he was in deep despair.
What will you do?
I want to rethin k my life.
Se駉r Caballero, let me ma k e one comment.
Thevoice you heardyesterda y said what you could find in anycatechism.
Do not burden oneself with premature worries.
My friend, he who once heard thevoice of the dead, will surely not spend much more time among the living.
Farewell, my friend.
Tell the lady everything without getting into detail.
I have chosen you as I have a delicate problem.
I would be glad to help, but I am afraid to leave my client.
I can substitute for you, it won't be long.
Listen.
I warn you, he is a prattler and a bore.
You can find something interesting in every story.
You remember the se駉r with whom I dran k wine at your inn?
He is the husband of a young noblewoman.
Discreetly hand this little jewel over to her.
Se駉r Lopez Suarez? like fortune telling, love has its magic.
This tells me you'll see me again soon.
Ma ybe.
You are kind, but the medicine is awful.
I would giv e you a more tasty one, but the medic won't let me.
Sit down.
Sit down, when I tell you to.
I have one soft spot and you will do me a favor.
Ta k e this instrument in your hand... and now listen carefully.
I am the son of Gaspar Suarez, the richest merchant in C 醖iz.
You're wasting time again on romances.
I 'm listening, Daddy.
I漵 time you departed for Madrid.
You have to get to know the world.
Daddy, I want to get married.
First, pass your ex amination in life.
These are the rules you have to follow.
I forbid you to get into discussions with noblemen.
The lords honor us while actually they just want credit, but cannot repa y, understand?
I forbid you to use the title of " Don".
You are Suarez and tha漵 that.
And I also forbid you to use your sword.
The habit brings more discredit than good.
Last but not least, under no circumstances mayyou enter into anyconnections with the house of the ban k er, Moro.
Moro.
And I will reveal to you wh y.
Though I am related to the greatest ban k ers in Spain, seeing how well you are trading with the Philippines,
I will deposit a million with you for a limited partnership.
I am honored.
I 'll try to double your deposit as soon as possible.
You do not need to hurry, se駉r.
Too bad
I didn't hurry.
I am Moro, the royal ban k er, as you know.
My relativ e, Se駉r Liv ardez, has passed awa y.
I n his accounts, there is your cheque for a million.
Will you please return the capital?
I have legally ta k en over his estate.
The million was invested.
It will be doubled in the future, ma ybe even...
I am very sorry.
All right.
Here is your late relativ e's share.
And now listen carefully.
Years later, my ships returned, ha ving tripled the fortune, so I wrote to the ban k er Moro that I had his two million.
My principal receiv ed your letter and begs to inform you that the Liv ardez capital was entered into the book s.
He will not claim anymore.
I owe him two million!
My principal does not even want to hear of it.
This is an insult!
I do not need his generous donation!
He is insulting me!
I began to claim my rights, considering my good name and that of my profession.
I started proceedings.
The tribunal of Se ville pronounced Moro right.
We are to paycourt fees of 600, 000 piastres.
We got no justice.
Sixyears wasted.
And the two million is supposed to be mine?
Tha漵 vile!
You will appeal.
So you see, my son, I have good reasons to forbid you anycontact with the house of the ban k er Moro.
And then?
I said goodbye and, filling my carriage with love stories I had bought in C 醖iz,
I left for Madrid.
Pour me some more of this good mixture, good man.
I feel my strength returning.
These sentimental stories had softened my soul so much that arriving here
I was madly in love, although I didn't know the object of my desire.
Oh, sorry.
Who is that?
Come on in, se駉r.
Se駉r Don Lopez Suarez.
I came to pa y my respects.
I am generally known under the name of... under the name of...
Don Roque Busqueros, a family from Old Castile.
My father has forbidden me to use the title of " Don", and to get involv ed with noblemen.
Senor Don Lopez, my father, in turn, ordered me to giv e the title of " Don" to all prominent merchants, and to seek their compan y.
I also respect my father's will.
Your attitude and the elegance with which you got out of your carriage impressed me.
I s it yours, Don Lopez?
Mine.
Luckycoincidence!
This is what
I passionately collect.
Here, I 'll be glad to oblige.
A real collector always has copies, should one get lost for un known reasons.
And the third could come in handy, when the chance arises.
Don... Roque, I just got out of the carriage.
I am tired and hungry.
Ex actly.
Well, Don Lopez, it isn't becoming that we eat off one plate and use the same spoon and fork.
He y, bo y!
He y, bo y.
Get another set!
Heybo y, get another set!
Busqueros entertained me with gossip from Madrid, while I was impatiently looking forward to getting back to Buen Retiro.
This depopulated park is famous in our romantic stories, and I don't even know what was telling me
I would enter into some tender relationship there.
Se駉ra, I probably found what you are looking for.
I lost my lock et and gold chain.
Was an ything written on it?
You read my name was I nez, and that the original of the portrait is mine.
MayI comment, lovely lady, that the finder usually gets a decent prize?
You're forward for a first meeting.
Congratulations!
You'v e met the son of C 醖iz's richest merchant.
I did not giv e anyreason to have strangers tal k to me.
Lopez Suarez.
Be kind enough to return my lock et.
Begone!
Se駉r Don Lopez,
I 'v e refused twenty in vitations to come and see you.
Well, you have to admit
I did you a favoryesterda y.
Feigning unwittingness,
I told the lady you were the son of one of the richest merchants.
Though she pretended to be angry, it was only to con vince you she was not at all impressed bywealth.
Believe me.
You are young, reasonable and handsome, but remember gold is never an obstacle to love.
How shall we spend the afternoon?
I want to see the town... alone!
You see there was no wa y out of this situation.
Go and sayprayers, then!
It was a lock et from my brother.
Don't as k about an ything else, unless you find something else belonging to me.
Then you'll be able to demand a reward.
We shouldn't be seen together.
Lopez Suarez to...
What?
To I nez.
There is charm in my eyes, comma and you, lady, are the only reason for it.
I would like to put my thoughts in this letter, but they seem... they seem tovanish.
Don Roque, giv e it back!
Where?
Don Roque!
Don Lopez!
Stop, wait!
Well, a letter has to be deliv ered.
You should be grateful to me, se駉r.
Se駉ra.
Whydid you use a man whose impertinence
I already disliked, to bring me your letter?
I wrote that letter for my own pleasure, and that imp stole it.
Ev er since I got to Madrid, he has haunted me like an e vil spirit.
I don't thin k I can be bothered with this nonsense.
And what would you like to know now, se駉r?
Se駉ra, I wish I knew who you were and what your name is.
The daughter of a man who is as rich as your father, the ban k er, Moro.
The curse of my life.
I cannot thin k of you under the threat of my father's curse.
He crossed manyseas to set up as a merchant in C 醖iz.
I n C 醖iz.
Don't believe him and don't lose heart.
Those little heirs are hard to get hook ed, but sooner or later, their turn will come.
You'll scare my dog, meddler!
Now only death is left for me.
Lightning, stri k e me!
Do not be afraid.
I nez loves you more than her life.
Me?
She wants to meet you at the same spot tomorrow at sunset.
I understand that at your age, you don't feel like marriage.
However, I find your ex cuse very strange.
Your father crossed manyseas to set up as a merchant in C 醖iz.
You're luck y,
I 'v e fix ed everything.
Se駉r Don Roque, do one more thing for me:
Do not go to Buen Retiro.
Fair I nez won't be there, but I must sit once more on the same bench and weep over my misfortune.
There's something very offensiv e in your words. they seem to infer some lack of appreciation on your part.
Se駉r.
Jasmine breathes the balmyfragrance, the trees grow greener as you pass under them.
What will happen to a heart which you honor?
I could let you cry in misery alone, but fair I nez maycome, and who will repair your nonsense?
Wha漵 this?
To kill time, I suggest
I tell you a story, in which you will find manyinstructiv e events.
I always had a talent for the law.
I wanted to know people and life.
What is it?
Wha漵 the matter?
Oh, fearsome head!
I thought it was one of my relativ es with whom I was to have an important tal k.
I don't know you or the reason for this unexpected visit.
I had no intention of entering your room.
I just wanted to know who liv es here.
I am a lawy er, studying people's liv es.
Tha漵 different.
Nothing's more pleasant than knowing what people are doing.
Before you wok e up, se駉ra, your husband honored me bythin king my face was a fearsome head.
And she
Se駉r Don Roque, time is passing.
Don Lopez, when a decent man is telling you a fascinating story, you should not interrupt him.
No, no explanations!
This woman
Let me explain everything.
I am the daughter of a brave officer.
My name is Frasquita Salero.
I attracted men, even when
I was a young girl.
Frasquita, Frasquita, be modest!
Be reasonable, Mama!
How can I be bad with such elegant caballeros? haven't you dropped something?
Too bad for me.
If you had dropped that little cross,
I would have pick ed it up and k ept it as a dear souv enir.
Frasquita, get awa y from the window.
U nfortunately, the young man never showed up again.
My beautiful wife.
My sweetness.
Do you love your hubb y?
I do.
And nobody else?
Nobody.
What do you have there, son?
A letter for Se駉ra Frasquita.
Giv e it to me.
I am her father.
Here.
A ring?
What ring?
" I am waiting for you and y earning for you, Pe馻 Flor. "
Frasquita, do you love me?
I do.
Then there are no obstacles to our love.
Perfect, Don Ramino!
If you go on like that with the noble Count Pe馻 Flor, he won't be a nightmare to husbands anymore.
What if I put an end to his conquests?
I 'm afraid of the effects of such a duel.
If I could have
100 doubloons,
I would wait out in the islands.
I 'll gladly offer you 100 for such a noble cause.
The count was murdered last night.
Pe馻 Flor!
From the letter we found on one of the criminals, we know that you offered 100 doubloons for the crime to be carried out.
I have never set eyes on Se駉r Pe馻 Flor.
Yesterda y, two men came with a promissory note for 100 doubloons which I signed ayear ago.
Shall I show you?
No, I am a member of the criminal court, and I am not interested in trade.
That will be all.
Ex cuse us for the inconvenience.
Did you really order this se駉r to be killed?
Whyshould you care?
Do you know him?
I would go on a pilgrimage to St. James of Campostela and even a greater distance, if I believed it could help me.
A wonderful story.
Yes.
Since then, strange things have been happening in the house.
Here are your 100 doubloons back!
Don Diego!
I like it.
Needless to sa y, Count Pe馻 Flor was only made up to upset my husband and ma k e him go on a pilgrimage!
The justice clerk s, as well as the thugs, were all paid off.
Now I understand
"the fearsome head".
And you understand whyI thought you were somebody else.
I haven't finishedyet, se駉r!
Later!
My duties are calling me.
Do you want to offend me, se駉r?
Yes, as there is no other wa y to get rid of you.
Your daddy will surely be glad.
Now.
Where was I?
That same night,
I found my self in entirely different circumstances.
You are luckyonly to be injured, not depriv ed of life.
Eas y, eas y.
I 'v e ta k en things into my own hands.
Things will work out ok ayfor you.
But i漵 too bad you interrupted my story at such an interesting point.
So, listen.
That same night...
I found my self in entirely different circumstances.
Well, and what next?
Se駉r... Don Lopez.
You shouldn't strain yourself, se駉r.
I漵 so long.
Who is it from?
A child, a complete child.
From fair I nez, of course.
I漵 done.
But what is it?
You are supposed to be at her place tonight.
The wedding is tomorrow!
I sn't it enough?
What place?
Moro's house?
Tell me how.
The simple wa y.
But the house is guarded.
The old, well known wa y.
Ta k e it eas y.
I 'll ta k e care of it.
I don't know.
What would you do without me, se駉r?
Which window?
First, second, third.
Which one?
Third!
The window of fair I nez.
My heart is pounding.
I am moved, and please, do not bring anyshame on me.
My gratitude, se駉r, but now we have to use the ultimate means.
When I clap my hands, go up to heaven!
Ready?
Ready!
Well.
Balm breathes.
Jasmine does not.
Oh God!
Did you die?
I did!
I s there purgatory in the other world?
There is one and I am in it!
Was it storm y that night?
Lightning like in hell... it must be whyhe got the wrong window.
Se駉r, I found a purgatorial soul.
Where?
What are you tal king about, man?
Se駉r Toledo.
Listen, se駉r.
So it is the end of my penance.
But how did you find out about it?
Lopez Suarez told me.
The merchant from C 醖iz.
But how did it happen?
Busqueros got the wrong window.
Busqueros?
Ah, Busqueros!
I don't know him, but as k him to come b y.
I 'd like to know more.
What do you thin k?
The lady who gave you a hand k erchief...
I s she still faithful to me?
U ndoub tedly.
Farewell then.
I made up my mind to find that intruder, known all over
Madrid.
Please, don't stop now.
Allow me, se駉ra, to giv e a few moments to this man.
Frasquita told her story to Busqueros, he told it to Lopez Suarez, who in turn told it to
Se駉r Av adoro.
I漵 enough to driv e you craz y.
All these adv entures begin simply.
The listener thin k s i漧l soon be over, but one story creates another, and then another.
Something like quotients which can be divided infinitely.
I 'm a captain of the guard, not a philosopher.
Your math is just dead numbers.
Se駉r, this zero, plus and minus one, gave Archimedes and Newton power equal to the gods.
Very noble men.
But wha漵 the point of it?
We are like blind men lost in the streets of a big city.
The streets lead to a goal, but we often return to the same places to get to where we want to be.
I can see a few little streets here which, as it is now, are going nowhere.
New combinations have to be arranged, then the whole will be clear, because one man cannot invent something that another cannot solv e.
I no longer follow.
Then le漵 k eep listening.
Caballero Toledo regained his former gaiety and balanced soul, and I went to look for that impossible man.
I happened to meet him that same da y.
I like you,
I 'll ta k e you as a serv ant.
Giv e than k s to heaven that unlimited possibilities are opening up to you.
I suppose you haven't met manynoblemen.
I can easily prove that I was brought up as a gentleman.
The fact that I 'm a beggar is down to fate, not birth.
Tha漵 fine.
Le漵 go, se駉r.
At first, your duties won't seem very attractiv e, as you won't be paid or have proper clothes.
As for board...
Are you byanychance the Don Busqueros to whom Lopez Suarez owes so much?
Yes, tha漵 me.
I 'd have ended this whole thing successfully if he hadn't got the wrong window, but le漵 be patient.
Caballero Toledo wishes to get to know you.
Toledo?
I漵 a great honor for me.
I found out that Lopez Senior travelled from C 醖iz, and waited at the house, but ha ving missed his son, went to town.
Where to?
Where can a pro vincial man go?
To see the church.
Wrong, you noble tramp.
To the tavern.
But which one?
The nearest.
But se駉r, what nonsense.
You must admit, C 醖iz is a more important city than Madrid.
Wha漵 more, Suarez, who was short of cash, was trading, than k s to his contacts with Liv ardez.
Moro, in order to retrieve the mone y, had to start a case, which is still unfinished.
Suarez sued Moro to ma k e him accept not a million, but two million from the investment.
The Suarez family is the greatest in Spain and you are an ill informed big mouth.
Than k you for your compan y.
I can see, se駉r, that you're an honest negotiator.
I 'm honored bywhat you'v e said.
I 'm Gaspar Suarez from C醖iz.
My name is Moraredo.
You are heaven sent.
I deduced from your talk that you're a true connoisseur of life.
At your service.
I sent my son here,
I forbade him to use the title
"Don" or frequent nobles.
Very wise.
Or draw a sword.
Understandable.
Just imagine, my Lopez is now
Don Lopez, and the only person he is close to is a nobleman called Busqueros.
U nbelievable.
And he fought him and was thrown out of the window.
I've decided to have him married immediately.
Do you know a young lady from a spotless family?
I do.
What a luckycoincidence.
A reputable merchant also got angry and said he'd closet her in the monastery if she doesn't choose a husband this week.
I 'd love to tal k to her.
You'll meet her toda y.
What in an inn?
A lady from a good family?
I ncognito.
We should hurry.
He's pa ying.
Farewell.
Toda y, more than ever, you'll understand thevalue of my friendship.
You know, Don Lopez, such complex tas k s are my specialty.
From what I gather, you know the merchan漵 life well.
But ex cuse me, Se駉r...
Moraredo.
Your name is not known in merchants' circles.
You know, se駉r...
I presume the situation hasn't allowed you, so far, to try your hand at a business conduciv e to your abilities.
The reason for my beha vior, se駉r, is not impertinence.
I came here only because my father's rage forces me to seek salv ation.
I respect the name of Suarez.
Dear lady,
I 'm honored.
So you intend to marry Se駉rita Moro.
Se駉rita Moro?
Are your intentions not serious?
There's a misunderstanding!
If you can kneel in front of my sister, you're not too old to duel.
Draw or go out the window!
What?
Your honor is at sta k e.
I forbid you to have an ything to do with nobility.
I only got close to the one standing next to you.
You shouldn't have duelled.
Mind, se駉r, you'v e got a sword in your hand too.
Oh, Lopez, whyon earth did you choose Se駉rita Moro?
But you yourself were kneeling at her feet not long ago.
The punishment, Se駉r Gaspar
Suarez, always fits the crime.
If your son ta k es my daughter's hand, it would be an honor.
Although he chose to introduce himself through the window, his actions were undoub tedly due to the grudge over the two million.
I 'll accept it then, pro vided
I can add another two million, and giv e it all to your son, along with my daughter's hand.
You'v e done a good job.
Well done, well done, se駉r.
I漵 not hard to see how i漧l turn out.
Lopez was ta k en to his future father in law's house, and with I nez's care, he'll soon recover.
And now I 'd like to hear more about the other affair.
Was this woman, Frasquita, so charming then?
I told the story you just mentioned to a young gentleman.
Yes,yes, and Lopez Suarez passed it on to my friend, who introduced me to her.
You have an incredible memory, se駉r.
Since you already know
Frasquita's story,
I should tell the story of her husband, and how he got to meet an unfortunate young man.
Go ahead.
That very night,
I found my self in entirely different circumstances.
Who are you?
This sign shows
I 'm in the De vil's power.
Reprobate, stop persecuting me!
Persecute.
What of the doubloons you paid for Count Pe馻 Flor's head?
What do you want of me?
You recognize me?
As you can see, the count, before his death, raised the sta k es.
Don't! Don't!
You'v e giv en us a pleasant hour, se駉r.
You have not disappointed me.
Ex cuse me for telling of things which is a sin in itself, but it is a very instructiv e story.
What happened to
Se駉ra Cornandez?
She became a widow!
Then she married her lover, and ever since, has led a model life.
Here she is!
Well?
But this is Do馻 I scariz.
Frasquita.
What can I do?
I couldn't.
Nor could I! The only wayis
She said
I was her first lover.
There are other women in the world.
Toledo?
Se駉r Toledo!
Run!
Don't panic!
I must thin k it all over again.
More carefully this time.
Se駉r I
Farewell, my friends.
Your sword.
He leads an exhausting life,
I must sa y.
There should be a ladder under every window.
J ust in case.
Wha漵 up?
The officers of the guard are sorting out a problem.
Must have been a dilemma.
There were other reasons too.
I s what you said true?
I never back down.
If I 'm not mista k en, that brave officer was your father.
The chronicles of his duels mention those events.
I n order to avoid an argument, he duelled twice that da y, wounded fiv e in the afternoon and six more in the evening.
He did right, or there'd have been an unnecessary argument!
And this is the end of the story.
You wanted me to tell of my adv entures, and I don't thin k you regret your curiosity.
We must part.
The hour of parting...
I 'm very sorry... also has its sweetness.
I mportant affairs are calling you.
But you said...
I don't thin k, se駉r, you'v e got much time left.
Alfonso Van Worden, we're waiting for you.
Who are you?
My name will tell you nothing.
Welcome to
Gomelez's land.
You must recognize the hermit in me, and thus guess that
I am the Shei k of the Gomelez.
You are here because you have not disappointed us.
Well, I 'm a captain of the guard.
I漵 time for me to reveal our secret.
The Prophet has blessed your love. they will both soon be mothers and continue the family line.
We'v e been to ying with you long enough to ma k e sure that your first night in Venta Quemada will be fruitful for the Gomelez family, as you are the only male heir to ourvanishing line.
Everything you have been through was a planned game, meant to test your honor and courage.
Your men were the ghosts and spirits?
And the Cabalist?
Yes.
So was Pashek o.
He is a Basque acrobat and he lost an eye performing some dangerous acrobatics.
If you sayVelasquez was also involv ed, I won't believe it.
Yes.
This heretic caused us a lot of trouble and we are putting our hopes in Rebecca's hands.
I n this book is everything you saw and experienced.
Ma ybe I can put it all in some order at last.
The rest you can write yourself.
MayAllah send the dew of happiness on your head.
Kiss him, Zibelda.
I will be happyseeing him in your arms.
Whenever I see you, I am always afraid I won't see you again.
Perhaps we won't meet again.
But we want to liv e in your memory forever.
The hour of parting also has its sweetness.
But now I know everything, so tell me really who you are.
Close your eyes.
And when you hear your name, follow us.
Now?
Can we ma k e it before dark?
We can.
This time we can.
For sure.
Where have you been?
The mules have escaped.
Off we go on our wa y.
And hurry!
You must see to him.
A nice room and some peace are the adv antages of our inn.
For a long time, they thought I was missing.
Everybody was overjoyed to see me.
Only the shei k was saddened to see me wea k and my health damaged.
A meal for the se駉r, quick.
Two foreign ladies, who are spending the night at this inn, would like to in vite you for supper.
Wha漵 that?
Where?
The End
She may be a little late.
Will you please wait for her?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
Well, what complaint have you got to add to the world's misery?
- No complaints at all. That is...
- Then you can't be a teacher.
If you are not a teacher, you've got no right in my kitchen.
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like junket.
But when it looks like junket, it is junket.
- You know what Miss Elvira said about it?
- No, but I...
She said, Really, dear, can't we admit the junkets just the weest bit poor?
- You know what I said?
- No, but I would like...
I said, it's just as stupid to talk about poor junket... as it is to talk about good junket.
Junket is junket, I said, and no matter what you do with it... it still tastes like swill and swallows like slime.
Haven't seen you around here before, have I?
No, my little girl is just entering today, and I can't find anyone to turn her over to.
No, of course you can't.
What little discipline there was among these junket-eaters... went to hell the day Miss
Benton was taken to hospital.
We've only just arrived in
England a few days ago... and I have an appointment to let the moving men into our new apartment...
Everybody has his troubles.
Where's your little girl?
In the First Day room. When I telephoned to say we'd be late... they said I should take her to the First Day room.
Isn't that a cute name for it?
The teachers will be down at the 10:00 bell.
That's only 10 minutes.
I'll look after her till then.
Maybe I'd better wait until the teacher...
No, nonsense, you just go.
You'll be late.
- Her name is Bunny Lake. And she's in...
- Yes, I know. The First Day room.
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Have you been waiting long?
Only a bit, ma'am.
It's quite all right.
These three bags go upstairs into the smaller bedroom.
- And those go into the large bedroom.
- Righto, ma'am.
- Yes?
- Hi!
Hello, Steven.
I wanted to check if you got there all right.
Of course I got here.
They're unloading.
I'm sorry I can't help you, darling... but some Congolese general is flying in.
I've got to cover it.
New York thinks there may be a student demonstration at the airport.
How did you like the school?
I don't know yet.
I didn't see anybody.
The Armstrongs sent their kids to the same school.
They came home bleeding only twice.
Seriously, it's a good school.
Please be on time for dinner.
I'm making fried chicken just for you.
- I'll be home at 6:30 sharp. Love you.
- Bye-Bye.
The books stay in here... and the typewriter goes on top of the desk.
And this carton goes in the kitchen.
Thank you. You've been such a help.
I'm still trying to figure out your money. Is that all right?
You're doing beautifully, if I might say so.
- One is more than generous. Goodbye.
- What's wrong with you?
- You must be bonkers.
- Why, thank you.
- Is somebody...
- Hear that, Samantha?
Our new tenants have arrived.
Hello. We've come back from wettest Worcestershire...
Samantha and I. This is Samantha.
If we hadn't been away, we'd have organized a small... but vociferous reception committee.
Who are you?
Among other things, your new landlord and friend.
I hope my little African faces didn't disturb you.
Of course not. I'm sorry, but I do have a lot of unpacking to do.
- Carry on.
- Thank you.
This one was a gift from my fan club in Ghana.
You can wear it, if you like.
I believe it's marvelous for fertility.
- That's not exactly my problem, Mister...
- Wilson.
Wilson. Horatio Wilson.
Poet, playwright... dropper of alcoholic bricks, also.
Am I totally unknown to you?
We've just arrived in England.
From Siberia, I presume.
That might possibly explain your bizarre ignorance.
Mr. Wilson, I hope you'll forgive me... but I really must get my marketing done.
I have other African heads, small pickled ones, in my apartment.
Do drop in anytime you'd care to meet some unsuccessful politicians.
Thank you. That would be lovely.
Now I really must go.
A bientot, duchess.
Wave, Samantha. Go on, wave to the nice young lady.
They're late. It's absolute chaos with Miss Benton away.
I don't know. Elvira seems to be coping manfully.
I'm not altogether sure.
Jamie lost his socks again yesterday.
Socks just don't disappear into thin air.
It's obvious she put them on some other child who came without socks.
Not tremendously encouraging.
- Excuse me. Have you got a minute?
- A lifetime. Can I help you?
It's about my little girl.
She just entered today... and I'd like to meet her teacher.
When there's time, of course.
Her teacher will be with the class when it comes down.
Good afternoon.
I beg your pardon. Could you tell me where the fours are?
The fours are packing up.
These are the babies.
What a big boy Jamie is.
And what a heartbreaker.
When we saw him this morning... in the First Day room, my Bunny just about fell in love with him.
She'd have fallen out soon enough.
He's got a foul temper. Bye-bye, now.
Hello, darling.
Had a nice morning?
Excuse me, what class is your little girl in?
- The fours.
- So is mine, but I can't seem to find her.
Miss Daphne's in charge of the fours.
She could tell you.
I don't see her, though.
Sort of tall, and dark, and 30-ish.
That's the classroom up there.
But I don't see Miss Daphne.
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.
Are you looking for something?
Of course I'm looking for something.
What did you think I was doing?
I can't always tell.
I'm looking for my daughter,
Bunny Lake.
- How old is she?
- Four.
The fours have already left.
I know, only Bunny wasn't with them.
Are you Miss Daphne?
No. Miss Daphne has a bad tooth and went screaming off to the dentist.
Anyhow, you're in the three room, the fours are next door.
I've been there. It's empty.
- It's Bunny's first day...
- Perhaps she's gone down for her dinner.
- But she's not supposed to stay for lunch.
- Did you tell us that this morning?
No. You see, we were late...
We can't be expected to read your mind, can we?
Come along. We'll have a look-see.
Is Bunny here?
Is a Bunny Lake here, please?
What's she look like, Dorothy?
I don't know that I've ever seen the girl.
She has red tights and a white blouse with short sleeves... and a blue pinafore dress.
She's blonde, and... don't you watch the children here?
Isn't anybody in charge?
We'll find her. Don't worry.
Haven't you seen a little girl called Bunny?
- No.
- About your age?
- No.
- A new girl.
With a dress, just like yours.
There's no point in questioning the children.
What do you mean, no point?
It's my child, my little girl, not some lost pair of socks.
Please, Mrs. Lake.
We mustn't get emotional.
I don't need your advice.
I want my child.
Who's in charge of this madhouse?
All I need is someone who can cook, and by tomorrow morning.
Will you take a Spanish girl?
I want her to cook, not speak English.
She won't take less than 'L8. 10.
We'll have to pay it then, won't we?
- Are you the one...
- Just a moment.
- Shall I send her to see you?
- Yes. Send her by 8:00 tomorrow.
- Right. Lopez is the name.
- Thank you, Mrs. Twigg.
The cook walked out just because
I said something about the junket.
That may be the least of our worries, Elvira.
The cook who walked out, is she a German woman?
- That's one way to describe her.
- What time did the cook leave?
Around 11:15, I suppose.
It was in the middle of cooking lunch.
Brace yourself, Elvira.
We can't seem to put our hands on one of the children.
- Which one?
- My little girl. Bunny Lake.
I don't recall any Bunny, or any Lake.
But you're the one I spoke to on the telephone.
- I recognize your voice.
- When was this?
This morning. Don't you remember?
I telephoned because it was Bunny's first day and we were late.
Yes, now I remember.
And I took her to the First Day room, just as you told me to.
But now we don't seem to be able to find her.
- How old is she?
- She's a four.
The fours are all gone home ages ago, except those that stay to dinner.
Will you all please stop saying that?
The fours are not all on their way home.
Mine isn't, and she isn't at dinner, either.
If she's a four, I imagine
Miss Daphne would...
Miss Daphne went home with a toothache!
You don't seem to know very much about what goes on here.
- A child who's been placed in your...
- London office. Can I help you?
Mr. Steven Lake, please.
She couldn't have walked out that way.
- She couldn't have walked out at all.
- What do you mean by that?
If she couldn't have walked out by herself, then someone took her.
- Is that what you're saying?
- Of course not.
I assume you regulate who comes into this school and who doesn't.
People don't just wander in off the street, do they?
- Certainly not. We keep...
- Then listen to me for a minute.
Shortly before 10:00,
Bunny was brought into this room.
A little boy about 18 months old was playing here.
Yes, and I saw the boy later in the hall with his mother.
The cook promised to keep an eye on her until the 10:00 recess.
Listen to me.
We all agree she couldn't have got out of this room by herself.
Barring witchcraft, that can only mean someone took her out, correct?
- I don't know. I mean...
- I do.
If you'd stop defending yourself for a minute, Miss...
Smollett, and I'm not defending myself.
If you would worry less about yourself and more about this child... you seem to have misplaced, we might begin to get somewhere.
Since she couldn't have gone out by herself, it means someone took her out.
The question is who.
Who took the child out of here?
Think about it.
Calm down and begin to think.
How can I when you scream at me?
- Forgive me, we're all a little overexcited.
- What I was going to say is... even though someone did take her out of this room... it doesn't necessarily mean they took her out of the school, too.
In which event she'd still be here.
The question is where.
Have you searched the place?
- Of course we have.
- Maybe we'll have better luck.
Your track record, just for today, hasn't been too dazzling.
So you don't mind if we look for ourselves, do you?
Not at all. I'll be in the office if you should need me.
Don't worry, Annie. We'll find her.
We'll start on the top floor and we'll work our way down.
- What's up there?
- Miss Benton's private flat.
We thought Miss Benton was in the hospital.
I told you, it's a private flat.
- She could have easily run up here.
- Listen.
It was an underground train
But there was nobody on it...
except this dog.
It was the giants dog, really.
He didn't know that he was on the train.
And this dog had great Big...
huge eyes and the most awful teeth.
Who is it?
But this dog had hundreds of teeth, just to mash you up with.
To mash you right up and...
Such imagination.
We might think of teeth gnashing.
But mashing... Which is exactly what they do, of course.
Are you parents? We don't usually see parents up here.
We're looking for a four-year-old girl named Bunny Lake.
Have they lost one? How careless.
- Are you Miss Benton?
- No, not at all.
I am Miss Ford.
Miss Benton and I started this school together, but now I'm retired... except for my book.
I'm writing a book on children's fantasies.
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.
I have all their little nightmares on my tape machine.
You don't have bars on these windows.
All the other windows have bars.
The children aren't meant to come up here now.
Elvira thinks I may frighten them by asking about their dreams.
But I'll tell you something in confidence.
Every now and again, one brave child slips through the defenses.
So, let's hunt, shall we?
Now, what's her name?
Her real name is Felicia, but we've always called her Bunny.
We have to call, although very often when they hear the calling... they hide and laugh at us.
This woman is crazy.
Don't you think we all are, to one degree or another?
Crazy, I mean. Especially children.
That's why with a child you have to think of everything.
Your little girl has probably gone to sleep somewhere.
Yes, you're probably right.
She does take a nap every afternoon.
But where?
Perhaps she's been frightened.
They do go to sleep sometimes after a bad fright.
Quite sensible of them, too.
- What could have happened to frighten her?
- Who could say?
What happened to her?
What are you hinting at?
- That something happened to Bunny?
- Easy, honey.
Miss Ford, if you do know something, please level with us.
I wouldn't want to embarrass you.
- Embarrass me? How would you do that?
- By calling the police.
What an enchanting idea.
The telephone is in here.
Dreadful painting of Madge, this.
Makes her look like Mother
Earth or something.
You wouldn't mind my calling the police?
It's exactly what I should do myself were I the child's father.
I'm not her father, I'm her uncle.
Ann is my sister.
Curiouser and curiouser.
You've no right to come up here.
Absolutely no right at all.
We have every right in the world to be here, or any other place in this building.
You seem to have been a little careless, Elvira.
- Call the police, Steve.
- The police? No, Mr. Lake. Please.
Miss Benton wouldn't like that.
She just wouldn't have it.
Au contraire. I'm sure Madge would want us to protect our good name.
Please, we can look again.
I've rung up Miss Daphne.
She'll be back from the dentist within half an hour.
I'm sure she can explain everything.
Miss Benton wouldn't want the police dragged into The Little Peoples Garden.
- Unbelievable.
- It's their free play.
- What are they doing?
- Exactly as they like.
Expressing themselves.
They must find that tremendously hard work.
Don't you want to look anywhere else?
No, I don't think so. I've got men peering about all over the shop.
I just wanted to get to understand the place a little.
- Miss Daphne Musgrave?
- Yes.
How's the tooth feeling now?
- Better, thank you.
- Good.
I swear to God... if only she's all right...
I'll never let her out of my sight again... as long as I live.
You'll feel pretty silly along about the time she's hitting 30.
It's all my fault.
I never should have left her here. Never.
Supt. Newhouse wants to talk to you now, if you'll be so kind.
Just you, madam, at the moment, please.
What did you say to this teacher?
After you'd handed over your little girl.
You mean the one they call Daphne?
The one that they said went to the dentist?
Have you found her yet?
- I didn't say anything to her.
- How was that?
I didn't say anything because I didn't see her. I didn't see the teachers, just the cook and she said she'd keep an eye on her. It was only for five or 10 minutes.
I was late. So I left her there all alone, with a baby half her age.
We found Daphne Musgrave.
- Where?
- At the dentist.
She says she never saw your child.
She says she went into the First
Day room. Isn't that what it's called?
At about 10:05. The cook told her there was a child there.
Two. Bunny and this baby.
Miss Daphne says the cook said child. Singular.
She was quite definite about that.
Sure enough, when she went in, there was a child. The baby.
So if you left Bunny in there at...
What time did you say?
Almost 9:55.
Then it was during the next
10 minutes that she went off.
Went off?
On her voyage of discovery.
But the window and front door were locked.
I'm sure I heard it lock behind me. let's go and see, shall we?
You must think I'm a terrible mother, leaving her that way.
No, Mrs. Lake. I don't know anything about you yet.
Andrews, see what you can learn about this cook.
If you can't find her, send out a general call.
Very good, sir.
I must now, I suppose, enter the personality of a four-year-old female child... possessed with a conviction forbidden doors are to be opened.
Yes, Bunny would feel like that about forbidden doors.
I've been put in there, and I assume my mother has gone off and left me.
Well, that's how it must have seemed to a child.
Maybe I'd try this door.
Empty, obviously, at this hour.
Somewhere a hymn of nauseating banality is being sung by the punctual children.
They were singing, yes.
So I cross the hall... and office.
No joy there. And now... the kitchen.
The cook was standing right there when I talked to her.
- Is this junket?
- Yes.
I'm terribly fond of the stuff.
- Do you think they'd mind?
- Not from what the cook said about it.
That door. Was that door open or shut?
Shut, I think.
If she had wandered out this way, she probably would have gone through it...
- and on to the great outside world beyond.
- But the cook would have stopped her.
Perhaps.
I think that covers the possibilities here.
Don't you worry, Mrs. Lake.
Even if she did wander out this way, she can't have gone far.
Not in three hours, at most.
We'll circulate her description.
- She's not far away.
- Thank you.
- Have you got a snap?
- What?
This sort of thing.
Taken at Cromer Sands on a dull August afternoon.
Almost useless for identification, but it pleases Grandmother.
- A snapshot.
- That's right.
No, I don't have one. The photo albums, most of our things haven't arrived yet.
- Would your brother have one?
- Possibly, I'm not sure.
- All of your family are most elusive.
- Looking for me?
- Are you Mrs. Lakes brother?
- That's right.
- Steven Lake.
- Supt. Newhouse.
I was upstairs having another session with Ada Ford.
Who's she?
Sort of the witch in residence.
You know what she told me?
This has happened before in this school, only with two kids instead of one.
A teacher took them to the zoo in
Whipsnade without telling anybody.
- Did they find them?
- Yes.
Safe and sound. But the whole place went crazy looking for them.
Where's your husband?
You see, Superintendent, my sisters husband...
I'm not married. I never was.
I see.
I hope the fact that Bunny is illegitimate won't...
Of course it won't, Mrs... Miss Lake.
Although I assume you do sometimes call yourself Mrs.
Only when it avoids confusion.
Miss is fine.
Have you a photograph of your niece?
Let me see.
- Excuse me, but isn't...
- No, that's me.
I'm so stupid. Of course I have a picture of
Bunny. It's in her passport at the apartment.
- My cars outside. Do you want me to get it?
- That would be very helpful.
I put your briefcase in the top drawer of your desk.
Not a trace of the cook.
I've had them send out a general call.
Mr. Lake, this is Sgt. Andrews.
Go with Mr. Lake to his flat, will you?
Then you can bring him and a photograph of the little girl back to the station.
- What about me?
- You can come to the station with me.
That's where we keep all the red tape.
The little tailor went snip, snip, snip.
Poor flies, cut right across the middle.
Her hair was...
Her hair is blonde, like mine.
- Eyes?
- Blue.
Thank you, Mrs. Tulk. Weight?
31... No, thank you.
- 32 pounds, I guess.
- Height? Approximately, you understand.
Dark blue pinafore dress.
Dark blue double-breasted coat... with brass buttons.
Speaks with an American accent... and will answer to the name of Bunny Lake.
Message ends. Repeat message.
Attention called: Missing child.
Age: 4 years. Eyes: Blue.
Height: 3 feet, approximately.
Hair: Blond, medium length.
Speaks with an American accent...
and will answer to the name of Bunny Lake.
My father was a policeman.
Managed to get me into a university.
I think he rather wanted me to be a poet.
When I told him I wanted to be a policeman like him, he was horrified.
You'll have no friends, he said.
No single decent human being will want to speak to you from now on.
I must say he was perfectly right.
Mr. Newhouse, what are we doing here?
What are we doing about Bunny?
We're waiting for something to happen.
- Yes.
- Can I talk? Are you alone?
No, but go on.
There's nothing here, sir.
Everything seems to have Been removed.
- Everything?
- Yes, sir.
All the child's possessions seem to have gone.
- Very interesting.
- What shall we do next, sir?
Stay there, will you? Him, too.
We'll be along.
- And, Andrews.
- Yes, sir?
Don't move anything.
Not a thing. Understand?
Righto.
What would anybody want with Bunny's things?
It's like a nightmare.
- Somebody must have broken in.
- The lock seems to be intact.
Can't see any sign of tampering.
All the child's things are missing:
Mug, bib, one bathrobe, pink... one nightgown, slippers, teddy bear, everything.
And the passport, of course.
But it was open when we got here.
Anybody could've come in.
Yes, sir. When we arrived, we only had to push it.
Was the door open when you left here?
I think so.
I did leave it open when I went upstairs... with the groceries.
And I had to make two trips.
So I could have forgotten to lock it again.
- Has the child ever been here?
- Never.
No. She caught a cold on the boat coming over.
Today was the first day that I let her go out.
You were right here this morning at about what time?
They left a few minutes after?
I started to unpack.
Then a man came in.
- The door was unlocked?
- What man?
- Mr. Wilson. He had a key.
- Who is this Wilson?
Our landlord, but that doesn't give him the right to come barging in here.
So I went to buy some groceries.
- Did you leave Mr. Wilson alone here?
- No.
He left when I did.
How long were you here after you had come back from marketing?
Just long enough to unload the groceries.
I had to go get Bunny.
Yes, very well.
Mr. Lake, do you have personal possessions of any value?
Very few, and nothings missing.
Wait a minute.
- No, it's all here.
- Excuse me.
A little over $500 in Swiss
Francs and travelers checks.
Bunny isn't on your passport?
No, she has her own.
Why do you leave so much money lying around?
I was supposed to go to
Switzerland tomorrow... to cover the International
Monetary Conference...
- You work for an American newspaper?
- No, magazines.
He's in charge of the London office.
What's this got to do with Bunny?
- I'm temporarily in charge.
- What did you do this morning, Mr. Lake?
- After I left with Bunny?
- Yes, what did you do? Everything, please. let's see.
I waited at Frogmore End for the moving men.
- Where?
- Frogmore End.
It's a house where my boss lives.
He's on a leave of absence right now doing a job for the U.S. Information Agency.
I used to live with them as a paying guest, and then when Ann and Bunny came...
- we stayed there till we could move here.
- Five nights, I think.
Four nights. Then we moved in here.
- Why not move here right away?
- The flat wasn't ready until today.
So I waited at Frogmore
End for the moving men.
Then I went to the airport to cover the arrival of...
- How is all this helping Bunny?
- I don't know yet. Go on, Mr. Lake.
- Then I went back to the office.
- Where?
Grosvenor St. I stayed there until my sister called me from the school.
Very well. I'll telephone you the moment we have anything to report.
- Superintendent.
- Andrews knows what I want.
You won't mind if they take some pictures, fingerprints?
I don't understand. I don't see how a child can just disappear.
Either you've been the victim of a very eccentric burglar...
- or...
- Or what?
- ...the child's things never were here.
- I unpacked them myself.
I remember. Now I want you to try and remember... who else saw the child since you came to England... apart from you and your brother?
Just try to think of anyone else who saw her.
- Who saw Bunny?
- Will you think hard about that, please?
Let me have a list.
We'll find her, sir.
Yes, and the bloke, too. Degenerate.
What do you mean?
Hangings a courtesy to that type.
Hangings a kindness.
He's got two girls of his own, sir.
That kid we found up Old Oak Common.
The way we found her, I could have strung that bloke up personally.
They'll probably just hit him with a bloody psychiatrists report...
Come on, Charles. We have work to do.
He takes it all personally.
Good day, sir.
We'll be letting you know.
Don't let it be that.
Please, God, don't.
Don't let them hurt her like that.
I'd rather she be dead.
Don't. They always exaggerate.
It's the only way they can make their job seem important.
I never dreamed it could be anything like that.
It isn't.
That mans a policeman.
He knows about these things.
He's a dumb bastard.
If you'll just listen to me, I'll show you how it couldn't be anything like that.
- How?
- Because all of her things are gone.
But that doesn't prove anything.
Of course it does.
If you're going to kill a child... you don't go to the trouble of getting toys and clothes for it, do you?
And a bib? And a mug?
- No. That's true.
- They went farther than that.
They came here and got her own clothes and toys.
Why?
Because these people, whoever they are, want Bunny to be happy and comfortable.
Yes, I can see that.
And if they want her to be happy, that means they won't hurt her.
Exactly.
But who?
That's what we've got to find out.
But you're not going to be much help if you go all to pieces like this.
Sorry.
- That superintendent...
- Newhouse?
He asked me for a list.
A list of all the people who have seen Bunny since we got to England.
Now, what does he need that for?
- Suspects, I suppose.
- No.
Steven... he sounded like... he wanted to make sure there really was a Bunny.
- Come on. Get a hold...
- If he doesn't believe... that Bunny was real, maybe they'll just stop looking for her.
They wouldn't, honey.
They couldn't take that risk.
There is something.
Something I bet the thief missed.
Here it is. Right where I hid it.
What is it?
I bought it for Bunny.
It has candy inside.
I hid it there, so we could play Hot and Cold.
I'll take it to him.
And I want somebody to look at the house.
It's empty, locked.
You'll have to get in somehow.
Number 30 Frogmore End.
Have you got that?
- Yes, sir, 30 Frogmore End.
- Okay.
Steven, I just remembered.
Tell him at least 30 people saw her. Maybe more.
- What do you mean?
- Everybody on the bus we took to school.
Of course. I'll tell him.
Of course I've seen children disappear from this school.
I've known children come for one day and never return again.
It's perfectly feasible,
Superintendent.
Children are at the mercy of their parents.
And, for the most part, parents are a very bad lot.
In some instances, even undeserving of their children.
- Wouldn't you say?
- But I wouldn't say.
That would make me a suspect, don't you see?
Queer old party saves child from undeserving parent.
Now, coming back to Bunny Lake.
That's not her real name, you know.
Not Bunny at all, but Felicia.
Isn't it delicious? A little affected for an American child... but I think it shows a strong imagination at work.
The brother told me quite a lot.
There's something unusual about that young man.
Something very unusual.
What exactly did Mr. Lake say to you?
Apparently, she had this completely imaginary companion.
- Who, Bunny?
- No, the mother, when she was a child.
And she called her Bunny.
It's terribly common among children... lonely children, that is.
Why do you think Steven
Lake told you all this? let's say we took a fancy to each other.
The whole place was full of those great men of yours in boots.
I think we both knew that was no way to find Bunny.
- Why do you say that?
- Perhaps I'm wrong.
I'm alone a great deal,
Superintendent.
But that young man is worried about his sister. Desperately worried.
- Isn't that natural?
- Is it? Natural, I mean?
I should have thought the natural thing was to worry about the child.
Johnson and Bates, take a look upstairs.
How long do they go back, these records?
I've kept them ever since I came.
Ever since Miss Ford retired.
The parent fills out the entry form and returns it with the fees.
Just the first months.
Then the child's name is put on a card which records its progress... health, absences, dental treatment, and conduct.
And the ledger?
Every penny received over the last 12 months.
Mr. Newhouse, I think this might interest you.
My sister bought it this morning for Bunny.
What time did she buy it?
Before the child was missing, if that's what you mean.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean, Mr. Lake.
It would have been more useful if it had turned up earlier.
She hid it for a game of Hot and Cold and forgot all about it until now.
- Hot and Cold?
- It's a sort of treasure hunt.
Ann and I used to play when we were little.
Now she plays it with Bunny.
Odd how the most improbable things suddenly seem quite reasonable.
Then you'd agree with me she'd scarcely buy playthings for a nonexistent child?
Nonexistent? Did I say that?
You suggested to her perhaps Bunny's things were never in the apartment.
You also asked her for a list of everyone who had seen the child.
Yes, I did want that.
Then find the conductor and passengers on the 13 bus that left Frogmore End... around 9:15 this morning... and stopped at Finchley Road tube station and let Ann and Bunny off.
Passengers are difficult to trace, and bus conductors are rarely observant.
They tend to be dreamers, philosophers, that sort of thing.
Self-protection, I suppose.
You're not going to check it out?
We have checked every bus that passed Frogmore End... between 8:45 and 9:30 this morning.
The fact that none of the conductors can recall our mother and child is not unusual.
Neither does it invalidate your sisters statement that she was on board.
However, I think we've found something of greater importance...
- and I'd like your views on it.
- Well?
We've been through all the records of every child entered for this nursery... during this past year.
We've also been through the receipt for all checks paid for fees in advance.
Were Bunny's fees paid for in advance?
Yes, for the first month.
- In currency?
- No, a check.
And the entrance form, was that sent back?
- Yes, I mailed it in with the check.
- You did?
My sister was still in America.
- Besides, I...
- Besides?
I always take care of these things for her.
Can you give us any idea of when it was sent?
I can give you more than an idea.
Here it is: Little Peoples Garden.
L9 and nine shillings.
Sent two weeks ago. Satisfied?
I'm afraid, Mr. Lake, there's no record of that ever having been received.
The child's name is nowhere in our records.
What a convenient discovery.
Just at the right time, too.
I take back what I said this afternoon, Miss Smollett.
Your track records looking up.
You are all in the clear no matter what happens... because you don't have Bunny's name in your records.
She's not in your index, so she doesn't exist.
What are you suggesting?
You tore up the card and changed the ledgers when there was trouble.
- Superintendent, you don't believe...
- It is possible.
Look, either the school is lying or we are.
They have a reason to.
They lost a child.
But what possible reason would my sister have for lying?
I was hoping you could give me a reason.
You know that teachers lying.
She has to admit it.
What do you suggest?
We no longer have the rack.
You don't seem to be taking this thing very seriously.
I assure you that I am.
It's very easy to tear out an incriminating page... from a loose-leaf ledger.
You said so yourself.
No, I didn't. By the same token, it's possible to tear out a blank check form... and write anything you like on the stub.
If that's what you think, ask the bank about it.
I may, but you could just say the school never deposited it... and they tore it up along with the application.
Are you calling me a liar?
I'm not calling anybody anything, Mr. Lake. Not yet.
One thing I can guarantee: If this child isn't found by tomorrow morning...
I'll stir up the damnedest mess you ever saw.
How?
By simply doing my job as a journalist.
American child disappears in broad daylight... right in the middle of London.
Police do nothing.
That sort of thing.
Sounds conventional. A bit dull, too.
It won't be dull for you.
I'll go to the American ambassador.
I'll hire detectives.
Yes. You'll hire. You'll complain.
That would be normal procedure.
You do everything for your sister, don't you?
Pay her bills, fill up her forms... hire detectives to solve her little mysteries.
What's wrong with that?
- How did she get to England?
- She?
I'm sorry, they. How did your sister and Bunny travel from America?
- By ship.
- What ship?
The Queen Mary. They arrived last Thursday.
Tell me about you and your sister when you were children.
What are you doing here?
Carrying out my landlords right of inspection.
The police were here.
I don't care for the police.
My little girl, she's lost.
They're trying to find her.
Your little girl?
Mr. Lake, I understood, had a little girl. A little sister.
And that, duchess, turned out to be you.
But your having a little girl... that comes to me as a most unwelcome surprise.
No cage birds, I stipulated. No cats.
No livestock of any kind.
Somebody got in here and stole her things.
Somebody took Bunny's things.
- Bunny?
- Did you see anyone?
They came up here while I was out.
What sort of a name is that?
Bunny rabbits, with those long, mean heads... and those wet noses going up and down all the time.
Just who is this Bunny?
How can you make jokes when I told you she's lost?
Bunny is my little girls name.
And you, little duchess, what exactly does that make you?
I'm Bunny's mother.
And I'm expecting a phone call from the police and my brother.
Probably my brother first.
The telephone, that miracle of modern communication.
I often wonder why it is... that we communicate so much less with all these marvels at our disposal... than we did in a more primitive day, without the wireless and the television.
I appear on the television, you know.
They pay me to make use of my melodious voice.
I sing rude old Welsh ballads.
I recite a few things of my own... and then I give them
Elizabethan drama.
And all in exchange for one whiskey... served to me in the first aid room.
I could, if you like... give you a private performance.
Please, just go away.
I'm told that my voice... is extremely seductive.
It seems to unleash whole hurricanes of passion... in the breasts of the females who watch me on the BBC.
Perhaps you should sample the wine... before sending the bottle back to the cellar.
Anyone else in the family?
No, except for Bunny.
Of course. What about your parents?
Our father was killed in the war.
Went right up to V-E Day without a scratch, and then got hit by a tank.
One of ours.
My mother, she was kind of peculiar.
Any special way?
She was a great believer in the hereafter.
Do you believe in life on another planet?
Seems quite unbelievable enough to me on this one, I think.
Anyhow, Mother used to spend most of her time in church... the Church of Christ the Spiritualist, having long talks with my father.
It's funny, he never had much to say to her while he was alive.
But once he was dead, apparently he never shut up.
Anyway, I sort of got into the habit of taking care of Ann.
She was my responsibility.
A bit of a burden, wasn't it, on a schoolboy?
- I didn't think of it that way.
- Your mother?
She died almost two years ago.
- Any communications with her since?
- Not a peep.
When you were at school, wasn't Ann lonely?
No more so than any other child.
What did she do to fill in her days?
Reading, I suppose.
Books, dolls, that sort of thing.
- Alone?
- Most of the time. We lived in the country.
Look, where's all this getting us?
Children, lonely children, often make up imaginary playmates.
- Did your sister ever do anything like that?
- Not that I know of.
I'm terribly sorry if we've inconvenienced you... but we're just following our instructions.
You've made me miss my plane.
We'll book you on another plane as soon as you've answered a few questions.
You mustn't be cross with me because
I betrayed your little secret.
After all, I didn't know it was a secret.
- Perhaps if you had told me...
- What precisely was it he did tell you?
He began by asking me if it were unusual for a child to invent a playmate.
- And is it?
- Quite the contrary.
It's one of the most common of childhood fantasies.
I recall one case, quite outré...
- but that's neither here nor there, is it?
- I'm afraid not.
Then he told me his sister had made up a child.
He said when his sister was 5 years old... she'd invented another little girl who she named Bunny.
And that after a time, she began to think of this Bunny as being her own child...
- not only a friend.
- Mr. Lake?
She has a good memory, except for one detail.
- I wasn't talking about my sister.
- I never lie, Superintendent.
That makes you a most unusual woman, Miss Ford.
- Did he say it was his sister?
- Not in so many words, perhaps... but we'd been talking about his sister earlier.
If it wasn't about Ann, then why did you tell her... that the name of the imaginary child was Bunny?
I couldn't remember the real name, so I used Bunny hypothetically.
That's reasonable.
It's not reasonable, and Mr. Lake is a most frightful liar.
I give up.
What was your purpose in paying
Miss Ford a second visit?
- To soften her up, to get her talking.
- Why?
- I had a feeling that she knew something.
- What could I know?
This room, this flat, have been my whole world for years now.
This room and this flat are on top of this school.
What are you implying?
That she wants to prove an imaginary child to get the school off the hook.
You would do anything, almost anything, to protect your sister, wouldn't you?
What's that supposed to mean?
If Bunny were a phantom... if your sister were delusionary, would you admit it?
I've had it, Newhouse.
Just give me half an hour to square things at the office, then I'll get busy.
I'll find Bunny without you.
You'll be lucky if they still let you hand out parking tickets.
If you won't come to the party, duchess, the party must come to you. Have a drink.
I give you golden whiskey,
Scottish wine.
I give you a sight of some very interesting African gentlemen... whose heads shrunk in the wash.
I give you dark diamonds of Elizabethan poetry... set in the velvet of my melodious voice.
And all you do is sit staring at that small mechanical instrument.
Please go away.
What is it, duchess? Are you cold?
Is that buttermilk flesh all frozen?
What, cold, my girl?
Some would be honored, may I tell you that, by my touch?
There are those at the BBC who bear, like medals... bruises left by the love of Horatio Wilson.
Is that the patter of tiny feet... or the great thumping boots of a constable?
Nothing yet, I'm afraid.
Nothing definite.
- It will increase your melancholy...
- Who are you?
No autographs, but you may touch my garment.
Andrews, take Mr. Wilson back to his flat, will you?
Is this where we get police violence?
Go with Andrews, please.
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.
All right. I was just about to go.
Good night, duchess.
Sorry that drunk pestered you.
Ever heard him read poetry?
It's like a Welsh parson gargling in molasses.
Where's Steven?
He had to get back to his office for a little while. He won't be long.
- Looks as if you have a starved mouse.
- I tried to eat, but it made me sick.
If you don't eat, you'll just collapse.
That won't help Bunny, will it?
Come along.
The poor nuns used to lash each other... into positive frenzies of self-mortification.
For myself, I find the sensation rather more titillating... if you'd care to have a bash.
- No, thank you.
- No, I can't say I blame you.
Hardly what one would call a proper whip, is it?
More like a plaything.
But this one...
You simply must try this one.
It's my particular pet.
It's reputed to have belonged to the great one himself:
The Marquis de Sade.
I have his skull here.
At least, that's what they told me in the Caledonian market.
But there's nothing like his very own whip.
So lovely. So very lovely.
One ham and one cheese sandwich, and a large brandy and soda.
Yes, sir.
Couldn't see anything in his flat... but he could have taken the little girls things any time this morning.
- Why should he, I wonder?
- Bloody pervert, if you want my opinion.
Kept on asking Rogers to strike him.
Please, Andrews, he works for the BBC. While we're here... go through the lake flat again, will you?
See if anythings changed since this morning.
Several hundred American troops in West Germany...
in full Battle kit, moved up this morning to Helmstedt...
the control point of the autobahn to Berlin.
You're trying to tell me something terrible?
- Why?
- I don't know. You're being so nice.
- I tried to make out that list.
- List?
- The people who'd seen Bunny.
- Yes, the list.
There isn't anyone special.
Just the people on the bus this morning... or at Southampton when we got off the boat.
I see.
She had a cold. I kept her indoors.
I did find something I bought for Bunny this morning.
- Did Steven give it to you?
- Yes, he showed me.
Why don't you do something?
Why don't you find her?
We repeat, and ask our viewers to pay special attention...
No stone, as they say, unturned.
The search for the child who disappeared...
from a Hampstead nursery school this morning continues.
The police say that the child is fair-haired, about 3 feet high...
is wearing...
Ever been in a pub before?
No.
Here it is, the heart of merry old England.
Complete with dirty glasses, watery beer... drafts under the doors, and a 23-inch television.
Have you been out much since you arrived?
Steven was looking forward to showing me the sights... but Bunny had that cold.
But surely you could have found someone to babysit for you.
Steven thought so, too, but I didn't.
She was in a strange house in a strange country.
A strange babysitter might have been too much.
You and your brother are pretty close, aren't you?
All of our lives.
I've been meaning to ask you... did anyone try to stop you having your baby?
You mean an abortion?
Steven offered to arrange one for me if I wanted it.
I suppose it seemed the most practical thing to do... but I decided against it.
- What about the father?
- My father?
Bunny's father.
He was just a boy I went to school with... or sometimes to a movie or a dance.
He wasn't really very important to me.
How did he take the news of
Bunny's impending arrival?
He came to the house and he offered to marry me... but Steven threw him out.
And that somewhat dampened his ardor?
No, he was still willing.
I was the one who said no.
- Why?
- I wasn't in love with him.
Steven said I'd already made one mistake.
Why complicate it with a second?
Your brother sounds like a sensible young man.
Eat something, won't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Two brandies and soda, please.
That's better.
I'm not very good at drinking on an empty stomach.
Did you ever have an imaginary friend when you were a child?
Did Steven tell you that?
In a way. What sort of a friend was it?
A little girl. Didn't you ever have an imaginary playmate when you were little?
I was raised amidst the strife and tumult of nine male and female siblings.
It would have been madness to invent a tenth.
Did Steven tell you my playmates name?
- No, he didn't.
- Bunny. Does that seem odd to you?
Compared to most oddities that fall into my professional lap, it's commonplace.
Bunny was the name of a character in a child's storybook.
She was a lovely character, so I named my playmate after the girl in the book.
Then later, when my daughter was born, I called her Bunny... as a nickname.
Isn't that what you're really questioning me about?
I'm not questioning you, Miss Lake.
I'm just trying to know you better.
What happened to the
Bunny in the storybook?
How did her story end?
I can't remember.
Well, what happened to the Bunny you invented?
When I began to outgrow her, we decided it would be better if she died.
- We?
- Steven and I.
He had read about this
Buddhist funeral ceremony... they have each year in
Japan for broken dolls.
So we dug a grave in the garden... and then we buried her after burning all her things.
What things?
The imaginary things an imaginary child would need.
What the hell do you think you're doing, Newhouse?
While the Superintendent was being so charming to you here... his stooges have been searching our apartment.
I assume you have a search warrant?
Are you making a complaint?
Why are you pouring liquor into my sister when you know she's so upset?
Was he trying to brainwash you?
- No, Steven, of course not.
- What are you up to, Newhouse?
Trying to find the truth.
Isn't that what you were looking for in our apartment?
I just want to find one simple thing... one small, simple proof.
- Proof of what?
- That Bunny Lake exists.
You son of a...
Let him go.
We're not supposed to hit you, Mr. Lake.
In return, I must ask you not to hit me.
It doesn't prove anything.
Mr. Newhouse, what are you going to do now?
Go home.
That's all, Superintendent.
Shall I keep her here...
until you return?
No, it all adds up. Compliment her on her junket and let her go.
I'd like to talk to Supt. Newhouse, please. This is Ann Lake.
Is it about your little girl?
Of course it's about my little girl.
What else would I be calling him about?
The Superintendents not here.
I'm afraid he's gone home.
Ann, bring me another cigarette, will you? They're in my coat pocket.
He did it. They said he'd gone home.
We'll find her ourselves.
I made an appointment with the best private detective in London... first thing in the morning.
By morning, she may be dead.
Ann, stop it.
We've already been through that.
The one thing that absolutely can't happen is that Bunny will be found dead.
Either she'll be found with the people that took her... or she won't be found at all.
That's the worst that could happen.
We'd never see her again, but we'd know she's alive.
I'd rather die than never see her again.
Listen to me. I was only trying to comfort you.
You said she might be dead, and I wanted to show you... that even if we never see her again, she'll still be alive with people who love her.
- How could they hide her so well?
- I don't think they have.
I think we're gonna find her.
And the best thing you can do to help... is to take a sleeping pill and get a good nights sleep.
- I'll wait up for the phone.
- No, I don't want to.
Steven, the doll!
- What doll?
- Bunny's doll.
Here's the ticket from the repair shop.
You took it there yourself yesterday.
I forgot all about it.
- I'm gonna run right over there.
- It's too late. They'll be closed.
I'll make them open up.
I'll break the door in.
If the ticket and the doll is real, then they'll have to believe Bunny's real.
But nobody will be there at this time.
Keep moving, please.
Keep on the pavement.
Don't walk in the street, please.
Can't we take some other street?
They're all the same, ma'am.
It's the theater crowd.
- How much further is it to King St.?
- In this mess, could take hours.
- Could I walk it?
- Quicker than I can drive you.
Tell me where it is.
Turn left, go about 200 yards, then ask again.
Keep moving, please.
- Is this all the passengers?
- The complete list.
- No stowaways?
- Not as far as we know.
Did you expect to find the child, sir?
It's not just the child. Neither of them came. Neither one of them.
You know what that means, don't you, Andrews?
You and I made them up.
We made up the whole family.
Go and ring the Lakes flat.
Hello, my dear. What about a little drink and a dance?
You do dance, don't you?
No reply, sir, from the Lakes flat.
Four nights.
Four or five nights.
She said five. He said four.
- If it was five, they'd have come on...
- Wednesday.
Yes. Did any of your boats arrive on Wednesday of last week?
Not ours, definitely.
Well, what did? Something must have crossed the Atlantic.
- Well?
- From New York?
From America.
The Bremen, bound for Bremerhaven... arrived Southampton,
Wednesday, 2:30 p.m.
- Can you get me a passenger list?
- Tonight?
No, I don't mean tonight.
I mean, now.
Come up. I've almost finished it.
- Good evening.
- Come in, my dear.
I thought it was someone else.
Yes, I've got a near fatality here... and I told the char to leave the door unfastened for its mother... who lives next door.
She's only 6 years old, you see.
And at that age, they're always alarmists about their children.
But you look pale. Are you all right?
Can I get you some tea?
No, thank you. I'm quite all right.
I was just...
My brother left a doll here to be repaired... and I need it so I can prove that I really have a...
Here's the receipt.
Yes, I remember.
This doll had almost been loved to death.
You know, love inflicts the most terrible injuries... on my small patients.
I'm afraid you'll have to find it yourself.
My helper has gone home.
There's a basement... underneath the room you entered by.
I call it the recuperation ward.
You'll find it there.
I'll just light this lamp for you.
There now.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
Look, I found her. Now we can take her to the police. They'll have to believe us.
Yes, I guess they will.
Come on, the cars outside.
No, wait. I have to pay the old man.
Mommy.
Steven, what are you doing?
No, sir, both out.
By the looks of it, they left in a hurry, too. All the lights are still burning.
Other than this slight contusion, there's nothing that shows up yet.
She must have hit her head when she fell.
I found her just lying there in front of the fireplace.
She'd been under a terrible strain the last couple of days. let's not wake her.
Sleeps the best medicine right now.
But she'll wake up soon.
She's always been a light sleeper.
If that happens, we'll give her something. She needs to sleep.
It'll give her a chance to unwind.
Tomorrow, when she's had a rest, we can run some tests.
I don't care how long it takes or how much it costs. I want her to get completely well.
The last couple of weeks, it was as if I had lost touch with her and she with me.
She kept going on about an imaginary child... she thought was lost or something.
Perhaps I ought to consult a psychiatrist.
Perhaps. In the meantime,
Mr. Lake, we'll do all we can.
And if we should need to get in touch with you later...
- can we call you at home?
- Yes, but I won't be there till very late.
This whole thing has played havoc with my job.
Dr. Avery, please.
- The doctor ordered sedation if needed.
- Thank you.
- Bed Number 2.
- Right.
- Mrs. Robertson is getting restless.
- Go change her dressing, Nurse.
Will you bring the trolley?
Then I'll call Dr. Sheldon.
- Everything is ready.
- Thank you.
So then, what's all this about,
Mrs. Robertson?
We're going to do your dressing again, and you'll be quite comfortable.
Just lie quietly.
- Operator.
- Get me the gate.
- Main gate.
- A patient left Ward C4 without permission.
Stop her at the gate. I'll come down.
Routine report just came through from St. Charles Hospital in Hampstead.
A young woman seems to have escaped.
Her name is Lake.
That was very smart of Stevie, wasn't it?
- What?
- The way he got her out of the school.
He was there before you were.
He was watching you all the time.
Then when I left, he took her.
He had to be very fast.
He knew he didn't have much time before recess began.
That was brave of him.
I would have been frightened.
Where did he hide her?
He put her to sleep and hid her in the trunk of his car.
That was the smartest thing of all.
He knew they'd never look there.
Of course not.
But he knew they'd look here.
He even reminded them to, and they did.
Now he's perfectly safe.
They'll never come back.
Only, you shouldn't be here.
He didn't want you here.
- But I came.
- Why?
I wanted to be with you, Stevie... so that no one would frighten you... or hurt you... or make you cry.
- I didn't do anything wrong, did I?
- Of course not.
But you did.
You did wrong, Annie.
You forgot about me.
All you could think of was that boy... that dirty, rotten boy.
That was wrong, wasn't it?
Yes, Stevie, that was very wrong.
And then you let her grow inside you.
You didn't have to do that, but you did.
And now we can't be together anymore.
She's always there between us.
No one will ever come between us, Stevie.
We'll always be together.
- I'm sorry I burned that doll.
- It was just a doll.
- I didn't care.
- I knew you wouldn't.
That other Bunny came between us, too, didn't she?
Not really. She was only make-believe.
Mommy.
But she did come between us.
That's why she had to die and go to heaven.
No, don't. I'll do it, Stevie.
Let me do it.
No, Annie.
You don't like me the best anymore.
You like her.
You whisper to her at night.
You tell her secrets that you won't tell me.
I can't trust you.
Of course you can, Stevie.
I promise.
It isn't fair.
When the make-believe
Bunny came between us... you made her die and go to heaven.
Now it's my turn.
Stevie, I'm tired of this game.
I want to play hide-and-seek.
- I bet I beat you.
- I bet you don't.
I thought it up, so you're it.
- Now hide your face and count, Stevie.
- All right.
But I'll catch you.
Just you wait and see.
One, two, three, four...
- I won!
- Not until the game is finished.
You haven't tagged me yet.
Here we go round the mulberry Bush
The mulberry Bush, the mulberry Bush
Here we go round the mulberry Bush
On a cold and frosty morning
This is the way we jump up and down
Jump up and down, jump up and down
This is the way we jump up and down
Jump up and down
This is the way we jump up and down
On a cold and frosty morning
Hey, let's play blind mans bluff!
Yes, let's!
Here I come, ready or not.
- I won!
- Now it's my turn.
Darling, move in here... and sit down very quietly.
Don't move till Mommy gets back.
Promise me.
- Promise.
- All right.
Please don't. Don't.
You cheated.
Steven, you don't mean it.
You can't possibly be serious.
You love Bunny, too.
We can all be happy, all three of us together.
Steven, don't.
Please give her to me, Steven.
Steven, you're sick.
You're mad, Steven! Sick!
Please, Steven.
Steven, give her to me, please.
Steven, give her to me.
Please, Steven.
Give her to me.
Steven, please.
Stevie, come here.
I want to go high, Stevie, and I can't go high without you.
Come here.
Come here right now... or I won't play with you anymore ever again.
Annie needs to play with you.
Push me, Stevie.
I want to touch the sky.
Up to the sky.
- Fly up to the sky!
- Up to the sky!
- Higher!
- Higher!
Higher and higher!
You shouldn't have lied about the boat they arrived on, Mr. Lake.
Quite unnecessary and sure to be found out.
Rogers, you'll drive Miss
Lake home, won't you?
Yes, sir.
Sleep well, both of you... now that you exist.
Your boss has given you this factory.
What do you think?
So he's the main character in this story?
Hasn't this blocked all chance of a workers' revolution in the future?
Is his act unique, or a general modern world tendency?
A general tendency, I think
Can such acts, as symbols of a new source of power...
...herald the transformation of all humanity into the bourgeoisie?
The bourgeoisie will never turn all humanity into bourgeoisie
So the not very original answer is:
No matter what he does, even giving away a factory...
...a bourgeois is always wrong
- Is that it?
- I don't want to reply
This bourgeoisie is making revolutionary changes...
...in our situation
It's identifying all humanity with the bourgeois class
It no longerfaces a class struggle...
...using the army, the nation or the church
Then it would fail; it would lose its natural allies
You must answer the new questions raised by the bourgeoisie
Of course
What are the answers to these questions?
God led the people about
through the way of the wilderness
ARRIVING TOMORROW
Pietro, how about some music?
Well, do you feel better?
It was nothing
Sorry. I'm afraid it's all rather make shift
It's fine
It's been a real invasion
I used to sleep in this room when I was little
I'm here
Sorry
Your friends are calling you
You're a serious player
These are my friends
What's the time?
I don't know
- What does it matter?
- It's six o'clock
It's about a sick man like me
Even in this disagreeable situation
Ivan Ilyich found comfort
Gerasim came to wash him. Gerasim
was a clean, fresh peasant boy
What are you reading?
His life was his and his alone
It would take longerto duplicate
his goodness than to create a star
The godhead which had come
without my hoping for it...
...has not returned, and will
never return again
I like speeding. Now I'll show you what the car can do
I believe you, but I'm not young any more
You're not Gerasim...
...it's difficult to face you
There are two reasons
I must talk to you
Firstly, there's my moral sense
Then there's a sort of confusion within me...
...which maybe I can only clarify by talking about it
You have seduced me, Lord,
and I have let myself be seduced
You have violated me
and you have prevailed
I have become an object of daily
derision, everyone mocks me
For I heard the defaming of many,
terroron every side
"Denounce him, and we will
denounce him"
All my friends awaited my downfall,
saying:
"Perhaps he will let himself be
seduced...
"...and we shall take our revenge
on him"
What did you say? So you do talk!
I must go. Tomorrow
I don't know myself any more
Because what made me the same as others has been destroyed
I was like all the others, maybe with many faults
You've made me different by taking me from the natural order of things
While you were near,
I didn't realise it
Now I understand, you're leaving...
...and knowing I'm losing you makes me aware of my difference
What will become of me from now on?
The future will be like living with someone nothing to do with myself
Maybe I must probe the depths of this difference you have revealed...
...which is the innermost anguish of my being
But whether I desire it or not, won't this set me against everyone?
I realise now that I've never had...
...any real interest in anything
I don't mean some special interest
Not even ordinary interests, like my husband's in his work...
...or my son's in his studies, or Odetta's domestic cult
I had no interests
I don't know how I could lead such an empty life, but I did...
If there was anything... some instinctive love of life...
...it dried up like a garden where nobody goes
That emptiness was filled with false, mean values...
...with a hideous load of false ideas
Now I realise it, you've filled my life with a total interest
So, in parting, you're not destroying anything I had before...
...except perhaps my chaste bourgeois reputation. What do I care?
But what you yourself gave me...
...love in my empty life...
...by leaving me you're destroying it completely
By knowing me, you've made me a normal girl
You've made me find the right solution for my life
Before, I didn't know men, but I was afraid of them
I loved only my father
But now, in leaving me, you're making me worse than before
Did you want that? Now the pain of losing you...
...will cause a relapse more dangerous than the sickness I had...
...before this brief cure that your presence brought
Before, I didn't understand this illness, but now I do
Through the love you gave me
I've become aware of my illness
Now how can I replace you?
Is there anyone who can?
I don't think I can go on living
You must have come here to destroy
The destruction you've caused in me couldn't be more complete
You've simply destroyed the image
I always had of myself
Now I can't see anything at all...
...that can rebuild my identity
What do you suggest?
A scandal like death in the eyes of society...
...a complete loss of myself
How can this be for a man used to the idea of order...
...of the future and, above all, of ownership?
- I'll carry it
- No, I'll carry it
Then let's carry it together
- Have you got a tape measure?
- At once, miss
Time to eat, miss
I can't help it. It's beyond my expertise. Sorry
Open your fist, miss, please
How pathetic! I'm a real shit!
I'm not eating
You must eat. It's good
I don't want to
Why don't you want to eat? It's good
At least tell us what you want to eat
We must try to invent new techniques, unrecognisable...
...which are unlike any previous method...
...to avoid childishness, ridicule...
...make our world unlike any other...
...where previous standards don't apply...
...which must be new, like the technique
Nobody must realise that the artist is worthless...
...that he's an abnormal, inferior being...
...who squirms and twists like a worm to survive
Nobody must ever catch him out as naive
Everything must be presented as perfect...
...based on unknown, unquestionable rules...
...like a madman, that's it
Pane after pane, because I can't correct anything...
...and nobody must notice
A sign painted on a pane...
...corrects, without soiling it...
...a sign painted earlier on another pane
But everyone must believe...
...that it isn't the trick of an untalented artist, impotent artist
Not at all. It must look like a sure decision...
...fearless, lofty and almost arrogant
Nobody must know that a sign succeeds by chance... is fragile
That as soon as a sign appears well made, by a miracle...
...it must be protected, looked after, as in a shrine
But nobody must realise...
...that the artist is a poor, trembling idiot, second-rate...
...living by chance and risk, in disgrace like a child...
...his life reduced to absurd melancholy...
...degraded by the feeling of something lost for ever
DOWN WITH ALL STATES
DOWN WITH ALL CHURCHES
UP WITH PAINTERS OF...
Blue reminds me of him
But obviously blue isn't enough, it's only a part
Who can permit me such mutilation, what ideology can justify it?
Weren't my first miserable attempts at portraits better?
Look at the state she's in, eating nettles
Lord, what a scandal
I don't smoke
Which is the road back to Milan?
Turn left, then straight on
What would happen to me if...
...I stripped myself of everything, gave my factory to the workers?
Let's go
Don't be afraid, I didn't come to die, but to weep
Not tears of sorrow
No, they will be a source... but not a source of suffering
Go away now
? In the heat of the night
? Seems like a cold sweat creepin' across my brow
? Yeah
? In the heat of the night
? I'm feelin' motherless somehow
? Stars with evil eyes
? Stare from the skies
? All mean and bright
? In the heat of the night
? Ain't a woman yet been born
? Knows how to make the mornin' come
? It's so hard to keep control
? When I could sell my soul
? For just a little light
? In the heat of the night
? In the heat of the night
? I've got trouble wall to wall
? Oh yes, I have
? I repeat
? I repeat, in the night
? Must be an ending to it all
? But hold on, it won't be long
? Just you be strong
? And it'll be all right
? In the heat of the night
Where you keepin' the pie tonight?
A man ate the last piece just before you come in.
What's that little old orphan sittin' right up there?
Marble cake.
Tell you what, Sam. Bein' she's in there by her little old lonesome,
I'll let you have her for free.
I told you 'bout that "Sam" business, didn't I? Hm?
Sorry, Mr Wood.
I mean, uh... Officer Wood.
? Well, a bow-legged Polly and a knocked-kneed Paul
? A bow-legged Polly and a knocked-kneed Paul
? A bow-legged Polly and a knocked-kneed Paul
? They can't get together at all
? Just like the worm in the cornfield said to his brother
? "Yeah, go in one ear and out the other"
? Well, a bucktoothed Clara and a cross-eyed Clyde
? A bucktoothed Clara and a cross-eyed Clyde
? Like old bow-legged Polly and a knock-kneed Paul
? Every time I see your face
? It's got a way of turnin' me around
? You tune me in, pretty baby
? Wild things begin
? Baby, that ain't love
? But it sure is groovy
(doctor) It's Colbert, all right.
Skull's caved in.
You ever take a homicide picture before, son?
Well, at least he won't be movin' on me.
That's for sure. I want you to cover every angle. Do you hear me? Every angle.
Uh, you boys, move on back now, OK?
Came all this way to build us a factory, make somethin' outta this town.
Look what it got him.
Yeah.
Sam, did he have a wallet, identification, anything like that?
That's the first thing I looked for.
Whoever fixed him musta took 'em.
Nothin'.
- Any witnesses?
- I mean, not even a cat.
- How long's he been dead?
- Oh, less than an hour.
- Less than an hour.
- Maybe half that.
Maybe half.
Could have been a hitchhiker.
Check both ends of town, check the depot, and check the pool hall. OK?
- Pool hall closed at one o'clock, Chief.
- I said check it, Sam.
Yes, sir.
On your feet, boy.
I mean now!
Get against that wall.
Get them hands high!
Spread them fingers out.
I wanna count all ten.
You move before I tell you to, boy, by God, I'm gonna clean your plough.
That's pretty fat there, ain't it, boy? Huh?
Now, outside there's a police car.
You're gonna pick up that bag.
You're gonna walk out, and you're gonna plant yourself in the back.
And you're gonna be a real nice quiet boy all the way in.
You hear?!
C'mon, boy.
Move it!
Chief here?
- Hey, what's up, Sam?
- (Sam) Chief?
What's goin' on?
- Sam?
- (squeaking)
- Wood?
- Yes, sir?
When's the last time I asked Courtney to get oil for this damn thing?
Uh, last Wednesday.
Would you be kind enough to go outside and remind him what day it is today?
Well, uh... how about the prisoner here?
Don't you worry about him.
Got a name, boy?
Virgil Tibbs.
Virgil?
Well, I don't think we're gonna have any trouble, are we, Virgil?
No trouble at all.
Oh, you can go now, Sam.
Yes, sir.
- What did you hit him with?
- Hit whom?
"Whom"? Whom?
You a Northern boy? What's a Northern boy like you doin' all the way down here?
- I was waiting for the train.
- There ain't no trains this time of mornin'.
- Tuesdays only. 4.05 to Memphis.
- You say.
Well... All right, you say right.
All right... Virgil.
Oh!
Now look.
I try to run a nice, clean, safe town here.
A town where a man can sneeze and not get his brains beat out. You follow me?
Yes.
Why don't you tell me how you killed
Mr Colbert? You'll feel a whole lot better.
Not now!
I was visiting my mother.
I came in on the 12.35 from Brownsville.
I was waiting to go out on the 4.05.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And meanwhile, you killed yourself a white man and picked yourself up $200!
I earned that money, ten hours a day, seven days a week.
Coloured can't earn that. It's more than I make in a month! Where did you earn it?!
- Philadelphia.
- Mississippi?
- Pennsylvania.
- Just how do you earn that kinda money?
I'm a police officer.
Oh, yeah.
- Wood!
- Yes, sir!
- Did you question this man?
- No, sir.
Would you mind taking a look at that?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
I'll check on this wise city boy.
You take him outside and hold him.
Yes, sir.
May I suggest that you call my chief rather than send a wire or anything?
I mean, it would be quicker.
And I'll pay for the call.
Did you hear? Did you hear him say he'd pay for the call?
How much do they pay you to do their police work?
$162.39 per week.
$162.39 a week!
Well, boy! Take him outside, Wood.
But treat him easy, because a man that makes $162.39 a week - man, we do not wanna ruffle him!
No, sir!
Courtney... would you try and get me long-distance?
(Courtney) Police business, honey.
Chief's on the line.
No. He catch you listenin' in, he'll run your butt around the block.
- He don't panic me none.
- No?
- Where's the chief?
- You got the pictures of the dead man?
Sure do. I got him top, bottom, sideways - you name it.
- Good. I'll take 'em, son.
- No, I wanna give 'em to the chief.
- I said I'd take 'em, Charlie.
- Do like he tells you, Charlie.
Somebody owes me some money for those.
I had to buy paper and film and developin'.
That's all right. Just bill the department.
Everything will be taken care of.
God Almighty. He sure looks bad.
May I see the man
I am supposed to have killed?
Sure. I don't know why not.
(whispers) Hey, Sam. He's finished talkin'.
- Here's the photos of the dead man.
- OK.
Got your chief on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.
Hello? Yes, sir. I'm sorry to have gotten you involved in this.
I really had no choice.
Yes, sir.
You can't be serious, sir. I mean, even if I could be of help, they wouldn't want it.
No, sir. I'm not prejudiced.
Yes, sir. I am a police officer and they're police officers, but...
Hello. This is Gillespie.
Yes, sir. Yep, well...
You don't say?
He's your number one homicide expert?
Well, my, my, my.
I don't think we need any help.
We can wrap this up ourselves.
Yes, sir. But I do want to thank you for offering me such a powerful piece of manpower as Virgil Tibbs.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Yeah. Goodbye, now.
Oh, it's all there.
We paid for the phone call ourselves.
Now, you are the number one homicide expert.
- That's right.
- I bet you look at a lot of dead bodies.
Lots.
Well?
- Well, what?
- Well...
I just thought maybe, uh... Maybe you wouldn't mind takin' a look at this one?
No, thanks.
- Why not, expert?
- Because I've got a train to catch.
Wait a minute.
That train don't leave till noon.
They pay you $162.39 a week just to look at bodies. Why can't you look at this one?
- Why can't you look at it for yourself?
- Because I'm not an expert...
Officer!
Ten cents, ten million dollars - just doesn't matter when a man's time comes.
Mm-hm.
I could give him a nicer service right here in Sparta than he could ever get up there in Chicago. And at half the price, too.
- I got a rosewood casket out there...
- (door opens)
Ted Ulam, Chief.
We haven't had the pleasure.
That's for sure.
He's with me.
Hello, Doc.
Yep.
Well...
Uh...
Do you wanna look at it?
(Virgil) New manicure. That's good.
That's very good.
- I'll need a few things.
- (Gillespie) Such as?
Ammonium hydrosulphide, benzidine, superoxide of hydrogen.
Copper powder, distilled water.
A six-inch celluloid scale.
Thermometer.
Some tweezers.
Callipers. And some toothpicks.
Toothpicks?! Copper...?
What's goin' on here, Chief?
Who is this boy anyway?
I asked him to look at the body.
That's who he is.
It's 4.45. What time was this man killed?
Sam found him at 3am. The doctor says it's possible he was killed an hour earlier.
- At two?
- Maybe a little later.
Would you feel the face and jaw, please?
Am I mistaken, or has rigor begun?
It has.
You'll notice too that postmortem lividity is present.
So the time of death really has to be earlier. Wouldn't you say?
Mm.
Well, we'll be able to pinpoint that as soon as I get a thermometer.
As you know, the loss of heat from the brain is the most reliable way of determining time of death.
Right, Chief?
Oh, yeah.
Well...
Which one of you gentlemen will assist me?
Ulam's Funer... It's for you, Chief.
Yeah. Talk to me.
When?
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. Right away. I've got a runaway suspect, boy. I gotta go.
Now listen, you. Anything he wants, man, you better see that he gets it.
Where can I wash my hands?
This here's Shagbag, you hear?
He's headed for the river.
The river, you hear?
He's gonna be in Arkansas.
Shoot.
OK. I got him.
Mrs Colbert.
- How is she taking it?
- Chief had to leave. She don't know it yet.
Hey! You can't go in there, boy!
- Mrs Colbert?
- Where's my husband?
What's happened to him? Why won't anybody tell me what's happened to him?
Why won't anybody here tell me?
I have a right to know if he's hurt, if he's been in an accident.
I want to know if he is all right!
Your husband is dead, Mrs Colbert.
Uh...
Somebody killed him.
We don't know who - yet.
It's, uh...
It's very hot in here.
It's very hot in this room.
Sit down.
No.
Would you...
Would you... leave me alone for a few minutes, please?
Virgil, we don't need you or your microscopes. Tell that to your chief.
We don't need him - or you.
Mrs Colbert's in there.
- I've already told her.
- I see.
Here is the examination results from
Ulam's. You wanna know what I found?
No. I don't need to look at 'em now.
May I examine this prisoner?
Yeah, you can look at him.
C'mon, let him look. Go on.
All right, now! Steady!
You finished?
Thank you.
All right, Fryer, bring him with me.
- Now we're grindin' corn!
- You shoulda been there!
If it weren't for them radios, we woulda lost him goin' over that bridge.
That old boy highballing that train like to cut us off.
And old Charlie's hound dog got loose...
- Did he confess?
- Huh?
The man you arrested, did he confess?
Well, I believe he will.
Yes siree, I believe he will.
I believe he will.
- He's left-handed, isn't he?
- How do I know?
Well, he seemed left-handed to me.
I believe Harvey is a southpaw.
Now, ain't he, Shagbag?
What if he is? What's that make him?
Innocent.
Mrs Colbert... There's just one more thing.
Yeah.
I picked it up, I tell you. He was already lyin' there. It was lyin' there next to him!
I just picked it up, ma'am. That's all I did.
Shut up.
- Get him outta here.
- OK. C'mon, Harvey. Let's go.
Mrs Colbert, I, uh... I wonder if you'd mind if I have somebody drive you over so you could, uh... complete the identification?
Martin, I want you to take
Mrs Colbert over to the funeral parlour.
And, Wood, run Virgil down the depot.
Uh... Virge here, Chief, he thinks that Harvey's innocent.
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Could I talk to you about it, in private?
No. Because I got Colbert's wallet in my hand, and we took it from Harvey Oberst.
- You think he gave it to him?
- I don't know.
But Oberst could have come along after the crime, found it, picked it up.
- I don't know.
- That's what the boy said he did.
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I say different.
When I examined the deceased, it was obvious the fatal blow was struck from an angle of
17 degrees from the right, which makes it almost certain the person who did it is right-handed.
- So what?
- (Shagbag) Harve's left-handed, Chief.
- Everybody in town knows that.
- We figured that out.
Harvey's a lefty. Uh-huh.
You're sure of yourself, Virgil. Funny name for a nigger boy from Philadelphia.
- What do they call you up there?
- They call me Mr Tibbs!
Mr Tibbs! Well, Mr Wood, take Mr Tibbs, take him down to the depot.
And I mean, boy, like now!
I'll have the FBI lab send you the report on this.
Not that it'll make any difference.
I'll take that.
No, you won't.
I'm sending it in personally.
(Mrs Colbert) My God!
What kind of people are you?
What kind of a place is this?
My husband is dead.
Somebody in this town killed him!
I want you to find out who!
You gonna give me that?
No, I'm not.
Wood, you take him, and you lock him up for withholding evidence.
Go on, move! Put him with his friend, Harvey Oberst!
Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains to the hogs, that's for damn sure.
Hold on there, Arnold. Open her up again.
We got another customer.
(Harvey) Hey, man, not in here.
- Put him somewheres else!
- Don't push the panic button.
Play it cool, boy. Play it cool.
Hey!
- Hey!
- (door shuts)
What you doin' wearin' white man's clothes?
Where d'you come from?
You deaf or somethin'?
Listen, I'm get...
Keep cool, Harvey.
I'm on your side.
Well, I don't need you!
I'm all you've got.
Police?
You're a cop?
- You're a cop.
- Mm-hm.
Yeah?
So, how come they locked you up?
How come they lock up a cop?
Who said they locked me up?
How come with all these empty cells here they'd throw me in with you? You dig?
Look.
I already told 'em.
I see this fella lyin' on the street there.
And there's this wallet lyin' beside him.
Boy, I mean, I come into this world outta luck.
Here's the first good thing to come my way. And I pick it up.
But when I see whose wallet it is...
I mean, I start to sweat. But I heard about this new chief. This Gillepsbie?
Got no more smile than a turnip.
So I cut across the fields, headin' for the line, and got myself as far as the bridge before Gillepsbie grabbed me.
What time did you find the wallet?
Well, I ain't got no watch, but it must have been after two, by the courthouse clock.
I'm interested in eleven to two.
Where were you?
Shootin' pool. Larry's Lounge.
I got there about ten.
- What time'd you leave?
- Closin'. Must have been one.
- Anybody can swear for you?
- Packy, Bert, Les.
Ever been in trouble with the police before?
Come on.
I could ask at the desk, you know.
Well, they brought me in one time.
- On account of this Delores Purdy.
- On what charge?
Well, uh, this Delores, she, uh... she's real proud of what nature done for her, you know?
And, uh...
Well, we was on a date up to Clarke's Point, and, uh... she says, uh... (sniggers)
Anyway, she asks me, she says, uh...
"Don't you think I got a classy build?"
And I say "Sure."
And so she starts to show me.
But I didn't do nothin' wrong.
I just didn't stop her from tryin' to prove her point.
Then this cop, Sam Wood, comes chargin' outta the bush and hauls me in.
He let you go, didn't he?
Told me not to mess with her no more.
She lives on Third, a block from me.
Traipsin' around in the altogether.
With the lights on.
Now, somebody sure oughta make her stop doin' that.
Come here.
Let me see your right hand.
- What you doin'?
- Hold still.
All right now, give him the waiver for false arrest.
(Virgil) Forget it.
I'm askin' you to sign it. Please.
Give him a pen. Give him a pen.
All right. Let him out.
You'll be able to catch the 12.10 train.
It wouldn't be a bad idea to change the charge against Oberst.
He was nowhere near the scene of the crime, and I think he can prove it.
- I bet you know when Colbert was killed.
- About 12.30.
- While Harvey was still shooting pool.
- Wait a minute. I'll get it.
There's cue chalk under his nails, not dried blood.
- Thank God I don't live in Philadelphia.
- One more thing.
Colbert wasn't killed where the body was found.
- What do you mean?
- He was killed then moved to Main Street.
- Courtney?
- Yes, sir?
Change the charge to theft.
D'you mean Harve?
Who the hell else do we have back there?!
Yes, sir.
Hey.
Didn't I ask you to fix that gate?
No, not me, sir. Must have been my brother Harold. He's on days.
Harold.
Police department.
Yes, he's here. Hold on, sir.
Mayor's on the line, Chief.
What's all this Miz Colbert's been tellin' me about a... a cover-up arrest?
No, ma'am. We ain't had no cover-up.
In fact, we just dropped the charges for insufficient evidence.
Miz Colbert, I told you he was nobody's man.
I came by to make it as clear as I possibly can that I do not want that Negro officer taken off this case.
Negro officer?
Yeah, well, he, uh...
He comes from up North, you see.
And he was, uh, kinda...
- passin' through...
- If it wasn't for him, your impartial chief of police would still have the wrong man behind bars.
I want that officer given a free hand.
Otherwise, I will pack up my husband's engineers... and leave you... to yourselves.
Miz Colbert, now don't you worry about a thing.
Believe me, we're gonna take care of everything.
Bill?
I wanna see you come through this now, you hear?
Even if we have to step on Endicott's toes?
Even that.
But do it fast.
All right.
Now, Bill, how about this here Negro officer?
Miz Colbert seems to have confidence in him.
Oh, he ain't nothin'. Some kind of a... some kind of a homicide expert.
But I don't need him.
You mean you don't want him.
But you do need him.
Now look, Bill.
Suppose he turns up the killer.
He has no police power here. He's gonna have to hand him over on a platter, right?
That's right.
And if he fails, you're off the hook, cos it was Miz Colbert's idea in the first place.
See what I mean?
Oh, yeah.
Works out all the way around, Bill.
For all of us.
Excuse me.
Any reason why you have to leave today?
There's lots of reasons.
What would you say if
I asked you to stay for a while?
No.
This town needs a factory, Virgil.
Colbert come down from Chicago to build it.
I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.
Half of them'd be coloured.
- Know what that means?
- Probably got him killed.
That's what Mrs Colbert thinks.
She wants us to catch her a killer.
No killer, no factory.
Well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta coloured people. You follow me?
- I'm going home, man.
- They're your people.
Not mine - yours. You made this scene.
- What do you want me to do? Beg you?
- Look, I've had your town up to here!
Boy, it would give me a world of satisfaction to horsewhip you, Virgil!
My father used to say that.
- Even did, once or twice.
- Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.
Now you listen to me.
Just once in my life
I'm gonna hold my temper.
I'm tellin' you that you're gonna stay.
You'll stay here if I have to have your chief remind you what he told you to do.
But I don't think
I have to do that, you see?
No. Because you're so damned smart.
You're smarter than any white man.
You're just gonna stay here and show us all.
You could never live with yourself unless you could put us all to shame.
You wanna know something, Virgil?
I don't think that you could let an opportunity like that pass by.
Jess?
Jess, this is, uh...
This is Virgil. He's workin' for me.
Give him somethin' that runs. Fix him up.
What I fix, runs. Who pays?
Police.
Well, you know where to find me.
What you doin' here, man?
Policeman.
You're a policeman here in Sparta?
They've got a murder they don't know what to do with.
They need a whipping boy.
You got a roof?
No. I'll find a motel.
Viola... We got company.
Know what's gonna happen?
He gonna get hisself killed.
You watch and see he don't.
I'm aware of the risk, Tom.
But, like it or not, we're stuck with him.
Not if the chief here is right on the ball.
What do you say, Chief? You got that old killer all lined up in your front sights, hm?
I'm workin' on it.
Tom, climb off of Gillespie's back now.
You know damn well we didn't hire him off a homicide squad.
Yeah, well, it's gonna be his week.
Cos Colbert's only the start.
I say this nigger won't live past Saturday.
Mrs Colbert, can you tell me about your husband's enemies?
That's Endicott.
He's been fighting us all the way.
He sits up on his hill and runs this county.
Or did, until we moved in.
Did your husband tell you where he was going last night?
He said he wasn't sleepy. I went to bed.
What time was that?
A little after 11, I think.
Did he call you, or anybody on your staff, after 11?
No.
Maybe the elevator boy can tell us what time he went out.
They put it on self-service after ten.
Did your husband use a car here?
Find anything?
- Whoever killed Colbert drove this car.
- How do you know?
Where you goin'?
I'd drive up there, but I'm sure you don't want me running up there by myself.
- Up where?
- Eric Endicott's.
Endicott's?! Come on, now!
None of that for you, huh, Virgil?
? In the heat of the night
? Mm-hm, ain't a woman yet been born
? Yeah
? Knows how to make the mornin' come
? It's so hard to keep control
? Yes, it is
? When I could sell my soul
? For just a little light
? In the heat of the night
Listen. You know something I don't know?
I found a piece of osmunda in Colbert's car.
- A piece of what?
- On the brake pedal. Osmunda. Fern root.
Fern root? Oh, is Mr Endicott here?
Yes, sir. He's out in the greenhouse.
Would you follow me, please?
- Gillespie.
- Mr Endicott.
This here's Virgil.
- Mr Tibbs.
- How do you do, sir?
Oh, may I have Henry fetch you somethin'? Some light refreshment?
- No, thank you. We're all right...
- I'll have something cold, soft. Anything.
Henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade.
I'll have one, too.
Yes, sir.
I didn't know it was possible to grow this species locally.
- Oh, you like flowers?
- I do.
Mr Tibbs, do you know anything about orchids?
- Not very much, but I do like them.
- Well, let me show you.
Endicott's folly.
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful. It's breathtaking.
- Have you a favourite, Mr Tibbs?
- Well, I'm partial to any of the epiphytics.
Why, isn't that remarkable!
That of all the orchids in this place, you should prefer the epiphytics.
I wonder if you know why.
Maybe it would be helpful if you'd tell me.
Because, like the Negro, they need care and feedin' and cultivatin'.
And that takes time.
That's somethin' you can't make some people understand.
That's somethin'
Mr Colbert didn't realise.
Is this what the epiphytics root in?
My point! They thrive on it.
Take it away from them, they do poorly.
- What do you call this material?
- That's osmunda. Fern root.
Well, we don't wanna take any more of your time, Mr Endicott.
Why'd you two come here?
To ask you about Mr Colbert.
Let me understand this.
You two came here... to question me?
Well, your... your attitudes, Mr Endicott, your points of view, are a matter of record.
Some people - let us say the people who work for Mr Colbert - might reasonably regard you as the person least likely to mourn his passing.
We were just trying to clarify some of the evidence.
Was Mr Colbert ever in this greenhouse?
Say, last night, about midnight?
Gillespie?
Yeah?
- You saw it.
- Oh, I saw it.
What are you gonna do about it?
I don't know.
I'll remember that.
There was a time... when I could have had you shot.
- You better clear out. And I mean fast!
- What about that speech you gave me?
I didn't know you'd slap any white man!
Least of all Endicott!
All right. Give me another day.
Two days. I'm close.
I can pull that fat cat down.
I can bring him right off this hill!
Oh, boy.
Man, you're just like the rest of us.
Ain't ya?
It's all my fault.
But there's no point in ducking it.
It's gonna be tough to keep you in your job now.
Now look here, Bill. I don't have to tell you how urgent it is to get Tibbs outta town.
- No. I already told him to go.
- All right.
Now, Miz Colbert is not gonna be back till Thursday.
You catch your guilty party by then, she won't hold it against us we had to send Tibbs home for his own good.
But you gotta do it, you hear?
I hear.
Bill?
What's made you change your mind about Tibbs?
Who says I have?
Last chief we had, he'd have shot Tibbs one second after he slapped Endicott, claimed self-defence.
- Gillespie here.
- Courtney here, sir.
- Did you take Virgil down the depot?
- No, sir. He just plain wouldn't go.
- Shagbag saw him headin' to River Road.
- Check.
Hey! C'mon! C'mon!
Hey! C'mon!
OK, black boy. We come here to teach you some manners.
We told you about them bad manners, boy. You better put that down.
(Virgil) Why don't you come and get it, baby?
(thug) C'mon, man. You ain't nothin'.
C'mon. Let's get him.
We'll put that round your neck.
Hit him, man! Get him from the side!
Get behind him!
All right, hold it!
All right, boys.
You've had your fun.
Now go on, you just run along home.
Nigger-lover.
- I didn't catch what you said.
- Get rid of the nigger.
You don't... we will.
Now, is that a suggestion, or is that an order?
That's a warnin'!
I see.
I see.
Shut up and take this trash outta here!
Come on, move it and go!
Well, you finally get the message, Virgil?!
May I get in?
- Thought you left town.
- Not yet.
Could you follow the same route you followed Tuesday night, same speed?
- Why?
- Why not?
- Maybe I better check with the chief.
- I wouldn't want him to slap you down for steppin' outta line, makin' decisions on your own, and all that.
He don't knock me outta my socks.
Let's get rollin', Virgil.
? All you little birds better lock up tight
? Cos there's a foul owl on the prowl tonight
? Hey, little lark, get outta the dark
? Foul owl on the prowl
? Cute little jay, stay outta his way
? Foul owl on the prowl
? You just might be the quail he'll tail
? Foul owl on the prowl
? You just might be the swallow he'll follow
? Foul owl on the prowl
? If you hear him hoot - scoot
? If you pass his tree - flee
? If you catch his eye - fly
? Don't wait to say goodbye
Take ten minutes to get myself a king-sized Coke and a wedge of pie.
That is, if that peckerwood ain't sold out again.
- Can I bring you anything?
- No. I'm coming in.
I thought I told you to get outta here.
- I'm not ready to leave.
- I was gonna tell you, Chief.
- You forget about those four maniacs?
- I need more time.
- Do I have to put you on the train myself?!
- I guess so!
Whoa.
All right, Virgil.
Just what the hell do you want?
I wanna know exactly where Sam was at all times on the night of the murder.
? If you pass his tree - flee
? If you catch his eye - fly
Virgil, if you get killed, we'll have one hell of a mess in this town. You know that?
I know.
Got some real luscious cream pie for you tonight, Sam.
I mean Officer Wood.
Just like you always order.
You know I don't eat that stuff. The chief likes his boys streamlined. Right, Chief?
Why don't you shut up, Sam?
- All right, what'll you have, Virgil?
- I ain't servin' him!
Tuesday night you walked out of here at 2.40. Right?
Right on the button.
Two minutes from now.
That's for him.
Now, what'd you do when you came out that night?
Well, I picked up the radio and called in.
Do it, please.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Uh... Wood to radio.
I'm leavin' Compton's now.
(Courtney) Sam, look sharp.
Gillespie's sniffin' around.
Gimme that thing!
Courtney, your brother says I didn't tell him to fix that hinge, so I told you.
Do you read me, Courtney?
- Oh, I'll get right on it, Chief.
- I'd do that if I were you.
Yes, sir. Ten-four.
All right, you can move us. Officer Wood.
- Why'd you do that, Sam?
- Do what?
Change your route back there at the corner.
Who says I changed?
Look, I oughta know what I did!
Chief, do I have to put up with this?
Do I work for you, or do I work for him?
Good night, gentlemen.
I don't know.
- I don't know.
- Well, I appreciate anything you can do.
- This is highly irregular.
- Yeah, I know that.
Showing our depositors' accounts?
Hm. I don't know.
- You sure this is an official request?
- Yes. It's official, yes.
- You willing to put that in writing?
- Yeah. I'll put it in writing.
On police department letterhead?
I would write it on the head of a pin if you want it there.
- I gotta have somethin' for the file.
- I realise that, but I'm in a hurry.
Well, we'll see.
He's had an account with us for several years now.
That so?
Not a large account.
Never more than... Yeah.
That was back in '62. September.
I am not interested in '62 September.
I am interested in yesterday.
Yesterday? Well...
Well.
According to this, he made a deposit of... $632.
- Yesterday?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Must have been when I was out to lunch.
A deposit that size, I'd remember.
Oh, you'll send me that letter for the file, you hear?
I'll tell you, baby brother, the chief didn't like him, not even from the first.
- Morning.
- Where do you think you're goin'?
(Courtney) It's all right. Let him go.
I just talked to the FBI lab. We can prove Colbert was in that greenhouse.
Endicott's covering up.
I'm afraid you're too late.
We already got the guilty man.
- Who?
- Sam.
- Sam?
- That's right.
Our man is Endicott.
You just think a minute.
Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?
And yesterday he makes a big cash deposit at the bank.
If I told you once,
I told you a hundred times that I won that matchin' quarters and halves. It took me three years!
Then why was it in big bills? I checked.
Because whenever I got enough change,
I'd trade it in on $20 bills.
And when I got up to $600,
I took it down and put it in the bank.
The day Colbert was killed, he cashed a cheque for $900, $600 of which is gone,
$300 of which I believe you left in the wallet as bait for some kid like Oberst!
- What kinda man do you think I am?!
- Now, don't you push me, boy!
Now listen.
If you weren't suspicious of Sam here, why did you question him last night when he changed his route?
- I knew why he changed his route.
- Knew what?
He was afraid I'd see some naked white girl down the block.
- What?
- Some girl named Delores Purdy.
She parades around in the nude at night to get her kicks. That's...
- How do you know?
- I know.
Well, I know. Do you understand?
I know that Colbert cashed a cheque for $900.
I know that Sam made a big cash deposit.
I know that you caught him in a lie.
And I know that's enough for me.
C'mon, Sam.
Martin, lock him up.
Well?
Well... you're making a mistake.
Don't you bet against it.
You can catch your train now, Virgil.
Tibbs?
Do you think Sam did it?
- Where do I find the chief?
- What's it all about?
My business.
Hey, look, Purdy.
Now, you got a complaint?
Well, right here's where you file it.
What I got to say, I say to the chief.
It's about Sam Wood.
All right.
- (knock on door)
- (Gillespie) Yeah?
(Harold) Purdy's out here, sir.
It's about Sam.
All right. Send him in.
She is gonna have a baby.
Sam Wood's baby.
Well, ask her yourself if you don't believe me!
What are you doin' here?
It's important that I hear this.
I ain't talkin' about this with him in the room.
- Boy, you don't want trouble, you get!
- You be sensible. I'm a police officer.
You gonna get him outta here, or do I gotta do it?!
You ain't gonna do nothin'.
You just stand there and shut up.
Sit down, little girl.
All right, now.
You tell me... all about it.
Just tell me how it happened.
Oh, come on. Come on, girl, speak!
- Well, you know how hot it's been.
- Yeah.
Nights, they aren't any better.
My brother works nights.
He leaves me all alone.
This particular night,
I go out on the porch.
I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be if I had a fountain drink.
Sam comes down our road.
Just like he comes every night.
Passin' like a lord in that fine, big, shiny car.
Only, this time he stops.
He's got a nice face, don't you think, Chief?
So he stopped.
- (softly) He says...
- What? I didn't hear what you said.
(Iouder) He says...
"Hey, little girl, you know what the coolest spot in town is?"
And I said "No, Sam. I guess I don't."
And he said...
"The cemetery. That's where."
"Know why?"
"Cos they got all of them big, cool tombstones."
"Ever stretch out on a tombstone, Delores?"
"Feel all that nice, cool marble along your body?"
- He said that?
- You hear, Chief? You hear?
Yeah, I hear. I hear.
All right. Sam comes along and stops in front of your house and talks. What else?
Well, come on now, girl.
What else? What else? What else?
- Then I went for a ride with him.
- Where'd you go?
The cemetery.
So, Wood took you to the cemetery in the patrol car, right?
And then things went a bit too far.
Is that what you're sayin'?
Did they get a little bit outta line?
Come on now.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?
Come on, girl! Is it or ain't it?
- Yeah, they went too far!
- Well, fine!
Now, I got one more question.
Very important.
Did he force you, or did you let him?
Don't mean a damn whether she let him or not! She is still 16!
In this state, that's rape!
I know the plain law on that!
I know the laws in the state of Mississippi, thank you!
- Are you sure you're pregnant?
- Yes, I am pregnant!
- Courtney!
- Yes, sir?
Better get in here with a pad and a pencil.
Come on in. I want you to take this all down.
You had no right to keep a nigger in the room, shame my little sister.
You had no right.
Virge, what's happenin'?
- Hi, Harve.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Man, uh...
- You sure saved my hide.
- Listen, Harvey. Man, uh...
If a guy knocks up a girl in this town, where can he go for help?
- Barbershop.
- Barbershop?
Borrow Mr Fanning's razor and cut your throat!
Well...
But suppose
Mr Fanning's razor is too dull.
Suppose he's got some real money to spread around.
Uh...
Well, uh...
There used to be a coloured gal.
But she kept bumpin' her price, and I don't know if she's still in business.
- What's her name?
- Well, I ain't never had to look her up.
But, uh... Packy might know.
Where do I find Packy?
Down at the pool hall.
But, man, he wouldn't tell you.
Not unless I say so.
And how am I gonna say so locked up in here?
Suppose I get word to Packy that you wanna see him? Have him come here?
Will you let him bring me a cheeseburger?
Onions?
Now you're talkin'!
(Sam) Uh... Virge?
A little careless, ain't you, Virgil?
Parked in the road, you could get yourself killed. Anybody'd know where you are.
- You know what this land is?
- Yeah. It's the site for the new factory.
I found a piece of wood in Colbert's scalp.
The lab identified it as pine.
Three people saw Colbert drive by - alone - on the way back from Endicott's.
Colbert must have picked up somebody in town and then come out here.
I tell you he didn't pick up nobody.
Sam followed him here, come up behind him, just like I come up behind you.
- I heard you. Colbert would have too.
- He turned and he got smashed!
He was hit from behind!
If Delores Purdy hadn't come in,
I never would have seen the truth.
I was hung up trying to get Endicott, for personal reasons.
Do you know what I'm gonna do, Virgil?
I'm gonna take you to Brownsville and put you on the bus myself.
You aren't taking me anywhere.
You dig? You're holding the wrong man!
The wrong man?! I got the motive, which is money, and the body, which is dead!
- What makes you so sure?
- Why do you doubt it?!
Because Colbert was killed here!
Then driven back to town in his own car and dumped on the streets.
Sam couldn't have driven two cars!
What do you want?
Give me till morning.
You know...
You know, Virgil, you are among the chosen few.
How's that?
Well, I think that you're the first human being that's ever been in here.
Well, you can't be too careful, man.
You know a lotta things, don't you?
Well, just what do you know about insomnia?
Bourbon can't cure it.
Well... that's for sure.
Now look. I got no wife. I got no kids.
Boy, I got a town that... don't want me.
And I got an air conditioner that I have to oil myself, and a desk with a busted leg.
And on top of that, I got... this, uh... place.
Now, don't you think that'd drive a man to takin' a few drinks?
I'll tell you a secret.
Nobody comes here.
Never.
You married?
No.
Ever been?
No.
Ever been close to it?
Close to it.
Don't you get just... a little lonely?
No lonelier than you, man.
Oh, now, don't get smart, black boy.
I don't need it.
No pity, thank you.
No, thank you!
- Yeah?
- Chief?
- Yeah.
- You know where I can find Virgil?
Who are you?
Packy, Chief. Packy Harrison.
I'm a friend of Harve.
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.
- Where you goin'?
- Where whitey ain't allowed.
- What the hell does that mean?
- You gave me till morning. Remember?
- Here's the car.
- He could have exchanged cars by now.
John, you stick here. We'll keep cruisin'.
You find him, come back for me, you hear?
That's her place, here.
You want me to wait?
No, thank you, Packy. You go on home.
Mrs Bellamy?
People around here call me Mama Caleba.
Mama, I'm not from around here.
But you can put me on my train.
You talk crazy. You gin-drunk?
Just homesick.
Lord, Lord!
Whisper two little words,
Mama, and I'm on my way.
Maybe... I don't want to sever a beautiful child like you right out.
A man's name.
First name, last name.
The man who's paying you for Delores Purdy's abortion.
You're the boy who works for Mr Charlie.
I thought that's who you was.
Why you wanna do that?
Why you wanna help the police like that?
They stealin' your soul.
They chew you up and spit you out.
I'm not here to lay a finger on you, Mama.
It's the white boy I want.
What you got against him?
He's paying for his fun.
How much? I bet you he's not paying you more than a hundred.
You know how much he's got in his pocket right now? More than $600!
That cracker? (chuckles)
- Where'd he come off getting 600?
- He killed Mr Colbert.
You gone crazy out of your mind.
Now listen. Hear me good, Mama, please.
Don't make me have to send you to jail.
A lot you care!
There's white time in jail, and coloured time. The worst kind you can do is coloured time.
Child... you promise... give me understanding.
I got used to better.
You won't take it away?
I won't take it away.
Well... I don't know his name.
But she's coming here tonight.
Get herself straight.
- Leave me alone! Let me go!
- (man) Let go of her!
- Let go of her!
- Let go of me!
Gonna teach you, boy!
No club this time, man?
A gun's not smart. The way you killed Colbert was much smarter.
You killed Colbert?!
He's crazy. Crazy.
(thug) OK, nigger. Your time, nigger.
Look in her purse.
- What's that mean?
- She's got $100 to pay for an abortion.
Listen to that. That's crazy.
Money she got from Ralph.
You gonna listen to him?
He got her to tell you that Sam Wood did it.
He made a fool out of you, Purdy.
- Delores?
- Liar!
You stinkin' liar!
(Purdy) Gimme that purse!
You turned my little sister... into a field slut?
(Delores screams) Lloyd! Lloyd!
- Hey, man, stay back!
- He's got a gun!
He's dead.
When I left her house,
I was going to the diner.
Mr Colbert drove by, so I hitched a ride with him. That's all.
I said "I sure would like a job in that new factory once you get started."
And he said "Sure." And I said
"Well, I wonder where it's gonna be."
He said that field we were comin' up to was it, and he would stop and show me.
I said to myself "Man, he's askin' for it."
I said "Now, Ralph, all you gotta do when we get out... is just sneak up behind him and just... tap him."
"And then just claim that somebody jumped us from the bushes."
That's all.
I didn't mean to kill him.
Yeah.
All right, Courtney. That's enough.
All right. C'mon, Ralph.
(Ralph on tape) That's all.
I didn't mean to kill him.
Well, got your ticket?
Here you are.
Thank you.
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.
Virgil?
You take care. You hear?
Yeah.

ENHOH
Hey, Joe, drag your foot, boy.
Look what we got here.
Hey, you wanna drag, huh?
Sure.
Come on, man. Get ready.
I'll show 'em how to drive. Just watch me.
Sir, as high as this river is right now, and with all the mud and sand it's carryin', they may never find that car.
Uh-uh.
Right there.
All right, let's hear your story about how it happened.
- It wasn't our fault, sir.
- Yeah?
We were the first ones on the bridge, and coming a-along following the tracks, and they wanted to get around us,
I guess, and they lost control...
You sure you didn't crowd 'em off?
Three hours.
Yeah? Not sure I wanna find that car now.
With this sand and with that current, we may never find 'em.
About all I guess we can do is keep tryin'.
Look.
Come on. Let's get down there.
Why, it's Mary Henry.
Are you all right?
How'd you get out?
Here, put this on.
We'd better get you back to town.
What about the other girls?
I don't remember.
Is this like the one
I'll be playing in Utah?
It's quite similar.
I supervised the installation myself.
The accident won't delay your going, will it?
No. I'm leaving this morning.
- There's nothing I can do here.
- That's right.
Well, Mary, you'll make a fine organist for that church.
Be very satisfying to you, I think.
It's just a job to me.
Well, that's not quite the attitude for going into church work.
I'm not taking the vows.
I'm only going to play the organ.
Oh, you want more than that.
Of course it doesn't pay much, but, well, at least it's a start.
Are you driving by Benton to see your folks?
No, I can't. I... I must hurry.
I... I've got to leave.
I'm going to drive straight through.
Mary, it takes more than intellect to be a musician.
Put your soul into it a little, okay?
Good luck, Mary.
Stop by and see us the next time you're in.
Thank you, but I'm never coming back.
Can I help you?
- Fill it up.
- All right.
Be anything else, lady?
Could you tell me what that big structure is back a few miles by the lake?
Oh, you mean the old bathhouse.
Yeah, that used to be a pretty ritzy place in the old days.
Then the lake went down and they made a dance hall out of it.
Then they put those buildings up out there and made some sort of a carnival there for a while.
Ah, that's years ago though.
Just stands out there now.
I see.
Uh, I have an address here of a rooming house. Could you direct me?
Oh, sure. Why, that's just right over here a little way.
Been savin' it for you since I got your letter.
Could've rented it yesterday if I'd wanted.
Oh, it... it's fine.
I-It's just about what I expected.
I knew you'd like it.
This ain't no regular roomin' house, you know.
I only got you and Mr. Linden across the hall.
Each room's got its own private bathroom too.
You can take all the baths you want.
I'm not one to fuss about things like that.
Thank you.
I think I'll be quite comfortable.
Well, hope you'll stay a while.
I'm downstairs in the back part of the house, so if there's anything else you need, guess it'll have to wait till morning.
Night.
Good night, Mrs. Thomas.
And this, Miss Henry, is our pride and joy.
This was made in the same town where I've been studying.
Of course.
That's where we heard about you.
You have found a place to stay?
- Yes, I have a room.
- Good.
Well, we hope you're going to like it here.
We're not the largest church in this area, of course, but we have a nice congregation.
We'll have to have some sort of reception.
They'll want to meet you.
- Couldn't we just skip that?
- Skip that?
I don't suppose it's an absolute necessity.
I don't know what some of the ladies will say.
If they say I'm a fine organist, that should be enough, shouldn't it?
Well, yes, of course.
We'll let it go at that for the time being.
But, my dear, you cannot live in isolation from the human race, you know.
- Mind if I try this now?
- I want you to.
You go right ahead.
I'll be next door at the manse, if you need me.
We have an organist capable of stirring the soul.
What do you see?
Oh. Nothing. Nothing at all.
I've practiced all afternoon and it's gotten me in a mood.
You need some fresh air.
I've got to make a call out past the lake.
Would you like to come along for the ride?
- You know that old pavilion out there?
- Mm-hmm.
- Will we pass it?
- Go right by it.
- Stop and look at it if you like.
- I would, with you along.
Good.
This used to be quite a place.
- It's been deserted for a long time now.
- Will you take me in?
Goodness no.
It isn't safe out there anymore.
That's why they put up this barrier.
Be very easy to step around it.
What attraction could there be for you out there?
I'm not sure.
I'm a reasonable person. I don't know.
Maybe I want to satisfy myself that the place is nothing more than it appears to be.
- Would you take me out there?
- No.
The law has placed it off-limits.
Wouldn't be very seemly for a minister to break the law, would it?
No. Maybe I can come back some other time.
Shall we go along now?
Ah, I thought that'd be you.
Good evening.
That organ playin' must take a long time.
You've been gone most the whole day.
I went for a long drive in the country with my new boss, an elderly minister.
Oh, ho.
That must have been a kick in the head.
I learned that from my other boarder, Mr. Linden.
Did you get your supper?
Oh, I forgot.
Well, this ain't no boardinghouse, but I got some coffee and sandwich makings left.
I could bring you some up after a while.
Good. I'll be taking one of those baths you're so generous with.
Take as many as you want.
I ain't one to make a fuss about a thing like that.
Come in, Mrs. Thomas.
Oh, uh, just a minute.
I thought you were Mrs. Thomas!
Yeah, I, uh...
I wondered when you asked me in.
I'm John Linden.
I'm your neighbor across the hall.
- Nice to meet you. Would you excuse...
- Hey, I, uh...
- I was just wondering...
- Just stand right there.
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Mary Henry.
Yeah, I know.
I, uh... I heard you tell Mrs. Thomas you haven't ate anything yet, huh?
I just thought, bein' neighborly and all...
I haven't eaten anything either.
I just thought I'd ask you out to dinner.
That's very thoughtful, but I can't accept.
I know we haven't met or anything yet, but I just thought...
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.
Look, there's a real nice restaurant right down the street, and I thought...
I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like to eat by himself.
I've made arrangements to eat in my room tonight.
Hey, if, uh, you change your mind, just holler.
Looks kind of lonesome in here.
Good night, Mr. Linden.
Miss Henry?
It's Mrs. Thomas.
Hmm.
Who's the man in the hall?
The...
Oh, you must mean Mr. Linden.
He has the room across the hall.
No. I mean the other one.
There is no other.
Me and you and Mr. Linden.
Us three is all there is in this house.
B-But you must have passed him out there.
You're needin' this food.
Goin' without eatin' makes you jumpy sometimes.
Maybe you heard the boards pop or somethin'.
These old houses creak worse than my knees.
I didn't hear him, Mrs. Thomas. I saw him.
Now, don't talk that way.
I don't sleep so good as it is.
It's these old houses. They...
They're big enough so that you could hide a man in every corner.
You just gotta not let your imagination run away with you.
- Are you going out there?
- Well, of course.
There's nobody there.
Now you just go and eat that sandwich I made for you.
Don't drink the coffee if coffee keeps you awake.
It won't.
Coffee never keeps me awake.
Well, good morning.
I heard your alarm. I knew you'd be up.
- Guess what I got.
- I can't imagine.
Oh, just what it takes to start the day off right.
I make it in my room.
It saves me havin' to get dressed up.
I guess I had to get dressed to come over here anyway.
Oh! It looks just like what I need.
Well, then two cups of coffee comin' up.
Say, uh,
I guess you took it wrong last night about me comin' to your door and all.
I'm not a very sociable person ordinarily.
How can I resist an inducement like this?
A what?
Come on. I don't know all those big words.
I'm just an ordinary guy who works in a warehouse, that's all.
I make pretty good money though. Hey.
I got a couple of shots left over from last night. Want a little bit in yours?
No, thanks. It's not the recommended breakfast for a church organist.
Oh, is that what you do?
You mean they pay somebody to play the organ in church?
Some churches do.
Hey, I hope you don't mind about this.
I just didn't know you were a church woman.
To me a church is just a place of business.
- Well, that's a funny way to look at it.
- Why?
People seem shocked because
I took a job in a church, and I regard it simply as a job.
I'm a professional organist and I play for pay, that's all.
Thinkin' like that, don't that give you nightmares?
Strange you should say that.
As a matter of fact... not for that reason, mind you... but I had the strangest feeling last night.
Yeah, I had kind of a lost night myself.
That's funny.
The world is so different in the daylight.
But in the dark, your fantasies get so out of hand.
But in the daylight, everything falls back into place again.
Let's have no more nights.
Or let's make them more interesting, huh?
Say, how'd you get to be a church organist?
I studied it in college.
I could've gone to college.
I used to play pretty good football, but they wanted me to take a lot of classes and things.
- They're that way.
- I'm just as smart as the next guy.
But I just didn't dig what they were teachin' in school.
And the thing I hated most was "principal products."
Principal products?
You know, like, uh,
"The principal products of Brazil are..."
Oh, geez.
Coffee beans, snake oil.
You know, like that.
When I was in school,
I couldn't care less.
The only thing I cared about was girls.
Didn't they offer a course in that?
If they would've done that,
I would've graduated.
What's the matter?
Can you still taste the coffee?
Come on.
What do you think, I'm an alcoholic?
I just like to start the day off in a good mood, that's all.
You must be hilarious by noon.
I'm just the kind of a guy employers want.
You know, the happy worker.
Come on.
Didn't I make your morning happier?
This morning you're exactly what I needed.
You're gonna need me in the evenin' too.
You just don't know it yet.
I'll rinse off these cups.
Ah, no, no.
Just spoils the flavor for tomorrow.
Well, thank you for the coffee.
It was unsanitary, but delicious.
Well, uh, should've put some of the germ killer inside.
Well, I hate to leave so early.
Think you can get through the door?
You got the wrong impression of me.
Well, I meant because you have so many things to carry.
Oh. Like I said, I hate to leave.
It's been a pleasure, Mr. Linden, but I'm sure you have to get to work.
- Don't you?
- Nope.
I have the whole day free for shopping.
Does the hem hang right in back?
We might change the hemline a little.
The drape is just fine.
Otherwise it looks very nice.
I'm sure it isn't very chic to take the second dress, but I like it.
We alter it a little here to make it straight all the way around.
Do you want to go back to your dressing room?
I like it fine. I believe I'll have you deliver the dress, if you don't mind.
I did say I'd take it.
What's the matter with her?
What's the matter with everyone?
Why don't they answer me?
- What is it?
- That man!
I didn't mean any harm.
I just stopped to get a drink.
No. No.
It was that man.
That man!
There was someone else there!
That strange man was there!
Now, look. You've had a fright.
Hysteria won't solve anything.
Now control yourself.
Look, I'm Dr. Samuels.
My office is right across the street there.
You've had a shock.
If you would like my assistance,
I'll be glad to offer it.
Thank you.
- Could I come with you now?
- Certainly.
I'll take her over to my office.
We'll see that she's all right.
My purse.
It was more than just not being able to hear anything, or make contact with anyone.
It was as though... as though for a time I didn't exist.
As though I had no place in the world, no part of the life around me.
And then you saw this... this man?
Yes.
You'll excuse my back, but I wanted to get some of that written down.
I must have been talking for an hour.
Anything else?
Anything you haven't told me?
That's all there is.
That's the whole story.
He's been following me.
That's all there is to it.
It isn't that simple though, is it?
What do you mean?
He couldn't have been in the park this afternoon, or one of us men would've seen him.
And that night in the hallway, you said yourself the landlady came up a minute later, and she didn't see him?
What are you driving at?
It's been less than a week since you were in a car that crashed into the river.
How you got out of that no one seems to know.
But that experience must have been a serious emotional shock.
You think I imagined all of it, don't you?
You think I'm insane?
I didn't say that. I don't mean that.
I'm a competent person.
If anything, I'm a realist.
I'm not given to imagining anything.
Hogwash.
All of us imagine things.
Have you ever heard two men talking behind your back and imagined they were talking about you?
Have you never imagined you saw someone you knew, and walked up to them and found they were a perfect stranger?
- I don't see what this has to do with it.
- The point is this.
Our imaginations play tricks on us.
They often misinterpret what we see and hear. Do you agree?
I suppose so.
If that can happen in ordinary times, go a step further.
Look what can happen in a high fever, or following a serious emotional shock.
It doesn't seem possible that I could have imagined all of it.
Does this man, this figure, resemble anyone you've ever known?
- An acquaintance, or your father?
- No.
- Have a boyfriend here or back home?
- No, no desire for one.
- Never?
- No.
I'm surprised to find myself saying that, but it's true.
I have no desire for the close company of other people.
Have you always felt this way?
I... I don't know.
Don't you want to join in the things that other people do, share the experiences of other people?
I don't seem capable of being very close to people.
I do feel that perhaps I'm trying to reach out for those other things.
Do you feel guilty wanting them?
I don't understand you.
I'm not a psychiatrist, and perhaps
I'm being clumsy at all this, but I am suggesting that perhaps this figure represents a guilt feeling.
Oh, that's ridiculous!
Maybe. Frankly, I don't know.
Well, I know one thing.
If my imagination is playing tricks on me,
I'm going to put a stop to it.
You're a very strong-willed person, aren't you?
I survive, if that's what you mean.
That old pavilion out by the lake.
Somehow you associate it with all this, don't you?
I could go out there.
I could put an end to that too.
- I could go out there...
- Now don't be hasty.
If it is all in my imagination,
I could put a stop to it.
Maybe. But at least someone should be with you. I can't possibly...
As you say, Doctor,
I'm a person of strong will.
And the time to go out there is now.
And if I have to, I can go alone.
Say, uh,
I don't wanna get turned down again.
I was thinkin' of askin' you out to dinner.
I stopped for a bite to eat on the way.
Anyway, I have to practice at the church this evening.
Look, uh, how's about if
I pick you up afterward?
We'll go someplace and dance or somethin'.
I'm sorry. I'm not much for dancing.
Uh, hey, uh, you mind if I ask you a question?
I won't know until I hear it.
What, are you afraid of men?
No, I'm not afraid of men.
Well, you seem sort of cold.
This morning when I brought you the coffee, you were friendly.
This morning I needed company.
Well, maybe you'll need company tonight.
It's better than walkin' home alone.
Yes, it is.
I should be finished around 9:00.
- Will that be all right?
- That's okay by me.
Say, uh, I'll see you in church, huh?
Profane! Sacrilege!
What are you playing in this church?
Have you no respect?
Do you feel no reverence?
Then I feel sorry for you and your lack of soul.
This organ, the music of this church, these things have meaning and significance to us.
I assumed they did to you.
But without this awareness,
I'm afraid you cannot be our organist.
In conscience, I must ask you to resign.
That does not mean that I am abandoning you, nor should you turn your back on the church.
There is help here, and I urge you to accept it.
Well, hi there. I've been waitin' an awful long time for you.
My car's over there.
I know the right place to go.
What's the matter? Don't you drink either?
- Not really.
- Not really.
How else is there if you don't drink really? Answer me that, hmm?
Now me, I not only drink really,
I really drink.
What's the matter?
Don't you like the music either?
- I like it fine.
- You don't like it.
You don't like to dance, and you don't like to drink.
You don't like for a man to hold you close. That's it, isn't it?
- I didn't say that.
- You haven't said anything all evening.
Why don't I go play that song again, you like it so much.
Hey, Johnny, who's the doll?
Nobody you know, Chip.
Oh, come on now.
You been holdin' out on me.
That's not the kind of pig you usually drag around.
You quit lickin' your chops.
She's outta your class.
You wanna bet?
Lay off, huh?
- I got somethin' on the stove there, man.
- I'll help you put it over.
I don't want her to think
I even know creeps like you.
Good luck.
Meet someone you know?
Yeah.
He's a... college fella.
He told me about this girl that's been wantin' to meet me.
- Wanted me to meet her.
- What'd you tell him?
I said, how could I?
You're my date, you know.
Said you, uh, didn't seem to enjoy my company much.
Oh, that's not true.
I really appreciate you taking me out this evening.
I'd had a miserable night if you hadn't.
Ah. Forget it. Come on, here.
Join the party. Drink up.
I paid good money for that stuff.
It ain't poison.
I'm sorry if I annoy you.
You know, I don't get you.
First you stand me off.
Well, that's okay. That's class.
Figure you got somethin', you're just holdin' back.
Now everything I say is okay.
You're a mouse.
Yesterday I didn't care.
Tonight I wanna be with you.
With me, or just with anybody?
With you.
Why don't you thaw out, hmm?
- You wanna be alone. I'll leave you alone.
- No, I don't. No, I...
I like being with you, really I do.
I don't want to be alone tonight.
I want to be near you.
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.
Why don't you and me get outta here, huh?
You know, my room's only a couple of feet from yours.
Ain't likely to get very far from me, are ya?
- Oh, geez.
- Shh!
- You'll wake Mrs. Thomas.
- Ah, that old girl lives in the back.
She won't hear nothin'.
Honey...
You don't wanna go in there all by yourself, do you?
It's dark, and it's lonely in there.
You don't have to be alone tonight.
Just let me come in a while.
Let me stay with you, huh?
Look, you don't wanna be alone, do ya?
No.
- I'm sorry, I...
- Look, look, honey.
Honey, you asked me in.
You must like me a little, huh?
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What's goin' on around here?
What's the matter with you?
That man's after me.
You gotta stop him! He's after me again.
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- You don't have to go!
Not me, sister. That's just what I need, gettin' mixed up with some girl that's off her rocker!
I don't wanna be left alone!
What'd you find out, Doctor?
Not very much, I'm afraid.
I am sure glad you just happened around.
I was gonna call somebody, but I was afraid I'd have to pay the bill.
I came on purpose.
I've been thinking about her ever since she left my office yesterday.
What's she been up to?
Only the devil knows that.
I heard her movin' things all around that room all night.
Never heard such goings-on.
And she wouldn't let me in her room this morning.
- She's a strange one.
- Mmm.
She absolutely refuses my help.
I can't say that I blame her.
There's something about her that completely baffles me.
I've urged her to call upon me if she feels she needs help, and I hope she will.
I can't let her stay in this house.
You won't have to worry about that.
She's determined to leave the city, and she wants to get away as soon as possible.
I hope she does leave.
I hope she can.
Decided to leave, did ya?
Where ya goin'?
I can't refund none of your week's rent when you go off like that.
Sounds like your transmission.
Can you pull it up on the rack?
Okay, fine.
- Will it take long?
- Well, I have to check it first.
Would you like to get out?
- May I just sit here?
- Sure. Suit yourself.
When is the next eastbound bus?
When does the next bus leave?
I must get on it!
I want to get out of here.
I want to get away from here.
Eastbound bus, now loading, gate nine.
Don't close it! Wait! Wait, wait!
Let me in. You've gotta let me in.
I gotta get on that train.
I gotta get away from here.
Please! Please!
You hear me. You can hear me.
Why can't I hear anything?
Will you help me? I need your help.
J-Just a moment, please.
Why can't anybody hear me?
I... I came to you, Doctor, because you're my... my last hope.
I-I-If you don't help me,
I... I have to go back there.
He's... He's trying to take me back somewhere.
Doctor, you've got to tell me what to do.
Her car's still over there, and then there are footprints leading up to here.
And then nothing.
Okay!
The Buick's right down there.
Bring it on up.
Excuse me.
Would Mrs. St. Maugham live here?
She would.
I'm sorry.
I came in answer to the advertisement.
There's no need to be sorry.
At least not yet.
Come in, please.
Oh, goodness me.
It's very grand, isn't it?
Built like a fort.
It has to be.
Pardon me, but are there many others?
You're number six.
So many?
Numbers one to five have already left, or rather fled.
Oh, dear. The mistress must be very hard to please.
True. But in fairness, the other ladies didn't really want the job.
Why not?
Because, uh, let us say, this is a nervous age.
Oh.
Sit down, please.
Excuse me.
Good morning.
I should like to see Mrs. St. Maugham.
Do I have the wrong house?
I'm sorry, madam.
Mrs. St. Maugham is interviewing applicants for a position here.
For a moment I thought...
That's why I've come.
For the job as governess?
Is there some objection?
Uh, f-forgive me.
No.
Your name?
The name is Madrigal.
And yours?
Uh, Maitland.
You've done such work before?
Do you usually interview applicants in the doorway?
Uh, I-I'm sorry.
Please come in.
This way, please.
Forgive me for staring at you.
Why did you?
Well, uh, you're not the usual thing in governesses, are you?
Are you the usual thing in servants?
I'll tell Mrs. St. Maugham you're here.
Please sit... down.
They say five have left already.
Really?
There must be something terribly frightening in this house.
That sounds like a perfect description of me.
Good morning, ladies.
I presume you're both here for the interview?
Good morning.
Are you the young lady who requires a companion?
I never shake hands.
It's so animal.
Please be seated.
Now, what are your qualifications?
Twenty years' experience.
What kind of whiskey do you like?
Oh! Well, if I had my choice, I'd...
I'd take nothing.
Nothing less than a double, eh?
But I suppose you'd have endless patience with me.
I'm so fond of young people.
I set fire to things.
I intend to burn the house down one day.
Perhaps today.
Could you prevent me?
Well, I...
Maitland could, but he won't.
He's a pyromaniac himself.
Did seven years for barratry.
Barratry?
Arson at sea.
Oh, dear.
I'm not permitted alone, except in the garden or on the beach.
Grandmother's rules.
Such lovely weather for the beach.
If you don't mind sharks.
I told a former governess of mine there were sharks.
She said I made them up.
One day she was eaten by one.
Ugh.
Poor shark.
I see.
You live with your grandmother.
She must love you.
She calls me her little immortality.
She expects me to tell the world about her when she's gone.
I just might do it.
Have you no mother of your own?
Only legally.
She married again for love.
It's given me an adolescent repugnance to her.
My case is Freudian.
What are your qualifications?
I prefer to wait for Mrs. St. Maugham.
Where do you live?
In my room.
How do you take to me?
You're not what I'm used to.
I'm fond of painting.
Can you paint?
What I can't do is wait much longer.
Oh, she'll come.
Grandmother will come.
She's in the garden.
She's a great gardener, but nothing grows for her.
Mrs. St. Maugham will ring when she's ready for the interviews.
I've laid the fire, Miss Laurel.
Do you wish to light it?
See?
Did you use plenty of paraffin?
Half a gallon.
'Tisn't enough.
It's all that's left.
Oh, well.
It'll have to do for a start.
But later, Maitland.
I'm busy now.
Your grandmother would prefer you to be busy elsewhere.
She's probably right.
No point in terrifying the applicants.
But don't be discouraged, ladies.
You'll find things can warm up here quite suddenly.
Uh, during the interview, ought we to be together?
One of you ladies may wait in the living room if you prefer.
Oh, let it be me.
I have nothing to do but wait. Really.
I'll gladly wait in here.
When you're ready, just call.
She's a little light-fingered.
What, that one?
No more than a box of matches or a magazine.
Do you know her?
No.
But I've met those hands before many times.
Oh.
She won't be back.
What are you doing?
Locking the door.
You're not going to escape so easily.
If you get away, I shall end up by being governess as well as everything else.
With no time for barratry?
Oh, that's my recreation.
We prefer these not to light.
The child uses them too frequently.
The child's outlandish.
This is an outlandish household.
You may just find it to your liking.
Because I'm outlandish?
Unusual.
Emphasize it.
Mrs. St. Maugham cherishes the unusual.
After all, I'm here.
The lions are calling for a Christian.
Oh. So this is our first applicant?
The seventh, actually, madam, and the last.
The others have taken to the hills.
Oh. Doesn't leave us much choice, does it?
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll have to hurry to have lunch ready.
Hurry, Maitland, is the curse of civilization.
The fact that I hurry, madam, gives certain people the leisure time to make such observations.
Insolent man.
I suppose you're wondering why I tolerate him.
Because he amuses you?
Fortunately, he hasn't much time for that.
He has too many other duties.
He does them insufferably, but he does them.
Will you please sit down?
Now, what questions do two total strangers put to one another?
The name is Madrigal.
And what experience have you?
I have never applied for such a position before.
And why did you apply to me?
Your advertisement tempted me.
I have been somewhat alone.
You will be able, I suppose, to give me references.
References would be difficult.
In fact, impossible.
Really?
Then perhaps you would like to ask me questions, Miss Madrigal.
Does one have a room to oneself?
Life without a room to oneself is a barbarity.
Is this a quiet house?
Absolutely.
That's my daughter's child, Laurel.
She's so fond of screaming.
We met earlier.
Did she say anything?
Nothing of consequence.
Something about a governess being eaten by a shark.
That's only what she would like to see happen to a governess.
Anything to make a drama.
When she wants the center of the stage, you cannot take it from her.
It's rather early for her to be lighting it.
You encourage this?
It would be far worse to discourage it.
She is plagued with a compulsion to burn down the house.
However, we're curing that... with a sly psychological trick.
What is that?
Every day we're making the fire smaller and smaller.
She hasn't noticed.
One day it won't be there.
Do you see?
I see.
You study her as if you're seeing something I don't.
I am.
I see myself at that age, as if I were looking at an old photograph.
I suppose that's your way of saying you're qualified to care for her.
Well, perhaps you are, but her mother wasn't.
Where is her mother?
Unfortunately, she'll be here in a few days to try to take her.
And shouldn't she?
That should be the worst possible fate for the child.
Her mother married a second time.
And the child is alienated... because a love life has broken out again in her mother.
You put it well.
Exactly.
The child was frenzied.
When nothing would stop the wedding, she ran from the hotel into the dark... and by some extraordinary carelessness was attacked in Hyde Park... at the age of 12.
It's upset her nerves.
Now, we spoke of references.
Who will speak for you?
No one will speak for me.
Oh.
Well, in that case, the, uh, interview is over.
I would not wish to waste your time.
Come. I'll walk with you to the gate.
Do you know anything about gardens? I do.
But this year it's been going badly.
Nothing I do for it does any good.
Just look.
Nothing but grass and trees.
The flowers won't grow for me.
I tell you, when a flower dies in my garden it hurts me as if a dear friend had died.
I should think, as one grows older, death would seem more natural.
Natural? The closer one gets, the more unnatural it seems.
In that case, a garden should be a good lesson.
Why?
So much dies in it, and so often, yet it goes on.
Well, it's not a lesson I look for, but a garden.
I've tried everything...
Extract of humus on the seedlings.
Extract of humus is too rich for seedlings.
What?
It leads them on to expect what life won't give them.
The soil needs the early actinic rays.
Exclude the sun again at midday.
Counteract the high lime content in your soil with potash.
Where did you learn about such things?
I was put in charge of a garden once.
I will accept that as reference enough, Miss Madrigal.
You shall have the position of governess to Laurel.
Thank you.
But I warn you.
Laurel is mine.
If she goes back to her mother, you are dismissed immediately.
Well, I suppose you know all about me.
Not yet.
Shall I get the book that explains me?
Some rainy day.
What else are you interested in?
I mean, apart from yourself and my belongings.
What I don't like is to be questioned.
I agree with you there.
And I don't like to be agreed with.
I prefer a good argument.
More stimulating.
And I don't like to be read to unless I suggest it.
And every morning I don't like,
"Good morning!"
What is a good morning to someone else is rarely a good morning to me.
You must have had a good many lady companions.
Legions of them.
And I presume you got rid of them whenever you felt like it.
My record is three in one week.
How did you manage that?
I exposed them.
Oh? In what way?
Everyone has something in their past.
Some... dark and terrible secret.
I find it out and tell it to my grandmother, who has a positive horror of scandal, and you start packing again.
What if I were to expose you first?
Try it.
You'll find I have no secrets.
I'm the only perfectly frank person I've ever known.
Very well.
Be frank about yourself.
Not on your first day.
By tomorrow someone else will have told me.
All right.
I'm not to be trusted.
I steal things.
I cheat at cards.
I make up dreadful lies about people, and then I blackmail them.
Is that all?
That's not much.
Here's the perfect place for your family portraits or pictures of your loved ones, if you have any.
What else do you occupy yourself with?
Murder.
Maitland and I share that interest.
You see, he killed his wife and child.
So bit by bit he and I are collecting the Great True British Crime series.
You're not interested in fiction?
No. Real murder.
I know all there is to know about the criminal mind.
Why do you come here?
I have to do something with my life.
Well, I give you fair warning,
Miss Madrigal.
Exposing you will be the most fun of all.
You're wonderfully odd.
May I see?
It isn't finished yet.
Do you mind if I talk while you draw?
Not if you talk about what I want to hear.
What would that be?
Where you were before you came here.
What you did for a living.
I had private means.
But I'd much rather talk about you.
Do you like living with your grandmother?
Do you love her?
Love her?
I never really thought about it.
You should.
Love is the most important word in any language.
From love comes happiness.
You talk easily about love and happiness, but you never smile.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
You're beautiful when you smile.
You should smile more often.
Is it finished?
Yes.
But it isn't my best work.
I'll show you mine.
You're quite accomplished.
Now yours.
I don't think you'd like my drawing.
Oh, come on, Laurel. I want to see how much instruction you need.
It's wonderful.
Do you really think so?
Far more imaginative than mine.
Thanks for the compliment, but don't expect anything in return for it.
Laurel?
Laurel darling.
Did you think Mother had forgotten you?
You know better than that, don't you?
It's just that Mother's been so busy... trying to keep the house pretty and happy for you.
You know how Mother loves you.
Of course you do.
She loves you more than any little girl in the whole wide world, more than any other person alive.
If anything ever goes wrong, or if you just feel like crying for no reason at all, you know I'll always be here... to put my arms around you, hold you, protect you.
You know all that without being told.
So now Mother's going to read you to sleep... with a beautiful, beautiful story.
It's all about a good little girl who thought nobody loved her.
Can you imagine anything so silly?
Now...
"Once upon a time, hundreds of years ago, when people lived in great stone castles... and dragons roamed the earth... "
How dare you open my door without knocking!
I did knock, Laurel.
You forgot your milk.
And how did this thing get in here?
I told you to get rid of all my old dolls!
Apparently I forgot this one.
It's that new governess.
That Miss Madrigal. She's the one.
She slipped it in here.
Trying to soften me.
Trying to break me down.
But I don't break.
I don't crack.
I'm hard.
Harder than the doll, I'm afraid.
Well, perhaps I can mend it.
Who cares?
Get it out of here.
I never want to see it again.
You think about it.
Perhaps you'll think of some child who really needs it.
Good night, Laurel.
Is there anything I should do?
No.
No, she'll be all right.
Good night.
Good night.
You are aware, Miss Madrigal, that according to
Miss Laurel's timetable... the moment has come when I should discharge you.
Shall I start packing?
Well, I must say, she's given me a very sinister portrait of you.
Sinister?
She says you pace your room at night.
In her words, like a caged animal.
Anything else?
Let me think.
Oh, yes.
Yes, she says all your things are brand-new...
Clothes, shoes, many of them still bearing the original tags.
She says you keep your door open at all times... and you haven't a single picture of a loved one... on your dressing table.
I have no loved one.
Well, according to Laurel... it all adds up.
To what?
That you're running away from something.
That you've just escaped from a lunatic asylum.
That could explain my being here.
How do you explain it?
The new clothes?
Pacing my room?
I don't.
Everything she's told you is the truth.
The truth?
We're making progress.
I congratulate you.
I'm not discharged?
Certainly not.
I don't take instructions from the child.
That seems to work both ways.
Oh, don't be deceived,
Miss Madrigal.
I shall make something out of her yet, in spite of her mother.
And what did you make of her mother?
Do you try to provoke me?
Not at all.
But it would help me to know the child if I understood the mother.
Well, I can be of no assistance to you there.
I don't understand her myself.
I gave Olivia every advantage...
Background and breeding...
And she threw it away for a passing infatuation.
You mean the man she's married to?
Don't speak to me of him.
Confine your attentions here to Laurel.
And the garden.
It's shriveling up before my very eyes.
This is a chalk garden,
Mrs. St. Maugham.
You are trying to grow flowers in chalk.
It's not the soil.
Its the wind from the sea, the salt.
They have been in pure lime.
Not so much as a little leaf mold.
They could have compost or peat moss or soil food, but nothing in the world has been done for them.
Have you time, Mrs. St. Maugham, before death... to throw away season after season?
Of course, of course.
I know time is important, but...
Your flowers need nourishment, something to grow on.
Your soil can't give them what it doesn't have.
Then you give them what they need.
You're in charge of my garden.
Am I?
I wasn't sure.
I'll do my best, Mrs. St. Maugham, to help you with your garden.
And the child.
Their problems are similar.
Good morning, Laurel.
I told you I could tell... whether a morning was good or not for myself.
I wanted you to know how
I felt about the morning.
Won't win any prizes.
I thought you'd be packing by now.
The charges against me have been dropped for the moment.
Insufficient evidence.
Oh?
Well, I'll have to manufacture some then.
I'm quite capable of that, you know.
I'm sure you are.
Oh, what a lovely spot.
Is this where the shark ate the governess?
Somewhere along here.
What date was that?
I'm not a walking almanac.
You have no date because it's pure fiction.
Laurel, people who live on fantasy... usually do so because they're afraid no one cares for them.
Now then, today
I'm going to read.
Can't you remember anything?
I don't like to be read to.
Then you read to me.
Stuffy. I can tell by the cover.
What's it about?
It's about a little girl very much like I was, a girl who has everything... except the one thing she wants.
And what's that?
A friend.
Well, I must go and tell Maitland... he's forgotten to lay the bonfire.
He didn't forget.
I told him not to.
Never again.
You don't know what I'm liable to do.
I know.
You're liable to set fire to the house.
Go ahead.
Well, this is hardly the moment.
You've been telling everyone you're going to burn it down.
Do it!
I don't just do these things to order, you know.
That's another thing.
I never take orders.
And you never burn down houses.
And let me tell you something more about yourself.
You li being told how terrible you are.
You'd like to shock the whole world... for just one reason...
So that someone in it would know you existed... and make you do what you should do.
And what's that?
Stop hating people?
Who do you hate, Laurel, besides yourself?
Everyone.
My mother, most of all.
I too hated my mother.
I should say it was my stepmother.
Oh, that's just an ordinary sort of hatred.
Mine's more special.
Why?
Because my mother's a Jezebel.
She's so overloaded with sex that it sparkles.
She's golden and striped, like something in the jungle.
You sound proud of her.
Oh! How could you be expected to understand?
Here. I'll read your silly old book.
Anything's better than talking to you.
Page one, chapter one.
"Dainty little Daphne, only four years old, smiled with childish glee... as she picked up her hatchet... and nimbly chopped her governess into many small pieces.
Then, bounding up the stairs to her mother's room... "
She'll be here tomorrow, you know.
Who will?
Your mother.
Oh?
I wasn't informed.
Well, I'm not interested.
What she does has nothing to do with me.
I see.
Now suppose you begin again.
The original version this time.
I suppose I'll have to.
You're the boss, aren't you?
Yes.
"It was a lovely summer's morning.
The cathedral bells tolled harmoniously... over the great and fruitful valley.
Ding-dong, ding-dong."
Oh, Maitland, one thing more.
Don't greet Miss Olivia too effusively.
I want her to understand that her comings and goings... do not disturb us in the very least.
Not too effusively.
Yes.
Welcome home, Miss Olivia.
Maitland, how good to see you.
Now tell me. Where's Laurel?
I think she's up in her room.
And your mother is in the drawing room.
Mother.
Olivia, my girl.
Now...
Let me look at you.
Yes, I'm pregnant.
I'd no idea.
A little surprise.
You're so healthy and tanned, in spite of it.
Mother, how's Laurel?
Where is she? Has she changed?
Ask about me, Olivia.
Ask about me.
I do. I would.
All I can seem to say is Laurel, Laurel, Laurel.
Where is she?
Tell me about her.
Does she ask about me?
What does she feel about my coming to see her?
Mother!
At my age I've earned a drink in the afternoon.
That's not what I meant.
You haven't answered me.
Where's Laurel?
You know, you shouldn't wear beige with your skin that color.
So, we take up where we left off.
Laurel is happy here.
Why don't you leave her alone?
Because she's my daughter, not yours.
Did you wear the scarf on purpose to annoy me?
What you wear is a language to me.
Does it never become possible to talk as one grown woman to another?
Not so long as you refuse to grow up.
Please. I don't want to fight old battles.
I just want to see my daughter.
Yes, madam?
Tell Miss Laurel her mother is here.
Very good, madam.
Why do you come here now?
Why try to see her now?
Now? But I always wanted...
But you're going to have another child.
This child's the unknown.
Laurel's my daughter.
That's why I want her now, before I begin to love the baby too much.
So, when it suits your convenience you want her.
You want to take her, who came to me, who ran to me... as an asylum from your indifference.
It was not indifference.
It was a difficult and painful thing to do.
I tried to explain, but you wouldn't let her read my letters.
You never even let her meet the man I love... the man I married.
You deserted her.
You left her in the ruins of a marriage, a marriage I made.
For you, not me.
You left her.
You left your husband.
You drove him to his death.
You lie!
I had nothing to do with it.
Oh, Mother, of a thousand thousand rows between you and me...
And this not,
I know, the last one...
Be on my side.
Oh, for once be on my side.
Help me.
How dare you ask that.
You who've hated and fought me every day of your life, scorned my principles, scoffed at my ideals, ripped decency to shreds.
How dare you even set foot in this house, let alone try to take Laurel back.
I'm sorry.
I've looked for Miss Laurel.
She's not in her room or...
Then get Miss Madrigal to help you!
Find Laurel and bring her here.
Yes, madam.
Well, that's the last of her usual hiding places.
Isn't there anywhere else?
You know as well as I do she won't be found before she wants to be found.
Then she'll be quite impossible to avoid.
You give up easily.
You wouldn't conspire to keep Laurel from her mother, would you?
Miss Madrigal, you and I want the same thing for Laurel.
Her happiness, wherever it takes her.
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry.
Well?
Is she coming?
We can't find her anywhere,
Mrs. St. Maugham.
I see.
Do you think...
This is Laurel's mother.
This is Miss Madrigal,
Laurel's governess.
How do you do?
Do you think something's happened to her?
It's not likely.
She's a resourceful girl.
She'll probably pick her own time to present herself.
She likes to make a good entrance.
Yes. Now you're both dismissed.
No, wait.
I'd like to hear more about Laurel.
Some other time.
They have other duties.
Please, please.
Get on with them.
Laurel has good instincts.
I think in the end they will serve her well.
Miss Madrigal, I did not engage you as a fortune-teller.
She was only being kind.
Yes. She pities you.
Because it's quite obvious to everyone else... that Laurel can't stand the sight of you.
I don't believe that.
I won't.
I don't even believe she knows I'm here.
I think you've hidden her miles away.
No, she's running from you, as you ran from me.
A family trait.
Very well.
I'll go.
But I'll be back.
What for?
To take Laurel out of here and with me.
You can't!
I can and will.
I'll have the necessary legal papers then.
If Laurel's not here when I return,
I'll use the full weight of the law against you.
I'm still her mother.
An unfit mother, and I can prove it.
I give you warning.
Don't fail to have her here when I return.
Hello? Hello? Yes?
This is Litlington 3-9.
Yes, this is Mrs. Drexel
St. Maugham speaking.
Yes, well, I want to speak to Judge McWhirrey.
Oh!
Oh, he's there?
Oh, all right.
I'll hold on.
Puppy?
Is that you?
Yes, I've been trying to get you for ages.
Oh, fine, fine.
Yes, I'm quite indestructible.
Yes, but the truth is,
I'm in the most desperate need of you.
In a legal sense.
No, no.
No, not over the telephone.
Can't you come here?
Spend a day or so with us at Bellfontaine?
Yes, yes, it is quite that important.
Laurel's whole life may depend on it.
Don't be frightened, Laurel.
I've been looking for you.
What for?
I've been worried about you.
Then I saw your fire.
I told you I'd light one whenever I felt like it.
Yes, and Maitland told me you'd be found whenever you felt like it.
I'm hungry.
Has she gone?
Why didn't you have the courtesy to speak to her?
Miss Madrigal, you are a 12-pound-a-week governess, which means you are a failure in life.
So please don't try to run mine.
Now look here!
I can be 10 times as hard as you, with words or anything else.
You will no longer speak to me or any other adult as if we were cattle.
You will recognize that we have had experiences in life beyond yours... and that your mother loves you, or is trying to love you, with all her heart.
My mother never loved anybody in the world but herself.
You don't believe that.
My mother was married to a very important man... my father.
One night she didn't come and kiss me good night.
She didn't have time.
Oh, it's a little thing.
It grows big in your mind.
I sat up in my room and I cried because she did have time.
But not for me or my father, but for somebody she stood with in the shadows of the doorway downstairs, somebody she stood there kissing and hugging and making love to, somebody she got into the car with... and drove off with and lived with... and never came back to see me or my father again.
Come, Laurel.
Tell me how much she loves me,
Miss Madrigal.
Quote me something philosophical.
Do you know what my father did when he realized what she'd done to him?
He put a gun to his head... and killed himself.
I was in the room.
Now, Miss Madrigal, you clever, ingenious, experienced woman, tell me how to love everybody in the world.
Quote me a proverb, a motto.
Give me a piece of sugar... that will make life taste like one big lollipop.
Try!
Laurel!
Laurel!
Oh, go ahead and cry, Laurel.
Cry as long and as hard as you want.
Cry until you can't cry anymore.
No, no, no.
I hate to cry.
Don't.
I hate it.
God made tears to be cried.
Oh, why must everywhere else in the world... be so beautiful... and this place be so ugly?
Oh, if only I could be anywhere but where I am, anybody but who I am.
Oh, come on.
Now then, where and what do you want to be?
Dead... and in hell.
Laurel!
Let me go.
Laurel, you don't mean that.
I meant every word of it!
You do not!
Oh, no.
I don't mean it.
I don't mean it at all!
Don't you come near me.
And don't you get the wrong impression about what I just did.
Laurel...
I'd have put my arms around a post or a rock just then.
Laurel.
I don't trust you any more than I trust my own mother!
Laurel!
Miss Madrigal.
Won't you come in?
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.
I came down for a book.
Oh, that's quite all right.
Come sit down.
It doesn't matter.
Don't let me disturb you.
You're not disturbing me.
On the contrary, I have far too much of my own company these days.
Laurel is not at her best through mahogany.
Is she... Yes.
Oh... Now, may I help?
Something to, uh, keep you awake... or put you to sleep?
Will you tell me something?
About what?
Laurel's father.
Did he really shoot himself in front of her?
He died of a liver ailment, the result of too much liquor.
How to tell the truths from the lies?
Much of what Laurel says is dramatized truth.
The lies are very carefully salted in.
She told me you killed your wife and child.
Truth.
A motorcar accident.
I was driving.
I'm sorry.
And the Hyde Park incident?
Well, the truth of that could be no more than a smile or a wink by some passing man.
You don't believe she was attacked?
Mrs. St. Maugham would never allow a doctor to examine her... or the police to question her.
I know it sounds incredible, a 12-year-old child to make up this fantastic...
An only child is never 12.
You'll like this.
It's a good year.
I usually keep it for myself.
Please.
No, I...
I think you need it.
Odd. I feel as if you've taken me into your own house.
When it's quiet like this
I think of it that way...
My house.
A fine library, great wine cellar, warm, comfortable rooms.
An estate, Miss Madrigal.
What more could any man want?
And how else can I acquire so much?
I have it all to myself eight months out of the year.
It's only in the summer that I open my house to others.
Are your guests always so active?
Well, that depends on the climate.
But now you're here, even that's improving.
Now, don't misunderstand me.
This is my family, whatever their faults.
But you mustn't take on their emotional burdens.
You're not paid enough for that.
I might say the same of you.
No.
No, it's...
It's different with me.
Mrs. St. Maugham needed you.
She took me in because I needed her.
When the war finished, my wife and I bought a small hotel near Brighton.
Mrs. St. Maugham used to come and stay with us.
After the accident, I, uh...
I went to pieces.
She was very kind.
She made a place for me here.
And you've stayed ever since.
Yes.
I've made a new life for myself.
I've been able to continue my interrupted education.
By reading the Great True
British Crime series?
Well, this is an education...
An education on the reason for killing.
It's fascinating.
I'm sure.
When a man kills, it's the one act he does totally alone.
The world isn't with him.
Therefore, his convictions must be tremendous.
I admire people with convictions.
People don't kill reasonably.
They kill unreasonably, passionately.
Thank you for the wine.
Before you go, let me give you a book.
Any book.
For Laurel's benefit...
If she's still about.
Now, what do you fancy?
Arnold Bennett.
Conan Doyle.
Hemingway.
Uh, H.G. Wells.
Perhaps you feel like something a bit more contemporary.
How about this one?
That's Mrs. Maugham's collection of old admirers.
Three members of Parliament.
The usual percentage of undiscovered artists.
A Lord Mayor.
Do you know one of them?
Thank you.
I have a feeling you want to finish this conversation. Good night.
Ah!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning, Grandloo.
Oh, what a glorious morning.
What a marvelous morning for intrigue and for secrets.
Ah, here comes dear, dear Maitland.
I was just saying,
Maitland dear, that some mornings are better for secrets than others.
This one, for instance, has that...
Special feeling.
For making secrets or breaking them?
I haven't decided that yet.
More coffee, Miss Madrigal?
No, thank you.
Oh, Maitland.
You'll make some woman a marvelous husband.
None for me, thank you.
I'll just have brandy.
Straight or with soda,
Miss Laurel?
Laurel, when you take your first drink...
If ever...
It will not be brandy at breakfast.
Oh, Grandloo, I've been drinking heavily for years, ever since that terrible night.
Ask Maitland.
I've drunk all the burgundy... from 1917 to 1941.
Quite impossible, madam.
How do you know?
I drank it myself.
And what else is on the menu this morning, boss?
Mathematics?
Personality development?
Sex education?
Laurel!
Well, I've got to learn sometime or I'll never get the hang of it.
You may get the sketching materials from your room.
After you finish breakfast.
To hear is to obey.
Why should I be the only one to resist your persuasive charm?
"More coffee, Miss Madrigal?"
"Oh, certainly, Miss Madrigal."
"Oh, whatever you say,
Miss Madrigal."
Oh, Maitland, is love blossoming in the servants' quarters?
Simple kindness is so rare in this house... that it's instantly mistaken for passion.
Oh, Mrs. Williams, I didn't see you.
How well you look.
And how's dear Mr. Williams?
Oh, much better, thank you, Miss Laurel.
Much better.
And what sort of kindnesses were you and Miss Madrigal exchanging... in the library last night?
We met quite by accident.
Gentlemen of the jury,
I ask you.
And do you deny that you like her a little, Maitland?
Perhaps even love her a little?
The very fact that you can't answer proves that you do.
In what court of law?
In the court of the human heart.
Oh, and what a shame.
The great 20th-century tragedy.
She's not in your class, Maitland.
Now, that's enough.
But consider the evidence.
That's enough.
How she came to us with nothing.
She writes no letters.
She receives none.
She's never even had a phone call.
Maybe she's out of something...
Something like an alcoholic sanatorium... or a madhouse.
Do you think Grandloo would want a madwoman watching over me?
It would only be simple justice, considering all the governesses you've driven mad.
But we have to know, don't we, you and I?
I hope you're not asking me to spy for you.
To observe.
No.
Maitland!
No.
All right then.
I'll have to do my own spying.
Well, isn't that rather beneath your talents?
After all, she doesn't even lock her door.
It wouldn't matter.
A locked door never kept me out of your room, did it?
There we are, sir.
Safety, security and privacy...
All in one neat package.
Ah, the price, sir, will be nine shillings and 11 pence.
Is there anything else, sir?
No, thank you.
This ought to do the trick.
Right, sir.
And, uh, one penny change, sir.
Good-bye. Good-bye, sir.
Good day, madam.
Good day.
You must have something quite valuable in the house to take such precautions.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
For you.
For me? What for?
Your door.
I'm not in the habit of locking my door.
Even if you were, a skeleton key could still open it.
Laurel has the idea of searching your room.
I advise a good padlock.
I don't care much for locks.
Nevertheless, they're the principal reason... for whatever honesty still exists in our society today.
Well, that completes my purchases.
Now, what about yours?
There's nothing I need.
Oh, there must be something...
Hairpins, nylons, cologne.
Just the fresh air.
That's what I really came along for, not this, certainly.
I'm afraid that's a must.
Laurel's in for a disappointment.
I've nothing hidden in my room.
Or anywhere?
My life has been quite dull.
I don't believe that's possible.
In fact, in your own quiet way, you're the most exciting thing that's happened to the St. Maugham household... since I've been there.
Maitland...
I know what you're thinking.
"Here comes another problem for me to handle."
Well, don't worry.
My admiration knows its place.
It wasn't that.
It's...
Why exciting?
Have I done anything or said anything?
It's what you haven't done and haven't said.
Now you sound like Laurel.
Well, we're both amateur detectives.
With one difference.
To me the unsolved mysteries are far the most exciting.
None for me, thank you.
But it's sherry trifle, your favorite.
I have a new favorite.
You've scarcely touched your food.
Is anything wrong?
Not really.
I'm in the middle of a mystery story.
The suspense is killing me.
May I be excused?
Well, certainly, but I think you should...
I should have it finished in less than an hour.
Then we'll have a smashing game of backgammon.
She's been so nervous and upset all evening.
Do you suppose she's been meeting a boy?
If so, it's more likely he'd be nervous and upset.
I think it's something quite different.
Help me!
Help!
Heavens, child.
Well, what are you both staring at?
- I happen to like climbing trees.
- Come down at once.
Well, don't just stand there like a fool, Maitland.
Come up and do something.
Really!
She's getting out of hand.
Without even a word, she starts hacking off the branch of a 200-year-old tree.
But the branch is dead.
Even dead things have their uses.
That was a very deep thought, dear.
Why don't you get rid of her?
Throw her out. I don't need her.
Well, for some extraordinary reason,
I can't.
You're not afraid of her, are you, Grandloo?
Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.
Your lady friend has the oddest way of doing things.
I thought that was your stock in trade.
She's driving my madness underground.
In her warped imagination that limb probably represents me...
Just because I happened to be out on it last night.
Sawdust to sawdust.
So, you think she suspects you, eh?
Suspects?
She knows.
Then I'd be careful.
At the moment she has a better case against you than you've got against her.
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure, old ex-partner in crime.
I can pretty well guarantee she's very unlikely to want the law called in.
Oh? Well, it's been called in.
What, the police?
Worse. The judge.
Oh, what's he coming for?
Lunch.
Oh.
Maitland, that's marvelous.
Here's our chance to talk criminology and murder.
The judge.
Judge?
What judge?
An old friend of Mrs. St. Maugham.
Oh?
What's his name?
Well, Mrs. St. Maugham refers to him as "Puppy."
She was once his mistress.
Do you know that?
No.
Then why do you say it?
Why do I say anything?
For effect.
But if it's not true and you're believed, where are you?
Where am I?
Floating away.
The only hold we have on this world is the truth.
There's nothing in this world
I care about holding on to.
Tell us more about the judge, Maitland.
He's hearing that murder case in London on Monday. He's going...
Oh, no. That's too good to be true.
I've read about it.
The man who killed his wife in a fit of...
Cover your ears, Miss Madrigal...
Uncontrollable passion.
Think of him now, lying in his cell or pacing it.
Yes. Pacing it like a caged animal, back and forth.
His hot blood turned cold.
His murderer's blood frozen...
No man is a murderer until he's convicted.
But when he first looks the judge in the eye, he must know.
The judge never looks up.
He seems to sleep.
But it's the sleep of cruelty.
Why do you think only of the judge?
It's the jury they work on.
But when you read about such trials, it seems it must be the judge.
Read more and you'll see that it's neither, but fate.
But they work to get at the truth.
The truth doesn't always ring true in a court of law.
- What does ring true?
- The likelihood.
The probability.
They work to make things hang together.
What the prisoner listens to there is not his life.
It's the shape and shadow of his life... with the accidents of truth taken out of it.
How did you get into a courtroom?
It's surprisingly easy.
Now, go and put on some rubber-soled shoes.
For what?
To sneak into a court?
Yes.
Really?
A tennis court.
Oh, aren't you the clever one.
You play tennis too.
About as well as you play detective.
Oh!
Point. Game and set.
Change ends.
Tell me something.
If I can.
That trial you attended...
Was it a trial for murder?
It would have to be to satisfy you.
Who is C.D.W.?
My married sister.
I thought you'd been born unrelated.
And now you have a sister.
Most people have someone.
Suppose you were to drop down dead?
To whom shall we write?
I shall not drop down dead.
Do you have to do that?
Oh, I hate just walking.
Let's play a game.
What kind of a game?
A guessing game.
Do you know one?
Maitland and I play one called The Sky's the Limit.
We ask three questions each.
But for each one you don't answer,
I get an extra one.
And what do we guess about?
Each other.
You know, boss, we're both rather mysterious.
Does it have to be the truth?
Oh, you can lie.
But I get better and better at spotting the lies.
Now, give me a moment to think.
Right. I'm ready.
First question:
Are you a maiden lady?
I can't answer that one.
Why?
Because you throw the emphasis so oddly.
Right. You don't answer, so I get an extra question.
Mm-hmm.
Are you living under an assumed name?
No.
Careful, boss.
I've got my lie detector working.
Do you take things at my grandmother's house at face value?
No.
Wonderful.
You're getting the idea.
There's our bus.
Tell me the full name of your married sister, quickly.
Clarissa Dalrymple Westerham.
Is Dalrymple Westerham a double name?
You've had your questions.
Hurry up.
We'll miss it.
Now your questions.
What? The game.
Your questions.
Oh, yes.
Were there any witnesses to your famous
Hyde Park affair?
No.
What was the charge by the police?
The police didn't come into it.
Did someone follow you and try to kiss you?
Kiss me?
He tried to...
It was an open-and-shut case of criminal assault.
How do you know that if there wasn't a charge by the police?
Now you've had too many questions.
Fares, please.
Two. One and threepence, please.
Two to Litlington.
Thank you.
Thank you, madam.
Now for the deductions. Oh, you didn't tell me there was a deduction.
Oh, I forgot.
It's the whole point.
Mine's ready.
What do you deduce?
That you've changed so much.
You must have been something quite different.
When you first came to Grandloo's, you were like a rusty hinge that wanted oiling.
You'd been alone.
You may have been a missionary in darkest Africa.
You could have been almost anything except a maiden lady.
You've had a sex life of fire and brimstone.
Now, about your assumed name,
I'm not so sure.
But you have no married sister.
You take my breath away.
Good at it, aren't I?
Yes, for a mind under a cloud.
Now your deductions.
Well, give me time.
I'm new at this game.
And you've had an unfair advantage.
What's that mean?
It means that I should first have the privilege... of searching your room too.
And that, Puppy, is my problem.
Can Olivia take back the child she deserted...
This pitiful, helpless child...
And make her play daughter to the very man who broke up their home?
Well...
This little, frightened, insecure girl, to whom I've given my full devotion and attention, spared no expense, and for whom I've hired the finest governess that money can buy.
In these cases, it...
Can she be actually torn... from an atmosphere of love and understanding... and made to fulfill a cold, legal obligation... to a mother who considered her an afterthought... and a father who is no father at all?
The general legal view,
I would say, takes into account...
Now, don't make any snap courtroom decisions.
After all, we're dealing with real people here.
To make a snap judgment,
I should have to speak somewhat faster than I do.
Dear Puppy.
I feel better already.
Your views are always so helpful.
Hello, Puppy.
Good heavens. Laurel.
That's right.
Somehow I was still expecting a little girl.
I'm 16 now, but backward.
Olivia's daughter.
Shy Olivia.
How is your mother?
Hush. We don't speak of her here.
My dear girl, she's still living?
In sin, Judge.
In sin.
Ah, so she's found you, Puppy.
The little girl of my little girl.
Now, what do you think of her now?
Well...
Or perhaps I shouldn't ask the judge to compliment you in your presence, dear.
But come along, both of you.
Luncheon's ready.
It's not very grand, I'm afraid.
I don't entertain anymore.
The battle's over.
You see, even the table is laid... with fragments of forgotten ritual.
Faith is handed down that way.
When our era is dead, we shan't know why we have two glasses for one wine.
Ah, Miss Madrigal.
Puppy, I want you to meet my right hand, my green thumb, the mistress of my garden.
Miss Madrigal, this is an old, old friend of mine... Judge McWhirrey.
One "old" would have been enough.
Would you have your youth back?
No.
I'd have it back if I could.
Even life's reverses.
Wouldn't you, Miss Madrigal?
Miss Madrigal, why don't you sit down?
I was saying, do you think grief tastes more sharply than pleasure on the palate?
Miss Madrigal.
I'm sorry.
I don't seem to have the give-and-take of clever conversation.
Well, at least age does give tone to certain things...
Violins, old wine, old friends to drink it with.
Yes, Maitland, we'll have the wine.
None for me, thank you.
Alcohol in the middle of the day is exciting when you're 30, but disastrous at 70.
But it can make you feel 30 again.
What? Oh.
Turn back the clock, Maitland.
The judge will have some.
Judge.
Yes?
You're trying a murder case on Monday, aren't you?
I am.
Well, what...
I'd love to see you on the bench again after all these years.
You should. You should.
Time decorates a judge.
But what Maitland and I want to know...
And Miss Madrigal.
Conversation should include everybody.
But it's Maitland and I who collect the Great Cri series.
The trial... how will it begin?
When I enter court.
How will you enter?
Slowly.
Soberly, with deliberate gravity, robed in scarlet... terrifying.
She broke the glass.
I'm sorry.
My hand knocked it.
Well, never mind.
Now we know why we have two glasses for one wine.
Yes.
Maitland, pour some more wine for Miss Madrigal.
I'm not used to wine.
But it helps one to keep up one's end at table.
Go on, Judge.
With what?
The trial.
Heavens, Laurel.
Talk is a thoroughbred.
One doesn't say "go on" as if it were a donkey.
No, no, let her be.
Well, first I'm driven to church to pray.
To pray?
Against my faults.
I pray against bias and against vanity.
And for charity?
No, that's outside my job,
Miss, uh...
I'm so sorry.
I've forgotten how they call you.
The name is Madrigal.
I ignore the heart,
Miss Madrigal, and satisfy justice.
Every line on this face is written by law, not life.
The trial, Judge.
The trial.
Stop badgering him, Laurel.
No, no, let the trial begin.
At the gate my trumpeters knock three times, then blow for my admittance.
Then?
Then... garbed and toffed with medieval meanings, obscured by ritual, carrying the gloves of justice... and the cap of death, on a hollow knock...
I go in.
And the prisoner...
What about him?
He killed his wife, didn't he?
Oh, please, Judge.
We're mad on murder.
That's not a subject for discussion.
But murder cracks open the lives of people you don't know.
And as a judge, you hear everything.
In principle.
Miss Madrigal says the judge doesn't even listen. She says he sleeps.
I said he seemed to sleep.
With one eye open, like a tiger.
Have you been to a trial then?
Yes, she has.
She told me.
You defeat my purpose.
Let her answer.
Have you heard me on the bench,
Miss Madrigal?
When I spoke to Laurel of judges, it was in a general sense.
But I heard you give a judgment.
I hope it was a good one.
I think, if I remember,
I would not have come to your conclusion.
Miss Madrigal has such answers to life.
But that was a strange one.
Well, a judge doesn't always get to the bottom of things.
No. It would take the pity of God to get to the bottom of things.
Now, that is enough.
Forgive me, but you insisted.
It has removed my inhibitions.
When it's a murderer... and when you have to say whether he'll live or die, how do you feel?
- Do you suffer?
- Nobody suffers.
They all go into a dream together.
- Even the prisoner?
- The prisoner thinks... he is at the judgment seat of justice, the place where all the motives are taken into account.
- And aren't they?
- Absolutely not.
- Now, that will be all.
- Miss Madrigal says... that when everything has gone against the prisoner...
I'm quoted enough.
That after the verdict, when he's asked,
"Have you anything to say before... "
The prisoner is mercifully in a state of shock and says nothing.
Not always.
Some have said remarkable things.
I remember a woman...
Maitland, have you the case of Constance Doris Wakeland?
No, I don't think I've got that one.
Do sit down, Laurel.
We haven't finished our soup yet.
You should read it for what she said... when she stood before me.
Hardly more than a child she was, but old beyond her years.
"What I have been listening to in court," she said,
"is not my life.
It is the shape and shadow of my life... with the accidents of truth taken out of it."
What was she tried for, Judge?
Murder.
She killed her stepsister, brutally, from unreasonable jealousy.
I remember the case.
A pathological imaginer.
A liar.
A girl who lied... and lied and lied.
And when she told the truth, it didn't save her.
Excuse me.
Miss Madrigal. Miss Madrigal!
Where are you going?
Now, really, this is too much.
They didn't hang her, Judge.
That's quite enough, Laurel.
You've gone too far.
Yes.
I didn't mean to.
I really didn't mean to.
Oh! Let me go.
Let me go.
What are you up to?
Maitland, let me go.
I have to see her.
Oh, of course.
This is your moment, isn't it?
You've caught her, trapped her, run her to the ground.
You can't let her escape now.
Oh, Maitland, please.
She's wounded, dangerous.
Go on.
Finish her off.
But I didn't mean it.
I never meant it to go so far.
We were playing a game... a game.
Then all at once it wasn't a game.
Don't you see?
I have to explain.
I have to make her believe that.
How? How can anyone believe a word you say?
When you believe in no one, in nothing.
You're right.
I can't.
I don't know how.
And she'd never listen to me, not now.
But somehow I have to put it right.
I have to.
Help me, Maitland.
Make me a promise.
What?
That we'll never talk about what happened down there...
Not to each other, not to anyone who wasn't there, ever.
All right.
That's a promise.
Leave it to me.
Your door was... open.
Yes.
You see, I was right.
It's no good locking doors.
There's no place...
No safe or private place...
Not for people like me.
There are no people like you, Madrigal.
You're yourself, something quite original.
Even the name is a lie.
Nothing about you is a lie.
Well, you know the truth about me now.
At least the way it's written down.
Constance Doris Wakeland still stands condemned of murder.
That happened before you were born.
This is where
Madrigal came into being.
You're kind and... and generous.
I'm selfish.
I want you to stay here.
Well, I can't.
Don't you see?
There's nothing for me here.
Nothing more I can do.
Any influence I might have had with Laurel, that's finished.
She finished it.
She made good her promise.
She exposed me.
Or set you free...
Free of the fear of being exposed.
Now I'll always be afraid of that.
Now I know there'll be another Laurel, another Judge McWhirrey wherever I go.
But not if you stay here.
Even if I wanted to, do you believe Mrs. St. Maugham would allow it?
A convicted murderess under her roof?
All she's sure of is you behaved strangely at lunch.
Perhaps because of the wine.
She doesn't know.
By now she's been told.
No, she hasn't.
Laurel has just begged me to keep the secret.
But why?
She hates me.
At the table downstairs, she finally lit a fire she couldn't put out.
She got caught up in it.
But now she...
Now it's too late.
You can't put things back as they were out of ashes.
If you spoke to the judge.
I did that once.
It didn't help.
And by now, even if Laurel hasn't, he will have handed down his judgment to Mrs. St. Maugham.
He's a judge.
He knows better than anyone... you can't be tried twice for the same crime.
Talk to him.
Oh, what good will it do?
For Laurel... all the good.
Unless, of course, it's you who hate her now.
Hate her?
I'm afraid for her.
More and more she's the child I was.
And shouldn't the judge know that?
He's come down here to help decide her future.
Your influence now could be stronger than ever.
Do you really believe that?
Yes. I really believe it.
Thank you, Maitland.
No. As I said,
I'm a selfish man.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I could hardly be more disturbed than I have been already.
What do you want?
I know what you must think.
I don't belong here.
I shouldn't be here.
But it is a kind of work so fitted to me.
Do you believe in God?
At times I've thought it was he who sent me here.
Don't look at me as if I were a sad piece of news, a curiosity.
Why don't you answer?
Answers to questions involving God... must be carefully phrased.
One thing I must know.
When did you recognize me?
The moment you saw me or later?
So that's it.
What?
It finally comes to me who you are.
Constance Doris Wakeland.
But surely you...
I thought you knew.
Not until this moment.
Then if I hadn't come in...
Incredible.
I'd never have remembered.
Oh, no.
Fifteen years, and you've greatly changed.
At our last meeting, I died.
It alters the appearance.
So, what will you do now?
I'm an old man, Miss Madrigal, and very learned.
I don't know.
What in heaven's name... made you choose this occupation, with your history?
And in this family?
This family?
With any family.
I remember the girl and the lies she told.
Yes, and you've seen her again today in Laurel, haven't you?
Hardly more than a child.
Yet one day she may be facing you in court.
Why are you telling me this?
In answer to your question,
"Why this family?"
Why stay on?
Because when I came here,
I felt I had met myself again.
The cobwebs and the fantasies.
The same evasions.
I could have left at the first sign of trouble had I wanted to.
That might have been your best solution.
But not hers.
She needed me. Needs me now.
And I won't leave before I finish the job I was sent here to do.
Finish it? How?
By giving it up to you.
You have the influence and the power to return her to her mother.
Please believe me now, if you never did before.
It's where she belongs, what she needs, what I needed and never had.
And if she goes, what becomes of you?
I shall be leaving in any case.
Constance Doris Wakeland, be assured of one thing.
I'll not pass sentence on you a second time.
Thank you for that, but Laurel is the...
Laurel's case must be decided by Laurel.
She can't decide.
She hates her mother.
Unreasonably, but...
You're not the judge here.
Nor do I choose to be.
Whether or not you go, whether or not she stays... must rest with you and Laurel.
So you see, Miss Madrigal, you can't finish your job here by giving it up to me.
Shall you come again, Puppy?
When your trial is over and you can rest?
I shall rest before I come next time, my dear.
Too much happens in this house for an old man.
Oh!
Good-bye, Puppy.
Look after yourself.
No, there's no answer.
You sent for me, Mrs. St. Maugham?
I did.
I've just received word from Miss Olivia that she's on her way here now.
She expects us to have Laurel ready and her things packed.
I can do that in five minutes.
Please, don't anticipate me.
Her things will not be packed, and she will not be taken.
You will kindly listen to what I say and carry out my instructions.
Mrs. St. Maugham, she needs to be taken.
What?
She must go.
Laurel must go back with her mother.
You astonish me with the liberties you take.
I made allowance at luncheon yesterday...
The wine.
But this...
I'm quite clearheaded now.
To take this child of special soil, transplant her...
Mrs. St. Maugham, you have not a green thumb, either with a garden or a child.
This is a house where nothing good can be made of her.
My house?
Your house.
Why, even your garden is demented.
But her mother... you know what she is.
Even Laurel has told you.
She has told me what has been made of her mother, what you have helped her to make in her mind.
Not what she is, not even what you believe.
You couldn't.
Her mother is still your child.
But she's going to have another child.
There won't be room for Laurel.
The heart is a house with a room for every person it loves.
Neither you nor Olivia can understand Laurel as I do.
I have a special knowledge of her.
To me she's like a porcelain on a shelf, marred in some marvelous way for the better.
My knowledge of her...
We'll not compare ourselves.
I called you in here,
Miss Madrigal, because on Miss Olivia's last visit you attempted to interfere.
Now, I will not tolerate that today.
I advise you to remain quietly in the background. Your advice is foreseen.
But before I go,
Laurel must leave.
The flaming impudence.
- You must be mad.
- That has been said of me.
What collusion has been worked behind my back?
To take my money and then turn against me.
And I... lavish, trusting, leaning.
How could you do this to me?
What exactly are you,
Miss Madrigal?
A woman who has lost touch with unessential things, with confusion over two glasses for one wine.
No, by heaven, this time I want the truth.
Who are you?
Where do you come from?
Out of what dark past?
The past is an ugly wound not yet healed.
But if it must be opened up for Laurel's sake, I'll do that.
Don't go too far for me, boss.
The words that passed between you and Judge McWhirrey...
Now, I demand to know.
Have you two met before?
Judge McWhirrey once sentenced me to death.
To death?
But there you are.
Those who go on living must be somewhere.
It was a commuted sentence because of my youth.
It was many years ago.
And where have you been since?
I came to you directly out of prison.
Oh, my God.
My God.
My Laurel entrusted to a criminal...
A felon, a monster.
It's frightening.
You should be frightened.
You see before you the woman Laurel may yet become.
The child who lied and cheated and hated... because she could not believe one simple fact... that she was loved.
I have loved her, thought only of her.
You've thought only of yourself.
You've used Laurel to hurt her mother.
You wanted the truth, and the truth may still save Laurel.
Leave me alone.
Go away.
Leave me alone.
So that you can cry?
I am far from tears.
If I were you, I'd cry.
Cry with relief that her mother still wants her, is still prepared to take her.
But have a care.
Even a mother can't wait forever.
Not in the summer house.
Not in the toolshed or the greenhouses.
I'll try the attics.
I'll go to the beach.
Laurel?
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for my mother.
You see, boss, you finally convinced me.
And what I want is to be with my mother.
You made me want to.
You taught me what love is, boss.
You've grown up, Laurel, and you seem smaller.
Good-bye.
No. We'll never say good-bye.
Never, never, never.
Let's go home, Mother.
Oh, Laurel.
Thank you.
What will you do now?
Continue to explore the astonishment of living.
Is it a crime to want to be remembered?
No.
The pharaohs built the pyramids for that reason.
What do women do... in my case?
It wouldn't hurt to go on gardening.
I've made a muddle of my garden... and my heart.
Will Olivia forgive me?
In time, perhaps.
Would you stay with me?
Would you?
I'll stay as long as I'm wanted.
You know, we could make this place so full of life...
A good life...
That people would come from everywhere to see us.
What do you think?
I must know one thing.
What's that?
Did you do it?
What many learned men at the top of their profession... couldn't find out after a long, long trial, why should you know?
Forty years ago,
I should have said the same thing.
But I warn you, before I die,
I'll find out.
Miss Jane Marple, gentlemen.
My dear, Miss Marple.
How do you do, Bishop?
Now, this is your chair.
Thank you. I am indeed honored.
- Cecil Ffolly-Hardwicke.
- How do you do?
- Sir Geoffrey Bucknose.
- How do you do?
- Lord Rudkin.
- How do you do?
Now, my fellow trustees...
...our annual meeting tonight is at once a sad and a joyous occasion.
Sad because of the recent demise of Rear Admiral Sir Hubert Marple.
Joyous because in his stead we welcome his niece...
...and granddaughter of our founder,
Admiral of the Fleet Sir Bertram Marple.
Hear, hear. Now, Bishop, if I may...
Please, please, if you allow me a moment...
In Sir Bertram's own words:
"The objective of this trust is...
...to put backbone into young jellyfish."
Hence his purchase of that famous, old wooden wall of England...
...the Battledore...
...which has since served as a training ship for young hooligans...
...who might otherwise have gone to the devil.
Bishop, we all know this...
...but I have something of the utmost importance to say.
And so have I.
Madam, on this night your heart must be overflowing...
...with pride at the achievements of your illustrious family.
I can only say... And from the bottom of my heart, welcome.
- Oh, Bishop.
- Amen.
- Now...
- Please, please, please.
Bishop, my fellow trustees...
...I'm deeply moved with the warmth of your welcome.
My heart is indeed filled with pride.
Forgive me.
Smoke does so get in one's eyes.
That's better.
Bishop, fellow trustees,
I am honored to be one of you.
Would you mind taking your finger out of my snuffbox, madam.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
How dreadful of me.
As I was about to say...
...with our steady hands at the helm...
...I am confident that the good ship Battledore...
...will continue to buffet her way through storm and tempest...
...providing a safe haven for those who are in peril on the sea of life.
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen and lady, to the first item on our agenda.
Hang the first item on the agenda.
I insist on speaking.
Look here, whatever it is, why can't you raise it under any other business?
There won't be any other business...
...unless what I have to say is heard now and acted upon.
Well, that's most irregular, but very well.
Ffolly. Ffolly.
I suppose he was exciting himself about something.
Well, yes, Dr. Crump.
He did seem to be a little...
Yes, thought so. Well, there we are.
The spirit was willing, but the heart was not. I warned him.
Must get moving. Must get moving.
I'll deal with the police.
They're just across the road.
Good night. Good night.
Brisk young fellow there, eh?
Poor Ffolly.
I wonder what he was going to say?
He just made a surprise visit to the Battledore.
Got back this very day, as a matter of fact.
I shouldn't wonder if he was gonna create a fuss over the reception he got.
The captain, you know, does not encourage visitors.
What a beautiful way to be taken, unawares.
- Miss Pringle.
- Oh, I say, not her too.
She has merely fainted.
I have some smelling salts in my bag.
Miss Marple, quickly if you please.
Thank you very much.
Curious.
Empty.
Well, that's it, inspector.
I'll give you the death certificate for the coroner in the morning.
Thank you, doctor.
I'm sorry about the old boy.
Oh, no need to be. Long life, money, four wives, quick death.
What more can you want?
Well, I must get moving actually.
I've got a baby waiting.
Good night. Good night.
Brisk sort of chap, isn't he?
Look. Bacon.
Is it absolutely necessary for you to creep about like this?
Miss Marple, it's because I saw you creeping about that I am creeping about.
Yes. But you don't know what occurred up there.
It so happens I do.
What I don't know...
...is why you're climbing out of windows and down fire escapes.
Yes, well, that was because the poor man's snuff has been stolen.
- Snuff?
- Not the snuffbox, mind you...
Though that of course is quite valuable.
- Just the snuff.
Snuff? Stolen?
- Quite. By an intruder.
- Miss Marple, what on earth...?
There must have been someone lurking outside that window.
You mean, a burglar?
What interest could our proceedings have for the common burglar?
In any case what kind of a burglar is it who steals snuff?
I realize you must have had rather a severe shock tonight.
Now you come with me...
...and Sergeant Bacon here will see you home in my car.
A good night's sleep and tomorrow you'll be your old self again.
- Are you implying that I am unhinged?
- No, of course not.
Then what are you implying, pray?
Well, just that you're temporarily not yourself.
Chief inspector, I am always myself.
- Did you get it, Mr. Stringer?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- The chemist did question sulfuric acid...
...but when he knew it was for you...
Yes, yes, thank you.
Now I think we can proceed.
I must confess, Miss Marple, I'm at a loss to know what all this is about.
If the doctor said the poor man died of a heart attack...
- But he did.
- Then what...?
- Oh, patience, Jim. Patience.
- What is that?
A small quantity of Ffolly-Hardwicke's snuff.
But I thought it was all stolen.
Due to a slight contretemps earlier in the evening, I spilled some.
Fortunately our thief overlooked it.
Oh, I see.
Now handkerchief to mouth for my first experiment, Mr. Stringer.
- All clear. Not cyanide.
- Cyanide?
First a little of the solution.
Then we add the catalyst.
A few drops only.
Now we wait a moment.
Not African boxwood.
Gonioma kamassi. The sawdust contains an alkaloid that resembles curare.
Pity. I had hopes of that.
Nil desperandum as my old science mistress used to say.
We try and try again.
Now, if this changes color...
- So that's what it was.
- What?
- Strychnine.
- In his...?
He was done away with through his nose.
Good heavens.
Very original. Very ingenious.
Or perhaps not so.
Oh, propel me please, Jim.
Well, here we are.
The Doom Box by J. Plantaganet Corby.
Here it is. Now listen.
"'And so, me lad,' declared Sefton Harricott:
'Jacob Rushton did indeed suffer a heart attack...
...but it was induced by a noxious substance in his snuff.'"
Oh, Miss Marple, I'm beginning to...
Wait. " 'The murderer,' continued
Harricott, 'made one error.
He failed to remove the incriminating residue from the snuffbox.'"
A mistake our murderer no doubt imagines he has not made.
But why should anyone want to do such a thing?
That, Mr. Stringer, is the question.
Poor Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke had just returned from our ship.
He had something important to say.
He never said it.
I wonder...
Yes, that's where the motive must lie.
Mr. Stringer, there is something going on aboard the Battledore.
Oh, goodness.
There she is.
Magnificent.
A real bit of history.
Pity anything so beautiful should hold the answer to something...
...as sordid as murder.
Here comes the longboat.
Well on time.
Two minutes to two bells in the dogwatch.
Is this wise, Miss Marple?
Shouldn't we at least have tried to convince the chief inspector?
Policemen, Mr. Stringer, particularly our good friend Chief Inspector Craddock...
...are only convinced by proven fact.
Yes, but once you're out there on the water, it'll be so easy.
A marlinespike in the dark, your body rolling in the scuppers...
...a splash carried out on the ebb tide.
My dear Jim, calm yourself.
I'm sorry, but I must insist on pointing out the dangers.
Are you going to help me or are you not?
Well, yes, of course.
Thank you.
- Now, you have your signal lamp?
- Yes, yes.
Be sure to book a room overlooking the estuary.
- I suggest at that hotel.
- Yes.
- You understand?
- Oh, yes.
Remember, keep lookout at 11:00 tonight.
I shall pass on to you any evidence I've uncovered...
...so that if anything untoward does happen before morning...
Oh, Miss Marple.
- You'll be empowered to pursue the matter on your own.
That's all then, I think.
I shall see you in the morning as arranged.
Unless, of course, I find it necessary to contrive a longer stay on board.
But if the captain's all the bishop says he is...
...I don't fancy
I shall be very welcome.
Miss Marple,
I absolutely forbid you to...
Damn the torpedoes.
Full speed ahead, Mr. Stringer.
Thank you, laddie.
Can I help you with your bag, sir?
Oh, no. No, thank you.
- May I?
- Oh, certainly, ma'am.
Push off forward.
Give way together, lads.
Look at it. Will you look at it?
Reefer jacket, brass buttons, tricorn hat.
Who does she think she is?
Neptune's mother?
All right, Connington, pipe.
- Pipe.
- Pipe.
- Pipe.
- Pipe.
De Courcy Rhumstone, ma'am.
- Marple, captain.
- Welcome aboard Battledore.
- Thank you.
- May I introduce you?
By all means.
- Commander Breeze-Connington.
- How do you do?
Organization and Accounts.
- Lieutenant Commander Dimchurch.
- How do you do?
Navigation and Seamanship.
- Lieutenant Compton, ma'am.
- How do you do?
Discipline and Character Building.
- Sub Lieutenant Humbert, madam.
- How do you do?
Physical Training.
And?
We find that's quite enough, ma'am.
- Assistant Matron Shirley Boston, ma'am.
- How do you do?
- Yes, and last but not least.
- Matron 1st Class Fanbraid.
- How do you do? First class?
- Yes, yes, first class.
Well, that went smoothly.
Now, ma'am, may I on behalf of the rest of the crew...
...offer or sincere condolences on the loss of your fellow trustee.
Thank you very much, captain.
I don't wanna waste your time, so here's my program. Just a minute. Humbert!
- Sir.
- Come here.
All right, thank you.
Seventeen thirty to 1830, that's hours.
Naturally.
There's a tour of instructional classes,
15 minutes for a wash and brush up...
...then 1845 to 1945, drinks and cold collation in the wardroom.
Twenty hundred to 2100, sea chanteys by port watch of hands.
Twenty-one thirty-five, I personally see you aboard the last bus to Milchester.
- I really thought that...
- Excuse me. Miller.
- Sir.
- What are you doing with that?
- Carrying it, sir.
- It's mine, captain.
- Yours?
- Yes. My sea bag, you know.
Sea bag? But you're only staying a few hours, aren't you?
Well, I do feel it my duty, captain, as a new trustee...
...to be some little time with you.
I had hoped to spend the night on board.
Spend the night?
Spend the night?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, that's entirely out of the question.
Apart from anything else there's no suitable quarters.
I'm terribly sorry.
Splendid quarters, captain.
So kind of you to give them up.
Not at all.
Not at all.
Yes, this'll do splendidly, I think.
Delightful view.
Delightful view, captain.
Yes, I'm gonna miss it.
Snuff.
Yes, well,
I think that's about all then, madam.
A handsome blade, captain.
- Yes, it is, isn't it?
- Yes.
That was awarded to my great-grandfather...
...after the Battle of Trafalgar.
- Really?
- Yes, it was.
I've never been parted with it in my life.
I see.
Good. Yes, well, I'll see you on the poop in about 10 minutes then.
Yes.
- Captain.
- Yes, madam?
Haven't you forgotten something?
- Forgotten something? I don't think so.
- Surely you want your snuff.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Allow me.
- All right, thank you.
I wonder if you'd mind...
- Thank you.
- All right?
Thanks. No, you can have that on me. In memory of Trafalgar.
- How very kind of you.
- Thank you.
Oh, heavens.
I hope I'm not giving too much trouble.
No, of course not, madam.
After all, it is for only one night.
Isn't it.
What a waste.
What a diabolical waste.
Come on, everyone. Cheer up.
After all, it's only for one night.
The captain and his visitor will be here any moment.
For heaven's sake let's try to create a good impression.
But, sir, Eric and I were going to the Ellington's party.
Bingley Castle. The party of the year.
Never mind, darling, there's always another night.
And tomorrow night I'll be free.
If you want to cause trouble, Compton, now isn't the time.
Darling, please.
I do agree, muscles. I do so agree.
Compton.
Stop this, you two.
Well...
Miss Marple's presence here at least ensures that we shall eat hearty tonight.
- Hey, Dimchurch?
- What?
Oh, yes. Yes.
- Are you all right, old chap?
- Yes, yes, fine.
She doesn't worry you that much, does she?
No, no, it's just a nuisance.
Oh, never mind, old son.
We just have to keep the cupboard doors closed a little longer.
Stop the skeletons rattling and all that.
- Skeletons?
- Skeletons?
Skeletons. How interesting.
Bravo. Bravo.
Encore. Encore.
Why don't you shut up.
- That's all. That's all.
- Thank you, commander.
I found that most stirring.
Most stirring, indeed.
- Really?
- Well, all these young things singing.
The lads of the starboard watch stay better together on the whole...
...but it's their night for shore leave.
Perhaps another program can be arranged.
- As to that, Miss Marple...
- Yes, yes, yes. It can, it can. Next year.
Oh, thank you.
Not at all. I take it you're satisfied with what you've seen?
I must say, captain, everything seems to be shipshape and Bristol fashion.
I'm glad to hear you say it.
Mind you, I expected no less.
It's been a long day. How about a nightcap before you turn in?
- Very good idea.
- Good. Right. Dismiss.
- Dismiss.
- Dismiss.
Dismiss.
Well, we've enjoyed your visit tremendously, madam.
- It's been a great fillip to morale.
- Thank you, captain.
- But there is one thing that disturbs me.
- What's that?
I can't for the life of me think what it was so upset Ffolly-Hardwicke...
...after his visit here.
Upset? What about, Miss Marple?
Well, unfortunately the poor man passed over before he was able to pass on...
...whatever it was that was on his mind.
- We had hubble-bubble that day.
- Hubble-bubble?
You know, mixture of baked beans and leftovers.
So that's what you call it.
Even the boys loathe it.
I suppose he did too.
I'm rather fond of it myself.
Mind you, there's no accounting for taste. Well, we got that cleared up.
- Nice to get these things cleared up.
- Yes.
- Won't you please sit down.
- Thank you.
There. Now may I say on behalf of all of us...
...how sorry we will be to see you leaving in the morning.
Oh, how nice of you to say that, captain.
I had no idea you'd have welcomed my staying on.
The inconvenience, I mean.
Madam, there has been none involved.
It would have been splendid for you to have stayed as long as you wished.
Then say no more, captain.
I stay.
Good.
- Steward.
- Yes, ma'am?
You know.
- Captain.
- Yes, madam?
As a measure of my appreciation and with your permission, of course...
...I should like to give the order.
- What?
- Steward. Splice the main brace.
Thank you.
- Thank you, captain.
- Thank you, sir.
No, not for me.
If you don't mind, ma'am,
I don't really care for the stuff.
I think I'll turn in.
- Oh, well. Captain.
- Yes, madam?
Ladies and gentlemen, the good ship Battledore.
- Battledore.
- Battledore.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll retire.
Good night, everyone.
See you all in the morning.
How the devil did that happen?
I'm afraid you more or less invited her to stay.
- Who's talking to you?
- But you did, captain.
- Did I?
- Yes.
Did I?
I feel it's rather a case of being outmaneuvered, sir.
Outmaneuvered? Me? Outmaneuvered.
Well, you'll notice the champagne was already laid on, sir.
Yes.
Already laid on.
What's her little game then?
Mr. Stringer, what...
Dusty.
Whatever can the dear man mean?
Captain.
Captain, sir.
Officer of the watch, sir.
- There's no need to bash the door down.
- Sorry, sir.
One thing I can't stand is being disturbed when I'm curling my beard.
- What do you want?
- Well, sir, shore leave...
- Keep your voice down.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Shore-leave party just returned minus one.
Minus one? One?
- Who's adrift?
- Dusty Miller, sir.
Dusty.
- No. Not him.
- I'm afraid so, sir.
You mean to tell me, you let that young villain loose with her about?
- I didn't see reason to change the...
- You blithering twit! Blith...
You should've clapped him in irons the moment she came aboard.
- Request permission to round him up.
- Permission granted.
Thank you.
- And, Compton.
- Yes, sir?
You can tell Miller from me that for once in his miserable life...
...he'd better put his heart and soul into morning prayers.
Aye, aye, sir.
Patrol, quick march.
Patrol, halt.
Prisoner's escort, fall in.
Patrol, right turn.
Quick march.
I've been observing you...
...and I've been wondering why a gentleman like yourself...
...that's able to live in a lovely hotel like that, is wanting to sleep in my bed?
I do assure you, I'd no intention of...
Good night.
Prisoner and escort, halt.
Petty officer, carry on.
Quick march.
Prisoner and escort, halt.
Left turn.
Petty officer, fall out.
Operation Snatch. Go.
Mr. Stringer.
Miss Marple, l... I stole their boat.
Calm. Steady yourself.
Now go on.
I did as you said.
I followed the shore patrol.
Those boys, Miss Marple.
They robbed the place like professionals.
Did they indeed.
I strongly suspect that one of the officers is an arch criminal.
A man who corrupts the mind of youth...
...and profits by the corruption.
Yes. Return ashore, Mr. Stringer.
And keep on your guard.
I will, Miss Marple.
Oh, it's you.
What are you doing?
Don't be a fool. No.
Oh, pump up, lad. Pump up.
That's better.
Don't think I'm enjoying this, do you?
- Captain, sir.
- What?
Captain, I'm glad you're an early riser too.
A word with you, please.
Not at the moment, madam.
As you can see,
I'm somewhat déshabillé.
But, captain, this is important.
Now if you don't mind.
- As you like, madam, yes.
- I think I mentioned to you...
...that poor Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke was exceedingly troubled.
Yes, you did indeed.
I believe... I mean, I'm sure
I've stumbled upon the cause.
This lad Miller.
Madam. Please. If you are about to suggest that by some manner or means...
...there's been any dereliction of duty aboard this vessel...
...I will see to it that the culprit hangs from the highest yardarm on the ship.
Just like that.
Yes, just like that.
Hello.
Compton.
I'm not having it. Not in my ship.
I'm not having it.
Nothing but questions, questions, questions.
I haven't asked any yet, sir.
Well, it's about time you started.
Place swarming with police.
It's unsettling the lads, unsettling the staff...
...and it's certainly unsettling me.
- Yes, sir, and I can see that.
Death: Instantaneous.
Time: Round about midnight.
- Cause: Asphyxiation by hanging?
- Wrong.
Run through first then hung up afterwards.
- Run through?
- With a sword.
Seems rather like gilding the lily but there we are.
Extraordinary business, the whole thing.
Like to discuss it with you but not now.
Got a baby due. Give you a full report later. Good morning. Morning. Morning.
Well, he's a bit on the brisk side, isn't he?
Yes. Run through, eh?
You hurt yourself?
Any more of these weapons on board, captain?
Yes, there are.
I got one myself, as a matter of fact.
Well, everybody has.
Part of dress uniform.
Except for the ladies, of course.
Anyone could've used this, couldn't they?
That is hardly gallant, chief inspector.
Sorry, madam.
It might help if I could establish...
...who was the last to see
Compton alive.
The last person to see Lieutenant
Compton... Yes, establish that...
...and you've got whoever did him in, haven't you?
Well, let's begin with you, sir. Well?
- "Well," what?
- When did you last see the deceased?
Well, I can't see it's any of your business but it was six bells in the first watch.
- Which means?
- Eleven o'clock last night, of course.
Thank you, sir.
Any advance on 11?
Well, you heard what he said.
Any advance on 11?
I see.
Any reason why anyone should want to do away with this officer?
No, I can't. He was a most popular fellow, wasn't he?
Probably one of the most popular on board.
Clearly not with everyone, sir.
Perhaps you can help me, sir.
Did Lt. Compton have any enemies you're aware of?
- I don't think so.
- Quarreled with anyone?
- Had there been any bad feelings?
- Well, I...
I couldn't really say.
Can anyone say?
What about you, sir?
I had little to do with him.
I don't know.
And you, Mr. Humbert?
Yes, well. All right, it's...
It's... It's quite true that Compton and I hadn't been getting on very well lately.
- Really, sir?
- It...
Well, I'm sorry, Shirley, but it'll have to come out sooner or later.
It was because Compton was always making up to Shirley.
- That is, Miss Boston.
- Eric.
You see, Shirley and I are more or less...
...engaged.
What?
Do you know what you're saying?
Oh, Humbert, this is serious.
- Yes, I quite agree, sir.
- Yes.
In my ship there is no... Repeat, no hanky-panky between the sexes.
It is a golden rule of the trust and we are bound to uphold it.
By thunder, Humbert, you've got some explaining to do.
Engaged.
To a woman.
- Explain, sir, explain.
- Will you kindly let him, sir?
Sir?
Excuse me.
- What do you want?
- Excuse me, but something important...
- Have you hurt yourself, sir?
- Get on with it, Bacon, please.
Well...
I just heard that the lads up in town...
All right.
You sent a patrol ashore last night, sir?
Well, what on earth's the matter with that?
Well, sir, the lads are at the police station reporting a theft.
They couldn't return to the ship last night because someone stole their dinghy.
A man's been murdered, man, and you're fussing about dinghies?
Sir. I take the point to be that whoever stole the dinghy...
...could also have rowed out here and...
And...
Yes, that's very good.
Well done, Conners.
Why didn't you think of that?
I did. Your dinghy's been recovered adrift in the estuary.
It must've been tied up by an amateur.
We'll return it, when we've tested for fingerprints.
Just a minute. Don't you think
I'm due for some sort of...
..."I'm sorry, captain"?
- I'm sorry, captain.
- Thank you.
Bacon, you get the launch alongside to...
- Bacon.
- Sir?
Are you all right, sir?
I thought I saw...
No, it couldn't be.
Oh, botheration.
"Secretary to the trustees.
Cape of Good Hope
Youth Reclamation Trust, Milchester."
- Bacon.
- I'm sorry, sir. I lost my hat.
- What a time to lose his hat.
- Onto something, sir?
We've got to find whoever stole that dinghy. He's our killer.
Mr. Stringer.
Oh, dear.
Poor Mr. Stringer.
Mr. Stringer.
Mr. Stringer.
Yes, Miss Marple?
No. I'm here.
I'm sorry, Jim.
I had to come to warn you.
Warn me?
- You're a wanted man.
- Wanted?
That dinghy you purloined last night.
- Borrowed, only borrowed.
- I'm afraid the police think...
...that whoever borrowed that boat is a murderer.
- Me? A murderer?
- Look.
I brought you a little brandy.
I thought you might need it.
Roadblock, map reference S14 X02.
- Tommy 3 and Tommy 2 move to Y.
- Beat five extended 200 yards.
- Beat six, await sergeant's instructions.
- I don't care, it's orders.
Yes, sir, I realize our man is probably dangerous.
I'm taking all precautions.
Yes, sir, every man and dog in the force.
If you want to argue, take it up with the chief himself, Inspector Craddock.
What the...?
Sorry, sir.
- Sir?
- Yes?
- A tramp wants to see you urgently.
- I don't want to see a tramp.
Oh, yes, you do, sir.
- What the...?
- The man you're looking for...
...I know where he is.
So all you need to do is lie low and allow the hunt to continue.
That'll keep the chief inspector out of mischief and give me a free hand.
- But surely a combined operation...
- No, don't you see?
So long as the real killer thinks the police are looking for you...
...he'll be lulled into a sense of false security.
Very well, Miss Marple, I'll do it.
Stout fellow.
Well, then I suppose it was the nefarious activities...
...of the wretched Compton and his misguided lads...
...that Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke found out.
Well, let's say it was that.
- So Compton silenced Ffolly-Hardwicke?
- Yes.
Well, then who killed Compton?
- Well...
- His accomplice perhaps.
But did he have an accomplice?
Oh, yes. The person who intruded into
Compton's cabin when I was intruding.
That person obviously knew about the sea chest and its contents.
I see.
I wonder what it was that he or she wanted out of that chest.
Could it have been the loot from a previous robbery?
By Jove, Miss Marple. Yes.
The classic situation. Thieves fall out.
- Yes.
- I see it all.
Compton murdered Ffolly-Hardwicke...
...to procure his silence.
Compton's accomplice murdered him...
...to procure the loot.
Two murderers.
- No.
- No?
No. There's something wrong there.
I feel it in my bones.
I have it.
What was bothering me.
Surely Compton's accomplice would have chosen a more discreet way...
...of disposing of his partner in crime.
Yes. A sharp blow on the head...
...a quick heave over the side, body carried out on the ebb tide.
- Perhaps never to be recovered.
- Precisely.
But to run a man through and then suspend him for all to see...
...and from the mizzen yard, the traditional gibbet...
...for mutineers and traitors.
No, Jim.
This suggests a different kind of mind from that of the common criminal.
The kind of mind that could conceive something so diabolical...
...as to poison a man with his own snuff.
- You don't mean...?
- Yes.
I strongly suspect there is only one murderer.
That he killed both
Ffolly-Hardwicke and Compton...
...from a motive that we don't yet know of. A motive of his own.
By Jove, I believe you're right.
But what could that motive be?
A moment, Mr. Stringer.
I found this envelope in Compton's sea chest. It had been steamed open.
Why should Compton wish to intercept a communication to the trustees?
On the back, these figures.
Some sort of calculation probably by Compton.
But see here the number 33.
You will remember
Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke's preoccupation...
...with just that number, 33.
Mr. Stringer, you must return to Milchester at once.
Go and see the secretary of the trust.
Miss Pringle.
And ask her what kind of communication from the ship...
...would be likely to be contained in an unusual envelope of this sort.
But, Miss Marple, the police.
I thought you said I was to lie low?
Well, use the back stairs. Turn up your collar and pull down your cap.
Goodbye. Good luck.
The chief constable and I have read your statement.
We can't believe it, but we've read it.
Then there seems no further point in my staying.
Just a minute.
I could prefer charges against you...
...for withholding information from the police, conspiracy...
...aiding and abetting a fugitive...
...and I expect a good many more if I put my mind to it.
- Then why don't you?
- If I had my way. Anyhow you're lucky.
The chief constable considers that some good has come out of your meddling.
- Meddling?
- Meddling.
May I ask what line you intend to pursue?
We're already pursing it.
Compton was killed by his accomplice.
I thought you'd think that.
Glib.
Glib?
Thought you'd want to see this in a hurry.
Thank you, Bacon.
Thank you very much.
We now know who that accomplice is.
In addition to last night's...
...there were six robberies in this neighborhood in as many weeks.
Jewelry mostly.
A social event preceded each robbery.
At all these social events...
...the guest list included the name of Sub Lieutenant Humbert.
I see. Are you going to arrest him?
I'll pull Humbert in for questioning, confront him with those safebreakers.
But I feel that's going to be a formality.
I take it that you're going to disregard the possibility...
...that Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke died any other than a natural death?
Come, now, Miss Marple, snuffed out by strychnine in his snuff.
- You have too much imagination.
- Just as well.
Since I seem to need enough for both of us.
The way lies before you, Miss Marple.
May I suggest you take it, collect Mr. Stringer...
...and carry straight on home to Milchester.
The way lies before you, chief inspector.
I suggest you take it.
Lock yourself up for the night...
...and do some good hard thinking.
Of course.
Craddock...
...how much longer are you going to have us sitting here?
We'll wait for the doctor's report, captain, if you don't mind.
Just a... Just a...
Do you know what day it is?
- Wednesday.
- Wednesday.
It's Trafalgar Day.
We've got our annual hornpipe display to do tonight at the Quay Hotel.
There's a lot to do.
- I'm afraid you'll have to cancel it, sir.
- Cancel it?
That'll break a tradition, chief inspector.
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
It's the death of Nelson.
I can't ignore the death of Nelson.
And I can't ignore some rather more recent deaths, captain.
It's all very upsetting.
- Ever got any snakes on board?
- Snakes?
- Yes, snakes.
- What is he talking about?
Yes, I thought as much.
Still, it's most peculiar.
The girl was poisoned through a puncture in her middle finger.
Quick-acting stuff. Curare possibly.
Very popular with the South American Pygmies.
They use the blowpipes.
Straight into the system. Most effective.
They've gone in a jiffy.
Most extraordinary business.
I've never met anything like it in my life.
I'd like to discuss it, but I can't wait.
Where's my bag? You've got my bag.
Thank you.
Yes, I've got a baby due.
Actually it might even be twins.
Could be triplets. Good morning.
That chap really is brisk, I must say.
All life and death with him, isn't it?
Snakes...
...Pygmies...
...blowpipes.
It's her, you know?
Talk about the Ancient Mariner, he had nothing on her.
- Are you all right, captain?
- All right?
No, I am not all right.
- You've gotta get that woman off.
- What woman?
Miss Marple, you fool. Listen, listen.
I wrote out my logbook this morning.
Do you realize that since she came aboard...
...two of my staff have been slaughtered...
...Humbert's been slapped into jail by you idiots...
...and four of my lads have been accused of housebreaking.
Apart from that, the ship's stuffed to the gunwales with this stuff.
What do you call it? Loot. Look at it.
Craddock. My friend, my dear inspector friend.
I don't care how you do it, but get her off.
I mean, trump up some charge if you like.
I'm sure you're very good at that.
Do you see...
...she's a jinx.
She's a Jonah.
She's blowing an ill wind.
Where is the dear man?
He must be back by now.
The captain thinks you've got the evil eye.
He wants me to get rid of you.
I'm sure he does.
Well, can I come in?
If you wish.
And now I suppose you intend to release
Sub Lieutenant Humbert?
I'm not so sure about that.
I admit the girl must have been the accomplice.
She must've been the one who took the loot from Compton's cabin.
But I still think Humbert's mixed up in it somehow.
Oh, he is.
Well, you see, he's one of the Rutherfordshire Humberts.
As such, acceptable socially at all the big houses in the county.
Which would explain, would it not...
...his presence at the functions you spoke of, which preceded each robbery?
I suppose it would.
- I presume he went with the girl?
- Yes.
You know, it may be she made up to him deliberately...
...in order to gain entrée into these houses...
...so as to, as you would put it, case the joints...
...for her real paramour Compton.
I'll think about that.
Meanwhile she was poisoned.
Somehow or other the poison was injected into her finger.
- So I perceived.
- All right, but how?
By mousetrap.
Mousetrap?
Yes.
I think that last night that unfortunate girl...
...was seeking a safe hiding place for the ill-gotten gains.
She found one, reached inside, and snap.
- Snap?
- Yes.
The wheal across the back of her hand: Consistent.
The puncture: A sharp point attached to the snapper.
But wait a minute. A mousetrap primed with a deadly poison?
In heaven's name, why?
Clearly because the hiding place she found was already in use.
- What?
- Hiding something else.
Something of even greater value.
Obviously, as the owner was prepared to guard it...
...with a murderous booby trap.
Miss Marple, all this seems so fantastic.
Not really, chief inspector.
The method is outlined in this book,
The Doom Box.
As is, by the way, the principle of murder by snuff.
Excuse me.
I take it you and your men will be wanting luncheon?
Don't want to put you to any trouble, madam.
Oh, it's no trouble.
There are four meals going begging, now that our lads...
...have been reduced to 29.
Twenty-nine plus four equals 33.
Thirty-three, chief inspector.
I'm convinced that the key to all this lies in the fact...
...that the full ship's company of lads numbers 33.
Miss Marple, you're way above my head.
Mr. Stringer.
Rash.
Foolhardy.
What hit me?
Seems some joker heaved this rock through the cabin window, sir.
- Does it?
- Probably one of these hooligans...
...we read so much about these days.
It's a pity the police...
...can do nothing about them.
- Now, look here.
As soon as you're compos mentis, chief inspector...
...the captain would like to see you on a matter of utmost urgency.
Chief inspector.
Miss Marple.
I must be quick. Listen.
The captain intends to demand that you allow tonight's hornpipe display ashore...
...and I want you to give way to him.
- What?
You must.
Chief inspector, do you know who threw that rock?
If I only did.
My friend, Mr. Stringer.
- Mr. Stringer?
- Yes, and you'll thank him for it.
I found this envelope in Compton's cabin after his death.
Assaulting a police officer, withholding information again.
Now don't be petty, chief inspector.
This type of envelope is used for the ship's quarterly report to the trustees...
...and Mr. Stringer has enclosed the latest example of our perusal.
You will see that the compliment of lads is quoted as 45.
In fact it is only 33.
- You mean, a swindle?
- Yes.
And one which, if it's been going on as long as I think it has...
...has cost the trust a fortune.
May I, sir?
I think it was this swindle that
Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke stumbled upon.
So did Compton who then added to his list of crimes, blackmail.
Blackmail?
He intercepted that report, steamed open the envelope...
...and as you will observe, calculated the amount...
...to which our miscreant was profiting per year.
No doubt he intended to claim a substantial cut for himself...
...but, of course, he got rather more than he bargained for.
Who signed that report?
- The captain, sir.
- Come on.
- No, inspector. Nothing precipitant.
- But, Miss Marple...
No one must be apprehended yet.
They must all be allowed to go ashore tonight.
That's impossible.
Embezzlement is one thing.
Proof of triple murder is another.
Softly, softly catchee monkey, with a mousetrap.
Liberty boats away in two minutes, madam.
What? Oh, my goodness,
I haven't even changed.
- Captain.
- Yes, madam?
- I wonder if you'd let me cry off?
- "Cry off"?
Well, I'll be returning home to Milchester tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? Yes, of course, tomorrow.
- Yes.
And while I'd tremendously enjoy accompanying you tonight...
...I'd like so much more to spend my last night on board.
Yes, well, of course that's entirely up to you.
I'm a landlubber, you see.
And, well, to hear the sea gently slapping...
...the sides of the ship, to be curled up with a good book...
Well, I'd be only too happy as long as it tops off your stay.
This is a rattling good detective yarn, you know.
I borrowed it from the ship's library.
I know only one of you has read it, but I suggest that all of you do.
I've just got up to the most exciting part, when...
Well, I hope I won't be giving too much away if I say...
...the answer...
...is a mousetrap.
A mousetrap?
There. I'll say no more.
Otherwise I'll spoil it for you.
- Captain, the boats are waiting.
- Yes?
Oh, yes, of course. Well, then, may we wish you a very pleasant evening.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
The same to you.
All of you.
Miss Marple, I understand that you spoke up for me.
I'd just like to say thank you.
Good night.
Good evening, Miss Marple.
Are you quite comfortable, chief inspector?
No.
Well, it won't be long now.
Torch.
You.
I didn't go ashore.
No one noticed in the dark.
No one notices me anyway.
What do you want?
This was my last chance.
You leave tomorrow, don't you?
That is my intention, yes.
I've been under a great strain since you came aboard.
I want to talk to you.
I've got a confession to make.
Yes?
I suffer from chronic seasickness.
I am not fit to teach seamanship.
- I have to keep going on pills.
- Oh, I see.
- Do you purloin them from the sickbay?
- How did you know?
It doesn't matter now.
I suppose I'll have to resign.
- No. I don't think so.
- What?
Admiral Lord Nelson had your complaint, you know.
And where would we all have been if he'd resigned?
If it sets your mind at rest, I suggest it's not too late for you to go ashore...
...and join the festivities in honor of your noble predecessor.
Miss Marple...
...I hardly know what to say.
I don't know how to thank you.
Then don't try.
You can show yourself now.
Good evening, commander.
Good evening, Miss Marple.
How long has it taken you to embezzle such a vast sum?
Twenty years.
My fellow trustees must indeed have been lax.
Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke's visit was the first for a decade.
You prepare the quarterly reports, don't you?
Yes, I do.
I must admit I suspected the captain at first since he signed them.
I thought perhaps you might.
Then it dawned on me.
You had two reports, didn't you?
The one accurate, the other false.
A sheet of carbon paper between them, and the captain signed them both.
True.
Apparently you've spent very little of the fruits of your labor. I find that curious.
It's simply that I wish to retire in a style befitting an admiral of the fleet.
I beg your pardon.
My rank, you know.
I understood you were retired as a commander.
You don't understand anything.
You don't understand at all.
- I should like to.
- I was axed from the navy.
Nothing to do with my competency.
"Unsuitable for further promotion,"
I think the phrase was.
I was offered this post afterwards.
- And you took it?
- Yes...
...and I also took as my right the regular promotions...
...that would have been mine had I still been in the service.
And the pay rises that went with them.
I may be wearing the uniform of a commander, but I am in fact...
...an admiral of the fleet.
I think you've heard enough, chief inspector.
You almost convinced me there.
Now I propose to execute you on the spot then scuttle this vessel.
That way they'll think that we both went down with her.
And by the time the truth comes out, if it ever does...
...I shall be enjoying a well-earned retirement a long way from here.
You won't find it as easy as you think.
I warn you, I was ladies' national fencing champion in 1931.
And in 1931, madam, I was fencing champion of the Yangtze Flotilla.
En garde.
Inspector.
Salute, Miss Marple.
And now, I'm afraid, the coup de grâce.
- Mr. Stringer.
- Not this time, Miss Marple.
Touché, Mr. Stringer.
- Well done, well done.
- I was so worried, I couldn't stay away.
My goodness, the chief inspector.
Quick, the hatch.
Allow me. Are you all right?
I was so concerned about you.
Captain, sir.
Sir?
I think they want you.
What?
- Captain.
- Madam...
...please, there's no need for words.
Hilt towards me. Guilty.
- The end of my career.
- Captain.
Your great-grandfather's
Trafalgar sword?
Madam, I'll tell you something.
I never had a great-grandfather.
And I bought this in
Portsmouth Market for 35 and 6.
I think you've misunderstood.
The hilt was towards you.
- Yes, I know.
- Which means you're not guilty.
No. We trustees must take full responsibility...
...for all that happened.
- Not guilty?
- No.
Not...? But I thought when...?
I thought when the hilt was towards you...?
- It's the other way around?
- Yes.
I never could get it right.
Not guilty.
Oh, thank you very much, madam.
Gentlemen, thank you very much indeed.
Excuse me.
Nevertheless, I regret I shall have to tender my resignation.
You see...
Just a minute.
Would you come in, please?
You see, Matron Fanbraid wants to get married.
And so do I.
We've been courting now, underhand, for far too long.
Fourteen years as a matter of fact.
It's about 14, isn't it? Fourteen years.
Now, I fully realize, madam, that it is a golden rule of the trust...
...that there shall be no hanky-panky between the sexes.
- I see.
- So we'll wish you good day.
- Come on, girl.
- Matron.
- Captain.
- Yes?
I think I speak for all my fellow trustees...
...when I say that golden rule is hereby rescinded.
You're a fine sea dog, captain, but it seems to me...
...that the Battledore could well do with a woman's hand at the helm.
Sydney.
Alice.
Push off forward.
Give way together, lads.
You know...
...the moment I clapped eyes on her I said to myself:
"What an old darling."

PARIS BELONGS TO US
Paris belongs to nobody. Peguy
- What do you want?
- Can I help you?
I doubt it
Go away. I can't stand it!
Are you ill?
Are you Pierre's sister?
You know Pierre?
It doesn't matter
Pierre can't do anything; no one can.
He was murdered
I'm sure he was murdered.
It's the only answer
- Who was murdered?
- First, Assunta. Then Juan
All one after the other.
It's the beginning
All his friends will be killed, no one will escape
Not just me, or Pierre, or you... everything's threatened... the world
And nothing can be done
I must talk. You can't stop me,
I want to talk and talk!
Thanks, you're very kind.
Put it there
- You're Pierre's sister?
- Yes. Why?
- Hello, Pierre. Am I late?
- Ida's late, too
- What's new?
- Not much. How are the statistics?
You look tired. How long since
I saw you?
- About a month
- Have you heard from the family?
- They're fine. Drop them a line
- They could write to me
You know how mother loves you
She still lives with father? Write, then; I'm sure you'll do it well
They have their ideas, I have mine
- And I'm the girl with no opinions
- They'll come
Something wrong?
Nothing much. I'm just tired
- You work too hard
- Maybe, but I've lost heart
You'll get over it
Yes, but then there will be more exams. It's endless
Things used to go well,
I don't believe in it now
You don't have to believe; pretending will do
There's something else
- Am I going mad, or is it the world?
- Both, kid
Someone spoke about you
Someone who seemed to know you well.
A girl
My neighbour
Nothing I can tell you
I mean, it wasn't coherent.
I think she's crazy, like me
- Do you know her?
- Maybe. Don't worry about it
Anne, this is Ida, my concubine
Come along with us this evening
A party. You know Bernard, the painter
Philip will be there; he's been staying at Bernard's
- Who is Philip?
- Philip Kaufman
Famous journalist, Pulitzer Prize.
Written a couple of novels
Thrown out of the US.
You're heard of McCarthy?
- Isn't he dead?
- I wasn't invited to the funeral
- Always the sceptic
- Come on, you're losing time
- And time lost...
...is never retrieved
What's going on here?
- I want to leave
- You're crazy, we've only just come
Why not leave?
He doesn't seem to be enjoying it, either
Wolfenstein agrees. I talked to him about Juan's portrait
Can we see it?
- A portrait of Juan?
- Yes
- You have it?
- It's sold
- Why isn't Juan here?
- Minna, don't you know?
They've arrested him?
He's dead
He committed suicide
I never thought he'd do that
- It's that or a firing-squad
- I'd prefer a firing-squad
- He shot himself?
- No, he used a knife
Typically Spanish
Did he suffer much?
No Funeral March?
How did Terry take it?
Philosophically; I phoned her
Is she coming?
Probably, but surely not alone
I know
But Juan had so many ideas, and his art
He was one of us, our musician, a new Garcia Lorca
If Lorca played guitar
- Have you heard his last thing?
- The tape he made at Terry's?
Yes. Music of the apocalypse
Shut up! You're a phony
What do you make of it?
And you, Pierre?
He doesn't think anything, but he acts. Right?
The air of Paris did him in
It goes deeper than that
It was his early life, all those anarchists, those failures
- The guitar is all right
- It's all that's left
- What better could be said?
- That's nonsense
You want to hear why he did it?
Juan was more than he seemed
Shut up
Mysteries. Fiction
- A revolution put down
- Like the Commune?
- When you feel like going home...
- No thanks
Aren't you Romanian? It's incredible
Juan's suicide is your doing... all your bitterness, your despair
How could a good man live surrounded by nihilists like you?
You still won't shake it off, though it's been going on for twenty years
Go on playing your game. You're the guilty ones, with bloodstained hands
That's a bit thick!
What about Mayakovsky? He wasn't
Spanish, but he killed himself
Mayakovsky who?
Mayakovsky, wowsky!
You bloody fools!
I want a word
You drink too much, but that's not what I want to tell you
You must understand our problems; you're not in Greenwich Village now
I'm speaking as a friend, a comrade.
I think a change of air would help
It may be that we're bad for you
- Where will I sleep?
- You needn't go tonight
I'm not throwing you out, a man of your calibre, but try to understand
I can't keep you here for ever.
What will people say?
I'll go and pack my toothbrush
He didn't make a fuss
- He can't get over Terry leaving him
- Among other things
- What did he say?
- Nothing. He's drunk
If you want to live, forget her
- What's the matter?
- A headache. Give them my apologies
Don't judge them hastily
Who are the two who just came in?
Gérard Lenz, a slightly dotty theatre director
And her?
An American, Terry something. She was
Juan's girl; left him just before...
- What's she got to do with Philip?
- No idea; past history, maybe
- Why did Juan kill himself?
- Because he was a jerk
Jean-Marc, how are things?
- So-so. How about your exam?
- Two days to go
- Shall we eat?
- Be my guest
You'll eat better than at the Lycée
- Seen our old classmates?
- They've all vanished
- How's the stage?
- Great. I have auditions all the time
It's slow. I have five or six appointments
You're lucky, you keep busy
No card? No entry, then
- Can I help you?
- I don't see how. Thanks
I'm used to being not wanted
Yes: "They know not what they do"
I know you
Yes, last night
- You know him?
- By sight; a political refugee
You have strange friends
- Now what?
- Let's go, their cooking stinks
It's not a patch on Shakespeare
We'll talk about Shakespeare after my exam, in a couple of days
- I'm not keeping you?
- I have fifteen minutes
- What's your programme?
- I must see this TV bloke
He makes commercials
At five I've an audition with Boileau, but I must see Gérard Lenz first
- Do you know him?
- No, what does he do?
He's formed a company to perform
Shakespeare's Pericles
I have to get out of it
- You've other commitments?
- Not exactly, but I'd like to drop it
Do you like Pericles?
It's very good
Some good scenes, but not all of a piece. It wasn't Shakespeare's work
Anyway, it'll be a flop; Gérard's nice, but he's kidding himself
It's one of those things where you work for art without being paid
- And you've no time to lose
- Exactly
Are you going there now?
I've nothing else to do
You want to come? All right, if you want a few laughs
To sing a song that old was sung, from ashes ancient Gower is come
Assuming man's infirmities to glad your ear and please your eyes
This Antioch, then
Antiochus the Great built up this city for his seat...
...the fairest in all Syria
What do you envisage?
Towers, ramparts, severed heads
- Why?
- To give the audience the illusion
But theatre is not illusion, it's reality
You're not Gower, you're an actor; don't imagine things, use the stage
You are addressing the audience directly
You come forward...
...you take a couple of steps prompt side
Look, I'm not myself, I'm worn out
He's right, we worked all night.
Why can't you all help us sometime?
I don't care, I've no talent
- You know each other?
- By sight
Sorry, but I've too much to do, lots of other things
Well, at least you've told me
I think this project is crazy.
The odds are that we'll have a flop
- Maybe not
- Thanks for the encouragement
Well, I must rush
Would you like to stay?
- Is it all right?
- Of course
- When shall we meet?
- One fine day
- Like today
- Tomorrow or next year
Right, your exam. Be seeing you
Another gone
And we've nowhere to rehearse tomorrow
All right, where were we?
"Enter Marina, with a basket of flowers"
And Marina's not here.
Where is Suzanne?
I'll do Marina
Very funny, but I'd prefer a girl
You're on stage
- Will you cue us?
- I don't know how
You can read? That's all you need to help us
- Won't you help us?
- Yes, but I'll be awful
- On your head be it
- I'll risk it
It's a scene on a beach; you must make us feel that when you speak
Speak against the wind...
...the sound of the sea, the gulls
Thy oath remember. 'Tis but a blow, which shall never be known
I will do't. But yet she is a goodly creature
The fitter then the gods should have her
She comes weeping for her only mistress'death
- Thou art resolved?
- I am resolved
No, I will rob Tellus of her weed, to strow thy green with flowers
Ay me, poor maid, born in a tempest...
Turn towards the wind
Take a step. Let's take it from
Dionyza's exit
- Is this wind westerly that blows?
- Southwest
Don't force your voice;
Marina is about fourteen
When I was born the wind was north
My father, as nurse says...
...did never fear,
But cried "Good seamen!"
To the sailors...
...galling his kingly hands haling ropes; ;
And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea that almost burst the deck
- Where do we rehearse tomorrow?
- Call me at Terry's, without fail
You see, it went very well
I stuttered like a child
You speak very clearly, and that's rare
- You're staying?
- Yes, I'm waiting for Terry
I'll never get my hair right
It suits you. Are you a student?
Literature. I'm not sure if I like it
Here's Terry
What did he want?
He phoned. He just wanted to talk to me about a few ideas he had
- About what?
- You
He's a bit crazy. Won't you see him?
I don't want to. Your friend Philip is paranoid
Meet Terry Yordan
- A new girl?
- Not at all
- How did it go?
- Jean-Marc and Suzanne have quit
Sometimes I wonder if Juan wasn't right
Don't talk about it
I think he was wrong with the knife;
I'd rather slash my wrists
I did it once
It always fails; that's why you chose it
It fails until it succeeds.
It calls for perseverance
Come again, if you can
You've made the rounds.
I don't believe in coincidence
- You're wrong
- No, it figures. I'm right, as usual
If you insist
Another one. I think I'll go now
- I quit. Why walk so fast?
- I always walk fast
- Did you know him?
- Too many questions
How's Pierre? Don't you see him very often?
We talk sometimes. We don't always agree, but that's natural
I want to tell you that the world isn't what it seems
Some people have guessed what I'm going to say, but I know it
It's the whole world that's threatened...
...yet doesn't know it
It's all nothing but appearances; those we think powerful are puppets
The real masters rule in secret
- Who are they?
- They have no names
I speak in riddles, but some things can only be told in riddles
- Did Juan commit suicide?
- Maybe... I believe nothing
Juan knew fearsome things, but he wasn't strong enough to stand it
Perhaps he killed himself... with help
He wasn't the first, or the last.
If you like, I'll tell you who's next
You know Gérard? It doesn't matter
- It's Terry?
- Terry and not Terry
Some secrets few men can bear.
Juan couldn't; I fear Gérard can't
Gérard's threatened. He doesn't know it, but I don't give him two months
All right, it's not true, then
Why don't you do something?
Damocles' friend warned him of the sword, but his reaction made it fall
- Another riddle?
- Yes, but maybe you can do something
Why me?
Maybe
If you wanted to try to save Gérard...
It's up to you to discover how
I can't help, I'd ruin everything.
But don't try, it's too much for you
Don't talk to your brother about me,
I don't think he likes me much
I'd better shut up, anyway; I talk too much, it's all my fault
Terry's, too. All near us are in danger
Why tell me this?
Sorry, I've taken you out of your way
I live in a hotel now.
Do you live hereabouts?
Not really
Sorry, there's no Métro now
Why have you talked to me?
Never seek to know why.
Beware of Terry. Beware of me
Forget all I've said, if you can
If not, forgive me
Pierre, can I come over?
I'll explain when I see you
- What is it?
- Am I intruding?
- I don't know how to put it
- Try. I've an appointment
I'll go, then
No, stay. Take no notice of this mess
My neighbour, the Spanish girl... she's vanished
So she's moved, that's all
Are you getting mystical?
I need your advice
What would you do if you found out that someone was in danger?
It depends. Anyone we know?
Gérard Lenz
Come out; Ida wants to dress
What are you and he up to?
Nothing
Don't you feel that he's in danger?
What danger?
Because of Terry
I've been told about Juan's death
- By whom?
- Someone
What about poor Terry? Our pals have lots of imagination
If anyone's to be suspected in all this, isn't it Gérard?
- Why Gérard?
- Why not?
Ring out the old, ring in the new
What about Terry, then?
You're right. I must be going crazy
Possibly. Come back to earth
- When's your exam?
- Tomorrow
Well, good luck all the same
- Does Philip Kaufman live here?
- I don't know him
May I use the phone?
May I speak to Gérard Lenz?
Do you know when he...
No, he doesn't know my name
Do you know a Philip Kaufman?
Is he in?
He must be. Room 19, fourth floor
Philip, what's happened?
Sorry to inflict my act on you; it's dramatic, but I always survive
A souvenir of Midway.
There ought to be some cure
Why have you come?
I must speak to you
Was what you told me true, or were you having me on?
I can't remember what I said
- Please tell me
- Is it that important?
Whatever it was I said, forget it
Nothing more?
You've no right. You told me I could help to save a man's life
I asked nothing of you. You've no right to leave me at a loss
Right... I was wrong to talk to you as a rational person
You're an over-imaginative child
- And Juan?
- He's dead. Let him be
Everyone talks about him now he's dead
He wasn't anything special, neither is your Gérard
None of us is, we're ordinary
Not worth lifting a finger
You don't mean that; you're frightened about what you say
You think I won't see it through?
I think you're raving
Go home. Forget it, don't tell anyone; above all, don't tell Gérard
Your best way is not to do anything, drop the whole business. Promise?
- Promise what?
- To knock before entering
Have you come to talk about Juan, too?
You're improving
- Don't you agree?
- I know nothing about it
There's no need to know anything
Which do you like best? This one is terrible. Do you like it?
But why are you here? No, never mind
Gérard wants to see you; something about the play
Call him. But hurry, he won't be there all day
Take this as a souvenir
Tell Gérard I'll meet him as usual
- What's this? She seemed upset
- I've done a stupid thing
You talked to her?
Yes. I've tried to deny it all, but she won't have it
Why did you talk?
I wanted to test an idea, but this way is too risky
Only you can help
Leave Gérard. Sooner or later you'll tell him and he won't take it
I can't
I must have Gérard
- Have I put you out?
- Not at all
I didn't want to tell you by phone; I like to see people's eyes when I talk
Suzanne is leaving, she's got some film part
Will you play Marina?
It's the part you read
I'm no actress
It doesn't matter, I'm sure you will be good
I don't know. I must think it over
Think quickly. Call me at Terry's tomorrow
She'll meet you tonight, as usual
What do you think of Pericles?
- Is this a test?
- No, I'd like your opinion
It's rather disconnected, but that doesn't matter
Because it's on another level... is that the right answer?
Full marks
Everyone says I'm crazy, even Terry, but the reason I want to stage it...
...is because it's "unplayable"
It's shreds and patches, yet it hangs together over all
Pericles may traverse kingdoms...
...the heroes are dispersed, yet they can't escape...
...they're all reunited in Act V
I want to show that. Do you think
I'm crazy?
Not at all
Thanks. But we must try to make people understand it
It shows a chaotic but not absurd world...
...rather like our own, flying off in all directions, but with a purpose
Only we don't know what
Am I boring you?
I agree: The world is less absurd than it seems
But what can we do to show it clearly?
I'm counting on the music
You didn't know Juan?
He hadn't time to do the music for it
One night, at Terry's, he made a tape, improvising on guitar
Just what I wanted for Pericles, but I don't know where it is now
You can't find it?
Terry lent it to friends, who passed it on
Now it's vanished without trace
Have you looked for it properly?
You need time to make a real search
Terry says she doesn't know where it is. Terry often lies
I must go. Jean-Marc will be waiting
- Do you see him often?
- Sometimes; he's from my home town
It must seem odd that I talk of Juan, since Terry... well, you know
I was a great friend of Juan.
I still don't know why he did it
Terry won't talk about it, but I'm sure she's always thinking about him
Don't judge her hastily; she's a fine girl
- I bet you despise her
- Not at all
Her mother's French. Divorced. Terry drifts between Paris and New York
It's marked her. She was very affected by Juan's death
I'm very fond of her, but sometimes she frightens me
I don't want to end up like Juan
She's tough and strong, but she doesn't help
I feel at home with you
I was feeling discouraged, empty, ready to jump into the Seine
Now I feel better
- You're exaggerating
- No, I want you to take the part
Call me about it tomorrow
- Am I late?
- A little
- Where's Jean-Marc?
- He couldn't come. How was it?
I'll tell you later
- You see?
- What of it?
How did you know her?
Her brother asked me to help her find a room. I know the landlord
- How was the exam?
- I didn't go; I didn't want to
- What will the family say?
- They're used to it
I've been offered a part in a play
- By whom?
- Gérard. I'm thinking it over
Where shall we go? You decide
Gérard's very nice, but this will lead to nothing
- You have no experience
- I'll work at it
He's grown up, let him paddle his own canoe. One actor more or less...
I'm phoning Gérard to say I accept
Some weeks later
Is this wind westerly that blows?
When I was born the wind was north
Was't so?
My father, as nurse says, did never fear...
It's no use, I can't act without the fan
Make an effort. Here's your wind
My father, as nurse says, did never fear...
This won't do, take it away.
Get rid of it
Never mind the wind, the sea.
If I had my music...
You won't find another like me
I know him; he'll be buying us drinks in an hour
Let's get on with it, don't mind me
When I was born the wind was north
Was't so?
- I must go
- Of course
I'll feed you the lines
You see? She's away
What's all that? It's the wrong speech
What are you thinking of?
Nothing
Why can't you say two words simply, normally?
Throw in some music here
Juan's
When you've found it
But I don't know where it is
- So look
- I don't feel like it
What about Juan's friends?
Run your own errands
Maybe Terry doesn't want to see them
Stick to your lines
Another scene. Ghislaine,
Minna, please
Something wrong? Are you cross with Gérard?
You are, don't deny it
I went through it, too; being indispensable, then treated as a prop
- Have you known him long?
- Since last year
- Was he with Terry then?
- No. Why?
You're too interested in Gérard; that'll get you nowhere
Gérard is in danger, I'm sure of it
- Who says?
- A friend of Juan... and Terry
He knows Juan didn't kill himself.
He knows a secret, perhaps from Terry
- What sort of secret?
- I don't know; something frightful
Juan knew; now he's dead. Gérard doesn't know, but he may learn it
- From Terry?
- I think so
Why don't you tell Gérard?
He wouldn't believe me.
I must have proof
You'll need witnesses. Your friend...
He says I must forget it all
- You're sure he wasn't...
...kidding me?
I can't believe it
- You don't believe me, either?
- I don't know
I only saw Juan a couple of times, but Terry wasn't his only friend
He had many friends. You must find them, question them...
...ask how he spent his last days
It's the only way to find out
It's the Broken Hearts Club
What if I told you you were in danger, because of Terry?
It's jealousy. Hear that, Terry?
Doesn't it make you laugh?
No. I may be a dangerous girl
I aways liked femmes fatales
Perhaps I could look for Juan's tape, if Terry doesn't mind
- It'll keep you occupied
- Don't be bitchy
- How will you go about it?
- Leave it to me
- I'll kiss you if you find it
- That's an incentive
- Do you know where Juan lived?
- I'll find out
What if Anne were right?
- I think you know more than you say
- So?
That's why I like you
I can never open this door
I know you know
You don't know what I know.
Your knee is in the way
Tell me
No. This way I can keep you
He died in this woman's place
Aniouta Barsky? I'm a friend of
Gérard Lenz, he was a friend of Juan
I wonder if you have heard about a tape which Juan made
- No. Where?
- At a friend of Gérard's
- I know nothing about it
- But you knew Juan?
Yes. Why?
Did he never say anything that...
Not that I remember
Did he never speak of Philip Kaufman, or Gérard...
...or Gérard's girl?
Terry?
Who sent you?
No one
Did this Gérard send you?
Not exactly. I'm sorry, but it's important for me to know
- What?
- All you can tell me about Juan
I don't know what you want, but this is the wrong address
I can't tell you anything
I came home one night and found him lying with a knife in his belly
He had rolled there, half cold already. He couldn't talk
- But before that?
- What?
I wasn't here when it happened.
He might not have done it if I was...
...because of the kid
- His son?
- No; two years before him
You're sure it was suicide?
If not, it was a good imitation; he talked about it all the time
- In what way?
- Corruption, end of the world...
He didn't care if I understood.
I was just to be happy to have him
He broke off with me several times, but came back for refuge
He always came back.
At last he stayed
You know Terry? What's she like?
Beautiful, hard... I don't know
I think she drove him mad. Whatever she did to him, it wasn't nice
I couldn't say anything, I never knew how he'd take it
There were always plots, secrets, revolutions
Everything was bribery, corruption, washed up
I didn't dare question him;
I waited for it to end
- Why ask me all this?
- As I said, I'm looking for that tape
- What's that?
- A tape-recording
- Do you know who might have it?
- I don't think so
Someone. Anyone
- Why?
- I must know
Don't say I told you. There's Doctor
Jean-Bernard de Georges, the economist
He said he admired Juan, he kept an eye on him
Juan was flattered; he didn't realize de Georges was interested in Terry
You can find his address.
Don't say who told you about him
- Thank you
- No thanks to me
- I called you
- Yes, come in. I think we've met
My ward
I knew Juan well; a specimen of a vanishing race...
...rabid individualists who want everything to be destroyed
And who destroy themselves first; a sort of biological inevitability
Juan disappointed me. I love music
Once I had great hopes of him, but he was too subjective
He thought he could solve all problems without reflection or calculation
Calculation!
Think what one can do with numbers
The boy was a walking anachronism
Yes, I heard that tape once;
I remember it well
It was rather poor...
...absolute crap
It must be lost; he destroyed almost everything he did
A sort of nihilistic obsession.
I'm sorry I can't help you
- How's Gérard getting along?
- Not too well
I admire the naivety and enthusiasm of youth
Perhaps it will all work out.
Give Mademoiselle Yordan my regards
Terry?
And don't look any farther.
You won't find it
What must he have thought of you?
He's hiding something, he feared me.
I was sure he'd phone when I left
- Phone whom? Why?
- I don't know
You're imagining things.
This childishness...
It's my own business
Mine, too. I've worked for de Georges and I'd like to again
What work?
Chores: Investigations, reports, everything
Why do that?
You think we can live like saints?
No one's perfect, not even Gérard
- Shut up
- Why? I'm a realist
I have no illusions. There are no heroes and no saints
We'll take it from there
- Will it bother you if I stay?
- In theory, no
- And in fact?
- Yes
- Why?
- It's a fact, just that
Too bad. I like you, I'd like to help you
- Where's Francois? Ç
- In a radio quiz
- When will he be back?
- When he can
I never manage a proper rehearsal
Mytilene is full of gallants.
We lost too much money this mart...
...by being too wenchless
We have but poor three, and they can do no more than they can do...
...and they with continual action are even as good as rotten
A little young for a brothel-keeper
It's coming on. Still a bit affected,
Virginie
Shakespeare's all very well, but I prefer operetta
We'll skip the pirates, who aren't here, and take it from Pander's exit
Boult, you cry. ; "He that will give most shall have her first"
Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been
Performance shall follow
Alack that Leonine was so slow!
He should have struck, not spoke
Or that these pirates, not enough barbarous...
Anne, why stand like a post? Poetry is movement, moving forward
I want you to seem to be surging forward. Try again
- Why not?
- Never speak to me of that again
Work on it at home. Take a rest now
Paul and Virginie, go on
- What's wrong with Gérard?
- Worries, as you know
- Nothing else?
- What else could there be?
- He seems to be so distraught
- Rightly so
Philip spoke to me about Juan, about his death
He did wrong. It's not a subject for conversation
You're wasting your time with Terry; she'll never tell you anything
Terry acts mysterious, that's how she keeps Gérard
Anne, come back on stage
- But I must go, you know
- You can't leave without rehearsing
I've got to eat
Why do some stupid job?
- Why not pay us for rehearsals?
- With what?
- Find another trade, if you're broke
- Get out, and don't come back!
- Val, find another chap
- Easier said than done. Keep him
It's fascinating, but I must go
I'm late. Be seeing you
Let me go, I must speak to him
What a farce! What have I done?
Are you paid to drive me mad?
Why are you here, you spy?
What is it?
Nothing. I just wanted to see you
That's all. Why?
You don't look too good
It's nothing much. Just a touch of the blues
- Is it the theatre, or Gérard?
- Both
Neither is worth it
Do you still want the truth?
The truth is that it's not important; plays work, or they don't work
They're pastimes for intellectuals
Open your eyes, look around
Have you noticed the people who live in this hotel?
They're worth more than any little actor
I have no little actor
If you haven't yet, you will
You know why Juan's dead and I hold on? I have reasons to pop off, too
We won't mention Terry. I'm around because I'm not crazy about an idea
There's only one solution:
Don't think
I cling to people I meet: You, anyone
I look at them: They exist
They're still alive and free
If they can see me, too, it means
I'm still here...
...if they think of me as one of them
That's egotistic
Maybe. I don't give a damn
- Do you hate me?
- Right, I do
Believe me, I'm right
Look at people passing by, they live in a real world
Take those in my hotel:
Room 20, Birgitta
Finnish, aged nineteen.
Ambition. ; happiness
Works as a model, hoping for better things
Room 13, Karoly, aged twenty-four, from Budapest
Arrived with fifty words of French, still wants to be a doctor
Room 9, Gustave Baron, sixty-seven.
A tiny pension. One son, killed 1940
Room 11, Minna, from Darmstadt.
Came to France four years ago to...
Hello, Minna
- You know her?
- I'm in Pericles too
- What's that prove?
- Nothing. We're both right
That's what's complicated
Thanks for your advice, but
I'll try to work things out myself
- Wish me luck
- I won't abandon you
- Have you seen Philip?
- Yes
Why always Philip?
He's tough
- What's that mean?
- Like everyone, he can't live alone
- That's profound?
- Alone with his thoughts
More and more profound
And what are your thoughts?
The usual: Comfort, good whisky...
Beautiful girls
Obviously. What more do you want?
I didn't mean that
How about your thoughts?
I was thinking of Philip, for a change
How it felt to be exiled
I feel more and more an exile myself
As if Terry had initiated me into an order of exiles
- Who was it?
- De Georges
- Now what does he want?
- Can't you guess?
Besides, you're all in exile
Doesn't this corruption disgust you?
The time draws nigh
I don't want to stay to the end
One must always take one's bow
I'd rather slip out before the tomatoes
Have you finished? You're not funny
I'm not trying to be funny
You're grotesque
You're spouting literature
- You irritate me
- Point one. What's next?
What shall I tell you?
Not before the children
Later, then
- Be quiet, please
- Why?
You know why
This is becoming fascinating
Don't get so upset.
Can't we even have a joke?
You're looking for Philip?
I don't know where he is
- He'll be back?
- Surely. Can I give him a message?
- No, I must see him
- Wait in my room
Have you known him long?
I don't care, you know;
I'm not jealous
- A few days
- I've known him since he's lived here
- Is that long?
- Just three or four weeks
- And before?
- I don't know
He had some money when he came to
Paris. Then he let himself go
All sorts of reasons
He had many illusions. He thought he'd be welcomed here by free spirits
"Naught worse than the narrow spirit of liberals"
But there was something else
He didn't leave New York alone
- Terry?
- You know her? Oh, well
She broke with him, I don't know why, and that didn't help
Why am I telling you all this?
- Did you know Juan?
- I heard Gérard speak of him
It seems he was very talented
I know he was handsome
I've a photo of him that Philip threw away. Want to see it?
That's his sister
- Juan's?
- I saw her two or three times
A strange girl. A militant
She's disappeared. I don't know where
- Does Philip?
- No. He's worried
Has Philip ever mentioned a tape of Juan's?
No. I don't know anything about music, or politics
They say Juan was plotting.
He was famous for doing nothing
He spent his days at the Royal with friends
They'll be there still; they may help
- Do you know them?
- Only by sight
Shall I come with you?
You won't wait for Philip?
- Feeling better?
- Yes
Good. I'm off now, come and see me tomorrow
A tape? It's possible. All Spaniards play the guitar
I remember something, maybe it was him. Nothing much. I fell asleep
- Where did you hear it?
- At a friend's
What friend?
Tania somebody. A Russian name
The last descendant of Genghis Khan
- Do you remember Tania's name?
- Fedin
- Where does she live?
- Near the Odéon somewhere
Your actor friends might know; she did a bit of acting
- Why pretend not to know me?
- I don't know you
Was this Juan talented? He didn't look it: The Modigliani type
His genius lay in sitting for hours without saying a word
He'd watch passers-by, especially girls
If he didn't like someone, he'd hit him
Once he got two weeks for hitting a man he said was a Fascist spy
You believe that?
It's O.K. By me
You're adorable
That's all I know, and all I want to know
You were in a hurry last night.
Why were you around here?
- Out for a walk
- With that tart? Give me her address
How's your fancy man Gérard?
- I don't know
- Cat got your tongue?
You're hiding something.
Is it Gérard? Terry?
Yes and no. You wouldn't understand
I could try. Why not tell me?
Either I'm crazy, or Gérard is doomed, like Juan
- Why?
- I don't know
Gérard is doing everything Juan did before he died. He can't stop
Because of Terry? Why Terry?
- Have you seen Philip again?
- No. Why?
- Does Gérard see him?
- I don't think so
What's he done that's so bad?
Look at yourself, you're pale
Don't take any notice
- What's the time?
- Three-thirty
- Could you lend me ten?
- Here's five
- Why not go home in the vacation?
- Later. Not now
- What do you want to do? Act?
- Oh, right now...
I know someone who might help Gérard.
It's up to Terry
You heard me. Otherwise, your friend
Gérard has had it
Keep me posted, eh?
Luck's on our side. Meet at my place. Gérard
- What's up?
- A secret
Everyone here?
I have great news
The Théâtre de la Cité has taken the play
There's a gap in their season.
I've signed for thirty performances
Good-bye, Gérard
- What's wrong?
- Don't you understand?
Understand what?
Sorry, but I'd rather not see you again
Is it serious?
No, don't worry, it clears the air
It wouldn't have lasted, it's all for the best
Are you free tomorrow?
You'll have to come to the theatre for an audition
A pure formality. I'll rehearse you
See you at noon tomorrow, the theatre café
I'll be there
Don't worry, Anne, it will all work out
As everyone's kissing...
Will you drink something?
- I can't remember a word
- It no longer matters
What do you mean?
You'll soon know
They took the play on certain conditions: Some cast changes
And my part?
I must use a well-known actress
- Who?
- I don't know
- Are you angry?
- Not at all
You despise me. Forgive me
Forgive me, too. I promised you
Juan's tape, but I can't find it
It doesn't matter; they'll impose a composer on me, too
Are you sure?
Can't we go on with the play as before?
No, it's too risky. This way is more certain
Could it be a trap?
What trap? Do you think I'm wrong?
No, you must be right.
One must make concessions
I do so want to stage this play,
I'd do nearly anything
I'll try to get you a job as an understudy; you'll get paid for it
I must be going now
No, Anne, I can't see you or anyone else. Leave me alone
Philip, I beg you
You're playing with fire. You don't appreciate the consequences
Why this investigation? What's Juan's death to you? Leave the dead alone
What have I done to you? You encourage me, discourage me, drive me crazy
What's the game? What use am I to you?
Don't try too hard to find out.
Calm down
The hotel's being searched
Men in plain clothes, a funny-Iooking lot
Take Anne to your room
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me
- What is all this?
- Philip's been expecting it for days
He told me he hoped for a catastrophe; that alone would prove him right
He asks you to forgive the harm he's done. It was necessary
Necessary for what?
That's all he said; I thought you'd understand
He got away
A low-key reply, note that
Ay me, poor maid, born in a tempest when my mother died!
This world to me is a lasting storm, whirring me from my friends
Is this wind westerly that blows?
Southwest
When I was born the wind was north
I'd like to do something for this wind bit
I saw a peasant do this once
I was on holiday, I can't bear the Côte d'Azur... where was I?
Oh yes, the wind business...
I'd like to wet my finger...
...to test the wind direction
I understand, but I think it will slow the pace of the scene
Not a bit, take my word for it
I know the business:
Acting since I was sixteen
As a puppet?
I'd like to have Monsieur Boileau's opinion
If you feel it inside, then do it
It's an unusual gesture. Do it again
Yes, it's... fine
Very Renaissance. With proper lighting it will go big
It depends on you. Can you place the finger in a spotlight?
We'll try it with a 250
I haven't done the lighting yet
Mademoiselle Vera d'Istria insists that Monsieur Boileau lights her sets
Even when she designs window displays,
Monsieur Boileau lights them
- What if he refuses?
- No matter, I've got him
See Gérard, he'll fit you in.
I'm playing a lady-in-waiting
Wait for me
- What are you doing?
- Boileau wants to hear my Mark Antony
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honourable man
- Did you find that girl?
- Tania? No, I gave up
You mean Tania Fedin?
I ate with her last Sunday.
She's moved
35 rue de Bellechasse
Much quicker, as though you were rising from the sea
But it's not a surprise; remember the pirates' galley in the background
What galley? You know about a galley?
It's news to me
A model manned by dwarfs
Audition all dwarfs in Paris
Failing them, we could use kids with beards
- But why?
- Third dimension, old chap
Mademoiselle d'Istria has a knack for such nuances
Got that, Jacquot?
I don't want to see anyone
I must see you
Who sent you? The lamb or the dragon?
The lamb
Come in, then
Untie me
An exercise. If the body is upright, so is the soul
We must prepare. The hour approaches
We must temper our souls with fire
God will spew forth the tepid
Are you ready? The star Absinthe approaches Earth
The waters are poisoned.
Children drink a deadly milk
Do you read the papers?
A man in London died yesterday, with the stigmata of Hiroshima on his body
The end is very near. Be not afraid, do not tremble
- Who sent you?
- Jean-Val gave me your address
He's a wretch. I owe him money and he keeps pestering me to pay
- But go on
- I want to ask you something
- I haven't any money
- Have you got Juan's tape?
He took it back three days before he died
He probably wanted it for that fool Anouita
Do you know Juan's sister?
I used to. If she had it, it's gone; a little tape is easy to wipe
- Why gone?
- Maria Almereyda was sent to Spain
Sent on a mission, to start a strike, or some such nonsense
Do you know the tale of the warlord?
He had a very dear friend
But all warlords come to distrust their friends
Friends are our mirror image
Sending him back to enemy territory, he had him parachuted over the sea
Then he declared him a martyr
- Juan's sister's friends did likewise
- You think she's in danger?
I think she's been arrested, maybe shot
All those close to Juan must die
The American girl, the actor, myself
I don't know why, but I know.
We die because we are life
All must perish
And you who have reached towards the secret...
...you now bear the fatal mark
- You took your time
- I met Paul
What are you talking about?
About Juan. And how I asked him for the child you won't give me
I haven't decided
- Will you eat with us?
- No, I must go
Afraid?
I know how it is. Courage drains from us, like water from a hand
Nothing can be done. Await a sign
Await his return. Be patient
Ham
- I can't wait. I give up
- Patience is difficult
Yes, child, waiting is difficult
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all. Come in
I quit the production this afternoon
You're not surprised?
- Why have you given up?
- I'd had enough
Once you start making concessions, you can't stop
Boileau's taking over; he said he could do without my ideas
What about the others?
They quit, or were sacked.
But Paul is in luck
Good for him
Couldn't you have fought it longer?
There are limits
But I'm satisfied, I let rip.
I think I scared Boileau
Now they'll make me pay for it, they'll send me back to the wilds
What can they do?
I'm at the end of my tether, but I won't end up like Juan
If I could, I'd blow everything up
That means nothing, I know
Anne, perhaps I seem normal, well, almost normal...
...but I feel I'm lost in
Terre del Fuego
You're the last human face on the horizon
I have this curious dizzyness
Things seem to whirl about me faster and faster
- You need something to hang on to?
- Exactly
- Have you seen Terry?
- No
- Don't play games, I'm serious
- So am I
I've phoned Terry. She's cut herself off, she won't see anyone
She talked in riddles: "I am unworthy of you, you are unworthy of me"
Do you love me?
Goethe said: "If I love you, is that your affair?"
To hell with Goethe. Answer me
I'm fond of you, but I've no time to talk. I must work
I must take another exam in October
Well, good luck. Work hard and marry a notary
Why not?
It's no?
In that case: "I have no alternative...
"...but to cast myself into the sea"
Moliére, Georges Dandin, Act 3,
Scene...
Fifteen
Why not?
Then he left. Perhaps I was wrong.
It was my pride
His, too. I'm no saint
You love him?
I don't know where I am.
Do you think he's in danger?
I won't be a moment
What was I saying? Oh yes, don't worry, it'll work out
Take a few days off, it'll do you good. Things will work out
Stay with us. Come and see some silent films at a friend's
That will cheer you up
Give us a smile
If you don't call before midnight,
I'll kill myself. Gérard
Monsieur Kaufman isn't here.
We haven't seen him for a week
Another jeton, please
Jean-Marc, did I wake you?
I must see you right away
- Is it a joke?
- No, his flat is locked. No answer
Could you smell gas? He's with a girl
- What can I do about it?
- Anything but just stand here
Let's go to Terry's; maybe they've made up
Maybe I should phone first
Have you seen Gérard?
I had a message saying that he might kill himself
Can you come at once? Hurry
Why ask her to come?
- Will you tell her?
- I don't know
I don't want to see her
Hurry up
Show me
- Didn't you call him?
- It was too late
- What can I do?
- You're thrashing about in the dark
Juan's tape?
You see, it wasn't far away
Did Philip know? Why didn't you give it to Gérard?
You don't love Gérard, you deserted him
No. I'm afraid
It built up, like for Juan
- You're sure you're not wrong?
- I wish I were
How I've wished Philip were wrong, how I've refused to believe him
Now that's no longer possible
What is it? What's going on?
It's Philip. He always talked of it
In '45 we thought the death of one man had solved it all
Anne, this is the greatest conspiracy of all, on a worldwide scale
- But what? Who?
- Still the same ones
But in thirty years, methods have changed
They're ready to regain power, on the sly
This time, no mercy: All will be sacrificed to efficiency, the state
They're biding their time
Meanwhile, they've worked hard
You don't care?
But why Gérard?
It affects him, Juan, you, all of us.
Those who don't give in are broken
Either we huddle together like waifs, or swallow something like this
Total oblivion in ten minutes.
Carrying it reassures me
You're making fun of me
Do I look like it? You wanted to know, now hear me out
Rule One of the organization: Secrecy
Rule Two: The least sign of treason and you are condemned
You can't live alone with that secret.
Philip's told me this for months
He learned it by chance in New York
He thought he could escape to Europe
I saw him withdraw into himself, destroy himself
I asked him stupid questions
One day he told me everything; perhaps that saved him
But then we couldn't go on living together sharing this thing
I didn't want to believe; it was too frightful
I tried my best to be rid of it;
I left him
But the secret stayed with me, driving me crazy
I couldn't keep the secret any longer;
I had to tell someone, or die
Now Juan is dead
A coincidence, perhaps; he was mixed up in dangerous things
I tried to think that
Then Gérard. He became strange, restless
His play fell through
Philip hounded me with his prophesies.
And you, with your silly questions
De Georges, always after me
I hoped to save Gérard. I was wrong
I couldn't go on lying to Gérard
I abandoned him
Don't leave him, he needs you
What will you do?
Go back to Gérard's, try to break down the door
Go on. I just can't...
- What did she tell you?
- Nothing
Secrets as always
- Here?
- No, farther
Did you send me this?
Do I look as if I'd write such rubbish?
Are you angry with me? Don't be
- Why not?
- I've told you
You expect me to fall into your arms?
That would be nice
I can't
How goes it? Over the blues now?
Much better. It seems like a bad dream
Your "organization" seemed a bit much
Mixing with geniuses is bad for you
Common sense comes back, sooner or later
Dead? It's not true
I'm coming
Gérard has committed suicide.
I'm going
Don't go. I can't tell you more.
Don't go
Please. You'd never forgive me
- Get hold of yourself, Pierre.
- I wouldn't forgive you, either
Who found him?
Terry called me
It's really suicide?
Perhaps
- He was murdered?
- Perhaps
You're sure it's not suicide?
And Juan wasn't suicide?
I'm not sure of anything
A strange coincidence
But maybe they can push their victims to suicide
The art of seduction, persuasion.
Man has long sought the devil's face
We're beginning to see it
It's all my fault. I acted like an idiot
I provoked it by trying to help
You did nothing of the sort; you're a cog in a vast machine
What do they want?
Power, world domination.
A nice, worldwide concentration camp
In a spy film, nabbing de Georges would suffice. But he's only a link
I think it's a crime syndicate, a dictatorship syndicate
But if they killed Gérard...
Then we're all suspect
Anne. I'm to blame
Pierre, what did you do?
I can't say now, but I swear I did all I could to prevent this
I know why he's dead and who's responsible
Who?
Later. He tried to buy my silence and I refused
He said he'd break me.
He's capable of anything
I stood up to him. Now I'm afraid.
Help me
- Where are you?
- What station?
Dupleix. I don't know where to go.
Come to me
I'm coming
We'll go together
We'll meet at Jean-Val's place.
They're rehearsing a new show
- I can't believe that Pierre...
- I always suspected him
They're a pitiless breed, and deserve no pity
Come quickly, Anne
Take me away from Paris, Terry, before they find me
We could rejoin Philip. There's only two seats. Pierre, you come with me
You must. Anne, take a taxi.
You know where to go?
Jean-Val told me
Got any money? Here's some
- Pierre's with Terry. Where are they?
- They must have got lost
Don't worry
- You knew it already?
- Pierre? It's what I tried to find out
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I should have
You used me. You gambled with
Gérard's life
Anne, I had to be sure that we weren't imagining things
And are you sure now?
I no longer know
I called in at my old place on the way here. I found this
A letter from Juan's sister in Spain
"We were wrong. Juan was murdered by agents of the Falange
"That's not fantasy. You can fight against that. I'm fighting"
- I dropped Pierre off
- Terry, you didn't dare...
Dare what?
- I want to know what happened
- Nothing
He got out
Maybe he didn't want to see you
- You killed him. It's you!
- Why should I?
I don't believe you!
I was wrong. Pierre wasn't guilty
I know, Philip
I was wrong, Terry.
Pierre wasn't guilty
Keep back. Leave us, I'm used to this
Go and rest, Anne. That's an order
Anne, I don't know how to tell you
- He was innocent?
- Almost
Gérard did commit suicide.
De Georges drove him into a corner
He got financial control of Pericles
Gérard ended it all rather than give in
He thought he had another enemy, and yielded to his Ioneliness
- What did Pierre do?
- De Georges' dirty work
What about the organization?
It exists only in Philip's imagination
It's easy to encompass everything in one idea
His idleness, his cowardice.
Nightmares are alibis
And Gérard died for that
Such organizations do exist, but less clear-cut
Money, policing, faction... all the figures of Fascism
Evil has more than one face
- And what about Pierre?
- Pierre is dead
- You killed him?
- Yes. For no reason
On him I found an atrocious letter from de Georges
- Anyway, he was a rat
- And you?
We're imbeciles
It's all your fault.
You sought the sublime
- Poor fool!
- Go away!
- We're going
- Where?
You'll see
- What will you do now?
- Stage Pericles. Are you with us?
What for?
Is this wind westerly that blows?
THE BRIDE WORE BLACK
Julie, no! Julie!
- Here, Julie. Better take this, dear.
- No, Mama. I don't need it.
Please. For me.
- You must go?
- Yes, Mama. I must.
You will come back if you change your mind?
Yes, I will.
Don't be sad.
Just tell me where you're going.
Leave me your address.
I don't have one yet.
I'll write you.
- Are you leaving, Aunt Julie?
- Yes. I'm going to the station.
- May I go with you?
- Yes, you may come with me.
- Looking for someone, lady?
- I'm looking for Mr. Bliss.
- I believe he lives here.
- Yes, ma'am.
- But he's not in.
- It's quite all right.
- I must go up and wait for him.
- But there's nobody in, ma'am.
Well, you say that he isn't in.
But you're not sure, are you?
I'll go upstairs then.
As long as I'm here,
I want to see his apartment.
But I can phone the apartment.
I'll call up in front of you.
If nobody answers,
I can take the message.
Your name, please?
What's your name, please?
You hear it ringing?
Nobody's in the apartment.
Look, I've got a better idea.
You give me the key to the apartment.
I'll wait till he returns and give him a real surprise.
I was just thinking.
I haven't been here very long... and I don't even know if they'll keep me on.
But maybe we don't mean the same person.
- Mr. Bliss is a tall redhead, right?
- Yes, that's right.
I was afraid of that.
He didn't leave the key.
I guess he took it with him.
Sorry, ma'am. I'm very sorry.
Mr. Bliss, just a second.
A woman was asking for you.
- Mrs. Bujol? She and I are finished.
- No, not her.
This woman has never been here before.
She wanted me to give her your key.
And she even tried to bribe me with a hundred francs.
Really?
It wasn't that little Annie, was it?
- No.
- Then it was Big Bertha.
- No. I know those two women.
- Tell me about it then.
Hello. Did I wake you?
It was time for me to get up anyhow.
- What's new?
- Nothing special.
- I hoped you would answer "Gilberte."
- I don't see why.
It's very simple.
Question: What's new? Answer: Gilberte.
You did say she was brand new, didn't you?
You and your humor, you murder me.
So you're going to put the yoke on today?
And what's this?
Better get rid of it before Gilberte discovers it.
Since I broke up with that Bujol woman,
I've been living like a monk.
I also broke with little Annie.
Gilberte's marrying a new man.
You know my motto. "Don't run after women. But don't let any get by."
And I wanted to ask Gilberte to choose a maid of honor... who won't be too... who will be kind of...
You know what I mean.
It's about time you calm down.
"When you've seen one, you've seen them all."
- You taught me that.
- But I want them all.
Women, that's all you think about.
You'll have to give up this hobby some day... with age.
That's simple.
I've thought about that day quite often.
I'll use Hemingway's way out... bang, bang.
My own way out is called "Gilberte."
You can't believe that I'm in love?
Go into my bedroom... and right by the bed, you'll find a tape recorder.
- I see it.
- Good. Press the red button.
- The red button?
- Yes.
Just listen to that.
Terrific, isn't it?
Go back to the start.
I taped Gilberte crossing her legs.
She didn't know what I was up to.
Listen to the sound of her stockings rubbing against each other.
How do you like it?
That's the sound of nylons.
The first time I tried it...
Gilberte was wearing a pair of silk stockings. Result: Nothing.
I wonder what she's doing right now.
With whom, you mean?
You're envious, you traitor.
But you'll never make me doubt her.
No, I'm sure she must be gazing tenderly at my photo.
And I'll bet she's looking at her naked body in a mirror.
You're crazy.
I'm sure of it.
In every novel written by a woman... the heroine looks at herself naked in a mirror.
Gilberte's not in a book, though.
What's the relation?
Sexual relation.
Well, I better answer.
I'm sure it's Gilberte. Tell her I'm out of the bath and on my way.
Hello. Am I speaking to Mr. Bliss?
Mr. Bliss is in, but...
It wasn't Gilberte, but another woman.
She hung up, though.
A wrong number?
No. She asked for you, then hung up.
Yes, it is odd. I'll bet that must be my secret admirer.
Yes. There's a mysterious lady who admires me in secret.
It seems that some beautiful woman tried to enter my apartment... and even offered Charlie the doorman a hundred-franc note.
Which he refused, I suppose.
I'd have let her in for half that.
No, it must be a poor pregnant girl wanting an explanation.
- Impossible. She never saw me.
- How do you know?
Charlie gave her a description of me that was completely false.
The trap worked.
She said it was definitely me.
He said you were handsome and distinguished?
Go ahead and laugh.
But he says she was superb.
Know what she wore?
An evening gown at 10 A.M.
Let's go.
Yeah, let's go.
Your unknown lady is a hotel thief, that's all.
Did you ever see one wearing an evening gown? If I find her...
I'll celebrate the end of my bachelorhood with her.
- See what I mean, you...
- That must be Gilberte.
- Too late, a hang-up.
- Your mysterious woman again?
If it is, she wants something.
And she wants it bad.
And the best man?
Can't the best man kiss the bride?
I'll borrow my daughter, with your permission.
Do you see what I see by the door, Bliss?
- Well, introduce me.
- But I don't know her.
I guess she came here with Fred and his friends.
I'm going to check up, then.
- You don't recognize me?
- No. Yes, yes, sure.
Excuse me, please.
How are you?
If you recognize me, why do you never say hello to me on the street?
Excuse me.
Well, I give up. Fred doesn't know her.
Nobody knows her.
- She keeps looking at you.
- I have a secret admirer, too.
Boy, my move.
- You happy?
- Of course.
- Sure you're happy?
- Of course, I am.
- Mama is very happy.
- Then we're all happy.
You don't look happy.
It's my honor to present the real master of the house.
My friend, Bliss.
I can't make the introduction... because Mrs., or perhaps Miss...
...doesn't want to say her name.
She's an apparition.
Whatever her name, she's welcome here.
How do you do, apparition?
I suppose an apparition doesn't eat, smoke, or drink.
May I have some water?
Cold water, please.
I think it would have a better taste if you got it for me.
That puts me one up on you, my friend.
I wanted to be alone with you.
- That puts me one up on him.
- It's warm here. Take me to the balcony.
- Do we know each other?
- Perhaps.
- Where did we meet then?
- Think about it.
Thank you.
May I have another one?
Of course.
Won't you tell me your name now that we're alone?
- My name? No.
- Oh, there goes your scarf.
You'll permit me to buy you another one, won't you?
Well, you see... this one was a souvenir.
I can't lose it.
It means a lot to me.
You know you are...
I find you fascinating.
You intrigue me.
My fiancée is lovely.
Tell me just one thing.
Did you phone me twice this morning?
I don't know.
Get my scarf.
Get my scarf, and I will answer.
I'm Julie Kohler!
Oh, ma'am. You want Mr. Coral?
No, I came to see a friend.
But she's not in.
I was trying to leave, but with all these corridors...
I guess I lost my way.
Then I saw this open door.
I've always believed you can know what a person's like... if you just examine the room he lives in.
Yeah.
- I don't know your mister...
- Mr. Coral.
Mr. Coral, but let me show you.
I'm sure that he's a messy person.
- And I'm sure he isn't rich.
- You're right about that.
He's always at least three months behind in his rent.
He's also a man who won't face reality...
- but takes refuge in dreams.
- That's right.
What he's looking for is an ideal woman... a woman he can't find and who exists...
- only in his imagination.
- You're right.
I've noticed that whenever the poor man looks at a woman... he gets white as a sheet or red as a lobster.
You see. A simple room like this can tell you a lot.
You're right about that.
But don't let me keep you from your work.
Good-bye.
Mr. Coral, what about your letter?
- I don't think it's for me.
- Yes, it is. It's for you.
That's right, it's for me.
Mr. Coral, that's me.
"Municipal Theater.
The Fontanarosa."
Very strange.
I have a ticket.
Is it good for tonight?
Of course, sir. The performance just began three minutes ago.
- You're in box eight.
- Thanks.
Your ticket, please.
Thank you.
This way, please.
- You owe me an explanation.
- Do I?
Yes, and to begin with, how do you know me?
- You're much too curious.
- My name is Coral, Robert Coral.
Am I the man you meant to send the ticket to?
Yes, Robert Coral.
If it were all a mistake, would you be disappointed?
Yes, no, I don't think so.
At least we met.
I'm happy even if it wasn't meant for me.
If you were to tell me you won't see me again, I would feel lost.
You're not sorry you came, are you?
Then you're glad?
More than glad.
I'm overwhelmed.
- But I can't stop thinking...
- Yes, I know.
It's difficult to keep from thinking.
- Then why don't you tell me?
- It's my secret.
- Your name at least.
- I'll tell you later.
When?
- The next time we meet.
- When?
I don't know yet.
Next week perhaps.
- Why couldn't it be tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.
Wonderful! Where?
Where? At your place?
My place?
But I'd never have dared propose it.
Well, dare.
- Would you come tomorrow to my place?
- Gladly.
- You'll tell me everything?
- Yes, I'll tell you... when, where, why, and how.
- And now, good-bye till tomorrow.
- I'll take you home first.
No, you must go.
Until tomorrow night at nine.
I don't know what to say,
I'm just...
- Then don't say anything. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
And yet for not even a minute
Did she try to be pleasing
I'm wrong.
She did try to be pleasing.
The curtains...
There.
The mountain.
The mountain.
Under the bed.
Yes, yes.
Just a second. There.
The rent notice.
I guess you passed without seeing it.
Oh, just get out!
Yes?
You know, I was beginning to think you wouldn't come at all.
You're sweet, but you know...
I was sure you would say something stupid.
You're rather hard on me.
But I don't mind much.
Which do you prefer, whiskey or gin?
- I warn you, the gin isn't too good.
- No, wait.
I've brought something very special for the two of us.
Arak?
It's from the end of the world.
Do you know it?
- What? The end of the world?
- Why, no. Arak.
Give it to me. Thanks.
- Do you like mandolin?
- Sure I do, why?
Because I brought a record
I really love.
- I want to listen to it with you.
- Sure.
The record player's there.
Put your record on.
I'll open this bottle.
- I don't know how to work it.
- Just a minute. I'll get it going.
- Permit me to make an impossible wish.
- Why impossible?
- Because I'm rather a pessimist.
- I've heard it said:
"There are no optimists or pessimists.
There are only happy idiots or unhappy ones."
Yes, well,
I'm an unhappy idiot then.
You cheered me up, though, so here's to you and me.
The two of us, together.
- Can we have some music?
- Of course.
That's very nice.
I don't believe I know it.
Look, it's empty.
You know what they say?
"I empty my glass when it's full.
And when it's drained,
I'm full."
You remember the secret?
You were to tell me it tonight.
I want to know your deepest thoughts.
No, my thoughts are mine.
You will know the secret.
But wait, it's a bit too early.
Aren't you happy here with me?
Yes, I am, yes! You are magic.
You made me drink a love potion.
Look. I've made this to remind me of something I should do, but what?
- I feel like dancing.
- Good. Let's dance.
No, by myself, but I'll dance for you.
Listen here. It's the allegretto.
- You're beautiful. Too beautiful.
- But why too?
- Too beautiful for me.
- Don't be foolish.
Don't put yourself down.
In life you must always play to win.
Losers are made, not born.
You're right.
I won't put a hand on you.
You're my fairy princess.
My impossible dream.
I won't put a hand on you, but I wish you'd ask me to touch you.
That way I'd know deep down
I could have done it, if I'd wanted to.
You're here with me.
It's a miracle.
Till now,
I've had little to do with women.
I've been a very lonely soul.
I'll confess something that I can't tell to a man.
I'll bet I could count on the fingers of one hand... no, let's say both hands... the women I've had.
And now my impossible dream... of making you happy.
You've almost done it.
This isn't the first time we've met, you know.
I know that. I met you last night.
No, that wasn't the first time either.
Listen to me.
No, a little while more.
We know each other.
You saw me once.
Not too many years ago.
But I wasn't wearing black,
I was wearing white.
Yes, by God, I recognize you.
You're the bride.
Listen, it wasn't our fault.
I can't see very well.
Is the light flickering?
Nothing has happened to it.
It's you.
I'm being torn to shreds.
You must call a doctor.
It's no use. He'd get here too late.
It's all over now.
Cookie!
Hello, Cookie. Such a big ball for such a little fellow.
- How old are you?
- Almost five and a half.
Isn't that nice?
And whose little boy are you?
- I'm my papa's and mama's boy.
- What's your papa's name?
- Clément.
- Clément? Clément Morane?
- Why, sure. Clément Morane.
- You've got a Band-Aid.
It was my teacher who put it on when I fell down in the yard.
- Do you want to play a little game?
- What kind?
You put everything you have in your pockets in my hand.
A coin... and a stick of chalk.
Fine, be a good boy, close both eyes... and without peeking, tell me what I have in my hand.
A marble, a car, a picture... a whistle, chalk.
A coin.
You see, my grandma gave me it.
That's pretty good! Now, tell me, does Grandma live here with you?
Don't you know that grandmas live someplace else?
My grandma lives in Andeville.
- Would you like to go to see her?
- You mean, now?
Here. Would you like one of these?
Cookie, come here.
MOTHER VERY ILL
What are you crying for?
Get a grip.
You knew it would happen sooner or later. Your mother's no spring chicken.
You might be a little more sympathetic. A poor sick lady...
- alone in that big house, at her age.
- Alone, my eye. She's got a TV set.
The world could still function without a woman that old.
I'm worried about how the two of you will make out.
- Lucienne will cook the dinner.
- But Tuesday is her day off.
Your mother would choose
Tuesday to get sick.
Do you think you can get along without me then?
Does a man need a Ph.D.
To wipe a kid's nose?
- You're not hungry, are you?
- Yes, I am hungry.
Now, where's that package of soup?
"Gives you soup, thick and velvety, like mother used to make."
- Cookie, how are things in school?
- Everything's fine, Papa.
That's surprising.
Who'll get the star this month?
- I think José Macias.
- The Spanish boy?
He told me he can't speak any Spanish.
The boy may not speak it, but his father does.
Try to get the star back next month.
You see, life is like a big race.
Someone has to win, and someone has to lose.
I know, like Bertrand.
He's my best friend.
Next month, you better...
I'll get it.
Hello, Cookie.
Good evening, sir.
Mr. Morane, I suppose?
- Yes. My wife isn't in.
- I know that. I'm Miss Becker.
- Your son, Cookie, is in my class.
- Yes, Miss Becker. I know.
Mrs. Morane didn't really ask me to come by, but she sounded worried... about leaving you alone with the boy.
I could cook you something...
- and then put Cookie to bed.
- That's really nice of you.
But I can take care of things.
I even started making soup.
You've made enough to last a week.
Let me do it.
- I think I'll do better.
- Well, if you insist.
Cookie, you haven't said good evening to Miss Becker.
- It's not Miss Becker.
- Cookie, don't make me angry.
- She's not my teacher.
- Would you like this?
No, don't. He isn't used to seeing me outside of school.
- What's this?
- My whistle.
I took it away from you today.
You were so noisy. I'll give it back.
- And this, who put on this Band-Aid?
- Miss Becker.
You mean it was me.
- No. You don't look like her a bit.
- I know what's the matter.
It's the glasses.
I wear glasses in school.
- There. Well, is this better?
- No. You are not her.
- Where's my candy?
- I ate it up!
- I'll give you a hand.
- No, please don't bother.
But I have to show you where things are.
No, I'll find them.
Go read your newspaper.
Do you know where
Daddy's slippers are? Go and get them.
- All right, finish your yogurt.
- I don't like yogurt.
You say you don't like it, but maybe it doesn't like you.
- Yes, it does.
- You have the patience of a saint.
I'll give you some sugar.
I'm puzzled over something.
May I ask a question?
Tell me on exactly what basis you award the star...
- what's the criterion?
- Well, you know...
I don't mind if that boy,
José Macias, got it...
I just wanted to know.
You know, it's all based... it's based on the grades.
But I was told there are no grades in kindergarten.
Well, they aren't official.
Cookie, how about it?
It's bedtime. Put on your pajamas.
You know, the star.
I never got one, but...
Nothing was preventing me, but...
I spent more time under the teacher's desk than in my seat.
- Can a woman keep a secret?
- You must decide that.
Yes, well. Nobody knows this, not even the boy's mother.
Yielding to pressure from my friends,
I intend to become... the party's candidate in the next elections.
- I suppose I should wish you luck.
- I won't count my chickens... but I do think the situation is favorable.
- Would you like coffee, Mr. Morane?
- No, I prefer a light tea.
You see, the people here must wake up.
They are going to be given a choice, and they had better choose right.
Do you know the composition of the district?
- Politics and me, you know...
- You're not a non-voter, are you?
- Not me, not at all, but...
- Mark my words.
If you don't attend to politics, politics will attend to you.
Personally, I've given up everything for politics.
Even hunting.
It's no great sacrifice.
So many fools go hunting these days.
Now, let me tell you this.
Politics is not child's play.
Get this straight, to run a modern campaign like we're planning... money's needed, a lot of money, and we've got it.
Sure, people always ask questions,
"Where does it come from?
Who pays for the posters, hand bills and so forth?"
We can't tell them.
They wouldn't understand.
Yes, the voters should be completely informed, but that's just not possible.
They don't really know what's good for them.
This evening you were good for us.
I really don't know how to thank you.
I have no idea how
I'd have gotten along without you.
My wife will be very grateful to you.
My activities have prevented me from going to P.T.A. meetings... but I am acquainted with your principal.
He'll never set the world on fire, but he's a good man.
Could you find out if he's decorated?
I could see about getting a plaque for him.
It might please him, and it would help my boy.
Come along, Cookie, you have to go to bed.
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
- Yes.
Then I'll be it.
Good. And I'll count to ten. Ready.
One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Where can Cookie be?
I don't see him.
But I hear him nearby.
I'm sure that he's not far.
There you are.
Now you're "it."
- You scared me.
- Do you mean it? I scared you?
- No, not really. You go hide.
- Start counting.
One, two, three... four, five, six... seven, eight... nine, ten.
Come on. Up you go.
You're too heavy for me.
Say good night to Daddy.
- Good night, Cookie.
- Good night.
And say your prayers.
Now get ready to meet the sandman.
Get your feet under.
Give me your hand and I'll show you something.
You see, there were five little pigs... and they all lived together.
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home.
This little piggy had some roast beef, this little piggy had none.
And this little piggy cried
"wee-wee-wee" all the way home.
- There! Good night, now. Sleep well.
- Good night.
I went to sleep, dreaming I was in a movie.
My wife must have arrived at her mother's by now.
Don't leave yet.
Won't you have a liqueur?
Sorry, I must go.
All that counts is Cookie.
Me, I'm nothing.
You know, I may not look like a Don Juan, but as a general rule... politicians make it big with women.
It's normal because a woman can say...
"For an hour, he completely forgot
France and gave himself to me."
Please, it's impossible for you to leave in this weather.
I must go.
Wait, take this umbrella.
Return it to my wife.
She'll want to thank you.
No, thanks.
She's a perfect mother, but she can't seem to understand me at all.
You seem to understand me quite well.
I've lost my ring. I guess it must've fallen off while we were playing.
It's a souvenir, a man's signet ring.
It's not worth much... but I do prize it.
I may have lost it upstairs.
- I'm sure he'll wake up now.
- Don't worry about him.
He'd sleep through an earthquake.
But the closet could be a good place to look. You hid there.
Miss Becker, open the door, please.
It slammed shut.
No, I slammed it.
All you have to do is pull the bolt toward you.
But you haven't understood me.
I'm the one who locked you in.
Open up, Miss Becker!
All right, stop it.
I'll tell you why I did it.
- What?
- I'm not Miss Becker.
- What do you mean? Who are you?
- I'm Julie Kohler.
David Kohler's widow.
I came here tonight to kill you.
Let me out of here!
Listen to me!
Let me explain what happened.
I'll explain the whole thing to you.
It was a terrible accident,
and because of it...
our careers, our futures,
could have been ruined.
Bliss, Coral, Delvaux and I
weren't really friends.
We were a group of bachelors
in a boring, small town.
We'd get together to play cards
and kid around.
We only had two common interests.
Hunting and women.
After the accident,
we all felt guilty, and yet innocent.
We made a quick decision
to break up...
and never see each other again.
It's all in the past.
For you it's in the past.
But I live through it every night.
Every young girl dreams of meeting
her Prince Charming...
of getting engaged and married.
I never had to dream,
because David was always there.
I never looked at another boy,
and no other girl existed for him.
I waited for David.
I waited to become his wife.
Julie! Julie!
They wouldn't let me die,
so I went back to the church.
The sun was no longer shining.
I stood on the steps...
and turned around
to look at the rooftops...
and when I went into the church...
it was not to pray,
it was to make a vow.
I tracked the five of you down,
one by one.
It took me a long time to find you.
Let me out! Listen to me!
I only listen to David.
I told you what happened!
I'll do anything you ask!
- I want David.
- I can't breathe!
I only want David, to hear him laughing, to see him walking.
I want to see his eyes.
You took something from me, that you can't give me back.
Are you there?
I know you're there, answer me.
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Are you there?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Answer me! What are you doing?
You're mad!
Hello, Cookie. Come with me.
Let's talk.
Cookie, let's see.
You said you played hide-and-seek with your papa and a lady.
What was the lady like?
She was funny.
She played a game with us.
Did your father hide under the stairway?
All of us took our turn.
- Who was "it?"
- The lady and me.
- What lady?
- The one who was here.
I know, but who was that lady? Who?
I told you.
She's the lady who played with us.
When you played this game after dinner...
- who was the first to hide?
- Me.
- And then?
- The lady.
- And then?
- My papa.
You, the lady, your papa...
- You're angry with her?
- What?
You're angry with Miss Becker?
- What did you say?
- You're angry with Miss Becker?
- Who is Miss Becker?
- The lady who came here.
The one last night, her name is Becker?
Yes.
Very good.
That's very good, Cookie.
- Miss Becker, please.
- Yes? That's me.
I'm Detective Kling.
Would you come along to the Moranes?
- Right now?
- If you would.
Don't worry about it.
I will see to the children.
Thank you. All right.
The poor little boy.
We were just talking about him.
I guess they'll ask me to take care of Cookie.
They want to ask you a few simple questions.
I have to tell the principal.
He's been told.
Don't try to influence the child.
Well, Cookie. Is this she?
Was I the lady, Cookie?
Cookie, was Miss Becker here when you played hide-and-seek?
Yes, Miss Becker was here.
And Miss Becker ate with my papa and with me.
Passengers for Flight 813,
destination Essington...
please come to gate B
for immediate boarding.
Excuse me, I forgot something,
I must make a phone call.
You have two minutes.
Please, hurry.
Hello, police? Now listen.
Let that teacher go.
She didn't murder Morane.
I'm talking, not you.
The teacher is innocent.
You can believe me because
I'm the murderer. You want proof?
I will give it to you. The fake telegram received by Mrs. Morane...
"Mother ill. Must have your help."
Cookie's room is upstairs.
And the lamp by his bed has a lampshade... on which there's a locomotive racing on the tracks.
Well, is that enough? And now, let that teacher go. Good-bye.
You're wrong because revenge is wrong.
Revenge is hopeless. It would be endless. It would be necessary... to avenge too many wrongs, too many crimes, too much ignorance.
The evil thoughts of people.
You must renounce this sinister mission you've taken on yourself.
This must be done, it's not a mission.
It must be done.
- Give it up.
- Impossible. I must continue to the end.
I see no remorse in your eyes.
Don't you fear for your soul?
No remorse, no fear.
You know, you'll be caught in the end.
The justice of men is powerless.
I'm already dead.
I died the same day David did.
I'll join David after I've had my revenge.
How can you hope to join love through hate and murder?
You have no answer. Not a word.
- I beg you to stop!
- No, you can't sway me.
- What were you seeking here?
- The strength to continue.
You gave it to me, in spite of yourself.
Wait!
I was sure of it, boss. I know cops.
You fool them two or three times, then bang, they nab you.
I warned you, that paint job on the car was bad.
I think he did it on purpose, if you ask me.
I tossed the plates into a septic tank.
No one will find them.
I'd hate to be the guy they send down there.
The cops can't prove a thing without the plates.
The loot.
This is yours, boss, and this is mine.
And now, if anyone asks for you,
I don't know a thing.
You said good-bye and left.
I know nothing, see nothing, etc.
Customers. I'll get rid of them.
For you, boss. A woman.
She insists on seeing you.
I don't know her.
Looks like a tramp.
I'll tell her you're gone, but she looks stubborn.
Sorry, but Mr. Delvaux is leaving on a trip and can't see you now.
But if you want me to,
I'll give him a message.
That's no good. He's got to see me, and that's that.
I have time, so I'll just wait here.
Tell him that I'm staying till he sees me.
Mr. Delvaux.
Are you Mr. Delvaux?
Police.
You're under arrest.
Move on.
- Is he the one who sold it to you?
- He's the one.
Robber! I'll show you yet!
You dirty thief!
Take advantage of me! I'll show you, you louse! You stinking louse!
You won't get away with it!
Dirty rat!
He'll pay for what he did to me!
Driver, 13 Avenue Nemesis.
This is stupid. They were asked to send a tall, stacked redhead.
Good Lord!
I was looking all over for you last year.
Last year?
You're the image of the woman
I needed for my exhibition.
Exactly right for it.
You're a bit too late, though.
This is one more time that stupid girl got it wrong.
Yes, just right for it. So sorry.
But what about me?
I was thrilled to get to model for the great Fergus.
- And besides, I could use the money.
- Well, another time.
- Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Wait.
Just a second. I may have an idea.
Come on in. Where is that thing?
Oh, here it is.
They've asked me to illustrate a book.
I didn't say no. I didn't say yes.
But now that I see you...
You see, the theme is
Diana the Huntress. It's by Klossowski.
The publisher sent me these things, a lot of accessories.
Look at this.
They got her mixed up with Tarzan.
Well, all right, it's not complicated.
The costume, let's say white and short.
Good, you better take care of that.
Take this along. We'll start work next time you come here.
All right?
Have it made at Bertrand's.
- At Bertrand's?
- Yes, Bertrand's, the costume maker.
Just tell him it's for me and that I'm in a hurry.
Mr. Fergus, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I told you a lie.
I was in the agency waiting room when they told this girl... to come here to work for you so
I made up my mind to beat her here.
How do you do, Mr. Fergus?
The agency sent me.
- The agency? What agency?
- They have guts.
Well... well, you see, this has happened before.
That stupid woman gets things wrong.
I don't need you. Wait.
- This is for your trouble.
- Oh, no.
Take it. I think I've seen you somewhere.
Sure, at the Balto, often with Massoulier.
- That's right. I've noticed you too.
- Have you?
What do you say we get together some evening, but not at the Balto.
I'd love that, Mr. Fergus.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
There you are.
Now you know, I'm a skirt-chaser.
But don't worry, you're in no danger.
Good Lord! I was so busy with the front,
I forgot about the rear.
That's thirty-six, twenty-three and thirty-seven, good.
When I'm in shape, I can tell a woman's measurements within an inch.
Well, let's get to work.
I'm attracted to that redhead because she's so vulgar.
I demand lots of vulgarity in my women.
It's part of life.
She didn't get the job, but she got on my list.
I simply must tell you about my nightmare. Listen to this.
It's morning, I'm in the street,
I'm dressed... and there are only women.
No, there are no women, only men.
So I walk along... only men.
Not a single woman.
And then I wake up in a cold sweat.
But everything's fine, because it's only a dream.
Now listen. I walk around the neighborhood in the evenings... and look the girls over in the cafes... the way that some nuns do while collecting alms.
"I've collected from that one. That one, not yet. I'll have to try her."
Your nose is remarkable.
So is your mouth.
If I were a writer, I'd write a book.
Every place is the same, the subway, the train, the bus.
I get on, and immediately I look around to see women I could pick up.
And when I find one, there's a feeling of relief.
And if there's more than one,
I have a way of grading them.
I don't make a pass or even give them the eye.
But I know they're there.
And if something occurred, let's say an accident... suppose a subway train got stuck all night between stations... yeah, well, anything might happen.
- Does this shock you?
- No. I'm very interested. Go on.
Anyway, even if I do shock you, you mustn't move.
I prefer to talk when I work.
Listen. I often get out... and wait on the platform for the next train.
And you know why? Because there is no interesting girl in mine.
If I stay, I feel I'm being stifled.
I suffocate.
And you can't imagine how much I hate contact with men.
If a man sits down beside me,
I change my seat.
There. Now you change position.
Let's see. Your right leg...
No, not crossed.
Again at the left. Good. Your hands.
Fine. Try to hold it.
Still, I must say... if I should see too many beauties in one place or in one day... do you know what happens to me?
I get depressed.
I think of those I will miss.
I get dizzy.
It happens in the street.
I see a beautiful girl... walking in front of me, and my heart beats faster.
I hurry to catch up with her.
I look at her, she's hideous.
Then, believe it or not,
I'm relieved. I find it reassuring.
It's crazy.
I've got something to show you.
All right, now.
We're done for today.
Look at the date.
- And I'd never seen you in my life.
- It's possible.
This proves what Oscar Wilde said.
That nature imitates art.
- Good-bye, see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Who's she?
- You passed her downstairs.
Oh, her. I just saw her back.
I noticed her legs, not great, but nice.
- Her dress was white.
- You're right. That's her.
- Her name is?
- Funny! I forgot to ask her.
Where do we eat?
At Titine's or the Customs House?
At Titine's. This is Massoulier's treat.
He won his bet.
- What bet?
- On the Montreal-Paris flight.
He succeeded in making the stewardess.
- He won two hundred francs.
- It's worth it.
- Hey, Corey, what is it?
- I'm just sort of thinking.
I know I've seen her.
As soon as I find a new girl, somehow you know her... or if you don't, you have a friend who does.
No, this time it's like having a name on the tip of your tongue.
Has she posed for Massoulier?
Frankly,
I don't think she's a real model.
- She gets tired too fast.
- I'm sure that I've seen her.
She's not from around here.
I'd have noticed her.
- Why? Did you...?
- No.
- No, she's different.
- I detest that word.
When you say she's different, don't forget what the Italians say.
All women are prostitutes.
Except my mother, she's a saint.
Anyway, when you've seen one...
- It's you. Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Come in. Do you have the costume?
- Right here.
Great. You can change in the bathroom.
You'd never guess what those are.
They're falsies.
Manufactured by a customer of mine, an American businessman.
He overestimated his sales possibilities and got stuck... with eight thousand pair.
So he sells them by the yard.
Amusing, don't you think?
By the way, you didn't tell me your name yesterday.
- What's your name?
- I don't dare tell you.
- It's such a ridiculous name.
- Ridiculous. Let's hear it.
My name is Alphonsine.
Alphonsine!
That's a beautiful name.
I like it.
It has the smell of earth about it.
Ernestine, Julie, Charlotte.
A lovely name, Alphonsine.
And Alphonsine what?
Just call me Diana. Diana, that's all.
That's not bad.
- May I have your ring?
- Yes.
You may have it back later, if you're good.
But you need a bracelet.
It's not a piece of brass junk.
It's something Calder made.
Yes, on the right.
The girl is fine, the costume is fine, but from here... you look more like a tennis player than Diana the Huntress.
We'll have to concentrate on detail.
Let's take each thing on its own.
Position of the feet, position of the legs.
And the hand taking an arrow from the quiver.
Don't move your body.
You must be tired.
Now you may rest a bit.
Like something to drink?
- I would.
- Cool or hot?
Hot.
- Do you want tea or coffee?
- Tea. Let me make it, please.
- No, you take a rest.
- No, stay here.
I'll do it.
I'd rather move around.
- What happened in your kitchen?
- What?
I mean, what caused this hole?
That? That's a bullet hole.
A cop committed suicide in the courtyard.
- A cop?
- Yes, a cop. Funny, isn't it?
He shot himself in the head.
Do you know why?
Despair over love.
The whole thing was beyond me.
After all, who ever thinks of a cop being in love?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing special.
- Then, let's have dinner together.
- Absolutely not.
Why not?
Because I came to pose and when time's up, I leave.
Then we can stop now.
We're going to stop?
I'm fed up. Knocked out.
We'll go on tomorrow.
- Three o'clock tomorrow.
- All right.
Will you give me back the ring, please?
You must have a telephone.
Give me the number.
That's impossible. My ring.
I'll hold on to it.
This way, I'll know you'll come back.
All right. So long.
Fergus, how are you? Where have you
been lately? Something wrong?
Nothing special. A little depressed.
The gang's at the Balto.
We'll cheer you up.
No, I'll stay home, if you don't mind.
I'll bet it's that girl.
Nothing doing?
Yes, yes. It's all right.
I'm even spending my nights with her.
Are you all right? It's nothing.
How could it happen?
I don't understand.
It's all right, I tell you.
It wasn't your fault.
It was lucky I broke my charcoal.
You're trembling. You're cold.
Wait... I've got an idea.
Both of us are alive.
Let's drink to that.
When I was a boy, my father would say... champagne is to adults what milk is to kids.
Do you know why the Chinese never use this little finger?
Because it's mine.
Good champagne?
Feel better?
You got a shock.
We'll finish tomorrow.
See a movie with me?
And we'll have dinner on the Seine, on a boat later.
- Let's get it over once and for all.
- Then will you promise?
Whatever you want, but we must finish right away.
Are you all right?
- You sure?
- Yes.
Fine, let's go.
Very good.
Now, a little more toward me.
A little more.
That's it.
Damn it, damn it!
It's the weekly stampede.
They're like a cyclone!
We'll have to stop.
I'm going to change.
I don't want to meet them.
Wait! Don't look at me, please.
I have something to tell you.
But keep looking away, or I'd never be able to.
There are words and expressions that everyone uses.
They're in all the books.
The phrases I thought I'd never use.
I thought I was above all that.
Now, I'm in love with you.
- Don't run away! Do you love me?
- Leave me alone!
It's not love I'm looking for.
- Do you know her?
- No. Never saw her.
I'm sure that I've seen that face somewhere before.
I'm going to find out where.
Fergus, well, have you got it made?
Shut up, will you! She's in there.
Where? In the bathroom?
Diana The Huntress.
She's a virgin, then.
I've seen her.
- Daniel's making his usual play.
- That's a lot of hypocrisy.
Artists, they say, are immoral.
They sleep together and all that.
Yeah, why does everyone pick on us artists?
You take any field.
Civil service, banks, factories.
Take the subway, for instance...
Hey, Daniel, are you reciting Saint-Simon?
I think we know each other.
My name's Corey.
- And you?
- Diana.
- Diana what?
- That's all.
Where have I seen you?
You looked at me as if you knew me also.
There are people who don't make much of an impression.
You did.
I'm imagining you with different hair.
Grandmorin is inviting us all to dinner.
He wants you.
- It'll keep, I guess.
- No, you go and speak to him now.
- We'll be leaving right away?
- I guess we'd better go.
All right?
- You'd like to finish tonight?
- Yes.
Me too. I suggest we go along with them to the restaurant... and there you say you've got to phone while I go out the back door.
- We meet here in 20 minutes, all right?
- Yes.
Of course.
For three days, I've been trying to think where I met her.
And then, in the middle of the night, wham! At Bliss's place.
The night that he got engaged, when he fell off the terrace.
She was there alone. No one saw her come, no one saw her go.
No one knew her name or who she was.
Nothing.
Recognize him?
Yes, it's him.
I pushed him off the terrace.
Yes, that's Bliss.
The three of us were together.
To be alone with him, she sent me for a glass of water, and then...
I never saw him.
I had only met Bliss and Fergus.
Robert Coral.
I came to his hotel and poisoned him.
- Recognize this one?
- I don't.
He was pushed off a train in the night.
- We don't know who he is.
- I tell you, I don't know the man.
That's Morane. He suffocated in a hall closet. I admit I shut him in.
Mr. Corey?
This is the last victim, your friend, Fergus.
Now, please, tell us why you killed these men.
I remember something.
You didn't know Bliss... because at the party you took me for him.
And you didn't know
Fergus either. Well?
You'll never know.
They must have something in common.
Or else...
You'll be examined by a group of psychiatrists tomorrow, but...
I wonder if the list was closed?
He might have been the next.
Yes, I hate him because he's the sort of man... who's always pawing girls, but I wouldn't kill him.
What did you have against Bliss and Fergus?
And Morane and Coral?
I've nothing more to say.
Have you chosen a lawyer?
I don't know any, and it doesn't matter anyway.
Then, we'll assign you one.
I hope he can work out a better defense for you.
I've known killers caught with a smoking gun, brazenly refusing... to admit their crime, but this one beats all.
She admits committing four murders, and won't say what the motive was.
I'm stumped by the way this woman, so intelligent, let herself be caught.
Doesn't make any sense.
Soup's on!
Hey, you!
<b>MARLOWE
How do I get in to see the manager?
Thank you.
Hello?
Who the hell are you?
Orrin Quest's mother.
Wants her little boy back.
Cop?
<b>PHILIP MARLOWE
Private Investigator
Hmm. I'm unhappy.
Get out more. Dance in the streets. Take a cop to lunch.
I got friends. -You got a master key?
Hello. Let me speak to the doctor.
Klausen.
Doctor?
The key. -I run a legit hotel here. -Come on, the key!
All these private rooms. -You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Excuse me, the manager said that Orrin Quest was here.
The manager said that
Orrin Quest was in here!
Talkie that way, ain't he?
He's still registered.
So what am I doing' here?
You ask the question.
Close the lid.
I got a permit for the gun.
Let me see it.
Let me see it!
Quest left ten days ago.
I was across the hall, in 215.
This is a better room. So
I switched. You satisfied?
I'll sleep like a lamb.
You're Hicks, right?
The register: Grant. W. Hicks. 215.
Did Quest leave any forwarding address?
These kids, you know.
They freak out, disappear.
You narco squad?
Thanks.
For not spitting on it!
Going up?
The little one, darling.
Don't want another big roller.
Oh my God! -Anything for me, Chuck?
She's back. The one from Kansas.
Hi. -Well?
Hold it.
Well?
What happened? I've been waiting hours and hours.
All shadow no substance.
Not even a trace?
No satisfaction, no charge.
Dr. Lagardie's Office. 
I'd like to speak to the doctor, please.
Can I tell him who's calling? 
Tell him it's about Mr. Klausen.
Will you hold?
-Yes, I'll hold. 
No wonder you haven't found my brother.
You've been working on other cases.
That's me, just buried alive in success.
The luxurious appointments, executive secretary the electronic devices?
Drink?
I don't like you, Mr. Marlowe.
The minute I walked into this grubby little office...
I knew I should never have hired you.
Well, there's your retainer. All $ 55.
Now some people would keep it.
But I just get a little shaky running around with that much loose money in my pocket.
You didn't even really try to find Orrin!
Doctor Lagardie. -Doc?
Just this morning a Mr. Havin
Klausen tried to talk to you...
... He got cut off?
Havin Klausen? I'm afraid I don't know a Havin Klausen.
Then you have nothing to fear, Doc. 
Unless it was your ice pick.
Who is this? -Hicks. Grant Hicks.
A former tenant of Mr.
Klausen's rooming house.
I was just checking out when he tried to call you.
That was before someone mistook him for an ice block.
You might want to know before someone wanted
... why Klausen tried call you. 
But Doc?
Don't get me wrong, this is no shakedown.
I'm just a cat looking for a connection.
You know.
Please feel free to consult me.
Anytime.
Goodbye. -Goodbye. 
Do you mind?
Filthy habit.
My father used to smoke a pipe.
Momma never let him smoke in the house.
The last two years, after he had the stroke, he used to sit on the porch...
... with an empty pipe in his mouth.
Probably didn't like that, either.
We owed a lot of money.
We couldn't afford useless things like tobacco.
Well, stick your $50 back and forget we ever met.
Hey, the town's full of detectives.
Fine.
I used up my vacation time looking for him.
And most of my money, too.
And I have to go back home Saturday!
I'm sure something happened!
I can feel it, Mr. Marlowe!
I found a boarding house.
He slept there ten days ago.
Now, you go home, Miss Quest.
Sooner or later he will shuck his sandals, cut his hair. .
Ten years you won't know him from anyone else in Kansas.
Marlowe. -Grant
Hicks, Marlowe. 
You in the market for a quick $100? 
How quick? -Fifteen minutes quick enough?
Is that panel to panel pay? 
Marlowe, I'm in the Alvarado hotel.
Just five minutes from your place. 
A couple of minutes of your time and you're home free. 
Maybe -I'm in Room
22. But hurry, huh?
It's two minutes with you where your story breaks down.
Look, I'll give you something to hold and $100.
Tomorrow, next day, give it back.
Strictly legit. Nothing hot.
Look. Got to hang up.
I'm counting on you, Marlowe.
Get over here right now.
$50 is all I've got.
I guess not enough to keep you interested, right?
It's not the money that bothers me. It's ice picks.
If you won't take my money, what will you take?
A simple goodbye.
Does it bother you if a girl makes the first overture?
I've got a low threshold of boredom. It usually helps.
Does it mean that you want me too?
It means, that I keep thinking of your old man... sitting out on a porch... with an empty pipe.
Goodbye, Miss Quest.
But if you don't help me find Orrin, who will?
The department of missing persons or the FBI...
Mr. Marlowe!
Excuse me, room 22?
Who's registered, please?
Around here the concession for transom peeking
Has been given to Oliver J. Hady.
That little concession ought to bring a fortune at auction.
Past the stairs on your left.
Hady?
So? -I want to get a line on one of your customers.
What name? -Could be Naster for all I know. Room 22.
So? -He wants to see me.
Don't let me keep you.
Would you mind holding your finger there on this thing?
Ollie, a man in my business has enemies. You know that.
Anybody calls me to come over, wants something done
... and neglects to give me his name.
You think I'm wrong to think of that?
It could be a way to get me into a room and... zap!
Party checks out and your left with me on the floor in 22.
Wouldn't want a case of rigor in your hotel, would you Ollie?
Give me the box.
Will you hold this a minute?
Checked in 5:47. One local phone call. No Room Service.
Dr. G. W. Hamilton, El Centro.
What did he look like?
That's right, I stay out there with a Brownie when they register.
Don't move.
A 45 I wouldn't argue, but a 32
I can get in a couple of words.
I've said them all.
Please. Don't forget you're a lady.
I like the perfume.
What is it?
BENSON's Camera Shop
Whoever did this is a performer.
Cut the spinal cord first try.
They developed the technique in Brooklyn.
You don't say.
Sonny Steelgrave's
Boys were specialists.
You're aren't trying to connect Steelgrave with this?
Pretty fragile, isn't it? -Yes
Anyway, he definitely wasn't the last of the big spenders.
Fourteen dollars and change, Seven master keys...
Maybe he thought he'd clean out the hotel.
Eddie, do any of these keys fit this dump?
You can unlock our doors with your little finger.
Well, he knew somebody was after him.
Spotted them getting close.
Calls Marlowe and offers him
$100 to safe keep something.
Is that your story, Marlowe?
That's it.
Only he hasn't got $100 on him.
Maybe he was figuring on getting you to gamble along.
Eddie, could the desk give us a rundown on any visitors?
You don't have to pass the desk to go in or out.
No wonder he stayed in here.
That, and all the atmosphere.
I guess that just about does it for the first run-through.
Oh not quite.
What do you know.
Maliway Mushtom.
Used to be a runner for Ace Devore.
How you been, Maliway?
Going to miss you at the morning line-up.
Well, that takes the pressure off.
This punk won't be a 24 hour a day job.
How did you know about that wig?
I'm a trained detective.
That's your exit line,
Marlowe. Follow it out.
And don't leave town, you hear me?
Go on, Hady, You too.
What's bugging you? -The 150.
Don't get funny in the wrong place.
Oliver, when I checked him he had $164.
Now there's only 14 left. -So?
So where were you while I was calling the Lieutenant?
Are you accusing me?
-Just checking for crimes.
Fifty-fifty?
Okay, here you go.
I'll remember you!
Ollie!
I don't want the money.
I want something else.
What? -The girl.
Went out of here by these stairs. She had to pass you.
She'd have been running, you'd have been following.
What makes you so wonderful?
-I'm a trained detective.
All right. I followed her and she got the car.
How do I know that this isn't a number you already had?
Just take my word for it. -What kind of car?
Jaguar convertible, XKE, yellow.
Describe the girl.
You want a lot for your bread. -Grant Hicks's bread.
Wide felt black hat with a black patent leather band.
Dark glasses.
Black coat and black patent leather buttons and trimming.
White gloves.
Height 5'6"-5'6-1/2".
Built like a model.
Don't waste it.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Okay, relax a bit.
Hi. How are you. Hello.
Thank you. You're right, you're right.
Can you get me the name and address with this license?
Sure, I'll be through in half an hour.
Julie, tonight I couldn't lead a kindergarten marching band.
What if I lead, you follow?
Good night, girls.
And then we apply the colour along the part.
And notice how I help it with my thumb.
See?
Good morning, Chuck.
-Hold it a minute, girls.
Good morning, Philip.
-Good morning, all.
Special delivery for you.
Alvarado Hotel. Really, Philip.
Hey... -Do you like?
Yeah!
Another day another dollar. Let me go.
Benson Camera Shop.
Good morning, this is Grant Hicks.
Order ready on claim
A1654? -Hold on sir.
Marlowe. -I figured it would be a girl.
Why? -Mr. Hicks?
-Why? -Yes, I'm Hicks.
Your order's ready, sir. -Who's Mr. Hicks?
It's something I've been working on.
Why'd you say it had to be a girl?
Are you kidding?
-I'm sorry, I'm on another line.
Should I call you back? -I need the information now.
Sir, are you speaking to me?
-Yes, I will be in before noon.
That'll be fine. -I have to be back by one.
How's 12? -I can't make it.
-You can't make it. -We close at six.
No, I will be there to pick them up before noon.
How? -I'll be here. -Goodbye.
-Don't hang up yet! Hello? -Honey,
I'm sorry, I can't make it for lunch, but who's the girl?
Mavis Wald.
The Mavis Wald?
My luck. 
What's the address?
2720 Nelson Avenue. I hope they pitch you off the balcony.
Goodbye. 
Your change, Mr. Hicks.
I'll tell you what we'll do. Keep the change...
... and mail the photos to me at this address.
Alright Mr. Hicks.
It's Marlowe.
-Alright, Mr. Marlowe.
I have some stills for Ms. Wald.
You can leave them with me. -No, not these.
I'll phone, wait a minute.
It's the ones we shot at the
Alvarado Hotel last night.
Okay.
Yes, ma'am.
Sir, you can go right up.
Penthouse.
Hi. -Mavis Wald?
She's busy making panic calls.
You really shook her. What's up?
I am the father of her triplets.
Do you have a name?
It wouldn't do anything for you.
Sugar? -Yes, please.
I am Dolores, with an "o".
Dolores Gonzales.
Is that Spanish for pain?
You've picked a nice place to suffer.
You jumped to that conclusion, but it's Mavis's pad, not mine.
Which makes you?
Something you don't see every day.
An old friend.
My friend asked me to keep you occupied.
Are you hard to occupy? -As hard to get. as a haircut.
Has anybody ever told you that you have a sensuous under lip?
Everybody mentions it.
Do nice uncomplicated girls turn you on?
I come all unglued.
Are you looking for something?
I just don't want to see Mavis get hurt.
Now who are you?
His name is Philip Marlowe.
Private Detective.
Well, I hope everybody's happy.
Goodbye.
Philip Marlowe.
What can I buy you with? -The money helps.
How much? -Say... $ 100.
$ 100 is money to you? -Make it $200 and I'll retire.
I work for my money.
What am I buying?
I do not think you killed him.
Help to have some reason not to tell the police you were there.
Am I supposed to have killed somebody?
You're going to find this hard to believe, but I came up with the idea that you might need some help.
I figured you went to the room to make a payoff.
You went there alone and took a chance on being recognized.
That made me think you could be in a king-sized jam.
I said a king-sized jam as a cue.
You're good, Ms. Wald...
You could act your way out of a safe deposit box.
Good day.
You're out of work again, Philip.
Car.
Car.
A man with a limited vocabulary you do make your point.
Car.
They tell me there was a disturbance upstairs.
In Miss Wald's apartment.
They tell you wrong.
We were bombing craps.
Where are the pictures?
Who makes your ice picks, Mr. Steelgrave?
Too bad.
Does your mother know what you do for a living...
Mr. Marlowe?
Yes.
What can I do for you?
Good grief! What are you boys up to?
Just renovating, Chuck.
Yes? It's about time.
Come on girls, back to work!
Don't stand looking back to work.
You won't need that.
The word is you are a cool cat.
The word is wrong, I go all to pieces over nothing.
That coat rack has been my family for years.
Would you like it if your coat rack was disassembled?
I've come to make a proposition.
May I reach for my pocket?
It would give me pleasure to do you do something foolish.
For that you can kick the ceiling. -It's yours. -For what?
You are not looking for anybody and can't find anybody.
You do not have time to work for anybody.
You have not heard anything or seen anything.
And what do I for an encore? -Nothing.
Keep on doing nothing for a reasonable time... and I'll come back and place another 500 on your desk.
Side by side.
And for whom am I doing this? -Winslow Wong,...
... that is I.
I like a man who uses good grammar. You impress me.
... Whom sent you?
A man who would rather spill money than blood.
But... also a man who would spill blood if he had no choice.
Take this back to your leader, Mr. Wong.
Tell him you met the last of a dying Dynasty...
... King of the fools.
Unassailably virtuous...
... invariably broke.
Okay.
Come on, everybody. Break it up. Let me in there.
Termites, Lieutenant.
Want to come in, sit down?
We'd better go for a walk.
Why?
Because I say we'd better take a walk. Right?
Well, let's take a walk.
This, uhh?
- Be my guest, Lieutenant.
Alright.
Ever read the Bay City paper?
All that rape and homicide?
There's an article in there about a party named Klausen.
Ice pick case, Marlowe.
That's two in a row. A trend, maybe?
What did you hear from that hotel cop, Hady?
We lack rapport.
Okay, let's get off Hady and concentrate on you.
Hicks was dead when you got there, right?
Well, as we trained detectives say, he was terminal.
So he could hardly have taken one of your visiting cards?
Stop trying to scare me.
-No, tell me about this.
You found my card on Hicks' body? -That's your card isn't it?
Philip Marlowe,
Private Investigator.
We missed it the first time.
I gave him one of my cards to Hady.
We went upstairs while I called you, he searched the body.
You figure that he could have...
... taken the money and put my card on Hicks' body...
... while my back was turned?
Well, it's a possibility.
Would you know Sonny
Steelgrave if you saw him?
Yes, why?
Was he dark, late 30s...
... slick, something for the girls?
Still punching around with that ice pick theory?
Trying to tie Steelgrave into with Klausen and Hicks?
Does he get out in public much? -No, not much.
Where does he go?
-He owns The Dancers.
Steelgrave sometimes takes little chicken broads up there.
Marlowe. -Yes, Mr.
Marlowe, this way.
Mr. Marlowe... -What is this?
Compliments of Mr. Steelgrave.
Thank you.
Friends in high places.
Who is it? He rich?
He is. Even his tax bracket is elevated.
Delicious.
Might say baroque.
To a late breakfast.
-I'll drink to that.
All my friends are going to Lake Tropsure.
I see a trial balloon.
I'll make the coffee.
Mr. Marlowe, phone call please. -Thank you.
Did you tell anyone we were here? -No.
Well, that makes two of us.
It's just a way to get you alone.
I didn't come here for the cherry jubilee.
Okay. But take care of yourself.
Winslow, you suckered me out here, you devil.
Take the money
Marlowe. -Not a chance.
You can't refuse me this time. -You watch me closely.
Can you remember the alternative, Mr. Marlowe?
You're a paper tiger, Winslow.
You can't do anything in your boss's restaurant.
Mr. Marlowe, I have my instructions.
That's what I'm counting on, Winslow.
What are you going to do, break another coat rack?
You're very effective, but I've seen dogs do better on television.
You're light on your feet, Winslow.
Are you just a little gay?
I didn't come to seduce you. -Good...
Can I come in?
I had to walk miles the other night.
All steps in the right direction?
-I've never suspected anybody.
There's someone here.
Coffee?
No thanks, I have a taxi with the meter running.
I've heard from Orrin.
He decided to rejoin the establishment?
-He's staying with a doctor.
Your mother ought to be happy.
A Dr. Vincent Lagardie.
Okay, so he's staying with a Dr. Lagardie.
The mob is after him.
They're are all busy making movies!
Please, we have to go there right now to help.
He's afraid to leave.
After all, I did pay you! -I gave it back.
I offered it to you again.
And a lot more.
You'd never have forgiven me.
You don't know me, but when a man rejects a woman...
... he owes her something.
An old Kansas proverb?
-Philip, I'm frantic!
Philip? -They're going to kill him.
I have the address right here.
-I already have the address.
You have a taxi waiting outside and the meter is running.
Philip, you don't know me.
But then that's your loss.
What was that?
Sort of glad she did that.
I noticed your left jab was a little slow.
She reminded me of somebody. -Don't we all?
Want to have some breakfast?
All I see is two people.
Hardly disastrous to
Miss Wald's reputation.
Nothing for the sponsors or the network to be concerned about.
Then why are you talking to me?
I still enjoy talking to the man in the street.
Then you won't mind if
I show these to Homicide.
Why should they be interested?
I don't think we'll be doing business, Mr. Crowell.
But thanks for taking my call. -Wait a minute.
What might happen if you show those pictures to the police?
I'd have to connect it with something they are working on.
Something that happened a couple nights ago...
... one of the cheap sin spots in town.
The Alvarado Hotel.
I'd connect it up through the girl.
Miss Wald?
Won't talk to me.
That's why I'm talking to you.
She told me about it.
She told me you tried to force her into hiring you...
... on the grounds that she had been close to the murder scene.
Did she say how close?
She didn't say.
What? -The 11:30
Yes, thank you.
You amuse the hell out of me, Marlowe. You really do.
Trying to use me as a shovel to dig yourself out of a jam.
The jam I am in is nothing compared...
... to what the star of your show would be in...
... if I hadn't done the thing that got me into it.
What are you doing in the next hour?
Recounting my trumps.
Well, let's count them together.
We got to where you were thinking of going downtown with those pictures.
What then? -We didn't get that far.
We only got as far as her calling you.
Did she tell you she also called the man in the pictures.
She neglected to mention it.
He and some of his soldiers were waiting outside when I left.
Do you know who he is?
Don't you?
You're making me more unhappy by the minute, Mr. Marlowe.
Hold it back there, please!
I can't do anything until
I get back from London.
You were saying?
Her boy friend tried to buy me first, then bury me.
I resent both overtures.
Where does it stand right now?
You tell me.
She was great, wasn't she?
On the film?
But he must answer. 
Fine.
Why don't you answer the phone? -The show is out there. 
Yes.
- good?
Where are you? 
Well the darling of millions has got herself and the rest of us...
... who put her where she is in one hell of a mess.
If it were any actress it would be bad enough,...
... but in this series?
The part she plays?
Did you ever see the show? -No, I haven't.
It's the top rated sitcom in the country.
A situation comedy.
Can you imagine what would happen if it got out that our poor little Mary...
... was shacking up with public enemy number one?
Everything's set, Mr. Crowell!
You don't really want the cops to have those pictures, do you?
No, Marlowe, that's the last thing I....
Little Mavis Wald. The public would chew her to pieces.
Not to mention the sponsor and network.
The federal gangster's girl.
The number one gangster, no less.
What do you want? -Same thing I wanted from the start.
What she wouldn't give me: the right to work in her best interests.
By suppressing evidence.
If it was evidence. The police can't determine that...
... without smearing. Maybe I can.
They don't have time to worry about reputations.
You do.
Come on. Why are you doing this?
Steelgrave's boys spoiled the coat in my best suit.
Where would I be if I didn't put a stop to things like that?
What is your price?
$ 100 a day and expenses.
And a letter employing me to investigate blackmail of one of your stars. that a man in my spot dreads over all other mistakes.
I will find myself doing business with somebody I can trust. and I'm going to be too damned smart to trust him.
Take this letter to
Mr. Philip Marlowe.
" Dear Mr. Marlowe.
This agency employs you to investigate... on behalf of one its television personalities, a certain matter...
... the particulars of which you have been given verbally.
You fee is to be $ 100 day plus expenses...
... plus a deposit of $ 500.
Sincerely, etc...."
My driver will take you to the office.
I'm just going to have to trust you, Marlowe.
I hate making mistakes.
Alright, lunch everybody. 
40 minutes for the crew. 
time for the rest of you. 
first shot after lunch will be Miss Wald. 
Please be back punctually. 
Who let you in? -Mr Crowell.
I do not want you to work for me.
I go to ridiculous extremes to get clients.
Even collect rare photos.
You like a drink? -No, thank you.
Alright, so you know.
It could happen to any red-blooded girl.
Do you love him? -You mean will I give him up?
Something like that.
Do not know if I could, or that I want to.
Anyway, what good will that do now?
Who took the pictures?
-I don't know.
Who's trying to blackmail you? -I don't know.
Could you be persuaded to give those negatives to me?
Mr. Crowell hired me to decide what's in your best interests.
I know what's in my best interests.
Fold that letter up and forget this job. Go away, Mr. Marlowe.
You can't win them all! -Did
Steelgrave have Hicks killed?
You remember Hicks?
He was stretched out on the bed in the Alvarado hotel.
Sonny did not know there was a picture of us...
... not until you came to my place and I called him.
Leaves the blackmailer, and whoever else is in this with him.
You don't think he will let you off the easy way, do you?
You aren't going to follow my advice? -In one ear and out the other.
What?
You're on, Miss Wald. -Thank you.
Thank you very much for coming by.
You know, Miss
Wald, ... -Excuse me.
You could make life easier for all of us by laying your cards on the table.
Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe.
I'll be in touch.
Yes?
I'll be right there.
Stay with it.
Hello. -Hello, I'm Dr. Lagardie.
How do you do. I'm looking for a Mr. Quest.
Orrin Quest.
Who? -Quest.
" Q " as in quintessential,...
... "U" as in uninhibited,...
... "E" as in extrasensory...
..." S" as in subliminal,...
... and " T" as in Truth.
We chatted on the phone.
About a Mr. Klausen.
Please, come along.
There is no Orrin Quest among our patients.
You don't know him at all?
The name is completely unfamiliar to me.
Sit down. -Thank you.
That's funny. His sister says he was here.
Hiding out.
From what?
You tell me.
I could be wrong, but smelling all that pot smoke in Klausen's place...
... and his calling you,
I jumped to conclusions.
I told you I don't know a Havin
Klausen, or an Orrin Quest.
I think you're wasting your time.
You don't mind if I call you a liar, doctor?
I should I call the police and have them run you out.
But my field is special children. Unusual children.
Sometimes it’s better to let them bang on the walls and scream their heads off.
Until they’re prepared for reason. Scream away, Mr. Marlowe.
A fellow named Klausen and a grifter named Hicks... both killed... by the same man,...
... but not necessarily for the same reason.
Hicks because he muscled in on somebody else’s shtick.
And Klausen because he was a babbling junkie.
Not exactly a master of the zipped lip. Any good so far?
What is all this to do with me?
Question: what was the shtick?
Answer: Some photographs.
A good man could make a fortune...
... out of these particular photographs.
Question: Who took the photographs?
Presumption: Orrin Quest, the boy I'm looking for.
And why this particular subject... without their knowing they were being photographed?
Time to take a flier. Let's say Quest knew the girl...
. . let's even say the girl was his sister.
Pretty well screamed out by now?
Not quite.
These ice pick jobs.
They say the Steelgrave gang was taught the technique by a young intern in Brooklyn.
And it worked...
What happened... to a bright young medic like that?
Did he come west when they did?
Did he come to... open a clinic... for kids... well... to cover illegal activities?
Don't worry, it's not lethal.
I need a little more time.
Not much, just to clear things up.
What's the matter?
-Have you got a band aid?
Ooh, you'd better take that off. -In here?
Oh honey. First aid, rubbing alcohol, band aids...
You should get a tetanus shot. That looks deep.
Where I can find Mavis?
Mavis? -She's not at her place.
And why should I turn you over to her?
Because underneath those pasties there's a size 40 heart.
I thought you liked Mavis.
I do like her but why should she get all the goodies?
She's a star. Give me that.
If you believe that Mavis and
I studied at Lee Strasbourg...
Thank you, nurse. You're wanted in the premmies.
Will you come back tonight?
Am I under oath? -Sure.
Probably not.
They'll be shooting late at the studio.
Very well.
Thank you, Doctor. -My pleasure.
Thank you, nurse.
-Any time. Call me.
Honey, that is a no-no.
Okay, kids, that's fine.
Give me a minute, huh? How long did...
Miss Wald...
Your brother... -Don't you have anything else to do?
He took the pictures of you and Steelgrave, right?
He's dead.
Someone shot him a couple of hours ago.
You're making that up.
I have to tell Orfamay too. You want to come along?
All set, Miss Wald?
Where is Steelgrave tonight?
Don't try to blame him.
I talked to him on the phone more than an hour ago.
. . in his place at Mount Wilson.
That's one thing about Steelgrave.
He's never around when the shooting starts.
Maybe that's because he knows when it will start.
Please Miss Wald.
Orfamay Quest?
Checked out. -To where, did she say?
She asked for a train schedule to Kansas.
If that's any help... -Every little bit helps. Thank you.
Any time.
Are you going to leave without saying goodbye?
After all we've meant to each other? -I told you I leave Saturday.
But it's only Friday.
I ran out of money.
And out of friends.
I'm going home. My train leaves in an hour.
And I can do without your company.
Here, I'll help you. -No, thank you.
Orfamay.
Orfamay!
What do you want?
I thought we could go up to my place and have a drink.
I'll give you a shoulder to cry on. Oh!
Miss!
Miss!
Hot chocolate, please. -Coffee.
I'm sick of this stupid city
It's can be a meat grinder.
How come you're being so nice to me all of a sudden?
I get an attack of the nices every now and then.
You're getting ready to tell me something nasty, isn't it?
Yes.
About Orrin, isn't it?
Yes.
They killed him, didn't they?
Yes.
When? -Tonight at Lagardie clinic.
You could have saved him had you gone there when I told you!
But you had that girl in your place!
You couldn't bother to save a fellow human being.
Not when it might interfere with your animal pleasures!
He was alive when I got there with an ice pick in his hand.
Doesn't that tell you anything?
Are you accusing my brother?
You know about those ice pick murders?
Why shouldn't I, they're all over the papers.
When do the tears start to flow for your long-lost brother?
Officer, I believe this man knows about a murder.
This a joke? -My brother's been killed and he was there.
Is she putting me on? -I was just about to call Homicide.
Oh, you were, were you?
I hope they lock you up forever.
License 643 295.
Okay, Lieutenant, it's all yours. -Alright.
Now you just start to talk.
Let it flow. You know what I mean.
Want me to make a statement?
-Yes, full statement.
A voluntary and without coercion.
Everything you know, alright?
Then ask. If you don't like the answers book me.
And if you book me I get to make a phone call.
Wait. Don't tell me that you've been strictly legal in this... -Case? -Yes
No. -I suppose you have a client to protect?
Maybe. -He did. She dropped...
Ask the questions, please. -What happened at Klausen's place?
I went out there looking for her brother.
His sister told me she got a call from him at the Lagardie clinic...
... and I went out there.
Care to see my back? -Wait a minute.
Why would he try to pick you? You were his pal, come to save him.
I was just something between him and the light. Something that moved.
Maybe he thought I was the person who shot him.
A man in his condition acts from instinct.
He does not invent new techniques.
So I believe Orrin Quest killed both Klausen and Hicks.
What about Lagardie?
You got anything on him?
We checked on him.
He could have killed me and he didn't, so he probably hasn't killed anybody.
But finding an ice pick in his place, made me think of Steelgrave.
That's pretty wild, Marlowe.
That's tenacious, you know.
Would I do myself any good if I went out and tried to tighten it up?
I won't leave town.
Thanks.
I don't want to run this into the ground
One more little favour? -Yes, what?
Orfamay Quest.
Could you arrange to keep her around town for a day or two?
On what grounds?
Well, I don't know...
Tell her you've decided to draw and quarter me and you want her to whip the horses.
She won't be able to pass that up.
Is the party over?
Trying to break a lease, right?
Speak softly, please.
Sorry.
Tough day at the office?
Tough day? An average day in a detective's life.
I've been,... stabbed...... mugged... and generally snookered.
I ache all over.
My office qualifies for urban renewal... the cops... envy my successes, they're trying to take my license away,...
... I'd say that's an average day.
I'm almost afraid to ask why you're here.
I'm almost afraid to tell you.
Mavis?
She tried to call you, couldn't find you, and she got me.
I'll wait a minute.
I think you can service her.
All my clients have troubles.
That's why they come to me.
Why do you bother with them?
Why don't you get out of it?
Stock options.
Pension plan.
What kind of trouble is Mavis in?
I don't know. I was on stage when called.
The message was: get Philip
Marlowe. I need him now.
You do a lot of fetching and carrying for Mavis, don't you?
Why not? We go waaay back.
What are friends for?
Something like that.
The Steelgrave place. -Yes
She's not alone in there.
He's there too.
It's not like Steelgrave to leave the gate unlatched.
Where are all his troops?
Now and then he likes to be alone.
Speaking from experience?
Once upon a time he was mine.
Until Mavis took him.
You know?
I'm great between the lines.
I only suffer. Every winner has to be a loser, right?
Be careful in there.
I'll wait.
No, go on home, Dolores.
Miss Wald...
I got word you tried to call me.
Mavis?
Come on!
Hear, drink it. Come on.
More.
Where's yours?
-Someone has to drive.
You're rather nice for what you are.
Well, it could be the brandy, the altitude, or shock...
... You're stalling for time.
For someone to get here or get away from here.
Where is Steelgrave?
I liked him.
I liked him a lot.
Going to wrap it in a handkerchief?
Where'd you leave him?
Behind that chair.
In the corner.
Well it's been one hell of a day. -What did you expect?
He killed my brother. -Your brother was pushing too hard.
But to kill him?
Did you tell Steelgrave that it was your brother blackmailing you?
Of course I didn't.
Somebody did.
He did not care about those pictures except for your sake.
He was only trying to protect you.
Well, he certainly proved that.
-Yes, he did in his own way.
The same way he came after me when he thought I was pressing.
It will cost a lot to fix this.
I'm not worth it.
Tell me why you had the gun with you.
The gun? -Don't stop to think.
Tell me: did you mean to kill him! -Why not?
I thought I meant something to him. I guess I was vain.
Fool.
Go home, Miss Wald. -What?
Go on home. -You say!
You're my client. Do as you're told.
Go on! Get out! -I'm going, okay?
Homicide, please.
Yes, this baby's been working.
What is the story, Marlowe?
A girl came to my office to tell me that a client of mine was in danger.
Drove me up here, dropped me off and went home.
The girl's name?
Dolores Gonzales. -Your client?
Another party altogether.
-Your client's name?
Not yet, Lieutenant.
Your rules, right?
You here when he got it?
No. -Who was?
He was. -Who else?
I won't lie, I don't know who was here when he got it.
Who was here when you got here?
He was.
Alright, Fred, put the cuffs on this guy.
Behind.
Alright, Marlowe.
Let's go.
If I didn't have enough trouble,
I have to worry about you too.
Do you know how I spend my days?
Turning over dirty underwear.
And my nights?
Spent snooping rotten teeth. -Alright.
I go up a dark stairway after some gun punk with a skin full of horse
Maybe tomorrow I don't get up the stairs.
Or I get a confession from some guy... they swear I beat it out of the bastard.
Nothing I do is right. Never. Not once.
If I make one mistake,...
I'm back in uniform, out in the streets with the hookers yelling at me.
I taking tire chains away from tough kids. But that's not enough...
... I have you. I got to have me a shark with a private license...
... suppressing information.
Concealing evidence, framing set-ups that wouldn't fool a baby. impossible to believe.
You wouldn't mind if I call you a cheap double-crossing keyhole peeper!
You want me to mind? -I'd love it.
I'd love it. -Okay, then I mind.
Your license is dead as of now!
-When the commissioner says it's dead!
Let's get one thing straight!
-I'm doing this my way!
I'm waiting for this bird to crack wise. He hasn't cracked wise yet.
The price of practice!
Not as fast. -Come on...
Not so good tonight are you lieutenant? -Shut the hell up!
Lieutenant, calm down. -I don't need any excuse...
I'll take care of this comedian.
The new type of third degree. The police beat the hell out of each other...
... the suspect cracks up from the agony of watching.
It never fails.
You knew I hit, Fred.
-Nobody hit me, Christy.
Nobody I can remember, Fred...
Tell this character to get out of here. He's on short rope.
Tell him to get his ass home. Directly home!
Tell him I'll be in touch with him. Very close touch.
Get out of here, baby. Get out now.
-How? I don't have transportation.
Try hitchhiking and don't press your luck.
What?
Who do you suppose will clean up this mess?
Where are they?
-Looking for something?
You know what I'm looking for. -The pictures.
Now that your brother is dead...
Grab the pictures and blackmail your own sister.
Well I burned the pictures and negatives, and they made a lovely flame.
You what?
Give me your purse, little sister.
-Get away from me! Drops it, Mavis!
Don't come any closer to me.
It's my purse!
It's mine, Mavis!
It's mine!
It's mine!
It's mine! -Sonny gave you that money, didn't he?
I don't know any Sonny.
The smell of lilacs in his place that night was a little girl smell.
You went up there to tell where Orrin was hiding.
How much did he pay you to tell?
About an even $ 1.000.
Well, it was Orrin's own fault.
He took the pictures of you with that gangster.
And he promised me some of the money.
And I didn't hear from him any more. So I came to find him.
Sister, you got our brother killed! -Mavis, that's not true.
I warned Orrin.
I said that if you don't take care of me
I'll tell Mr.
Steelgrave where you are.
He said he had lost the pictures.
And I didn't believe him.
So I took a taxi and went to see Mr. Steelgrave.
You know how expensive that is?
Then I talked to Philip to go by the clinic and protect Orrin...
... even though he didn't deserve it!
It's not my fault your boys got there before Philip!
He was our brother?
-Don't you go blaming me!
You had no business going off and leaving us!
Orfamay, when did I forget about you or Mom?
Or even poor Orrin?
And I always came to see you whenever...
Oh, sure...
Always ask and no guilt feelings... pardoned now!
I tried to take the blame for you after you shot Sonny.
After I what? -I kept the gun in my apartment...
... and after you came to see me it was gone.
Well I didn't take it.
I hope your mother will be very happy.
Anyway, Who can prove it?
What can prove it? You?
Who are you? -Nobody.
That's right a nobody! A cheap nobody!
I said it first.
$ 50 means bye to you.
You! You!
You! Get away from me!
I hate you, Mavis!
I hate you!
Come on... -Let go of me!
Now stay there!
Kansas is due east.
Come here.
I tried to make things better for her.
I used to tell her how pretty she was.
You really thought that your little sister killed Steelgrave?
So you went out on stage and played the big guilty.
Trying to cover for her.
Those little 32s kick out a lot of graphite.
Last night your hand was a pure snow white.
But if Orfamay didn't kill him, then who did?
Forget it, Mavis, forget it.
You've got plenty of time.
You've got old bullfighters to meet, jets to fly...
Magazine covers to pose for...
Do it, make it work for you.
Thank you very much, Philip Marlowe.
Reservations. No, she's not here today.
Hi, Joe. Dolores is expecting me. -Go right in.
Our night? -All ours.
There's one piece still missing. Lagardie.
It would help if he used to be your husband.
Back in Brooklyn, a young doctor with the mob, a wife like you, a man like Steelgrave?
It makes a tidy package. -The streets are paved with forgotten husbands.
You must have loved him a lot.
-My husband? -Steelgrave.
It had to be someone who knew both Steelgrave and Mavis.
Who could come and go in her apartment as they pleased.
Who had access to the gun Steelgrave gave her.
It comes up you.
Like I said, Mavis is a nice girl, but why should she get hold of him?
You went to a lot of trouble.
And there is nothing you can do about it. Is there?
... unless you want to destroy her.
And you wouldn't do that, would you?
You'd dream of those great big eyes of hers!
Police department, please.
Police department.
Sergeant Parrish. 
Hello, hello.
Don't you point that beastly thing at me, you little lout! Don't you dare!
Blimey!
- Are you all right, Mrs. Dunhill?
- Of course I'm all right.
That wasn't that little monster's cap pistol.
That was a real shot from number 33.
A .38 caliber revolver, I think.
It might have been a backfire.
All the game I've bagged? Don't tell me what's a shot and what isn't a shot.
Did I hear a shot?
You certainly did.
Somebody run around to the mews.
Good morning. We've come to inquire about the flat to let advertised in the Times.
Could you tell me?
It didn't say how many bedrooms... What?
Dear, I'm so sorry.
We must have made a mistake.
Must have read the wrong bell,
I mean, the wrong advertisement.
- That'll do, Claude.
- Sorry to have bothered you.
Silly mistake. Sorry.
Agatha!
- Good afternoon, young man.
- Good afternoon.
- Come about the flat to let, I suppose.
- Yes, I have.
I hope you take it, young man. Things have been too dull around Gray Square of late.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
She's been a fascinating neighbor.
She should make a most interesting landlady, don't you think?
Most interesting, Mrs. Dunhill.
- Yes, sir. What can I do for you?
- Hello.
My name is Gridley.
I've come to see about the apartment... Flat.
Are you a Yank?
Well, yes, but some of us are very nice.
Could I see the flat, please?
You are a couple, aren't you?
I mean, you have a missus.
Well, no, there's no missus. Just me.
Sorry, sir. I know my mistress' mind.
She wants a couple.
- Well, hey, where is your mistress?
- There's no one at home, sir.
Well, you're home. What about you?
- Who, me?
- Yeah.
I'm just the parlor maid.
I see. Well, couldn't you show me the flat?
You wouldn't be what she'd want.
Well, now the ad states that it's a couple preferred. That indicates an open mind.
- I hate people whose minds...
- Come on, now. Be a sport and beat it.
Well, please, this is an ideal location for me.
Would you just ask your mistress to call me at the American Embassy?
I'm with the Foreign Service.
I've just been assigned here.
- What's her name?
- Whose name?
The mistress of the house.
- Her name?
- Yes.
Well, it's... Mrs. Hardwicke.
- Is it or isn't it?
- It's Hardwicke.
Mrs. Miles Hardwicke.
- Ardwicke with an "A"?
- You don't know the name?
No. Well, I mean, I'm new here.
I'm sorry if I should, but I don't.
It's Hardwicke with an "H."
Right. Look, even though this Mrs. Hardwicke with an...
Even though she's against single men, couldn't I just sneak a look at the flat?
I mean, if I like it well enough
I might even get married.
- American Embassy, eh?
- That's right.
Well, perhaps it would be all right to just look.
Good girl.
But don't get your hopes up.
She won't let you have it.
Isn't this very nice? Hey, immaculate.
I guess that's thanks to you.
Mrs. Hardwicke's very lucky to have you.
- Anybody'd be lucky to have you.
- The flat's one flight up.
- Yes.
- This way, if you please, sir.
I can tell you in advance I'm going to be just crazy about this flat.
What's this prejudice that your mistress has against single men?
Well, the neighborhood's full of neighbors, and neighbors are full of curiosity, and, after all, I do...
She does live here alone.
Well, believe me, I'd do nothing to harm her reputation as long as you're around.
You are a one, sir. You Yanks, you come right out with it, don't you?
- Well, most of it, anyway.
- These here's the digs.
I'm sure that taking care of a house this size puts you under a great strain.
- It's nip and tuck, sir.
- Is it really?
- Sometimes.
- Well, of course. Look at your cheeks.
They're all flushed. Well, tell me, does
Mrs. Hardwicke... You're sure she's out?
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah. Well, does she... What's your name?
- Hilda.
- Well, Hilda, does she work you too hard?
Now, that could be it, you know.
Now, those cheeks are definitely flushed.
That's the first sign.
I thought you wanted to take a look at the flat.
Yes. I knew it. I love it.
You know, I frighten myself sometimes, my instincts are so uncanny.
In there is the bedroom.
Yeah, that certainly is, isn't it?
Is she, your employer, due back soon?
- Any blooming minute now.
- Tell me, Hilda, do you sleep in?
- In and out, off and on.
- Catch as catch can.
You might call it that, sir.
Now that you've seen the flat...
Let's get down to brass tacks, shall we, Hilda?
Why don't you put in a good word for me, with this poor, frightened creature that you work for?
What rent is the old bag asking?
The old bag's asking £40 a month.
Well, that's not unreasonable.
- Mr. Gridley...
- Yes, Mrs. Hardwicke?
I...
I couldn't let you have it under any circumstances.
Where are you from?
- Chicago.
- Now, how about that?
The breach between us, never very wide, narrows.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't possibly let you have the flat.
It just wouldn't work out at all.
It'll work beautifully for both of us,
Mrs. Hardwicke.
Mr. Gridley, I clearly stipulated in my ad that...
I know, I know... I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll marry your adorable maid Hilda and we'll move in here as a couple, huh?
You're not very discriminating.
- Maid or mistress, it's all the same to you.
- Well, I'm a Democrat from New England.
I have no prejudices.
Now, why the maid act?
Well, it seemed as good a way as any to check on prospective tenants without committing myself.
Well, after all, I do live here alone now.
To put it plainly, Mr. Gridley,
I've a dubious reputation.
You do? I'll pay you £45 a month.
Not that kind of dubious.
Of course not.
Look, what's wrong with a man?
Very useful around the house, they tell me.
I mean, he fixes washers and he keep burglars away from the house.
- A man has endless possibilities...
- I'm sorry.
I'll pay you £50 a month.
- I'm sure you'd make an ideal tenant.
- Yeah.
- And I could use the money. But...
- Good.
Let's look at it another way.
We are both displaced persons, right?
But I don't have a place.
Look, Mrs. Hardwicke, I appeal to you as a fellow American.
Don't I appeal to you?
It's your funeral. I might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.
Yeah. Well, Mrs. H., you've made a wise decision.
- I hope so.
- I'll drop by the bank and pick up some pounds.
The first and last month, I guess?
Yes, I suppose so.
I'll have my bags sent over this afternoon.
I've got to check in at the embassy and I'll be back...
How about meals?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gridley,
I couldn't possibly provide you with...
I don't mean you provide. I'll provide.
Starting with dinner tonight. Are you free?
- Well, yes, I'm free, but...
- Good, you're no longer free.
I'll see you about 6:00.
Ask Hilda to get the ice out, please.
Good afternoon, sir. This is Mr. Gridley.
Yes, Gridley.
I've been expecting you. Come in.
Thank you, sir.
I've studied your record, Gridley.
So far, so good.
- Glad to have you with us.
- Thank you, sir.
- I understand you've been in Saudi Arabia.
- Yes.
I was there myself once.
Quite a stimulating two weeks.
Thank you.
Well, I was there for two years, sir, and time changes your point of view.
We go where we can serve, not necessarily where we can amuse ourselves.
- I wasn't complaining, sir.
- Of course not.
Have you found a place to stay?
Yes, sir. I've already rented a flat...
I mean, an apartment.
That's all right.
You can get as colloquial as you like.
The British will feel you're keeping your ears open.
Right-o.
Yeah. Now, about this flat. You're in a respectable neighborhood, I trust.
- Mayfair. Gray Square?
- Splendid. Splendid.
The chief is a stickler for proper conduct all the way down the line.
Stay on top of your job here, keep your personal life tidy, and I can assure you a happy stay in London.
Yes, sir.
- Yes?
- Lady Fallott calling, sir.
Put her on.
Lady Fallott. Very influential.
She can also bore the pants off you.
You're going to be seeing quite a bit of her, you might as well get some idea.
Lady Fallott, how nice of you to call.
Mr. Ambruster, I'm calling in reference to an American program
which appeared on television last evening and caused me no end of concern.
May I ask which program it was?
A western affair called The Gun Toter.
I was appalled at the shocking degree of violence.
I saw five murders, a double hanging, three pistol whippings
and a United States deputy marshal nibbled to death on an anthill.
Well, I grant you, that's a lot.
But don't forget, it is an hour show.
We have a new man with us, Lady Fallott.
Mr. William Gridley.
He's Mr. Collins' replacement.
I'll put him on to the matter immediately.
I trust he'll prove more reliable than Mr. Collins.
- He's one of our very best young men.
- Very well.
- Goodbye, Mr. Ambruster.
- Goodbye, Lady Fallott.
- Get the picture?
- I take it she didn't get along with Collins.
You've got your work cut out for you with her, Gridley.
Of course, you'll have plenty of other duties, too, which I'll have to go into with you at length.
- Yes, sir.
- What are your dinner plans?
- Well, I think I have a date, sir.
- So soon?
- You've still got desert sand in your shoes.
- Yeah. With my landlady.
Really?
I have yet to meet the landlady one invites out to dinner.
Well, she's an American. She's...
Well, may I speak off the record, sir?
- You may.
- Well, I would say confidentially that she's about 36-23-36.
That would sound good, even on the record.
She's single, I take it. Well?
Well, there's a Mrs. In front of her name, but there's no husband in evidence.
- Separated?
- Well, I guess so, sir.
Otherwise, why would she rent me half her house?
Her husband might be away on a business trip abroad, in which case he could drop in any time.
Jet planes, you know.
He could be in Afghanistan for breakfast and you could be in the middle of a scandal by lunch.
No, no. I don't think that, sir.
No, Mrs. Hardwicke acted as though he were pretty much out of her life.
You'd better make sure.
Did you say Hardwicke?
Yes, sir. You know her?
No, I don't think so.
It just seems to ring a bell.
It's just... Well, anyway, just remember what I said.
Keep your off hours tidy, and I don't think it would do a bit of harm to find out exactly what the story is regarding her husband.
- Right, sir.
- That'll be all for now.
Right.
I'd like you to look this over tonight, if you will, please.
It's a report Collins was working on when he went to pieces on us.
Be prepared to give us a report on the report in the morning.
Bye, sir.
- Hello? Research?
- Yes, sir.
Ambruster speaking.
I'm trying to track down an elusive thought.
Does the name Mrs. Hardwicke of Gray Square mean anything to you?
Does it? I should say it does.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look radiant.
- Do I?
- You do.
You're just trying to make Hilda jealous.
You wait a minute.
My aunt and I here were wondering if you'd be interested in some flowers.
You Yanks!
They're all so lovely.
What do you think I'd like?
Well, now it occurs to me,
I haven't seen flowers in two years.
- I think we'll take 'em all.
- The lot, sir?
- The whole lot.
- Bless you, sir.
- Say, how much are these?
- Thank you, sir.
You're a lucky woman, ma'am, to have such a thoughtful husband.
- He's not my husband.
- No, we just live together.
Well, thank you, sir.
That was very thoughtful of you, buying all her flowers.
Well, it's selfish, really.
I was just trying to impress my date.
Your date?
Well, yeah, we do...
I guess I didn't give you much chance to say no, did I?
No, you didn't. But I could've.
I see Hilda got the ice out, huh?
And I've given her the night off.
Well, good. Three's a crowd anyway.
What do you say we have our first drink up in my remarkable new flat?
Jolly good idea.
Especially since you've got the only bottle of Scotch.
Found it when I was unpacking your things.
- They do that in England, you know.
- Do they now?
I hope you find everything.
I just put things where I thought you'd think they ought to be.
Well, thank you.
Now, if you want to change for dinner,
I'll fix you that drink.
First, I'd like to talk to you about signing a 100-year lease.
Fine with me, if you pay in advance.
Do you always drink Scotch?
Well, in Saudi Arabia you have a choice, drinking Scotch or drilling for oil.
If I hadn't been transferred, I was thinking of getting up a syndicate to drill for Scotch.
- Just a little water with mine, please?
- Okay.
That's not your closet. It's locked.
Yeah.
Your things are in the bedroom closet.
Sure, fine. Thank you.
I won't be long.
Well, how about that?
You know, you pack as many times as I have, you get to be a real pro.
Look at this coat. Not a wrinkle in it.
Not one...
- You pressed it.
- It was all wrinkled.
Do I have to go on calling you Mrs. Hardwicke?
- Nope. My first name is Carlye.
- Carlye?
Carlye Hardwicke. That's odd.
I don't think I've ever known a girl with the first name of Carlye before.
Carlye Hardwicke. I approve.
That's a very pretty name.
- Thank you.
- I've a pretty first name, too. Bill.
Kind of exotic, isn't it?
Do you think you could learn to master that monosyllable?
Well, there's always the Berlitz school.
Let me see. I've got quite a choice.
Hilda, Carlye...
But right now, I prefer to get back to Mrs. Hardwicke.
Why?
Well, can I ask you a direct question?
What?
Where's your husband?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Well, believe me, if I was your husband, you'd know where I was every minute.
- Would I?
- You're darn right you would.
- And I'd know where you were every minute.
- Would you?
- Darn right I would.
- Wouldn't you give me any privacy at all?
Practically none.
You divorced?
No.
Separated?
Very much so.
Well, I don't want to seem too eager, but are you, by any chance, a widow?
I really couldn't say.
Here, I hope I did this right.
Well, is it possible for you to do anything wrong?
Why don't we wait and see? I'll change.
She's just gone off with your Mr. Gridley, sir.
He is one of your State Department lads,
I believe.
- And who, may I ask, are you?
- Dillings, sir. Scotland Yard.
Scotland Yard? Yes, of course.
Well, this is terrible.
He just started work today.
Well, let's hope he shows up tomorrow.
Good evening, sir.
Charles, table one.
Dressed to kill, isn't she?
Devilishly attractive, I'd say.
Really, Clyde!
And, let's see, after Bangkok,
I spent six months in Marrakesh, and then Saudi Arabia.
And this transfer to London was the biggest break of my career.
That is, before I met you.
Bill, what will your duties be at the embassy?
I'll probably spend most of my time getting reservations on ships and planes for VIPs and arranging visas, and I'll be checking tariff schedules on fascinating things like hemp, tennis balls.
And then I'll just move on to become Secretary of State.
I figure I'm too old to be President.
Well, I'd better hang on to your bed.
Someday I can say,
"William Gridley slept here."
Yeah. Right now you could put my importance in a teaspoon.
I wonder, somewhere along the line,
I likely shed about two bits worth of light on how we feel about other countries, you know?
Good.
I mean, it sounds corny, but my job means more to me than just a career.
And you've chosen the right career,
Mr. Gridley.
You're bound to be a very successful diplomat.
Well, behind every man's success there is a woman like you, if the man is lucky.
And what do you know about me?
Maybe I could ruin you.
Well, I'm willing to make allowances.
After all, compromise is the cornerstone of diplomacy.
Now, tell me, what about you is so dangerous?
Nothing tonight.
Carlye.
How did you wind up in London?
I came to Europe on a tour.
One of those all-expense deals.
It had been a dream of mine ever since I heard my first foreign accent.
We had a ball everywhere.
Rome, Madrid, Paris.
And then we came to London.
Yeah, and what happened?
Well, then the tour was ended and I was just about ready to go home, when...
Miles Hardwicke.
How did you know his name?
Well, you mentioned it at the door, you remember?
- Dance with me, Bill.
- Sure.
You will excuse us, won't you?
- I like dancing with you.
- I like dancing with you.
You didn't learn to mambo like this in Saudi Arabia.
No. South America. Student riot.
Well, you had to move something, or everything was over.
- Would you care for a drink, sir?
- Tonic water, please.
I hope we can get a taxi.
Will you look at this fog?
You'll get used to it.
Are you sure this country isn't on fire somewhere?
- Good evening, Mrs. Hardwicke.
- Good evening.
I wonder if I might speak to you a moment regarding that little matter.
Well...
Yes, yes, certainly.
Excuse me a minute, please.
Yeah, sure.
Sorry, sir.
I'm sorry, Bill. It was business.
It's all right. It's none of my business.
- Why don't we walk?
- Yeah, yeah.
Where...
Hemp.
Hello?
What was that for?
I just wanted to make sure that somebody hadn't dropped in unexpectedly.
- I'm not expecting anyone.
- That's good.
Certainly is convenient, isn't it, living in the same house?
I mean, it saves cab fare and all that.
Well, here you are, delivered safely.
You're dropping me at my door?
Well, how are you going to get home?
- Well, I'll feel my way.
- No, no. No.
Carlye, I couldn't possibly let you go home alone.
Why, if anything were to happen to you, I'd never forgive myself.
You're right.
Well?
Well...
How about tomorrow night?
Dinner, maybe a show?
Why don't you wait and see what happens tomorrow?
- See how you feel.
- I know how I'll feel.
Do you?
Carlye, don't be a dream I'm having, huh?
Don't just disappear in the night.
Thank you.
The rent.
And thank you.
For suddenly I saw you there
Oh, no.
Carlye!
Bill! It's you.
- I'm sorry.
- You frightened me.
Well, I heard the organ.
I'm sorry I disturbed you.
No, not at all. I'm sorry I disturbed you.
- I just didn't know that you played.
- Yes.
Please.
Gee, I used to play a little drums when I was in college.
Maybe sometime we could...
- You do this very often at night?
- No, not often.
I wouldn't mind. I love organ music.
To me there's something about the tone that's almost like the sound of eternity.
Yeah.
Do you know My Funny Valentine?
I'd better go upstairs now, Bill.
I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
I'm sorry I woke you.
- Yes?
- Mr. Gridley is here, sir.
Tell him to wait a minute, please.
People tend to freeze when Scotland Yard's around.
I'd like to size up your man without being observed, if you don't mind, sir.
- Go into the conference room, Inspector.
- Right.
- I'll turn on the intercom.
- Right.
Just push down the third key.
You'll hear everything that's said.
Third key. Right-o.
- Sir?
- What? Well, bring them along, lad.
Send Gridley in, please.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Gridley.
I've been looking over Collins' report.
Tell me, Gridley, how's the food at the Lamplighter these days?
Excellent. What?
You had dinner with Mrs. Hardwicke, danced, had two bottles of champagne, left the club at 11:42 and walked all the way home.
Well, that's quite a thorough report.
Look, if I'm considered some kind of a security risk...
- Sit down, please, Gridley.
- Yes, sir.
May I ask, just how did you happen to pick number 33 Gray Square as your residence?
I answered Carlye's... Mrs. Hardwicke's ad in the paper.
Mrs. Hardwicke seems to have a penchant for getting into the papers.
Look, I don't understand, sir.
Tell me, what sort of woman do you find her?
And you can speak off the record, if you like.
Well, this is for the record, sir.
I find her an absolutely heavenly woman.
Were you able to find out anything about Mr. Hardwicke?
Yes, sir. They're separated.
- She told you that?
- Yes, sir.
In my opinion, a divorce is imminent.
- She's going to divorce him?
- Yes, sir.
Don't you think that would be adding insult to injury?
How's that?
Gridley, Mrs. Hardwicke murdered her husband.
Well, that's certainly grounds for...
She what?
I said that absolutely heavenly woman killed her husband.
A sort of permanent trial separation.
That's impossible.
Mrs. Hardwicke has slipped lately, getting into the want ads.
Six months ago she made the front pages daily.
- Well, why isn't she under arrest?
- Because they haven't found the body.
- No case.
- There's no court case, yet.
But as soon as they can locate
Mr. Hardwicke's remains,
Mrs. Hardwicke has a date with the hangman.
- But she didn't do it.
- You don't know the case.
- I know Carlye Hardwicke.
- After one day?
After one minute.
And I'm going to know this case.
I'm going to know every single thing about it, and I'm going to prove she didn't do it.
This young man could be useful to us, Sergeant.
- Thinking she's innocent, sir?
- Yeah, all to our advantage.
Has she ever done anything since you've known her that might cast the least bit of suspicion on her?
Absolutely not. She's just been kind and generous and warm.
- That's beside the point.
- Look, sir, if you knew her as I do, you'd know she's not capable of...
Then why did she lie to you about her husband?
Why? Because.
I don't know why.
But if she did, there must have been a reason.
Maybe she's been assuming the guilt to protect somebody else.
We thought of that. The question is who?
I don't know who. But it is a possibility.
- True.
- You see. Are we on the air?
This is Inspector Oliphant of Scotland Yard.
Well, I wasn't aware that the police were listening.
Now, now, now.
I'm sorry about that, but we had to check you out.
I'm delighted to have your help on the case.
Help! I don't intend to help you on this case.
Cooperation, Gridley.
You're a guest of the United Kingdom.
That's true, but I'm not a police spy.
Now, now, now, Mr. Gridley, let me put it this way.
Assuming Mrs. Hardwicke was not guilty, there would be no problem, provided we knew all the facts.
Therefore, every shred of evidence
I can gather is important to her.
Even something that seems damning fitted into the overall picture might be just the clue to prove her innocence.
I see.
You want me to snoop around and report everything that I find to you, huh?
If you want to help her, yes.
You work on the inside,
I'll work on the outside.
We'll make a good team.
Team! You want to prove she did it,
I want to prove she didn't.
No, no, no. You see, you don't know Scotland Yard very well.
We consider it a higher duty to protect the innocent than to convict the guilty.
- You do?
- Yes, of course.
But it is essential to provide solid evidence to prove her innocence.
You're basing your opinion of Mrs. Hardwicke purely on the superficial aspects of the woman.
Mr. Gridley, do you ever hear of Angela Crowley?
Angela Crowley? No, I don't think...
Well, there you are, see?
There you are, you see?
As beautiful as Mrs. Hardwicke, I dare say.
She slept in a coffin, Angela did, and sent a goodly number of men to theirs with cruel dispatch.
She was an excellent cook, using the finest of spices and the rarest of poisons.
Now, I believe that it was a tribute to Angela's talents that one of her victims, after eating a poisoned kidney pie, asked for seconds.
It was the second one that did him in.
Would you say that it was interesting that a few weeks ago,
Mrs. Hardwicke tried to collect on her husband's life insurance?
It was pointed out to her, of course, by the insurance people, that they'd need proof of Mr. Hardwicke's death before they could honor the policy.
She probably needed the money.
True. True.
What makes her so sure that she could already collect on his life, eh?
- Did you know they fought a great deal?
- Well, every...
Every married couple quarrels.
Yes, I know that.
But their exchanges reached such heights of intensity that the police had to be summoned on three separate occasions.
It means nothing. It's...
There are two main causes of marital squabbling, financial affairs and extramarital affairs.
Now, Mrs. Hardwicke is undeniably attractive.
She might have had a lover.
Furtive meetings with another man who could have easily gone from paramour to murder accomplice.
Murder... Look, Inspector,
Carlye Hardwicke is a decent and gentle...
Gentle? You see?
Now then, Molly Pasco was gentle.
She couldn't bear the thought of hurting her husband with a divorce, so Molly and her lover sealed up Mr. Pasco alive behind a new brick wall.
Two weeks later she murdered her lover and ran off with the brick salesman.
Well, I hate a fickle killer, don't you?
- Be serious, Gridley.
- I am being serious.
I fail to see, sir, what these lethal ladies have to do with Carlye Hardwicke.
I am merely illustrating for you the homicidal tendencies of the fair sex.
Females make not only loving wives and devoted mothers, but very efficient killers, bless them.
I find this strange talk, coming from a man who says that he is interested in proving Mrs. Hardwicke's innocence.
- Come here. Come here.
- What?
You give me your help and you'll find that
I'm just as anxious to prove it as you are.
You've got my word on that.
- Yeah, well, I'll think about that.
- Gridley!
- Well, all right. I'll take your word.
- Good. Good. Good.
Now, here's my card, with my home number.
Just ring me any time of night or day.
Gridley, you must remember that you're living in a diplomatic goldfish bowl.
Your relationship with this woman must not leak out.
I must ask you not to be seen in public with her at any time whatsoever.
Now, here.
Take these clippings, go to your office and study... No, don't use your office.
Go somewhere else. Read them in the park.
- Take the rest of the day off.
- Yes, sir.
Just a minute, Mr. Gridley.
Two things, if I may.
For as long as you can, try not to let Mrs. Hardwicke know that you're aware of her situation.
Just try to catch her off-guard.
Well, I mean, you know there are ways of getting women to reveal their innermost secrets.
I mean, the more familiar you are with her, the better the chances are of getting her to the moment of truth.
What are you getting at?
Well, what's coming through?
You want me to be a male Mata Hari?
Look, I'm a member of the State Department, not the vice squad.
It's the method that counts.
If you get her to confess she's guilty, you'll have performed a great service for your country.
Somehow I can't believe
America wants me to do this.
If you foul up, Gridley,
I'll have you back in the Sahara so fast, you'll think London was only a mirage.
In other words, if she knows I know, I go.
That's exactly right. And I hope you haven't taken to talking in rhyme.
And do keep a sharp lookout for your own personal safety.
I mean, whoever killed Mr. Hardwicke might easily strike again, you know.
I'll check all my kidney pies for poison.
Odd you should mention that.
Mrs. Hardwicke purchased a large quantity of arsenic early this morning.
My mother says you're next.
Carlye!
Hello? Yes, I got your message.
Well, you know I hate to, but I'm afraid there's no other way out.
Well, I'd rather not do it tonight.
Yes, the man you saw me with last night.
Well, you're probably right, of course. I...
It's best to just do it and get it over with.
I'd say about 160 pounds.
The problem is getting it out of the house.
You'd better send two men.
All right. Bye.
Hi. Anybody home?
Hi?
I didn't expect you so early.
I guess you didn't. I mean, neither did I.
How did it go today?
Anything special happen?
Special?
I mean, out of the way or unusual?
No, nothing. It's been pretty dull, so far.
How about you? Anything unusual happen?
Well, yes, as a matter of fact, very.
I paid all my bills, thanks to you.
And I'm going to provide you with dinner tonight, Mr. Gridley.
And you can just take it easy and relax.
Great. Let's fix it together.
I'm pretty handy around a kitchen.
No, you don't. I'm a temperamental cook.
I can't stand anyone peering over my shoulder.
Now you get out of that ambassador's uniform, go on.
- I've got work to do.
- Okay.
Carlye?
If it's all right with you, I really don't feel like anything with sauces or gravy tonight.
Couldn't we just have something basic?
What's the matter? Afraid of my cooking?
No. No, nothing like that.
I just got a queasy stomach tonight.
Bill, are you sure there's nothing on your mind?
No, no. Honestly. No. It's just, nerves.
You know, first day at the office and all.
Good. Now will you please go up and get comfortable?
And while you're changing I'll make a drink.
Hurry up, now.
I've got a surprise for you.
- Carlye?
- Out here, Bill.
Ready for your surprise?
- Do you notice anything?
- Not yet.
- Well, look.
- A barbecue.
- Is that the surprise?
- Well, it's part of it.
Well, did you get that just for me?
Well, now, I've had it a long time, just never used it.
Why?
Well, Miles never cared for American food.
He never liked anything but Brussels sprouts, kippers or kidney pie.
Basic enough for you?
- Steaks. Perfect.
- Good.
Now, I'm not sure just how to get the charcoal going.
Well, you use some kind of lighting fluid.
I think I can find something.
Drink your drink. It'll pick you up.
My father says so, too.
I think I found something.
I don't know what it's for but it says "highly flammable."
Yeah? Well... A barbecue.
It's nifty. I didn't know you used these much over here.
They don't very much.
I had to chase all over London for it.
Look at the label. "Made in California."
- You haven't even touched your drink.
- No, I haven't, have I?
Here's to living every moment to its fullest, as if it's our last.
Too strong?
Sure?
Bill?
Is there something wrong?
Bill, are you sure? What's the matter?
Nothing.
Nothing. There's nothing in it. Nothing to it.
I mean, it... No, it's great. It's...
- Let me fix it.
- No, no, please. No, it's...
It's wonderful. It's just... You...
- Look, let's get the fire started.
- Right.
Maybe they think we're burning state secrets.
Or little witches.
Bill! The awning.
Well, the hose. Where's...
Turn on...
Get back!
Untangle that thing.
Will one of you people please call the fire department?
All right, clear the way. Come on, step down. Let the firemen in. All right.
All right, step back there, clear the way now. Let the firemen in.
Thank heaven you got here.
That'll do. Right-o, you blokes. Pack up.
It's all yours.
- Gangway here, please. Thank you.
- All right then, who lit the fire?
I did.
Well, sir, I'll have to have the particulars for my report.
Now, Officer, is this really necessary?
- May I see some sort of identification?
- What?
May I see some sort...
Some sort of identification.
Yes, sure.
Diplomatic passport.
- Mr. William Gridley.
- That's me.
United States Embassy. Terribly sorry, sir.
There'll be no need for a report, of course.
- Of course.
- I'll simply have a word with the Sergeant.
Yeah, well, give him my best.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
It's all right. I understand.
It's your duty and all of that.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Good night, sir.
- Good night.
Well, all things considered,
I'd say dinner was a roaring success.
It was a mess! I'm sorry, Bill. I...
I was so looking forward to having a quiet and pleasant evening alone with you.
Dinner and all, and then later, I...
Well, later, I planned on doing something that I wanted to do since the moment you set foot in this house.
- Really?
- Now it's all spoiled.
- No, not necessarily.
- Yes, it is.
With the police coming and all, Bill.
Men in public office, they can't afford to be involved in a scandal.
Well, they can if the scandal looks like you.
You're not listening to me.
You see, if your name should ever be linked with mine, it would just...
If you're worried about the policeman, forget it.
It's all taken care of. Diplomatic immunity.
You know, it saves you from everything, from parking tickets to murder.
I'll get it.
Hello?
- It's for you, Bill.
- Me?
Hello? Mr. Ambruster.
Gridley, I want to see you right away.
Even sooner would be better.
Right... Well, isn't that a little...
Isn't that a little irregular?
Highly irregular.
But then nothing's really been regular since you folded your tent and dropped in on us, has it?
No, sir.
Gridley, I want you to meet me at the Lion's Head Pub in Chelsea.
The embassy?
What are you talking about?
I said the Lion's Head Pub in Chelsea.
Did you say "the embassy" because she's standing there?
Yes, sir. I didn't want to repeat the address in front of her.
Well, if she's standing there, why are you saying that?
- She's not standing here.
- Then why are you whispering?
Never mind, Gridley.
I think I'm beginning to see how your mind works and it frightens me.
I'm leaving right now.
And I expect you to do the same.
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- I beg your pardon.
- Whatever for?
Yes.
- There you are, sir.
- Gridley.
Yes, sir.
When I instructed you to keep your presence in Mrs. Hardwicke's house absolutely secret, did you feel that you could best carry out that order by trying to set fire to London, coming within inches of being arrested and having the whole story appear in the papers?
- What do you mean, appear in...
- What are you drinking, love?
What you drinking?
- Scotch and water.
- With ice, of course.
Yeah... No, no ice. No, forget the water.
In the papers?
There were newspapermen present when the policeman made out his report.
They did some additional checking with your landlady's neighbors and gleefully pounded out the news that Mrs. Hardwicke is living with a man.
Not just an ordinary man, mind you, but a Mr. William Gridley,
US State Department man, and part-time firebug.
Well, look, I apologize, sir.
But this was not Carlye's fault.
Stop worrying about Mrs. Bluebeard.
The story won't appear.
What?
Inspector Oliphant informed me of what was happening and I was able to kill it before it ever hit print.
- You killed the story in the...
- I'll have the same, please.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you. How did you do it?
How? Gridley, I have held my position here in London for some years now.
And I'm proud to say that during that time
I have been able to build up enough influence, so that when the occasion arises, a few simple phone calls from me
- to the right people and all is well again.
- Yes, sir.
Gridley, if that story had appeared, you would have been in very deep trouble, both here and in Washington.
And when one of my people is in trouble,
I am in trouble.
I want you to know that I have no intention of watching you go down the drain and using my career as a raft.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Mr. Gridley is waiting and the Russian Embassy called to...
Never mind about the Russians.
Mr. Gridley has become much more of a menace.
Morning, sir.
- Have you seen this?
- Yes, sir.
Then tell me one good thing about this morning, except that it's your last one in London.
My last one... Now wait a minute, please.
Sir, it seems to me that last night you were saying something about power and influence and simple phone calls that kill stories in papers.
- Obviously something went wrong.
- Obviously.
Don't let that give you any satisfaction, Gridley.
My error remains between us.
Yours is on the front page of every newspaper in London.
By now, I assume
Mrs. Hardwicke has read them.
And to quote you, Gridley, she knows you know, so you go.
I'm sorry, my boy. In some peculiar way,
I like you, but you frustrate me.
I frustrate you?
Well, I think the answer to our frustrations is that we be in different countries.
I pick England.
Now let's see what we can find for you.
No. Sir, if I may, I don't feel you're taking the proper share of the blame.
If you'd killed the story as you said...
Gridley, you will learn that the higher your position, the more mistakes you're allowed.
In fact, if you make enough of them, it's considered your style.
Now you happen to be in what I would call a one-mistake position, and you've made it.
Now, let me see, Iceland, Auckland, the Truk Islands.
Will you please reconsider?
Put yourself in my place.
I can't. I haven't picked it out yet.
Pakistan.
- Tierra del Fuego.
- Tierra... Well, where's...
- Yes?
- Mrs. Hardwicke to see you, sir.
Ask her to wait, please.
So the little lady has come to ask her embassy to run interference for her.
No, I don't think that.
I'm not particularly interested in what you think, Gridley, but just for kicks, why do you suppose she's come?
- To intercede for me.
- My boy, my boy!
I mean, you've got a lot to learn.
I've had 20 years' experience with every kind of incident and many kinds of women.
And I take great pride in my ability to see beneath the surface of the most guileless female.
Now, in time, you too may acquire that ability, but just for now, suppose you go to your office, gather up your little bits and pieces.
It's a long way to Tierra del Fuego.
I'm not even sure that we have an outpost in Tierra del Fuego.
Now, if you will...
That door, if you don't mind.
Thank you.
Ask Mrs. Hardwicke to come in, please.
- Mrs. Hardwicke, sir.
- How do you do? Won't you be seated?
I prefer to stand, thank you.
What I have to say will take very little of your time.
I realize how busy you are.
Not at all.
This is your embassy, Mrs. Hardwicke.
- We're here to serve you.
- Well, I'm not here to be served, although I might have welcomed that speech several months ago when I needed your help.
- However, what I came to see you about...
- Mrs. Hardwicke, we will assist you in any way we possibly can, but we cannot act in what is not in the best interest of Great Britain.
That could lead to international complications.
I don't expect my country to go to war for me.
But the fact remains, Mr. Ambruster, that I've been hounded by the police, slandered by the press and humiliated by my neighbors.
I assume that you've seen the papers.
They're burned in my brain. Do sit down.
I've also been deprived of my passport, so that I can't leave the country.
And if I might mention it, accused of murder.
Well, is there any one particular item you wish to discuss?
Yes. I've been prevented from getting a work permit, which, incidentally, is why
I had to take in a boarder.
- Which brings us to Mr. Gridley.
- You mean, Mr. Gridley and you.
No, I mean Mr. Gridley alone.
Won't you please sit down?
- Do you know him well?
- Not terribly.
Well, I think you should.
He's really a very rare person.
That I know.
And he wants so much to do a good job in London.
Mr. Ambruster, there is absolutely no truth in what the press has inferred, that we, well, that we had some sort of an arrangement.
- Of course not.
- Why, he didn't even know about me.
I don't think it's fair for him to be punished for something that, well, that's not his fault.
You see, it was my fault for not telling him.
I was being selfish.
Actually, I was about to tell him last night when, well, when you called, and...
Well, I think that's all.
I do hope you treat him fairly.
I promise you that I'll do my part.
Thank you for your time.
Just a moment, please.
- If I may offer an opinion...
- I'm afraid I know your opinion of me.
No, no. You're a very persuasive young woman.
Mr. Gridley is indeed fortunate to have a champion like you.
And you know, your photographs don't really do you justice.
Well, the lighting is not terribly good in police stations.
Yes, I'm sure. It strikes me that perhaps I have been a bit derelict, and I suddenly find myself most eager to personally explore this entire unfortunate situation with you.
Now if I may suggest, there's a quiet little restaurant around the corner,
I thought perhaps we might just slip over there, have a bite of lunch, and talk about the whole thing.
You're not afraid of being seen in public with me?
On the contrary, it'll be a relief to get away from these constant interruptions.
Then you're not going to send him away?
The thought never entered my mind.
You have hazel eyes, as guileless and innocent as a child's.
It's easy to understand why he's so devoted to you.
In fact, if I were a younger man,
I'd wish I had answered your ad instead of Gridley.
- Have a nice lunch, sir?
- Perfectly charming.
- Well, what did you have?
- To tell you the truth, Gridley,
I was so involved with Mrs. Hardwicke that
I can't remember what it was or how it was.
Let me tell you something about that girl.
What are you going to tell me about that girl, sir?
That she couldn't possibly have done it.
That's your discovery?
With you, it was an opinion.
With me, it's a conviction.
And let me tell you something else.
You don't have to leave London.
You're staying right here.
You and I are going through the files of this case thoroughly.
- We've got to get Carlye out of this mess.
- Yes, sir.
Spending a day in the country.
She would pick the day of the murder to go off to the country.
With not one witness to back her up.
I still say this is our best bet.
Where is it? Where is it?
"Bloodstains on the carpet, one of his contact..." Yeah.
"The body was removed by car,
"indicating the victim was carried from the cellar to the garage."
Now, that could not have been Carlye, because that man was a giant.
I tried his coat on.
Where would she get strength enough to carry him all that way?
- Good thinking, Gridley.
- Yeah.
Maybe it's what led the Inspector to believe there might be an accomplice.
Now that you've met her, you realize how silly that is, don't you?
Certainly. The fact remains that part of the crime had to be carried out by a man.
Yeah.
Man?
- Look!
- What?
I forgot about him.
We bumped into him the night we went out.
- Who is he?
- She wouldn't tell me.
- I don't like this.
- Yes, sir. No, sir.
- Think you ought to follow him?
- Well, what do you think, sir?
I think, in a minute, you won't be able to find him.
Yes, sir.
I realize this looks bad for her, but I'm not worried.
- Gridley.
- I've gone.
- All right, we can go home now.
- Yes, sir.
No, wait.
- That'll be all for tonight, Brewster.
- Yes, sir.
- Move along, pussycat.
- I'm sorry. Carry on.
Here, what do you think you're doing down there?
Just window shopping.
Desecrating hallowed ground?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Gently, sir. I'm still warm.
May I help you, sir?
I'm sure Mrs. Hardwicke would never have sold it if she hadn't been strapped for funds.
The money I gave her for it tonight was only half its worth.
- It's beautiful, don't you think?
- It is.
Everything's beautiful when the truth finally comes to you.
Do you mind if I use that in my text next Sunday?
Carlye!
You needn't open them. Everything's there.
Well, Carlye, what does this mean?
Why are my bags all packed?
This is the two months' rent I owe you, all of it.
Well, wait a minute. Carlye, please, Carlye...
Look, I don't understand this.
First you go see Ambruster on my behalf.
- And then suddenly...
- On your behalf?
Look, Mr. Gridley, I've got my own problems, I don't need yours.
Now, if you'll just leave me alone,
I'll be fine. Just fine.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
You need somebody to take care of you.
I can take care of myself, thank you.
Just worry about your precious career and leave me alone.
Stop worrying about my precious career.
If it can't take a little rough weather it probably wasn't sturdy to begin with.
- And I'm not leaving.
- Yes, you are.
Why do you want to stay here?
Don't you know?
- I murdered my husband.
- I don't care whether you killed him or not.
Well, I...
- You don't?
- No, I don't.
I knew about that the day after I moved in here.
- You did?
- I did.
Then why didn't you say something?
Well, I said quite a few things at the time.
Among them that I adored you.
Well, maybe I didn't. I'll say it now.
I adore you.
If you killed three husbands,
I'd still love you.
Bill, you're a fool, an idiot.
Will you please get out of here?
I don't need you.
- You don't?
- No, I don't. I don't!
I love you.
Bill, I didn't do it.
I know you didn't do it.
You couldn't kill a flea, and Scotland Yard and the FBI together couldn't convince me otherwise.
Darling, I love you and I believe in you.
- Ambruster.
- How do you know?
Because he's Mr. Bad Timing.
Who else would call now?
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- Oh, didn't I?
- Not yet.
- Okay.
Hello?
Gridley, has she come back yet?
Yes, sir.
And if you don't mind, we'll talk about it in the morning.
Now, don't give me a hard time, Gridley.
You're talking to a man who has just come back from the grave, literally.
Ever heard of Slaughterhouse Lane?
Well, after you left, I followed her.
A police record? Are you sure of that?
What kind of a shop was it?
Well, as far as I could make out,
I think it was a pawnshop.
Pawnshop?
For Pete's sake...
She must have hocked something so she could return my rent money to me.
Well, that's a relief.
What's the dope on the character you followed?
The character I followed, sir, turned out to be a minister and let's hope I didn't upset his boss by trailing him.
Gridley, we were right.
She couldn't possibly have done it.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I've been saying all along, sir.
There's still one nagging little detail, though, that bothers me.
The arsenic.
The arsenic. Well...
It's used for killing garden pests, gentleman.
Yes, of course.
- Of course.
- Of course.
Good night, Mr. Ambruster.
- Good night, Carlye.
- Good night, Bill.
Good night? Are you still there, sir?
I'm hanging up as soon as I get my foot out of my mouth.
Did I call you at an inopportune moment again?
Most inopportune, sir.
Then you have my full permission to hang up on me.
Thank you, sir.
Inspector Oliphant here.
Gridley. Good man.
Are you on to something?
Yes. No. I called for ethical reasons.
What? Ethics at this time of night?
Inspector, I am resigning immediately.
I can't possibly cooperate, because now I'm absolutely convinced that Carlye's innocent.
Mr. Gridley, if she's innocent,
I'm just as anxious to prove it as you are.
Yes, well, we've been all through that, Inspector.
The statement's evasive and you know it. And I...
Gridley?
Yeah?
Gridley?
Hey, now listen to me very carefully.
If Mrs. Hardwicke is there, if she's there, if she's holding a gun on you, say anything you like, but start the next sentence with Mrs. Hardwicke.
Mrs. Hardwicke is not... Strike that.
Nobody's holding a gun on me.
Then why the sudden resignation at this time of night? What...
Gridley, what's going on in that house?
Well, nothing is going on in this...
- Would you hold the...
- Wait.
Just hold on for a moment.
Gridley? Gridley!
She was holding a gun on him.
Dead?
A burglar?
My husband.
Sergeant Dillings, you were stationed in front of the Hardwicke house
- on the night in question.
- Yes, sir.
You please tell us what happened?
At approximately 11:00 p.m.,
I perceived a man entering the house by letting himself in with a key.
He roughly answered the description of who we believed to be the late Mr. Miles Hardwicke, and a little while later proved indeed to be the late Mr. Hardwicke.
I went to a telephone booth and put in a call to Inspector Oliphant.
I had some trouble getting through to him, since his line was engaged.
But finally he called me, and as a result of his instructions,
I broke into the premises and entered Mrs. Hardwicke's bedroom.
Please tell us what you saw in the bedroom.
Mrs. Hardwicke and Mr. Gridley standing together, and the body.
They were in their nightclothes.
All except the body, that is.
You say "standing together."
Exactly what do you mean?
They were very close, with their arms around each other.
She had her head on his shoulder, and the gun, which had just been fired, in her left hand.
I should like to ask Mrs. Miles Hardwicke to take the stand, please.
Mrs. Miles Hardwicke.
I represent Mrs. Hardwicke, sir, and she has informed me that she does not wish to testify.
Does Mrs. Hardwicke realize the gravity of that decision?
She is quite firm about it, sir.
Would her counsel please come to the bench?
What's going on? You're your only witness, you've got to testify.
Look, for six months, they haven't believed one word I said.
- Why should they...
- Carlye, you have got to.
- Why?
- I need you.
- All right.
- Sir. Sir.
I apologize, but Mrs. Hardwicke has changed her mind.
Mrs. Hardwicke, tell us, if you will, exactly what happened on the night in question.
My husband was shot.
Well, of that much we are certain.
Can you tell us how he came to be shot?
- Yes, I think so.
- Then, please do.
It was an accident.
Yes?
That's all. It was an accident.
Mrs. Hardwicke, you seem terribly shy about details.
Couldn't we reconstruct the incident a little more fully?
Perhaps I can help.
To begin with, exactly where were you on or about 11:00 p.m.
On the date of the alleged shooting?
In my room.
And what were you doing?
Well,
I went to the window.
I wanted to draw the curtains.
Forgive me, my dear.
I hate to deprive you of the pleasure of screaming, but unfortunately, I can't take the risk.
Not the usual entrance for a husband into his wife's bedroom, is it, dear heart?
But then, I'm a most unusual husband.
Aren't I, Carlye?
Dead one minute and here the next.
Now, do you think you've got over your desire to scream?
Good.
Well, aren't you going to kiss your husband?
Aren't you going to tell him how much you've missed him?
What kind of sadistic game is this, Miles?
- Game?
- Letting everyone think you're dead.
It was no game, dear heart.
You see, one of us had to be accused of murder, so it made my choice comparatively simple, didn't it?
You!
I suppose you have wondered where I've been all these months.
Well, I've been on the run.
You see, I did a little flying for a certain employer of mine, and I seem to recall
I was rather drunk at the time and stole some valuable cargo from him.
Needless to say, he was most annoyed, and sent a messenger to retrieve what was rightfully his, and also to kill me.
Presumably, I suppose, as a warning never to do it again.
Well, fortunately, well, for me, that is, the assassin was most inept.
And I was able to assassinate the assassin.
And that's why I've been in hiding, Carlye, both from friends and police alike.
Well, now that you've heard my enchanting little bedtime story...
Why did you come back here, Miles?
For money, enough to get out of the country.
But first, well, it has been six months, hasn't it, Carlye?
Tell me, haven't you missed the more pleasant aspects of marriage?
No more than I missed them when we were together.
- Come off it, Carlye.
- You're hurting me.
I meant to.
I think I like you better when you're frightened.
Let go of me, Miles.
Struggling, you know, only makes it all the more enticing.
I think we can well do without a visit from the polizia on my first night home.
And you, my precious?
Mrs. Hardwicke, do you feel able to continue?
Now, then, Mrs. Hardwicke...
That's all.
That's all?
That is the balance of your testimony?
Yes.
But, Mrs. Hardwicke, what of the shooting itself?
Well...
He came at me, insisting that I give him money, even though I told him I didn't have any, and I tried to get the gun away from him and it went off.
That's all, Mrs. Hardwicke?
That's all.
I have here a police report stating that subsequent to your renting the flat, you took Mrs. Hardwicke dining and dancing.
Well, why not say dining, dancing and drinking?
That makes it sound worse.
There's also a slightly confusing report of an evening that you and Mrs. Hardwicke spent together during which a fire brigade was summoned.
We were merely having dinner in the garden.
While the house was on fire?
Well, we were going to have dinner by candlelight and then we decided to do it real big!
I think perhaps I'll ask for police clarification of this incident.
Now, when Sergeant Dillings arrived in the bedroom, according to his testimony, you had your arms around Mrs. Hardwicke.
Look, sir, you've been asking an awful lot of questions about my dancing with Mrs. Hardwicke, dining with her, having my arms around her.
Now, exactly what are you getting at?
If there was something more in the relationship between yourself and Mrs. Hardwicke than that of tenant and landlady, then it is my duty to establish it.
Well, then, why don't you come right out with it?
Ask me if I'm in love with her?
Frankly, I didn't want to put it so bluntly.
It's quite correct, because it's hardly a question you would ask a gentlemen to answer.
And if you think that is why she killed him, you're...
Ignore that!
Mr. Gridley, I advise you to take these proceedings a little more seriously.
After all, you were at the scene of the alleged crime when the police arrived.
Exactly.
And as a matter of fact, it hasn't been established whether or not I participated in the alleged crime.
Well, sir, did you participate?
I don't remember.
Now, Mrs. Hardwicke has stated quite clearly that you were not in the room at the time.
She may have been lying to protect me.
Now, how do you know that I wasn't in on the struggle for the gun with a jealous husband?
Let's just sit back and ponder that, shall we?
He's behaving like a maniac.
He's trying to take the blame.
Yeah. If he keeps it up, he's going to get himself hanged.
Hanged? We can't allow that.
No. I don't think it will come to that.
Hang on.
I wish to correct the impression
Mr. Gridley might have created by implying that he was somehow connected with the shooting of Mr. Hardwicke.
If you would, Inspector.
Sergeant Dillings has testified that he was unable to reach me on the phone, my line being engaged.
I was, at the time, speaking to Mr. Gridley who had called me from the Hardwicke house.
Now, since I had him in conversation at the precise moment the shot was fired,
I can state without reservation that he was neither a party to the struggle, nor the shooting.
May I ask, Inspector, how it happened that you were talking with Mr. Gridley on the telephone at 11:00 p.m.?
Yes, sir. The day after he moved into Mrs. Hardwicke's house,
Mr. Gridley, at my request, and with the kind cooperation of Mr. Franklyn Ambruster of the American Embassy, started acting as undercover agent for Scotland Yard.
Might I say something, please?
Madam, we are trying to conduct a proper inquest.
I have something to tell the court.
Well, ask her to step this way.
Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you give before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Will you state your name and residence, please?
Mrs. Agatha Brown. The Marston Hotel.
At the time of the alleged unfortunate incident,
I resided at 35 Gray Square.
You have information pertinent to this inquiry?
I saw that it was an accident, if that is pertinent, sir.
You say you saw the incident?
The window at number 35 looks directly into Mrs. Hardwicke's bedroom.
It was what I heard first that made me look.
They were arguing, and knowing that Mr. Hardwicke was missing and the other gentleman was living with her, naturally I was interested.
Naturally.
Well, I saw Mrs. Hardwicke backing toward the window and there was Mr. Hardwicke coming after her with a gun in his hand.
He grabbed her and twisted her wrist.
They struggled, she tried to stop him, the gun went off, and Mr. Hardwicke just stood there for a moment with a surprised look on his face, and then he fell.
And then the other gentleman came in.
Mrs. Brown, why did you withhold this information until now?
I was afraid.
I didn't want to get mixed up in anything.
It wasn't until I saw how badly things were going for poor Mrs. Hardwicke that I knew I had to speak.
The poor dear was only trying to protect herself.
There was no murder.
It was nothing more than a terrible accident.
Order! Order!
Order! Order!
Carlye!
- Carlye!
- How about a statement, Mrs. Hardwicke?
Carlye, I've got to talk to you.
Mrs. Hardwicke, would you tell our television...
I've nothing to say.
- Millions of viewers...
- Mrs. Hardwicke has nothing to say.
Why don't you just switch to another channel?
Please, sir.
Mr. Gridley, you have exactly a half-hour to get out of my house.
Out of your house?
- Gridley!
- If you don't get rid of that...
Gridley, speaking not as a man, but as a member of the United States government, you have exactly one hour to get your things out of that house.
That's wrong, sir. I have a half an hour.
She just threw me out.
Just come in, my dear. I believe we have a matter of importance to discuss.
33 Gray Square.
A marvelous thing, gratitude, and yet how little one sees of it these days.
It was kind and grateful of you to give me this, my dear.
But then, I'm terribly grateful to you for leaving that one little detail out of your story.
Amazing, isn't it, how it's assured me a life of comfort and security?
Why don't you nap till I come back, dear?
This has been a trying day for you, I'm sure.
When I come back I'll fix you a nice hot tub, and then we'll have dinner.
I think I'll have the ground floor done over for myself.
I don't much care for stairs at my age.
Yes, we must do that.
It will be much better, my living with you, rather than that dreadful husband or Mr. Gridley.
At least, my dear,
I am a friend who won't betray you.
Carlye!
Carlye!
Now, what was that all about?
What was she doing here?
Are you still working for Scotland Yard or are you doing your snooping on your own now?
Look, I never worked against you, you must believe that.
I only believe that I can't believe in anyone, ever again.
Did my testimony sound like
I was trying to prove you guilty?
Carlye!
Look, Carlye!
You've got to tell me what's going on.
Look, Carlye, what's all this about Mrs. Brown moving in here?
Where are you?
Look, Carlye, dear, believe me,
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you or us, but I cannot help you unless you tell me everything.
Carlye?
Answer me.
Are you all right?
Carlye, open the door.
Darling, please.
What are you doing?
I'm taking a bath.
Well, could you explain why you're taking a bath at a time like this?
Because I feel dirty.
Carlye.
Will you put that gun down and get out of here?
No, I won't get out of here until you tell me what's going on, and what Mrs. Brown meant by one little detail that you left out of your story!
Carlye, if you don't turn off the water,
I'm going to go downstairs, and I'm going to smash all the pipes!
Carlye! So help me!
Now,
I want to know what Mrs. Brown's involvement is in all of this and I am not going to move one inch until I find out!
You nut!
Can't you tell that I'm trying to help you?
She wanted the pawn ticket.
Well, why couldn't you... What pawn ticket?
The one my husband was going to kill me to get.
I don't understand.
Come on!
All right.
At the inquest, I lied.
Well, at least, I didn't tell the whole truth.
It was true that he wanted money, and he did come at me with a gun.
But what I didn't tell them was that he...
All right, Carlye, we'll stick to business.
Where is it?
Where's what?
Don't play dumb with me.
I'm talking about the candelabra, the one that's missing from the parlor.
The...
Well, I pawned it.
You did what?
I pawned it. I needed £40.
- You hocked it for 40 quid?
- Well, I...
Didn't you know there were jewels stuffed in that candelabra worth half a million?
- What?
- When did you pawn it?
Just tonight.
All right, Carlye, give me the ticket.
I said, give me the ticket.
I don't have it.
- What do you mean, you don't have it?
- I don't know where it is.
I've got to find that pawn ticket.
I've got to have it.
Get away from that window.
It's an odd thing about killing, but ever since the first, I've been rather looking forward to the second.
Now, give me that ticket, or I'll...
I was just plain scared.
You see, I was afraid that if I mentioned the jewels, they'd think somehow
I was involved in his illegal activities.
And I didn't want his friends dropping in on me, either.
I just wanted to forget about the jewels and the candelabra.
- I wanted to tear up the pawn ticket and...
- Yeah, only now it's in Mrs. Brown's purse.
She's blackmailing me.
Well, Carlye, we've got to go to the police.
And admit I didn't tell the whole truth?
I thought I was in trouble before, but now I've really fixed things.
- Carlye, there's no other choice...
- Bill!
Standing here at the window,
I just remembered something.
- What?
- That night,
I broke away from him and I ran to the window to yell for help.
Yeah?
And I saw Mrs. Brown coming down the street.
- The street? Well, she said...
- By the time that she reached her house and got up the stairs, the whole thing was over.
Bill, she never saw it at all.
She couldn't have.
Wait a minute, then how would she know what had happened?
How did she hear about the candelabra or the pawn...
Mrs. Dunhill.
She must have seen it and told her.
Well, let's pay a visit to Mrs. Dunhill.
She moved the day after the shooting.
- She moved? Where?
- Mrs. Brown must know.
Maybe we can still catch her at the pawnshop.
Come on... Wait a minute.
Don't you think that you'd better...
- Yeah.
...change?
- I'll meet you downstairs.
- Okay. Yeah, I'll get a cab.
Better wait.
The pawnbroker?
Dead?
Looks like he knew what was inside of this thing.
He wasn't too anxious to redeem the pawn ticket.
So, Mrs. Brown...
Yeah. Well, it's a cinch she won't go back to the house now.
But how will we find Mrs. Dunhill?
Next door, her house. She must have left a forwarding address. Let's go.
Back to Gray Square.
Wait.
How do you do?
The séance starts in half an hour.
Won't you come in, please?
Well, that's not why we came, but thank you.
The woman that lived here before you, did she leave a forwarding address?
Mrs. Dunhill.
Paddington Station.
- Inspector.
- Are they in?
I don't think so.
I was going to pick up... Why?
Both Gridley and Hardwicke were spotted leaving the scene of a murder.
Is this a new murder or one I already know about?
No, sir, a pawnbroker in Slaughterhouse Lane.
- Gridley couldn't have done that.
- Maybe not, sir, but the death rate has certainly gone up since he arrived in London.
- I'm afraid I'll have to pick them both up.
- Wait! Look, look, Inspector.
Oliphant?
This is Inspector Oliphant speaking.
This is an all-points bulletin.
Pay special attention to all airports and railway stations.
Arrest on sight on suspicion of murder,
Mrs. Miles Hardwicke and
Mr. William Gridley, both Americans.
Mrs. Hardwicke's description is as follows, height approximately 5'5", complexion fair,
- eyes brown, speaks...
- Hazel.
Eyes hazel. She's quite attractive, as a matter of fact.
When is the next train to Penzance, please?
That train is on Platform 6 right now.
- What time does it leave?
- Five minutes ago.
Two tickets, please.
- Single or return?
- Return.
How far from the Penzance Station is the Hotel Wessex?
Just a short cab drive, madam.
- Yeah... How much?
- That'll be £16, eight shillings, sir.
If you're thinking of it for a holiday, sir, the Wessex caters to elderly people.
Yes, we know. Thank you.
Hazel eyes, yeah, yeah.
Both Americans.
Yes, sir. I'll keep a sharp lookout.
Bill...
What if Mrs. Dunhill won't come back to testify for me?
Mrs. Brown says she has a bad heart.
Maybe she'll be too sick.
Yeah, well, we'll drag everybody down to Penzance and make her testify there.
It's been done before.
You know something?
I do need you.
I wonder who Mrs. Brown is killing right now?
If she has any sense, she's hiding.
I'll be right back.
I see.
I see. Well, no one at all.
I said, no one at all.
Yeah, well, Dillings, stay with it.
Stay with it.
What's the word?
Well, no one has entered or even approached the house all night.
- Did you sleep well, sir?
- I had a marvelous dream.
I was in the shooting gallery and every target had Gridley's face on it.
He has been a bit of a trial to you, hasn't he?
A bit?
Inspector Oliphant speaking.
They have? Where?
- Gridley?
- Now, listen.
They're to be arrested the instant the train arrives and returned to London.
- Now, Inspector, look...
- Well, now, they were identified at
Bristol Railway Station during a stop.
For some unknown reason, they're headed for Penzance.
Inspector, you can't arrest them.
You have no idea what the repercussions would be.
Washington will throw a fit.
Well, I'm afraid
I can't let that concern me, sir.
If I can just speak to him first.
Inspector, I gave you Gridley when you needed him.
I ask you to give him to me for just five minutes.
I appeal to you with every one of my exposed nerve ends.
Mr. Ambruster, sir, look, I'd like to be able to help you, but it's hours from here to Penzance.
If we should lose them there...
- May I use your phone?
- Yes, certainly, of course you can.
- We can be there in no time.
- Yes? How?
Inspector, have you noticed that the emblem over the American Embassy is an eagle?
What are you doing, Mrs. Brown?
I was lonesome for you, my dear.
I thought we might have a little chat.
I don't want to chat!
Take me back before I miss The Mikado.
But first, we'll have a little ride along the cliffs.
I insist that you tell me what you're up to.
Well, of course, my dear.
Remember when we decided that I should go to the police to tell them about that terrible accident you saw to save you the ordeal of an investigation?
That was your idea.
You knew my heart condition.
Well, since then, a great deal has happened.
I can either go to prison, or to the gallows, or spend the rest of my life in luxury.
I prefer the latter, and I want to make sure you won't spoil it.
How could I spoil it?
Gridley, if there is an explanation for this astounding exhibit, you'll never find a more willing audience.
Mrs. Brown tried to kill me.
See, Mrs. Dunhill really saw the shooting.
It was self-defense. He had a gun.
- I saw the whole thing.
- You see, she was blackmailing me.
Yes, after she perjured herself at the inquest...
Because I didn't mention the candelabra.
Mention it? She didn't tell anyone.
I was afraid if I told the police, they'd just think...
You poor child.
I had to shoot my way into her bathroom to find it out.
You see? These jewels, they were in her purse.
- She killed the pawnbroker to get them.
- She also tried to kill Mrs. Dunhill,
- just to keep her from telling the truth.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Is that clear to you, Inspector?
- Probably.
- Of course it's clear.
Wraps the whole thing up, doesn't it?
Now, Gridley, it's been said that there will always be an England, and I'd like to do my part to keep it that way.
How would you like an assignment back in the States?
Would I?
Would I?
We would.
Done. I'm going to miss you both.
Mrs. Hardwicke, I promised myself something the first day we met, and I've never been one to go back on a promise.
Gridley, I do hope your life from here on in proves less hectic.
Yes, so do I.
- Good luck, old boy.
- Thank you, sir.
Right.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, no!
No!
Robbed! Cleaned out!
Nine thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven dollars.
Precisely as I told you over the telephone.
And that girl did it. Marion Holland!
That's the girl. Marion Holland!
- Can you describe her, Mr Strutt?
- Certainly I can.
Five feet five.
A hundred and ten pounds.
Size eight dress.
Blue eyes. Black, wavy hair.
Even features. Good teeth.
- (Chuckling)
- What's so damn funny?
There 's been a grand larceny committed on these premises!
Yes, sir. You were saying, ah, black hair, wavy, even features, good teeth.
- She was in your employ 4 months?
- Mmm.
What were her references, sir?
Well, as a matter of fact -
Yes, uh, she had references, I 'm sure.
Oh, Mr Strutt, don't you remember?
She didn't have any references at all.
Well, she worked the copying and adding machines.
No confidential duties.
(Strutt) Mr Rutland.
I didn't know you were in town.
Just had a robbery. Almost $1 0,000.
So I gathered. By a pretty girl with no references.
You remember her. I pointed her out to you last time you were here.
You said something about how I was improving the looks of the place.
Oh, that one!
The brunette with the legs.
Excuse me. Mr Rutland's a client.
I don't think you've got time to discuss business today, Mr Strutt, what with your crime wave on your hands.
Oh, no, no. Always time for
Rutland business. You know that.
How are things in Philadelphia?
The little witch! I'll have her put away for 20 years!
I knew she was too good to be true.
Always so eager to work overtime, never made a mistake.
Always pulling her skirt down over her knees as though they were a national treasure.
She seemed so nice, so efficient.
- So -
- Resourceful?

Hello, Mrs Maitland.
Oh, so nice to have you back,
Miss Edgar.
- We put you in your same room.
- Thank you, Mrs Maitland.
Can someone drive me over to Garrod's right away?
- Of course. Anytime you're ready.
- Soon as I change.
How do, Miss Edgar?
Good to have you back.
Hello, Mr Garrod.
Ah, there's my darling!
(Garrod) That big spoiled baby of yours knew something was up.
Tried to bite me twice already this morning.
Forio, if you want to bite somebody, bite me.
Thanks.

Thank you.
(Girls) One, two, three, four, five, six -
Oh, it's you. Where's my mother?
She's makin' a pecan pie... for me!
That figures.
(Woman) Who is it, Jessie?
- Hello, Mama.
- Well, I just swan. Marnie!
If you're not the very limit.
I can't take in the way you jump all over the place like you do.
(Mama) Boston, Massachusetts.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.
I brought you some chrysanthemums.
Those gladiolas are brand fresh.
Miss Cotton brought 'em last night.
I never could stand gladiolas.
I ' ll get rid of these.
For land's sake - Marnie, now watch the dripping.
Here, Jessica, why don't you take these home to your mother?
She don't get home from work till 6::00.
I'm supposed to stay here till 6::00.
Take them to the kitchen then.
Just get rid of them.
Take 'em to the kitchen before they drip all over.
We could stand gladiolas!
I send you plenty of money.
You don't have to be a baby-sitter.
Whoever said I did have to?
It's my pleasure.
That smart little ol' Jessie.
Marnie, if you could just hear some of the things that she says.
Oh, but I do.
Seems I get a report in exhaustive detail on all the bright sayings of ol' Jessie Cotton.
What's more, every time I come home, she's roosting here.
I see that you've lighted up your hair, Marnie.
- A little. Why? Don't you like it?
- No.
Too-blonde hair always looks like a woman's tryin' to attract the man.
Men and a good name don't go together.
I brought you something, Mama.
Now what have you thrown good money away on?
Oh, Marnie.
You shouldn't spend all your money on me like you do.
But that's what money's for: to spend.
Like the Bible says,
"Money answereth all things."
We don't talk smart about the Bible in this house, missy!
Well, I just swan! How do I wear it?
Like this. Real high up under the chin.
(Marnie) Oh, it's smart, it's very, very smart.
Goin' around buyin' fur pieces like they was nothin'.
Mr Pemberton gave me another raise.
I told Miss Cotton my daughter is private secretary to a millionaire.
He's as generous with her as if she was his very own daughter.
Miss Bernice, don't you want to get my hair brushed up
- before my mommy gets home?
- I sure do, honey.
You run up and get the brush.
Oh, that kid and her hair.
Puts me in mind of yours when you was little. The colour.
This side of the street don't get the afternoon sun.
My hip and my leg ache me somethin' awful.
I got the hairbrush!
Uh, Marnie, mind my leg.
(Mama) I never had time to take care of Marnie 's hair when she was a little kid like you.
- How come?
- Oh, child!
Well, after I had my bad accident, first I was sick so long, and then I had to work.
(Jessie) Didn't you all have a daddy either?
No, we didn't. We surely did not!
There.
As pretty as brushin' can make you.
Oh, sugarpop, it's five after 6:00.
You better scat on home.
And you be sure to take your mama those glads.
How ' bout my pie?
How ' bout my pecan pie?
I ' ll get it done tonight and bring it over to you.
Now, Jessie, you mind you go straight home.
OK. Bye, Miss Bernice.
See you later, Miss Bernice.
Do you really like the scarf, Mama?
It's real mink.
Oh, there. You look just like an old man's darling.
No man ever give me anything so good.
We don't need men, Mama.
We can do very well for ourselves.
You and me.
A decent woman don't have need for any man.
Look at you, Marnie.
I told Miss Cotton, look at my girl Marnie.
She's too smart to go gettin' herself mixed up with men... none of 'em!
Well, let's go on back to the kitchen.
I've got to see to that pie.
Uh, Marnie, I've been thinking seriously about asking Miss Cotton and Jessie to move in here with me.
Miss Cotton is a real nice woman.
She's decent. A hard-working woman with a little girl to raise.
Come on, Mama, why don't you just say what you mean?
What you want is for Jessie to come live with you.
Marnie, you oughtn't let yourself act jealous of a little ol' kid like that.
She don't bother me none.
And we could always use the extra money.
The Cottons are mighty decent people.
Why don't you love me, Mama?
I 've always wondered why you don't.
You never give me one part of the love you give Jessie.
Mama -
Why do you always move away from me?
Why? What's wrong with me?
Nothing! Nothing's wrong with you.
No. You don't think that.
You've always thought there was something wrong with me.
- Haven't you? Always!
- I never.
My God! When I think of the things I've done to try to make you love me.
The things I've done!
Hm. What are you thinking now, Mama?
About the things I've done?
What do you think they are?
Things that aren't decent, is that it?
Well, you think
I'm Mr Pemberton's girl.
Is that why you don't want me to touch you?
Is that how you think I get the money to set you up?
I'm... I'm sorry, Mama.
I don't know what got into me talking like that.
I know you've never really thought anything bad about me.
No, I never.
Well, I'm sorry. I really am.
- I'll pick up the pecans.
- No, you go upstairs and lay down.
You're all wore out. I'll ask Jessie to come over and pick up the nuts.
Alright.
After all... it is Jessie's pie, isn't it?
No, I don't want to. Mama, no!
Marnie, wake up. Marnie?
Don't make me move, Mama.
It's too cold.
Wake up, Marnie.
You're still dreaming.
- Get washed up. Supper's ready.
- Oh.
I was having that old dream again.
- First the tapping and then -
- I said supper's ready.
It's always when you come to the door.
That's when the cold starts.
- Miss Clabon.
- Good morning.
Is Mr Ward in his office?
Yes. He's interviewing for the new office assistant.
Rutland and Company is an old established publishing -
- Oh, Mr Rutland.
- This is Miss Blakely, Mr Rutland.
Well done. You'll hear from us,
Miss Blakely, I'm sure.
Thank you for your time, Mr Ward.
Good day, Mr Rutland.
Good day, Miss Blakely.
Well, I guess that does it. She seems to have the exact qualifications -
Come in for a moment, please.
Now, sit down, Mrs... Taylor.
Thank you.
(Ward) I have here your
Pittsburgh references.
Reference, that is. Kendall's, yes.
This the only reference you have to show us?
Well, Mr Ward, I have good training, but I've had very little actual experience.
Kendall ' s was my first real job.
After I finished school, I was married.
My husband was a CPA.
He helped me keep up with my training.
I learned a great deal more from him: accounting, cost-price,
- even something about computers.
- (Ward) I see.
When my husband died very suddenly last November, he left me a little money, but I felt I needed work.
Good, hard, demanding work.
I got the job at Kendall's, but it was -
Well, it wasn't a very exacting position, and there didn't seem much chance for anything else at Kendall's.
I don't mean pay. Salary isn't the most important thing with me, but more interesting work, Mr Ward.
Something that will keep me busy, occupied.
I don't care how much work
I'm given or what hours I work.
(Ward) Uh, Mrs Taylor, why did you leave Pittsburgh?
After my husband died, I just -
(Ward) Mrs Taylor, this is a post of some confidence.
(Marnie) Oh, please, let me have a chance to prove myself, Mr Ward.
Uh... very well, Mrs Taylor.
I suppose you might as well report to work on Monday.
Miss Clabon in the outer office will brief you.
I'll be out in just a moment.
Taking her on without references?
You' re always such a stickler -
Let's just say I'm an interested spectator in the passing parade.
I don't get it.
You're not supposed to get it.
Hi, Miss Clabon.
Hello, Mr Sam.
How's the curmudgeon business?
Oh, Miss Mainwaring!
Is Mark in? I want a free lunch, and somebody to cash a check.
I thought I'd stick Mark for the lunch and you for the cash.
Go right on in.
(Ward) You have your
Social Security card, Mrs Taylor?
- Of course. Right here in my purse.
- Who 's the dish?
Miss Clabon will show you around.
She's been with us for seven years.
I believe she finds the work exacting enough. Good day, Mrs Taylor.
Miss Clabon, will you call personnel and have them send the forms up?
Certainly, Mr Ward.
(Miss Clabon) Hello.
This is Mr Ward's office.
Would you send up a W-4 and the rest of the employment forms?
Yes, before lunch. I'll wait.
Thank you.
Maud, what about Saturday?
No, I only thought as you said your mother wasn 't coming with us,
I just wanted to make sure about our reservations.
Well, why don 't you call me back?
Alright. Anytime.
Thanks, Mr Sam, I ' ll try not to do anything sensible with it.
- Bye, Miss Clabon.
- Bye.
That's Lil Mainwaring,
Mr Rutland's sister-in-law.
- Her sister was Mr Rutland's wife.
- Was?
She died about a year and a half ago.
Some kind of heart thing.
Imagine. Only 29.
Well, anyway, she kind of brought Lil up.
Lil lived with them and old Mr Rutland down at Wykwyn.
I get the feeling little ol' Lil plans to stay on... permanently.
Anyway, like I was saying, old Mr Rutland - that's Mark's father - they say he's never even been inside this place.
The company was headed into the ground when Mark took over.
They say the first week he was here he retired... ha, retired, three board members, the acting president, the president's secretary.
Coffee time, ladies.
- Do you mind bringing me a cup?
- Just coffee? Donut, Danish?
- Lady, have I got for you a Danish!
- No, just coffee.
- Oh, I'm out of red ink.
- Oh, here, use mine.
- I'll get it.
- No, no, I will.
Thanks.
Mrs Taylor, are you hurt?
(Mark) Mrs Taylor!
I think she's hurt. Find out!
Mary, are you alright?
What?
Of course, I'm alright. I just spilled a little ink on my blouse.
The way you rushed out of the office -
Mr Rutland's standing out there.
- He said he thought you were hurt.
- Well, I'm not.
All that happened was I spilled a little ink on my blouse.
Good heavens! What a lot of excitement over nothing.
Why in the world does he keep locking and unlocking that drawer?
He never can remember the safe combination.
It's locked in that drawer.
Mr Rutland and I have keys too, for emergencies.
It's only five numbers, for Pete's sake.
Mrs Taylor? I've just had a call from
Mr Rutland, Mrs Taylor.
He remembered your saying you'd be willing to work overtime.
He wondered if you'd be prepared to work on Saturday?
- Saturday? Of course. What time?
- Two-thirty.
I ' ll advise Mr Rutland that you are available.
- (Knocking)
- (Mark) Come in, Mrs Taylor.
Good afternoon, Mr Rutland.
Are you interested in pre-Columbian art, Mrs Taylor?
Those were collected by my wife. She's dead.
The only things of hers I 've kept.
And that's Sophie. She 's a jaguarundi.
South American. I, uh... trained her.
Oh? What did you train her to do?
To trust me.
Is that all?
That's a great deal... for a jaguarundi.
Shall we get to work?
You can use the typewriter over there.
I want an original and one copy of this.
If you can't decipher any of this, speak up.
I typed it myself and
I'm a very creative typist.
"Arboreal Predators of the Brazilian Rain Forest."
Before I was drafted into Rutland's, Mrs Taylor,
I had notions of being a zoologist.
- I still try to keep up with my field.
- Zoos?
Instinctual behaviour.
Oh. Does zoology include people,
Mr Rutland?
Well, in a way. It includes all the animal ancestors from whom man derived his instincts.
Ladies' instincts too?
That paper deals with the instincts of predators.
What you might call the criminal class of the animal world.
Lady animals figure very largely as predators.
Put on the overhead light if you like.
The switch is by the door.
Why don't you sit down, Mrs Taylor?
If the storm worries you that much,
I'll get you something to drink.
Mrs Taylor?
The building is grounded, Mrs Taylor.
You' re quite safe here... from the lightning.
The colours! Stop the colours!
What colours?
It's over. All over. You're alright.
OK now? Would you like something to drink? Some brandy?
- No, thank you. I'm awfully sorry.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- Why do colours bother you?
- Colours?
You seem to be terrified of some colours.
No, no. What I'm terrified of is thunder and lightning.
I wouldn't have pegged you as a woman terrified of anything.
Well, we've all got to go sometime.
Look, this place is wrecked and you're in no state to work.
Suppose I drive you home.
You can do this job some other time.
- Thank you. I -
- Go get your things.
It's cold and damp here.
I must get the maintenance people in.
- I'm really sorry about the cabinet.
- Why should you be?
You said it was all you had left of your wife.
I said it was all I had left that had belonged to my wife.
Oh.
(Car Radio) "Native Winkler is second.

Oh, no please. I'd like to hear.
- You like racing?
- I like horses.
I go to the races when I can.
- Was your husband a track fan?
- Yes.
- And you go alone now?
- Yes.
Atlantic City track's open till the end of the month.
We could drive out there next Saturday.
Alright.
- Are you fond of horses?
- No, not at all.
(PA Announcer) "Fast Return moving up on the outside. "
Well, that's another one.
Oh, I like it here like this.
You' re the expert.
What do you like in the next race?
Lemon Pudding. He's finished third his last three times out.
- Got a good jockey up today.
- Lemon Pudding it is.
The morning line says he's four to one.
I'll get on him.
(Man) Pardon me.
But you're Peggy Nicholson, aren't you?
Remember me?
I'm sorry. What did you say?
- Aren't you Peggy Nicholson?
- No, I'm not.
Yeah? I was pretty sure you were.
When I first saw you down here -
I'm sorry, you've made a mistake.
I am not Miss Nichols.
- Nicholson.
- Nicholson.
Frank Abernathy introduced us a couple of years ago in Detroit.
Frank Abernathy.
You remember Frank.
No, I do not know anyone named Frank Abernathy.
I have never known anyone named Frank Abernathy.
- Now, will you please go?
- Aw, come on now, honey.
You're trying to pull my leg, aren't you?
(Mark) Now, why should any young lady want to pull your leg?
Oh, sorry. I thought
I recognised this lady.
- Did he recognise you?
- No.
- You did not recognise her.
- I said I thought I recognised her.
- I said I'm sorry.
- Good for you. You've apologised.
You may go now.
- You came back so quickly.
- Yes. Who's your fan?
I just seem to have one of those faces.
Well, what do you like in the next race?
Can we go to the paddock?
I'd like to see Telepathy.
Been watching him ever since I saw him work out once as a two-year-old.
Oh, I believe that's our old friend Telepathy.
Yeah, number eight. Telepathy.
He 's a lanky-looking piece of business, but I bow to your superior knowledge.
- What is it? What ' s the matter?
- Don't bet him.
- Why not?
- He's walleyed.
Can we go now?
What a paragon you are.
You don't smoke, drink or gamble.
Just this once... for luck.
- I don't believe in luck.
- What do you believe in?
Nothing.
Oh, horses, maybe.
At least they're beautiful, and nothing in this world like people.
Oh, yes, people. A thoroughly bad lot.
Generally.
Did you have a tough childhood,
Mrs Taylor?
Not particularly
I think you did. I think you've had a hard, tough climb.
But you're a smart girl, aren't you?
The careful grammar, the quiet good manners.
- Where did you learn them?
- From my betters.
What about your tough childhood,
Mr Rutland?
The old, sad story.
Promising youth blighted.
Dragged down by money, position, noblesse oblige.
By the time I came along, the company was hanging on the ropes.
We had about 1,000 employees who were about to go down for the count.
What about the Rutlands?
What would've happened to your family?
Nothing ever happens to a family that traditionally marries at least one heiress every other generation.
You shouldn't've chickened. Your walleyed reject just won by 4 lengths.
I think I've had enough. Can we go?
If you like.
The track's open till the end of the month.
That gives us two more Saturdays.
If your luck holds out, by this time next month, I'll be a rich man.
- Oh, Miss Nicholson.
- You really are pressing your luck.
Where are we going this time?
I thought it was time I brought you home to meet my old man.
- You should've told me.
- You're alright.
Dad goes by scent. If you smell anything like a horse, you're in.
Here we are, old bean. The homestead.
- Hello, Dad.
- Who's this?
This is Mary Taylor.
Mary, this is my father.
- How do you do, Mr Rutland?
- A girl, is it?
It's alright, Dad. She's not really a girl, she's a horse-fancier.
The track's closed. I thought if
I brought her to see your horses,
- I'd hold her attention a bit longer.
- Splendid, splendid!
Come along, my dear.
I was just about to have a cup of tea.
Oh, Mary, this is my sister-in-law, Lil Mainwaring.
- Mary Taylor.
- How do you do?
Hi. I've seen you at Rutland's, haven't I?
(Rutland) It bewilders me what any of you can find to do at Rutland's.
Oh, dear! I think I rather sprained my wrist this afternoon.
There 's sure to be droppage and spillage. Would you mind awfully?
(Rutland) Strong, please.
No milk, two lumps of sugar.
The meals in this house are shocking bad, but I do insist on good
Horn and Hardart cake at tea.
You take yours with lemon, don't you, Lil?
Yes, lemon for Lil, Mary.
Strong with a dash of rum for me.
(Rutland) Spinster's tea.
Mucking up tea with strong drink.
- Something sneaky about it, eh?
- What's your opinion, Miss Taylor?
Do you think old Mark here is a sneaky one?
Possibly.
How do you take your tea, Miss Taylor?
Usually with a cup of hot water and a tea bag.
(Rutland) Lazy habit, my dear.
I'll have quite a large slice of that butter cake, please.
- Do you ride, Miss Taylor?
- A little.
Best thing in the world for the inside of a man or woman is the outside of a horse.
I shouldn't think you'd find old Mark very interesting.
- Doesn't hunt. Doesn't even ride!
- Please, Dad!
I was hoping to lead up gently to all that.
I'd even planned to show her the horses first.
Swill that down or bring it with you to the stables.
Mark's trying to act as if he brought
Miss Taylor out to see the horses.
- He really brought her to see me.
- Really? Whatever for?
Showing off. I'm quite a presentable old party, you know.
Lil, I 'm sure your sturdy young wrist has recovered sufficiently to pour Dad another cup of tea.
- I will have another cup.
- I can't!
"When duty whispers low, thou must."
"Then youth replies, I can."
Ratfink! And you misquoted!
Will you come up and spend next weekend with us?
You can bring your tea bag, have your pick of the horses.
Good night, Mary. I have to run.
See you on Monday.
Good night, Susan.
(Woman) Good night. See you on Monday.
I haven't got my powder puff.
Have you got one?
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.
- Come on.
- Alright, I'm coming.
You mean we have to hang around and wait until he calls?
- Good night, girls.
- Good night. I'll see you.
- Have a good weekend.
- Yeah.
I think that's terrible.
- What are you gonna do?
- I don 't know. Let's get home.
He may have already called you.
If I miss his call, that's the way it goes.
This is the best one you 've had!
You' re sure makin' time tonight, Rita.
What's the big rush?
I wanna get to bed.
That's the big rush.
Please get down.
You'll walk back to the stables.
I'll ride.
Are you stayin' at an inn or have you friends among the local gentry?
- You said you didn't trust horses.
- I don't, but they trust me.
Which brings us directly to our relationship, Miss Edgar!
Is Edgar your real name?
And you're blonde.
You'll save time and make for better feeling if you tell me the truth.
Is Edgar your real name?
Now, don't crowd me, lady!
I'm fighting a powerful impulse to beat the hell out of you.
At last we communicate.
Now, for the third and last time, is Edgar your real name?
And don't bother to lie to me.
I'll check you out in every detail.
- Yes. Margaret Edgar.
- Where are you from?
California.
- Where in California?
- Los Angeles.
Where's the money?
Here! Some of it.
- Where 's the rest?
- Don't worry. It's safe.
Safe? At some pari-mutuel window?
Or gone on mother's operation?
Or perhaps you're putting your kid brother through school?
I don't have a kid brother or a mother. I don't have anybody.
Not even Mr Taylor?
I wouldn't be surprised to hear the rest of the haul is with your late husband, Mr Taylor.
Somewhere I expect to find him happily reincarnated, the pockets of his good blue burial suit bulging with Rutland money.
The rest of the money is in a registered package addressed to me in a post office box in New York.
You can pick it up there by tomorrow.
Here's the key.
Thank you, Miss Edgar.
Now I'll take the registration receipt.
This receipt and the package are as good as a signed confession.
You understand that? Alright.
Now, where does Mr Taylor come in?
There's no such person.
I 've never been married.
Mrs Taylor was an old friend of my mother's.
And when you applied at Rutland's, the name just came to your mind.
I was trying to get away from my cousin Jessie. She's no good.
If she found out about the insurance money, she'd try to get some.
Make trouble for me.
- What insurance money?
- Mrs Taylor's.
- She died.
- Oh, Mrs Taylor died. Pity.
Now you're working with this naughty cousin Jessie.
Nobody's working with me!
You talk as if this was some regular thing I do... did.
All planned in cold blood.
- And it wasn't?
- No!
You're not from Los Angeles,
Miss Edgar.
Insurance is only pronounced insurance in the South.
And that's where you're from.
Where? Around here?
You' re a cold-practised, method-actress of a liar.
- I can't help it.
- It would appear not.
I don't mean that.
I mean, I wasn't born in California.
I was born in Richmond, Virginia.
My father deserted us when I was a baby.
My mother and I lived in Richmond until I was seven.
Then we went to California.
Mother worked in aeroplane factories.
That's the truth. I swear it!
My mother died when I was ten.
And Mrs Taylor took care of me.
Come on, get moving.
How did you find me?
You're here to answer the questions, ol' girl.
How did you get the combination to Ward's safe?
- I took Susan's key from her purse.
- I see.
Now, suppose you just begin at the beginning.
It's just like I told you. I was born in Richmond. We were poor.
We were grindingly poor.
- I was so alone after Mother died.
- Well, go on.
You still have my attention.
I just went to school and took care of Mrs Taylor until she died.
She left me her house and $5,000 in insurance.
I sold the house. It had a mortgage so I only got $9,000 cash.
But there I was with $14,000! Me!
I could do exactly what I wanted to with it.
There isn't much more. I bought Forio.
- Forio?
- My horse at Garrod's.
I had two wonderful years.
Then last November it was all gone so I had to get a job.
I went to Pittsburgh and got the job at Kendall's until I could look around for something better.
Alright, let's try again.
Let's back up and turn that Mt Everest of manure into a few facts.
One: Your dates are all wrong.
Previously you were employed by the firm of Strutt and Company.
I saw you there once.
Mr Strutt is the tax consultant for Rutland and Company.
He pointed you out to me.
You were a brunette then.
Then some months later, he pointed out your absence.
You mean, you knew all about that when you hired me?
No. I wasn't positive.
But I thought it might be interesting to keep you around.
And all this time you've been trying to trip me up, trap me!
Um, I 'm not sure any more.
I think I was just... curious at first.
Then things got out of control and...
I liked you.
So I see!
Incidentally, I think you took a bit of a chance, knowing that Rutland's was a client of Strutt's.
I didn't.
My job at Strutt's didn't give me access to all the clients' names!
Alright. Let's... get on.
We've established that you're a thief and a liar.
Now, what is the degree?
Are you a compulsive thief?
A pathological liar?
- What difference does it make?
- Some!
It makes some difference... to me.
Have you ever been in jail?
Certainly not.
I know you'll never believe me now, and it's my own fault.
It's true about Strutt. I did it.
I don't know why.
I just kind of went crazy, I guess, but...
Old Mr Strutt was so -
Oh, I hated him!
Like you hate me?
Oh, no, not you.
Clean up your face.
Come on.
Good afternoon.
- What'll you folks have?
- A frank and a coffee, please.
- Same for me.
- (Waitress) Okey-doke.
Let's get on with that little discussion.
The chronic use of an alias is not consistent with your story of sudden temptation and unpremeditated impulse.
What if you'd stolen almost $1 0,000?
Wouldn't you change your name?
Oh, what's the use? Why should I even try to make you understand?
I'm not only trying to understand you,
I'm trying to believe you!
- Why?
- Because, damn it, I want to!
Can you understand that?
Here you are, folks.
Mark?
The reasons for what I did at Rutland's, they were so mixed up, what I wanted to say before.
I needed to get away, can't you see?
Away from Rutland's.
Don't you understand?
Things were - We were -
So we were.
Was that any reason to run away?
Yes. I thought it was time
I got out before I got hurt.
I mean, why try to kid myself?
- Are you called Margaret?
- Marnie.
- Oh, God, Mark, if you let me go -
- I can't let you go, Marnie.
Somebody's got to take care of you and help you. I can't turn you loose.
If I let you go, I 'm criminally and morally responsible.
Then what -
Marnie. Yeah, that suits you.
Alright, Marnie, this is how it's gonna be.
I'm driving you back to Philadelphia.
Tonight we'll go to the house.
Tomorrow you'll go to Rutland's.
You' ll see that Susan's key finds its way back into her purse.
How can I go back to Rutland's?
You' re covered. I replaced the money.
When I called yesterday and found you'd pulled out,
I knew instantly what had happened.
So I went to Rutland's and checked Ward's safe.
Figured the loss and replaced it.
Then I set out to find you.
Remember at the races when you were hot about Telepathy?
You'd said you'd watched him training as a two-year-old.
That's all I had to go on, so I looked him up, and found he'd been bred by a Colonel Marston of Virginia.
I phoned Marston and asked him if anyone there had horses for hire.
He gave me the names of three.
Yesterday I drove up to the plains, checked out the stables. No luck.
But at the last place, the man said why didn't I try Garrod's over by Middleburg?
(Waitress) You folks be sure and come back now.
Why are you taking me back to Wykwyn?
Because I don't trust you not to run away.
How can I run away?
You have the receipt, the post office key,
- my name.
- Margaret Edgar.
You sure that's all the name you have?
You sure you haven't misplaced an old husband or two in your travels?
I told you I 've never been married.
- Near misses?
- No!
And no lovers, no steadies, no beaus, no gentlemen callers, nothing!
OK. Eat up.
- Mark, I'd like to go freshen up.
- Uh-uh.
You're fresh enough. Come on.
You know, I can't believe you, Marnie.
There must've been a great many men interested in you.
I didn't say men weren't interested in me. I wasn't interested in them.
- Never?
- No!
That is... not until -
- Why me?
- Because you were different, Mark.
It won't wash, Marnie.
But it's true! I really liked you.
Yes, I think you did.
But don't try to make it sound like any more than that.
When we get home,
I'll explain that we had a lover's quarrel. That you ran away.
That I went after you and brought you back.
That'll please Dad. He admires action.
Then I ' ll explain that we' re gonna be married before the week is out, therefore you should stay on at Wykwyn.
That I can't bear to have you out of my sight.
He also admires wholesome animal lust.
We 'll be married just as soon as the law allows.
We 'll catch an outbound boat.
Where do you want to go?
- You ever been to the South Seas?
- What are you trying to pull?
I 'm trying to pull... a proposal.
Let's see, how shall I phrase it?
- How ' bout: Will you be mine?
- You're crazy!
- You're out of your mind!
- That's a possibility.
The name. Marnie. Yes, I'll just go on calling you Marnie.
That's easily explained. Pet name.
But the Taylor.
We'll just have to marry you off as Mary Taylor. It's perfectly legal.
You can sign yourself Minnie Q Mouse on a marriage licence, you're still legally married.
But you know what I am.
I ' m Minnie Q Thief!
I 'm - I 'm a thief and a liar!
It seems to be my misfortune to have fallen in love with a thief and a liar.
In love?
Oh, Mark, if you love me, you'll let me go.
Just let me go, Mark, please.
Mark, you don't know me.
Listen to me, Mark. I am not like other people. I know what I am!
I doubt that you do, Marnie.
We'll just have to deal with whatever it is that you are.
Whatever you are, I love you.
It's horrible, I know.
But I do love you.
You don't love me.
I'm just something you've caught!
You think I'm some kind of animal you've trapped.
That's right, you are.
And I've caught something really wild this time, haven't I?
I've tracked you and caught you, and by God, I'm gonna keep you!
Oh, and, Marnie, when we get home, no cute ideas about absconding with the Wykwyn silver.
Just get a grip on yourself for one short week and after that you can take legal possession.
Like you?
Like you take legal possession?
Yes, if you want to put it that way.
Somebody's gotta take on the responsibility for you, Marnie.
And it narrows down to a choice of me or the police, ol' girl.
- Indispensable.
- (Rutland Chuckling)
Ah, Cousin Bob, I almost forgot.
Do you have the old necessary?
Have fun, my dear.
Traveller's checks in this.
Letter of credit in this.
Thanks, old man. Will you see about having my car picked up at the airport?
Bob is our banking cousin.
A very handy fellow.
Take care, Lil.
We'll send you a noble savage.
- Goodbye, Dad.
- Bye, Mark.
Thank you, Dr Gillian. Without you it wouldn't have been legal.
It's been a pleasure.
(Rutland) Let's go finish the champagne and cake before they spirit it away.
Really splendid cake, you know?
I attended to that myself.
I've made the acquaintance of one of those excellent Horn and Hardart executives.
That engagement ring must have been at least five carats.
Six and a half.
Blue-white. Perfect stone.
His mother left perfectly good jewellery.
It's just sitting there at the bank.
He wanted her to have something that had never belonged to anyone else.
But six and a half carats!
And cashing in a bond to pay for a ring.
But he didn't pay for it.
He charged it.
I helped him pick it out.
It cost $42,000... plus tax.
Did you say $42,000?
The man's deranged.
You know what he did to me last Saturday?
He came out to the club waving a check for $7,000, and insisted that I break up my golf game, go in and open the bank, and hand over to him $7,000.
Then he drew out -
Well, let ' s just say, enough to pay for this trip, plus the letter of credit.
He cashed that very nice bond against my advice, made me get him the money.
Ten thousand in small bills.
And when I asked him why he wanted $10,000 in small bills, he said,
"Well, old man, I'm being blackmailed, and they specified small bills. "
I know that most people find Mark's humour charming.
I do not. There is nothing charming about running through -
Including the unpaid bill for a ring, approximately $70,000 in one week.
A $6,000 or $7,000
South Seas honeymoon, conservatively speaking, and a $42,000 ring.
All that money spent to celebrate what?
This meager, furtive little wedding?
He didn't even ask Mother.
"Pay off Strutt."
Strutt.
Booze?
Shall I, uh, fix you a drink?
Would you like some bourbon to brush your teeth?
(Marnie) No, thank you.
Contrary to the movies and the Ladies Home Journal, the battleground of marriage is not, I repeat, not, the... bedroom.
The real field of battle is the bath.
It is in the bath and for the bath, that the lines are drawn and no quarter given.
It seems to me, we are getting off to a dangerously poor start, darling.
You've been in the bathroom exactly 47 minutes.
You can have the bath now.
Thank you.
You're very sexy with your face clean.
Marnie, come here.
Sit down.
I... can't! I can't! I can't!
For God's sake, Marnie!
I can't stand it! I'll die!
If you touch me again, I'll die!
I promise I won't touch you. Just get out of that damn corner, please.
Now, suppose you tell me what this is all about.
Is it your own little way of saying you don't find me particularly attractive?
I told you not to marry me.
I told you!
Oh, God, why couldn't you have just let me go?
Marnie.
- Don't! Please, don't!
- Let me fix you a drink.
- I don't want a drink.
- A brandy -
I don't want it. Just leave me alone!
Not till I find out what's the matter, and some way to help.
The only way you can help me is to leave me alone!
Can't you understand? Isn't it clear?
I cannot bear to be handled!
- By anybody? Or just me?
- You. Men.
Really?
You didn't seem to mind at my office that day, or at the stables.
And all this last week
I've handled you.
I've kissed you many times.
Why didn't you break out into a cold sweat and back into a corner then?
- I thought I could stand it if I had to.
- I see.
Have you always felt like this?
- Always, yes!
- Why? What happened to you?
Happened? Nothing.
Nothing happened to me.
I just never wanted anybody to touch me!
You ever tried to talk about it, to a doctor or somebody who could help you?
No, why should I?
I didn't want to get married.
It's degrading. It's animal!
Anyway, I was doing alright the way I was.
I wouldn't say that. If I hadn't caught you, you'd have gone on stealing.
- No. No I wouldn't
- Yes, you would, again and again.
Eventually, you would've got caught by somebody.
You're such a tempting little thing.
Some other sexual blackmailer would've got his hands on you.
The chances of it being someone as permissive as me are pretty remote.
Sooner or later, you'd have gone to jail.
Or been cornered in an office by some old bull of a businessman who was out to take what he figured was coming to him.
You'd probably have got him and jail.
So I wouldn't say you were doing alright, Marnie.
- I'd say you needed help.
- I don't need your help.
I don't think you're capable of judging what you need.
What you do need, I expect, is a psychiatrist.
Oh... men!
Say "no thanks to one", and bingo, you're a candidate for the funny farm.
It would be hilarious if it weren't pathetic.
Let's try to get some rest, hm?
We'll talk this out tomorrow.
There's nothing to talk out.
I've told you how I feel.
I'll feel the same way tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that!
Alright, Marnie. We won't talk about it until you want to.
But we're gonna be on this damn boat for many days and nights.
Let's drop this for the present and try to get through this bloody honeymoon cruise with as much grace as possible.
Let's try at least to be... kind to each other.
Oh. Kind!
Alright, if that's too much,
I'll be kind to you,
- and you'll be polite to me -
- You won't -
I won't.
I give you my word.
Now, let's try to get some rest, hm? How 'bout it?
You in your bed over there, and me, light years away in mine here.
Thank you.
I think I'd like to stay out here for a while, but... thank you.
You're gonna bring a little pazazz down to the old farm, my dear.
I noticed before we left,
Dad was pulling out his silk shirts.
What do you mean, what will I do with myself?
I had of course assumed
I would become a society hostess.
In Africa, in Kenya, there's quite a beautiful flower.
It's coral coloured with little green-tipped blossoms, rather like a hyacinth.
If you reach out to touch it, you'd discover that the flower was not a flower at all, but a design made up of hundreds of tiny insects called Fattid bugs.
They escape the eyes of hungry birds by living and dying in the shape of a flower.
I'll close the door, if you don't mind.
The light bothers me.
Hm, what's that, dear?
The light? Oh, yes, of course.
You've been an absolute darling about my sitting up reading so late.
I'm boning up on marine life since entomology doesn't seem to be your subject, and I 'm eager to find a subject,
Marnie, any subject.
Alright. Here's a subject.
How long? How long do we have to stay on this boat, this trip?
How long before we can go back?
Why, Mrs Rutland!
Can you be suggesting that these halcyon honeymoon days and nights, just the two of us alone together... should ever end?
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to bed.
I've told you the light from the sitting room bothers me.
We certainly can't have anything bothering you, can we?
If you don't want to go to bed, please get out.
But I do want to go to bed, Marnie.
I very much want to go to bed.
(Screams) No!
I'm sorry, Marnie.
Why the hell didn't you jump over the side?
The idea was to kill myself, not feed the damn fish.
Mark!
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Was Fiji grisly?
We didn't get to Fiji. We jumped ship in Honolulu and flew back.
We had to take a cab from the airport.
We're tired and grimy.
Remember when you were six?
You wanted to go to New York.
I warned you then that travelling was a nasty business.
You poor thing.
You must be exhausted.
I think that we'll go after the first drink and pop up to bed.
The travel lecture will have to wait for morning.
- Where's the rest of your luggage?
- A t the airport.
I ' ll have breakfast with you in the morning, dad. See you then, Lil.
Come on, Marnie. It's not exactly a house of correction, you know.
Look, Marnie, for the present all we've got is the facade, and we 've got to live it.
Dad has breakfast downstairs at 8::30 every morning.
I always join him. So, naturally, as you want to be with me as -
This is the drill, dear.
Wife follows husband to front door.
Gives and or gets a kiss.
Stands pensively as he drives away.
Oh, a wistful little wave is optional.
Mark, are you... going to the office?
On the first day back after our honeymoon? How indelicate.
No, I'm going down the road on a little errand. I'll see you later.
Mark, I, um...
I don't have any money.
I'm sorry, Marnie. I'll have Bob make out an account for you.
It won't be much for a while. You see,
I've had a lot of heavy expenses.
And you might as well know
I 've paid off Strutt.
Anonymously, of course.
- (Marnie) But that's all over!
- So?
(Marnie) So, you've given away $10,000, so you' re a prize fool!
Possibly, but they don't put you in jail for being a fool.
I'm not the one the cops are after.
Not yet.
And I don't intend to be.
Not if I can prevent it.
Perhaps you, madam, but not me.
Hello, Mama?
No, I 'm alright.
I 'm perfectly alright now.
I had a bad case of the flu and just didn't feel up to writing.
I couldn't. I had laryngitis too.
Yes, I am still a little hoarse.
Look, Mama, I can't talk long.
I just called to tell you that I'm alright and I'll send some money soon.
No, I can't. I don't know when
I'll get to Baltimore.
But not for a few weeks anyway.
But I'll talk to you soon.
If you need anything, write to me at the post office box in Philadelphia.
I've got to go now, Mama.
Goodbye. Goodbye, Mama.
Oh, Forio! Oh, beauty!
Well, she said she could ride a little.
- Mark?
- Hm?
Mark, listen. I'm a good fighter if you need me.
I mean, if you are in some kind of trouble.
I have absolutely no scruples.
I'd lie to the police or anything.
What on earth are you talking about?
I heard you and Marnie this morning right out here.
- Heard?
- OK, I eavesdropped.
We should've made you go to college or come out or something.
- I can see that now.
- Don't patronise me, Mark.
That Mary-Marnie, brown-haired blonde you married so fast and sneaky and tried to hustle off to the South Pacific!
I didn't have to overhear stuff about your not intending to go to jail too, to know that you're in some sort of fix.
- Please, Mark, will you let me help?
- Alright, you can help.
You can help by being nice to Marnie.
She needs a friend.
I always thought that a girl's best friend was her mother.
Poor old Mark.
Is her mother that ghastly?
When the in-laws are so grim, you don't invite them to the wedding.
The usual excuse is poor health or the strain of the trip, you know?
But to claim they're dead, now, come on!
Alright, Lil, what is it you're up to?
Out with it.
Me? I'm just offering you my services.
Guerrilla fighter, perjurer, intelligence agent.
- Alright, intelligence agent.
- Baltimore.
There's a mother in Baltimore.
Marnie made a phone call this morning.
She said she hadn't been able to write because she 'd had the flu.
She didn 't know when she 'd go to
Baltimore, but she 'd send money.
She said to go on writing to her at the same post office box.
I listened through the library door.
She's having you on, Lil.
It's some sort of gag.
You've been ratty. She's set out to teach you some manners.
- You're being had, Lil.
- You can say that again!
But I don't want to say it again.
I don't want to have to say it again.
Alright, Mark.
You seem to be growing up, Lil.
I expect what we should do is find you some young man.
- What's your type?
- I was waiting for you.
I'm queer for liars.
Really? Well, what sort of liar do you fancy?
We could run an ad. Do you prefer an indoor liar or an outdoor liar?
Playboy or Field and Stream?
Anybody home? Hi! Where's Marnie?
She and Dad are still out riding.
He is taking her over the hunt country.
Big deal! She's going to ride with the hunt.
And Dad's throwing some kind of bash to introduce her.
- Has a long-distance call come in?
- No. Not that I know of.
- (Phone Ringing)
- I'll get it.
(Mark) Hello. Yes.
Hold on, I want to take it on another phone.
I ' ll take it upstairs.
Hang up as soon as I get it.
Uh, Lil, you will hang up, won't you?
OK, Lil.
Hello? Yes I ' ll talk to him now.
Hello, Mr Boyle. Found anything interesting down there?
Hold on. Let me get a pencil.
OK, ready.
Bernice Edgar.
1 1 6 Van Buren Street, Baltimore.
Yeah, I got that. Go on.
Wait a minute!
You say she killed him?
Well, when was that?
That means the little girl must've been about five, is that right?
Well, what happened to her?
No, not the woman. The child.
I want to know what happened to the little girl, the daughter.
No, no! Stay on there.
Get me anything else you can.
Look, have photostats made of all the court records.
Send them to me immediately.
Yes, to my office. Registered.
You're doing an excellent job, Mr Boyle.
(Lil) Did you have a good ride?
Yeah. Ah, Mr Boyle, get the photostats to me. Yes.
And call me the minute you get anything further on the child.
Thank you.
I'll expect to hear from you.
Goodbye.
- (Tapping Continues)
- Mama? Oh, Mama, don't cry.
Please don't cry, Mama.
- (Tapping)
- No! No!
Mama?
Mama, don't cry.
- (Tapping Continues)
- No!
Mama? Mama?
- (Knocking At Door)
- Mama?
- Mama?
- Wake up, Marnie.
- Mama?
- Marnie?
Mama? Oh, don't hurt my mama.
- Marnie.
- Please don't hurt my mama!
- Marnie.
- (Gasps) Oh, don't, don't!
- What's going on?
- She's having a nightmare.
- No, Mama. Mama?
- Marnie, wake up, it's just a nightmare.
- She's alright.
- I'm cold.
That's supposed to be your department, isn't it, ol' boy?
Good night, all.
- Let me get you a brandy.
- Uh-uh.
Where did you get these things?
I can get more anytime I want them.
Yeah, of course you can. You can also find, at your convenience, heights, ropes, ovens, even plastic bags.
The world's full of alternatives.
I'd like to go back to sleep now.
Why? Your sleep seems even less agreeable than your waking hours.
That, uh, dream.
You know, you've had it before.
Is it about something that really happened to you?
No, I... I don't know what it means. Nothing.
Well, it's about your mother.
She wants you to get up.
Yes, but first there are the three taps.
And then she says, "Get up, Marnie.
You have to get up now!"
But I don't want to. If I -
If I get up, I'll be cold and they'll hurt her!
Who? Who'll hurt her?
Th-Th- Them!
I don't know! I don't know!
But I hear the noises.
I'm cold and I hear the noises!
What noises? What are they like?
Who makes them?
You Freud, me Jane?
If you won't see an analyst, why don't you try to help yourself?
But that's why I'm in this trap, from trying to help myself.
Just leave me alone, Mark, please.
If I give you some books, will you read them?
Your new homework?
Frigidity In Women?
The Psychopathic Delinquent and Criminal?
- Have you read them?
- I don't need to read that muck to know that women are stupid and feeble and that men are filthy pigs!
In case you didn't recognise it, that was a rejection.
I want you to read them.
Start with The Undiscovered Self.
Oh, for God's sake, Mark, leave me alone! I'm tired!
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Because I think you're sick, ol' dear.
I'm sick?
Well, take a look at yourself, ol' dear.
You're so hot to play
Mental Health Week, what about you?
Talk about dream worlds. You've got a pathological fix on a woman, who's not only an admitted criminal but who screams if you come near her!
So what about your dreams, Daddy dear?
I never said I was perfect.
That was quite a speech.
It encourages me to believe that you have leafed through one or two books.
Which one did you find the most interesting?
You're really dying to play doctor, aren't you?
OK, I'm a big movie fan.
I know the games.
Come on. Let's play.
Shall I start with dreams or should we free-associate?
Oh, Doctor, I'll bet you're just dying to free-associate.
Alright now, you give me a word and I ' ll give you an association.
You know, like: needles, pins; when a man marries, trouble begins.
You ready?
Well, come on! I thought you wanted to play doctor, so let's play!
- Water.
- Bath. Soap. Cleanse.
Pure. Made pure for me.
"And his tears shall wash away thy sins and make thee over again."
Baptists. Mother used to take me to church. Twice on Sundays.
There. I'm not holding back at all, am I?
You're bringing me out marvellously, Doctor.
You'll have me up on my poor paralysed little legs by the next scene. Go on.
- Air.
- Stare.
And that's what you do.
Stare and blare and say you care, but you're unfair, you want a pair.
- Sex.
- Masculine, Feminine,
Adam and Eve, Jack and Jill.
I'll slap your filthy face if you come near me again, Jack!
- Death.
- Me. Oh, listen, Mark -
- Needles.
- Pins.
- Black
- White
- Red!
- White. White!
It's alright, Marnie.
Darling, come here.
I won't let anything bad happen to you. You're alright.
- You're alright.
- Oh, help me!
Help me. Oh, God, somebody help me!
(Butler) What name, sir?
- Strutt.
- (Butler) Mr and Mrs Strutt.
Mr Strutt, Mrs Strutt? How do you do?
I 'm Lil Mainwaring,
Mark's sister-in-law.
- So good of you to come all this way.
- So nice of you to ask us.
Wait till tomorrow, Charlie.
Wait till you see her on a horse, eh?
- I'm not a bit nervous, Mark.
- You have no reason to be.
You're unquestionably the best-looking woman here.
The best-dressed. The most intelligent.
And you're with me.
- I think everyone's here.
- Well, Lil's scorekeeper.
She has the list, made the table arrangements and everything.
I'm afraid I wasn't much help, but I'll do better next time.
You're doing well enough.
I suppose we should keep... circulating.
Why?
- Why?
- I don't know. I swear I don't know.
He wasn't invited here.
He's never been invited here.
- It's Lil!
- Lil?
- She doesn't even know Strutt.
- It's Lil!
Get me out of here please.
It's too late. Here they come.
Look, call his bluff. I'll back you up.
- Oh, hello, Strutt. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
- We haven't met. I am Mark Rutland.
- How do you do?
- And this is my wife.
- How do you do?
Well, this is a surprise.
I hadn't heard about your marriage.
You know, we all think a great deal of your husband.
We've been doing business with the Rutlands... for a long time.
- I believe we've met before.
- I don't think so.
Think again... Mrs Rutland.
Are you just recently married?
Marnie and I have been married for two months.
But we've known each other quite well for four years.
Four years? Before Estelle...
Yes, didn't you know?
Darling, Betty seems rather stranded over there.
You' ll have to excuse us for a few moments, Mrs Strutt.
Oh, and Lil, would you see that
Mr and Mrs Strutt's glasses are kept brimming?
That's a good girl.
- I'm going to be sick.
- You're not going to be sick.
You said we'd known each other four years. Lil thought -
I don't give one infinitesimal damn what Lil thought or thinks.
- Dinner is ready, sir.
- Good. Announce it.
Dinner is served.
Mr Strutt, my wife's taken a fancy to you. Will you see her into dinner?
Five minutes! I 'm five minutes behind you, and in those five minutes you've got yourself up like a cat burglar and packed for a world cruise.
I've got to get out of here, and you've got to let me go.
That man is going to send me to jail.
You know he is!
What are you using for guts this season?
Don't you understand?
He's coming back here tomorrow and he's coming for my head!
We just won't give it to him.
Strutt may be throbbing away with vengeful fantasies, but the fact is he's a businessman, he's in the business of doing business.
- So?
- So we try to do business.
The Rutland account is one of the biggest he's got.
If he insists on acting like the swine he is, then... and he'll lose others too.
I'll see to it, but first I'll see to it that he understands I'll see to it.
You can keep him from prosecuting, you can't keep him from talking.
I don't care if he outtalks every
Southern senator on Capitol Hill.
Well, I do. I care.
Darling, didn't your mother ever tell you about sticks and stones?
Can't you understand there may be other... things involved, other people that I don't want to hear about me?
Yes, I can understand, but since you're the well-known orphan child, who's to care?
The police, damn you.
What can the police do if we can stop
Strutt from prosecuting?
They can start investigating other jobs. Other similar jobs.
- Well, that's something else again.
- Yes, it is.
How many? How many other jobs?
Tell me the truth, damn it! You've nothing to gain by lying to me now!
- How many jobs have you pulled?
- Three.
- Try again.
- Four. Five counting Strutt.
Over how long a period?
Five years, and that's the truth, I swear!
- Alright. How much? How much?
- Under $50,000.
What towns?
Buffalo, Detroit, Elizabeth, New Jersey and New York.
Well, in New York and Philadelphia,
I ' ll be poor old Mark Rutland who lost his head over a pretty girl.
In the others I'm just an accessory after the fact and equally liable under the law.
Well, then let me go! They can't blame you because you didn't know!
After you found out, I ran away.
Just let me go!
If I let you run out now, nothing could keep the lid on it.
They've got your real name. They'll work up a complete dossier on you.
When they finally catch you, and they will catch you, they'll throw the
New York City Library at you.
But, suppose we don't lose our heads?
All we've got to fight is Strutt's big mouth. That gives us time.
Sit down. Listen.
We can do one of two things.
We can hire a lawyer and a psychiatrist, and make an immediate voluntary confession and an offer of restitution.
That'll make the whole thing public.
But the chances are very good that you' ll get a suspended sentence.
Now the alternative.
We can go together and make private calls on all the places you've robbed.
You'll express deep sorrow and repentance, sincere and vocal contrition.
And while you sob, I show a check for the amount stolen.
Press it into their hands and ask as a special favour to a distraught husband, to withdraw the charge.
But if one of them says,
"Thanks, I'll take the money, but I won't drop the charge, " then we 've had it.
After that it's an open court case, and very probable sentence.
On the other hand, with a bit of luck we might pull it off.
Think it over.
It's late. You better get some sleep.
You gotta be up for the hunt.
You don't expect me to ride in the hunt!
Certainly I expect you to ride.
For one thing, I want you out of the house when Strutt comes here.
For another, I don't want to give Lil the satisfaction of seeing you chicken.
And, Marnie, tonight the door stays open.
Forio!
A gun! Give me a gun!
My horse is screaming!
- Get me a gun!
- You want to shoot your horse?
Hey, wait a minute!
I can't give you a gun, my mister isn't home. I don't know what he'd -
You must be crazy!
Mrs Turpin!
Miss Mainwaring, this woman comes tearing in here demandin' I give her a gun.
Tell this fool to give me a gun.
Forio 's hurt!
Marnie, wait. I ' ll call a vet.
There's nothing a vet can do.
We don't have a phone anyway, Miss Mainwaring.
If the horse is hurt bad,
I could give her Jack's pistol.
Hurry. Oh, hurry, please.
He's suffering.
Go get the gun!
I'll do it, Marnie. You wait here.
Are you still in the mood for killing?
Please, Marnie!
Stay out of my way!
Marnie, please!
If you don't want me to do it, then let me go back for one of the men.
There.
There now.
So you can see, Mr Strutt, how very disadvantageous, any action on your part would be for everyone.
For me, certainly.
For a sick girl... and for you.
Yes, I 'm sure that's the fashionable attitude, Mr Rutland.
But just wait until you've been victimised.
(Mark) Try to look at the situation from a business point of view.
(Strutt) Yes.
(Mark) We 've been business friends for a number of years now.
(Mark) I want you to apply them all for my benefit.
(Strutt) Hm.
- (Phone Ringing)
- Oh, sorry.
Hello.
Yes, Lil, what is it?
Yes, I understand.
I 'm hanging up now.
You' ll have to forgive me, I 've had a bit of trouble at the hunt.
I'll talk to you again, possibly tomorrow. I'm sorry to run out.
I'll take you home, Marnie.
It's alright, darling.
You're just exhausted.
Now, don't panic.
I've spoken to Strutt. I think
I'll be able to talk him around.
I'll just put this away.
Go on. You want the money.
You wanted the money, or you wouldn't have taken my keys, would you?
You took the keys, now take the money!
I said take it!
What's mine belongs to you.
It's yours!
You're not stealing.
You want the money, take it.
I said take it!
Marnie, now we're going to
Baltimore to see your mother.
- No!
- Yes.
Come on.
So, I knew you'd run away, and you'd want money.
It didn't take me a minute to find out the office drawer key was gone.
If you tell my mother about me,
I'll kill you.
If you mean about the robberies,
I've no intention of telling her anything.
It's your mother who's going to do the talking.
Marnie, come on.
- No!
- Come on.
- It's alright, Marnie. You're inside.
- (Mama) What in the wide world -
I'm sorry to crash in on you like this, Mrs Edgar.
I guess you know how Marnie feels about storms.
Marnie, stop acting like such a ninny.
Who are you, mister?
You're not Mr Pendleton.
No, I 'm not.
Who 's Mr Pendleton?
Then what have you got to do with my Marnie?
I'm Mark Rutland,
Marnie's husband, Mrs Edgar.
Marnie hasn't been very well.
I don't believe she 's been well since your accident.
My what?
I think you've always called it "your accident."
What do you think you' re talking about?
Comin' into my house like this, talking about my accident!
You're not married to Marnie.
I don't believe you.
- Marnie?
- Your daughter needs help, Mrs Edgar.
You've got to tell her the truth.
She has no memory of what happened that night.
And she needs to remember everything!
You must help her.
Mister, you must be plumb crazy.
If you won't tell her, I will.
I know everything that happened.
- I'll tell her the whole story.
- Oh, no you won't, because you don't know the whole story, and nobody does but me!
Oh. Well, since you're so very knowledgeable, Mrs Edgar, do you also know that your daughter, your beautiful, young daughter, cannot stand to have a man touch her? Any man?
She doesn't know why, but you do.
Don't you think you owe it to her to help her to understand what happened
- to make her like this?
- What matters what made her?
She's lucky to feel like that!
Just plain lucky!
That's very interesting, Mrs Edgar.
But I've had an investigator working here.
I 've read the transcript. Hm?
The records of your trial for murder.
In the records it states quite plainly that you made your living from the touch of men.
It was one of your clients that you killed that night.
Oh, God!
Was there also a storm that night, Mrs Edgar?
Is that why Marnie's terrified of storms?
Was there thunder and lightning that night?
Did the storms terrify your little girl, in addition to everything else that happened?
Get out of my house.
You get out!
I don't need any filthy man comin' in my house no more!
Do you hear me? You get out!
You get out of my house! (Screaming)
You get out!
You let my mama go!
You hear? You let my mama go!
- You're hurtin' my mama!
- Who am I, Marnie?
- Why should I want to hurt your mama?
- You' re one of them.
- One of them in the white suits.
- Shut up, Marnie!
No! Remember, Marnie.
Tell us how it all was.
The white suits! Remember?
What does the tapping mean, Marnie?
Why does it make you cry?
It means... they want in.
Them in their white suits.
Mama comes and gets me out of bed.
I don't like to get out of bed.
Come on, Marnie.
Get up. Alright?
Good girl.
That's my baby.
There.
There. Mm.
- You go on back to sleep, sugarpop.
- Bernice.
- (Thunderclap)
- (Sobbing)
Now, you ain't afraid of a little bit of lightning, are you? Huh?
What happens next, Marnie?
He - He come out... to me.
Oh, I don't like him.
He - He smells funny.
Your old captain's gonna be here all through the night.
There's no reason to cry.
I want my mama!
I don't want you! Let me go! Mama!
Get your damn hands off my kid!
What are you trying to -
What are you -
Mama?
Make him go, Mama.
I don't like him to kiss me.
Make him go, Mama!
Get your hands - Get your hands -
There's nothing the matter with my hands!
(Mark) What is it, Marnie?
What's the matter?
He hit my mama!
No! No! What's the matter with you?
You crazy or drunk?
Now, don't go hittin' me.
You're gonna get hit yourself.
- (Screams)
- Oh, my leg!
- Mama?
- Is your mother hurt?
- How? How is she hurt?
- He fell on her.
Oh, she's so hurt! Oh, Mama.
Marnie! Marnie, help me!
I got to help my mama!
Marnie?
I hit him!
I hit him with a stick. I - I hurt him!
There. There now.
- (Screams, Sobs)
- (Screams)
You're alright now, darling.
You're alright.
It's all over.
You're alright.
I thought when she lost her memory of that night, it was a sign of God's forgiveness.
I thought I was being given another chance to change everything, to make it all up to her.
I 'm sorry, Mrs Edgar.
Truly sorry.
Your mother told the police that she'd killed the sailor in self-defense.
They could see how bad hurt I was.
They believed me.
And I never told anyone the truth.
Never.
Not even when they tried to take you away from me, Marnie.
Not even then.
You must've loved me, Mama.
You must've loved me!
You're the only thing in this world I ever did love.
And after the accident, when I was in the hospital, they tried to make me let you be adopted.
But I wouldn't.
I wanted you.
And I promised God right then, if he'd let me keep you, and you not remember,
I'd bring you up different from me.
Decent.
Decent?
Oh, Mama!
Well, you surely realised your ambition.
I certainly am decent.
Of course I'm a cheat, and a liar and a thief, but I am decent.
Marnie, it's time to have a little compassion for yourself.
When a child, a child of any age, Marnie, can't get love, it takes what it can get, any way it can get it.
It's not so hard to understand.
Get up, Marnie, you' re aching my leg.
There. That's better.
Mark?
Wha - What am I going to do?
What's going to happen?
What do you want to happen?
I guess I... I want it all cleared up.
Will I -
Will I go to jail?
No. Not after what
I have to tell them.
We'll go now.
Ah, Mrs Edgar, I'll bring Marnie back.
She's very tired now.
Goodbye, Mama.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, sugarpop.
Oh, Mark,
I don't want to go to jail.
I'd rather stay with you.
Had you, love?

Directed by
MARIO BAVA
What's got into you?
Why did you come here?
Don't you realise that Isabella could see us?
- Have you got any?
- No.
I can't take this any more.
If I don't get some soon
I'll go crazy.
Don't be like that, Franco.
Have you tried asking lsabella?
We had an argument.
She even stole what I had, damn her.
Try to hang on in there.
When I've finished work we'll find some.
Trust me. I'll help you.
Now go.
I'm counting on you.
Thanks. I'll be waiting.
Bye.
Isabella.
Your scarf.
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's wrong?
The sign's fallen off again.
- Do you want me to go and fix it?
- No, not tonight.
You can do it in the morning.
Same old story...
Isabella's late again.
I don't know what's wrong with that girl.
This is the third time.
There's no need to get angry, just give her a hefty fine. l certainly will, and I'll fire her if she's as late as she was yesterday.
- Good night, Madame.
- Good night.
Nicole.
Look at this dress.
Try to take more care of the clothes.
There's another show tomorrow.
Look at this.
- I'Il be more careful. sorry.
- You're always rushing off out of here.
You're all the same, that's all you think about.
What does she expect? she's so annoying.
It's not easy being a widow.
Isabella!
No, thanks.
- How Iong were the lights off?
- Ten minutes.
How long had the girl worked for you?
About two years.
What was she like?
Very lively.
A bit unruly, but there's nothing bad I couId say about her.
As far as you know, did she have a lot of friends?
Inspector,
I'm not going to be much help here.
I'm the managing director.
You should ask the two girls who lived with her.
I can't believe it. Such a terrible thing.
I still can't get my head round it.
Poor thing, she was always so cheerful, so...
Come on, stop crying.
It's not going to do any good.
Inspector silvestri, this is Countess
Cristiana, the owner of the company.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Haven't I met you before, madam?
Or am l mistaken?
Yes, we have actually met before.
Because of my husband's accident.
Exactly.
It was a car accident.
I imagine you'Il be able to help me.
You must know alI about your girls.
Inspector, this isn't a boarding school. l don't know or care about what they do when they're not here.
All right,
I'm going to be in the studio.
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.
Come on, Peggy.
Stop crying.
What good is it going to do?
Come on.
What time was it when you went out to fix the sign?
About seven. It was banging and the noise was irritating Madame Cristiana.
I went out and fixed it as best I could.
I protest!
Mr Morlachi,
I demand an expIanation.
I'd only just come through the gates when these men grabbed me.
- Ask the inspector.
- Inspector?
Calm down and tell me why you're here.
- I'm Marquis Riccardo MorelIi...
- All right, but answer my question.
He's come to pick me up.
He's my fiancé.
Fiancé!
- Why are you laughing?
- Because we live together.
Did you know Isabella?
Isabella?
You introduced us once, didn't you?
Yes, I guess I knew her, but only by sight.
I see.
Come on, Peggy.
Be strong.
Stop crying. lt looks like she's the only one who's upset.
They were very good friends.
- Did she live with you two?
- Yes.
Who had she gone out with?
Who was the last person to see her?
I don't know.
Leave her alone. Everybody knows who Isabella's lover was.
- Who are you?
- Cesare Lazzarini, fashion designer.
- Will you tell me his name?
- Whose?
The lover's.
Scalo. Franco scalo, the famous antique dealer.
- Police. Where's the inspector?
- ln there.
I can assure you
I don't know anything.
- Excuse me a second.
- sure.
It's confirmed.
ShalI I go?
- Yes, go.
- All right.
So...
Tell me, what kind of relationship did you have with Isabella?
- We were friends.
- Or lovers?
I'm going to admit to something, but you mustn't be shocked. l don't believe in permanent and everlasting relationships.
I understand.
Do you know what this is?
No, I don't.
- What is it?
- Cocaine.
It was found in your friend Isabella's house.
In Isabella's house?
- so you didn't know about this?
- No.
Never mind.
But I must ask you to remain at my disposal.
I'll see you again.
Autumn Evening.
Turn around.
AlI right, you can go.
Quickly.
- What's wrong, Cesaretto?
- lsabella was supposed to model this.
- You're right.
- Who should I give it to?
Let's see...
- Peggy...
- Not me, please. I can't.
For heaven's sake don't cry or you'Il ruin your make-up.
- Greta, you model it.
- No, l'm sorry, I can't wear it.
- Don't be silIy.
- lt'll bring me bad luck.
- someone's going to have to model it.
- l will.
Good. Come on, hurry up.
Why doesn't that surprise me? she's so cynical.
AlI right, you can go.
Turn round. Good. Walk.
Hold on a second.
Something's missing.
The brooch!
The green brooch.
We can fix that now.
Where is it?
Isabella brought her own.
She kept it in one of these boxes.
Here it is.
Look what l've found.
Isabella kept a diary.
It'll be an interesting read.
Listen. "He's a man who arouses deep and desperate feelings in me.
"I'd be prepared to die for him."
Let me see.
- I don't think we've got the right...
- What are you doing? Are you all mad?
Does this seem like the right time?
Go on, off you go. Get ready.
I think we should give this to the police.
I found it and I'd like to hand it in myself, if you don't mind.
As you wish.
Ray of MoonIight.
- Ηello?
- HeIlo. Hello, Franco.
Why didn't you come?
I was on my way out but I'm not feeling well. You know why.
Sure, I understand.
Try to come right away.
I've got some.
Listen, Franco.
I've found a diary.
- lsabella's diary.
- What?
Isabella's diary?
Who else knows about it?
Everybody, unfortunately. l realised too late that there could be something compromising about you in it.
I kept it and said I'd hand it in to the police.
Good. We'll have time to take a look at it.
- I'll come straight over.
- You don't sound well at all, Franco.
Franco!
Franco, can you hear me?
Yes, Nicole.
Sorry, I can't even breathe. But now you've got some I'll feel better. Bye.
I'll see you soon.
Hurry up, girIs.
Greta, you're on next.
- Everything all right there, Marco?
-Yes, Madame.
- Cesaretto, where were you?
- I'm here.
I looked everywhere for you.
Why do I have to do everything myseIf?
- Nicole?
- What is it?
Telephone call.
- For me?
- Yes, for you.
- Hello?
- Hello. Nicole, is that you?
- Yes. Who's speaking?
- It's Franco.
I can't make it over there.
I feel too ill.
You come over. Please. Now.
I feel like I'm suffocating.
How am I supposed to get away?
AlI right, I'll do my best.
I'll try to come right away.
There, it's all right now.
Peggy, Franco's sick.
He needs me.
I need to rush over and see him.
Will you lend me your car?
But the show's not over yet.
I don't care. Give me the keys but don't let anyone see you.
Hold on.
- Peggy, what are you doing?
- Nothing, just getting my handkerchief.
The alarm switch is hidden in the gIove compartment.
AlI right.
Thank you.
ANTIQUEs
Franco?
- Have fun but don't come home too late.
- Don't worry.
Marco!
I want to keep you company till Tao-Li gets back.
Aren't you scared of being at home on your own?
I'm actually very tired and I'd like to go straight to bed.
But you'lI have to stay up till Nicole brings your car back.
PIease.
AlI right. As you wish.
Come in.
Thank you.
I didn't want to leave you.
I'd have worried about you being alone in that house.
- Clarice, are you still here?
- Good evening, miss.
Yes, I've only just finished.
Didn't Miss Τao-Li come back with you?
She's gone to a party. she'll be home Iater.
Clarice Iooks after us.
I'll be off, then. I left your dinner in the oven to keep it warm.
If Miss Tao-Li wants her concoction, it's ready. she just needs to heat it up.
Thank you, Clarice.
Good night. l'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
Peggy...
- You always refuse to Iisten to me.
- I listen to you.
You don't. And I'm tired of telling you the same thing over and over.
I've told you a thousand times.
Sadly I've fallen in love with you.
But you don't care.
Why not?
Calm down and come here.
You see...
I'm not well.
I know you think I'm besotted, and that drives me insane.
I'm sick, unhappy...
Don't be like that. l understand you.
I'm your friend. Come on, cheer up.
- l'll have one of your cigarettes.
- No! stop! Leave it.
What is it? I just wanted a cigarette.
What have I done?
I'll get it for you.
You'lI mess up my bag otherwise.
Here.
Hello?
Good evening, it's Inspector silvestri.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm calling about your car.
We found it unlocked and abandoned.
Had it been stolen?
No, I lent it to my friend Nicole.
Yes.
Yes, she asked to borrow it so she couId visit a friend who wasn't well.
Has something happened?
I'd rather speak to you about this in person.
I'll come over to your house.
AlI right, I'll be here.
What's going on?
They've found my car but not Nicole.
Oh, God, what's happened to her?
- Is the inspector coming?
- Yes, he wants to speak to me.
I'll be off, then. I'd rather the police didn't find me with you.
Yes, it's best if nobody knows you came here.
Yes, it is best.
Especially for you.
- I'm sorry.
- l'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
"I caught Peggy trying to steal
1 00,000 lire from my bag.
"She started crying and told me she needed it.
"She's pregnant but can't deal with the scandal.
"I lent her the money because I felt sorry for her.
"Tomorrow I'll ask the bastard for 200,000 lire."
WHERE Is THE DIARY?
I burnt it...
I burnt it...
I burnt it!
Miss Peggy?
Good evening.
Sorry, I know it's late for visiting, but this is an urgent matter.
Don't worry.
PIease, have a seat.
What's it about?
Charles, you can go.
I got back a short while ago and found Nicole in my shop... murdered.
My God!
I'd gone to the studio to pick Nicole up.
Remember?
We bumped into each other.
I looked everywhere but I couldn't find her.
So I went back home.
Believe me,
I'll never forget what I saw.
Sorry, but why did you come here instead of going to the poIice?
Nicole was my friend.
She was kiIled in my shop.
The poIice are bound to blame me.
I need an alibi.
- You've got to help me.
- Me? What have I got to do with this?
You're in as much trouble as I am.
We need to say that we were together at the studio until we left.
I'll vouch for you and you'll vouch for me.
- lt's in both of our interests.
- You're insane.
The poIice have no reason to suspect me.
You're the one who's in a fix.
Maybe you really did kill her.
No. Call the police right now or I'll do it.
Go on, then, and you can tell them about the lOUs.
What lOUs?
The IOUs you signed to guarantee a seven million lire loan for lsabella that you couldn't pay.
Is that true?
Riccardo, you didn't telI me. Is it true?
Oh, my God.
My dear Marquis, you haven't got a penny to your name.
You're compIetely ruined and afraid of the scandal.
That's a pretty good reason to kill Isabella and maybe Nicole too, to make sure the police didn't get hold of the diary.
Who knows, maybe all the expiry dates were written in it.
What diary?
I don't know anything about it.
Don't lie, Riccardo. I told you
Nicole had found Isabella's diary.
As you can see, we're tied to each other by a strong thread.
If you don't want the police sticking their noses into your business, you'd better do as l say.
I'll go back to my shop now and call the inspector.
I'll tell him that we were together all the time. All right?
Good night.
Why won't you believe me?
I burnt that diary. lt contained things about me that I didn't want people to know.
I burnt it.
I swear I burnt it.
Believe me.
Believe me!
No!
How did that girl get in here?
- she had a key.
- How come?
I'd given it to her.
- she used to visit me sometimes.
- Her as well?
You mustn't think that I...
I'd left IsabelIa for Nicole.
How many other people had keys to that door?
Nobody else.
- Except me, of course.
- Of course.
Did you take drugs with her too?
- What are you saying, Inspector?
- Come on, scaIo!
Who are you trying to kid?
You've got a drug habit.
It's written all over your face.
I can even teIl you where you get your drugs.
And... as for the girls who, shall we say, keep you company, or who try to fight your habit, like lsabella did, or who take drugs themselves,
Iike this one...
That may welI be the case, but it doesn't mean that I'm a murderer.
Besides, I have an alibi. l was with...
I haven't asked you about that... yet.
We'll talk about it in good time.
- When?
- Right now, in my office.
- Do you recognise it?
- Yes, that's the one.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Hold on. l wrote down the first few numbers.
Here we go... 4, 5, 3.
What did I teIl you?
Did you see if a man or a woman was driving?
A man, definitely.
He was all in black and he didn't seem to have a face.
Maybe he was wearing a mask.
Maybe, l don't know. I looked at him because l heard a horn.
- What horn?
- The car horn, Inspector.
It beeped, but not for very long.
Then suddenly it stopped.
Could there be an alarm connected to the horn, Zanchin?
Hold on, I'll check.
Yes, there is one. It's at the back of the gIove compartment.
- How Iong did it beep for?
- I don't know.
- Not very long, like I said.
- Tell me how long.
That's it.
Pretty much that long.
If you didn't know where it was, you'd take a while to find it.
Right.
But if you did know where it was hidden, you'd only need a few seconds.
Come through.
After you.
Have a good look at these men.
Did you ever see any of them in Miss Peggy's car?
- HeIlo, Mr Morlachi.
- Hello, Clarice.
You know him?
You've seen him in the car?
Of course she's seen me.
In the car and walking, Iots of times.
All perfectly normal.
I didn't say it wasn't.
Let's keep going.
- Him. l saw him in the car.
- Of course. Big deal.
What's the point of this?
It's all a farce.
Be quiet.
You didn't just see me, did you?
Open your eyes, you idiot.
Him, for instance.
You saw him too, didn't you?
Do you only want to know who went in the car with Miss Peggy?
Why?
Because that gentleman came to the house last night.
He came with Miss Peggy.
At Iast we're getting somewhere.
You bastard! What are you trying to insinuate? Do you want to ruin me?
That's enough.
Bloody murderer!
Damn you!
Own up to it. You're the murderer.
Inspector, have him examined.
He's impotent.
That's why he hates women. He'd kill them aIl because he can't have them.
Why don't you tell the inspector that that's why your wife left you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm suffocating.
- HoId his shoulders.
- Calm down.
Take him to the infirmary.
No!
Let me go!
Let me go!
- None of you knew he had epilepsy?
- I didn't know.
You can go.
Goodbye, Clarice.
I'm very sorry but I'm going to have to keep you here, Mr Morlachi, and you too, Mr Lazzarini.
- What does "keep you here" mean?
- It means l'm legally detaining you.
Excuse me, lnspector, but you need a good reason to do that.
Nicole's murderer had been in Peggy's car before because he knew where the alarm switch was hidden.
- Can I go?
- Can I?
No, you'll stay here too.
This is absurd.
I've provided an alibi.
- The marquis confirmed it.
- lt's true. We were together.
Don't worry, gentlemen,
I haven't forgotten.
You were together until gone 1 1 .
Nicole was kiIled after 1 0.
- so why do you need us?
- Well...
When I called Peggy to tell her that we'd found her car, it was about half past 1 1 .
I got to her place a quarter of an hour later, but she was no longer there and the house was in a complete mess.
Maybe they killed her too and hid her body somewhere.
As far as this last event is concerned, gentlemen,
I'd say your aIibi was pretty useless.
It's already nine o'clock.
Why do we have to sit in the dark?
As if we weren't scared enough already.
Do what you want, but try to stay calm.
How can we stay calm?
Aren't you worried about everything that's happened?
I'm scared too, I admit it.
But there's no point in panicking.
I wish some of the men would come back.
We're the only ones left at the studio.
Hello?
Mr Morlachi, at last.
What's happened?
What?
That's ridiculous. Why?
What right do they have?
Oh, yes.
I see.
AlI right.
Of course.
Yes, don't worry.
AlI right.
- They've detained all five of them.
- Why?
Clearly the police believe that one of them is the murderer.
I knew it.
Madame... can we go?
Yes, please go.
Be strong.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I really envy those three living together.
At Ieast they can keep each other company.
- l'm going too, Madame.
- Yes, of course.
Wait... Why don't you come and sleep at my house tonight?
What?
I just live round the corner.
Why should I go all the way to yours out in the country?
I could come and sleep at your house, then.
No, I'm sorry, but I'd rather be on my own.
And I think you'd feel even more afraid at my house.
Aren't you scared on your own?
They lived with you.
Isabella's been killed, and Peggy...
Yes, I know.
But I'm certain that nothing will happen tonight.
AlI the men have been detained and I'm sure one of them is the murderer.
- Good night, Madame.
- Good night.
Madame, I don't want to go home, l want to sleep here.
No, my dear. You need to go
Iike the others. Good night.
But I'm frightened.
I live out of town in a house on its own.
Don't be a baby, Greta.
We've got a big day tomorrow.
Work must go on.
Listen...
Isabella and Nicole were mixed up in a nasty business that doesn't concern us.
We've got nothing to be frightened of.
Do you understand?
Off you go.
Don't worry.
- Good night, Madame.
- Good night.
Good night.
Miss...
Miss, the marquis called to say that something came up and he's stuck in town.
I know.
Can you make me some tea, please?
Right away, miss.
Hello? Hello?
I've brought your tea, miss.
Just a moment, please.
Come in.
Leave it up there, Charles. l can do it myself.
Good night, miss.
Did you see how the murderer attacked that poor girl?
He must have used a red-hot iron.
We're dealing with a madman here.
Or a homicidal sex maniac.
- Who only kills beautiful girIs.
- Exactly.
Perhaps female beauty makes him lose his head and kill.
We're going to have to start again from scratch. lnspector, Forensics are outside if you want to see the footprints in the garden.
The footprints start over there.
The murderer drove up here on this road, got out and walked down the slope to the house.
Τhe prints match the ones found in the studio gardens.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, we took casts of them.
I could have sworn the culprit was one of the five men we detained.
- We'll have to reIease them at once.
- Of course.
This time they reaIly do have a cast-iron alibi.
And I provided them with it.
Riccardo Morelli.
Make sure everything's there.
Massimo Morlachi.
Come in.
Mr Morlachi, I'd Iike to speak to you for a moment if I may.
Yes, dear. Come in.
Mr Morlachi, I'm a caIm woman, l'm not at all nervous.
But I find the thought of a sex maniac prowIing around our studio really very disturbing.
I've decided to take some holiday.
I've booked a seat on the flight to Paris tomorrow.
Paris?
- All right, Tao-Li.
- Thank you.
By the way, are you still living in the countess's house?
- Yes. Why?
- Nothing. Just memories.
When the count was alive
I'd often go and visit them.
It's a beautifuI house.
I remember being able to see all over Rome from the terrace.
Yes, but right now
I'd rather see the rooftops of Paris.
- l don't doubt that. Have fun.
- Goodbye. search as much as you like. I burnt everything that could compromise you.
When I heard you'd been arrested
I got rid of Peggy's body.
They couId have found it.
And I killed Greta to give you an alibi.
Perfect.
Perfect but horrible.
I don't know how I did it.
I'd never have thought
I'd have the strength to kill.
But I did it for you.
I can imagine what it cost you.
But tell me, how did you manage to take Peggy's body to Morelli's house?
I didn't take her there myself.
I just put her in the boot... and Greta did the rest.
Why did you decide to use Greta?
Well, l knew she'd be on her own at home.
- That made everything easier.
- Well done.
The police are convinced they're dealing with a sex maniac.
Isabella, Nicole...
Peggy... and now, with Greta, that makes four.
Stop it.
Sweetheart, what's wrong?
Kiss me.
Are you worried, darling?
What a mess. lt's all because of that stupid idiot Isabella.
Her blackmail had become unbearable.
Money, money and more money.
PreciseIy because she unfortunately found out... that my husband's death wasn't an accident, she should have realised that it was both foolish and dangerous to push it.
But no... No...
The more we gave her, the more she wanted.
- she asked for it.
- she thought she had us on a string.
She felt like she was the only witness to a perfect crime.
Her death wouId have been perfect too, if onIy that bloody diary hadn't cropped up.
But it's all over now.
We've got nothing to worry about now, darling. Nothing at aIl.
No, that's where you're wrong.
Very wrong.
The two of us will never have any peace until we give the police a culprit.
Peace!
Listen to me.
We'll never get away with it unless we put a face to their sex maniac.
UntiI they catch him they'll be watching us.
AlI the girls who were killed worked at the studio.
They've got no proof against us but the case has become a sensation.
It's all over the papers.
The scandal's raging.
We need to find a solution.
So what do you want to do?
I know, darling.
We should go away to the moon.
We need to kilI one last time.
And you'll be the one who does it.
- No.
- Yes.
They're definitely watching me.
Don't worry, darIing,
I'll create a perfect alibi for you.
Stay caIm.
No, Massimo.
You can't ask me to do a thing like that.
I refuse. l can't do it.
Do you understand?
You've done it already.
Yes, you're right,
I've done it already, but I had a very different motive then.
You were in danger.
I had no choice.
I knew that if I didn't do it
I'd have lost you forever.
My love for you gave me the strength to do it.
But it was horrible.
Horrible!
Don't cry. Listen to me.
You need to do what I say.
You have to kill Tao-Li.
You have to make it look like suicide.
Do you understand?
They'Il find the mask by her side and think that she was the culprit.
If we don't do it, everything we've done so far will have been pointless.
You're surprised to see me alive, aren't you, Massimo?
Your plan was certainly very ingenious.
It was going to be perfect, just the way you like it, but you didn't reckon on the shop awning breaking my fall.
PIease...
Be quiet.
I know very well what you'd like to say.
You'd like to deny it.
But I saw you with the jewels.
You planned everything.
Only you knew that I'd use the ledge if I was in danger.
Remember? You were the one who suggested it. It was your idea.
Cristiana,
I swear it was an accident.
Do you really still think that you can fool me?
Yes...
Yes, it was a very ingenious plan.
They'd have found me dressed like this and everything would have been clear and you'd have been free.
Now I understand why you wanted to marry me in secret and in such a hurry.
You were so in Iove with me. so in love.
You were, but with my villa, the house, the studio, my money...
You wanted to get your hands on everything I own by killing me.
Cristiana, I beg you...
You're wrong, darling.
It's not true.
It's not true.
You're imagining it all, darling.
Believe me.
I swear, Cristiana...
It was just an accident.
I didn't mean it to happen.
How could you think that?
I love you, darling, so much.
We'll go away.
We'll be together forever.
I'll never leave you.
Police...
Get me...
Get me Inspector silvestri...
Stop! Stop! Help!
I've dropped my purse.
It's got all my money in it.
Thirty-five cents.
Oh, it's gone.
It's gone.
Was that your candy money?
I'll never have so much money again in all my life.
Never mind.
Never mind?
I know somewhere where you can get some candy for nothing.
Come on.
I'm dying to see your place.
Sylvia tells me it's all modern.
"Contemporary" they call it, dear, nowadays.
Well, whatever they call it, I'm sure it's very nice.
Thank you. Come on, honey, tomorrow's another school day.
I can't tell you how much I enjoyed meeting you and Mr. Carter tonight.
You never know with a new principal.
He could be stuck up or plain nasty or both.
But neither of you seem to be either.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Yes, we were all very worried when we heard you were foreign.
Oh. English is hardly foreign, dear.
Well, you know what I mean.
I hope Mr. Carter does.
Sally and I met in England, while I was teaching over there.
Actually, I... I'm practically a local boy from Toronto.
Weren't the local girls good enough for you?
I didn't have a chance to find out.
Left Toronto when I was 10.
Well, you'll get used to Sylvia, but it'll take a little time.
Oh, you.
Good night, everybody.
Good night.
Good night, Sylvia.
Some of her best friends are foreigners.
Really?
I expect you'd like to keep this. Thank you.
Pity our chairman couldn't be here in person, but right now, politics take first place and he has this speaking date in Saint John.
Well, it was nice of him to send a telegram.
Our Mr. Olderberry always does the right thing.
Young Mr. Olderberry,
I mean.
Is the old one still alive?
Oh, yes, yes. Clarence is still alive, all right.
Well, it looks like they want to shut up shop.
Come along, sweetheart.
I have some things in the office. I shan't be long.
Oh, I'll come with you, Peter.
Thank you again for making Pete and me feel so very much at home.
Oh, my dear, from now on you are at home.
Thank you. Good night. Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
I was just watching you.
You didn't really come back to get those books, did you?
Just wanted to get you alone.
Oh, no, you didn't.
You wanted to have another look at your office to see if it was still here.
Do you blame me?
It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?
And you?
Do you like it here?
Oh, Pete,
I love this place.
And I love you.
Oh, sorry, Mr. Carter,
I was just locking up.
Uh, you two be long?
No, we're just going. Um...
Oh, Harry, this is Mrs. Carter.
Oh, yes, I reckoned it might be. Leastways, I hoped so.
Ah, how romantic.
Hello.
You two needn't hurry,
I'm on all night.
Oh, thanks, Harry, but we do have a home to go to.
Good night, Harry. See you in the morning. Good night.
Good night.
Hello, kids!
Oh, Mother, you waited up.
Well, were the natives friendly?
Very friendly. In fact, they were wonderful.
I'm sure they were the salt of the earth.
Only I just don't like too much salt.
Oh, Mother. Drink?
Now, that's what
I really waited up for.
Did Jean get off to bed all right?
She always does, for me.
What was tonight's tale of horror?
A little thing about a witch with three heads and one eye.
I don't know why you tell her such hair-raising stories.
She likes them.
You did, too, remember?
I sometimes wonder how she can get off to sleep after listening to you.
Don't look now, but apparently she can't.
Oh, no.
Mummy.
What are you doing out of bed?
I couldn't sleep.
Now, you go back up those stairs.
Hello, Grandma.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before tonight?
Come on up.
School tomorrow.
I know, but I was having a bad dream.
Oh, wait a minute. I thought you said you couldn't sleep.
How can you have a bad dream if you can't sleep, hmm?
I think I'm getting lockjaw.
Lockjaw.
Well, now that's just silly. You can't get lockjaw.
You've been inoculated against it.
Anyway, why lockjaw, for heaven's sake?
I stepped on a nail.
Come on, let's see it.
See? Right there.
I can't see anything.
Not even a scratch.
It isn't a scratch.
It's a dent.
Now, you get off to bed before I twist your ears off.
Where did you step on this nail?
At the Olderberrys'.
At the Olderberrys'?
When were you there?
This afternoon, with Lucille Demarest.
You went to the house?
Yes, we called on them.
I hope they appreciated the honor.
Did you see
Mr. And Mrs. Olderberry?
Oh, no, they were out.
Well, if they were out, how did you get in the house?
You didn't just walk in, did you?
No, we rang the bell.
Who let you in?
Mr. Olderberry. I mean, the old Mr. Olderberry.
Oh, just a minute, this is getting confusing.
Who's the old
Mr. Olderberry?
Oh, that would be the father.
I shall have to call up tomorrow and apologize.
How long were you there?
About half an hour.
Poor old man, he must have been about ready for a nervous breakdown.
Oh, no, he liked it.
I'm sure he did. I think that was a very nice thing for you to do.
But how did you come to step on this nail? You had your shoes on.
We, uh...
We took them off.
What? You took your shoes off?
We took all our clothes off.
Darling, you didn't mean that, did you?
About taking off all your clothes?
Yes, I did.
Why did you do it, Jean?
Because Mr. Olderberry asked us to.
You spilt your drink.
Yes, I did, didn't I?
Shall I help you wipe it up?
Uh, darling, I don't think
I quite understand.
Mr. Olderberry asked you and
Lucille to take off all your clothes?
That's right.
So, we did.
Wasn't that right?
Well, no, Jean, it wasn't.
Why not?
He said to.
Not now.
Um, darling, I think you'd better go back up to bed.
I'll come up with you.
Can't I stay down a little longer?
No, I don't think so.
Come along.
Good night, Grandma.
Good night, widget.
Hope it doesn't spoil the table.
Good night, Daddy.
Night, Jean.
What about my lockjaw?
We'll put something on it when we get upstairs.
Then you won't have anything more to worry about.
God.
Yes.
You think he did what Jean said he did?
Yes, I do.
He actually made them undress?
Apparently.
If he touched her,
I swear I'll kill the swine.
There. How's that?
Fine.
There. You'll see, in the morning it'll all be well.
Tell me a story.
I'll tell you what, let's have a little talk first.
Then maybe
I'll read to you.
What'll we talk about?
I want to know all about this afternoon.
What was
Mr. Olderberry like?
He's all right.
He was very old though.
What were you doing there?
I mean, why did you go to the house in the first place?
Lucille said he'd give us some candy.
And did he?
Oh, yes, afterwards.
After what?
After we danced.
Can I have a drink of water, please?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Where did all this happen?
In his room.
It's on the top floor.
It's got a private stairs and a front door and everything.
I'd like to live there.
Would you, darling?
Oh, I'd much rather live here, of course. It's much cleaner.
Was Mr. Olderberry alone?
Oh, yes, there was nobody else.
Lucille introduced me.
She said I was her friend.
And then what happened?
He asked her if she liked to play games, too.
Jean said she did.
He said the game was for her and
Lucille to take off all their clothes.
Jean didn't want to do it, but Lucille said Mr. Olderberry would give them a lot of candy.
She took off her clothes first, and then Jean.
He made them dance.
Oh, no.
Just sat there, a few feet away.
Jean said he kept smiling at them, rocking backwards and forth with his hands on the arm of the chair.
He was making a sort of noise, as if he were singing, only he wasn't singing.
Oh, Sally.
After a few minutes, he closed his eyes and Jean thought he'd gone off to sleep.
She started to put on her clothes again, but he woke up and asked her what she was doing.
She said she was cold, and anyway, she thought the game was finished.
He laughed and said that it was and told her to go and get another box of candy.
That was when she stepped on the nail.
And that's the whole story?
Yes.
Do you think Jean has any idea what it's all about?
No, not the slightest.
She still thinks it was all a game.
She said the candy wasn't very good.
Sally, it's true, isn't it?
Jean didn't make up any of it?
No, no, it's all true.
Pete! We don't want the whole town to know.
You know what those small town switchboards are.
Who are you calling?
His son.
Of course, they'll all be over at Saint John.
Well, we'll just have to leave it until the morning.
Leave it?
What else can we do?
Call the police.
I don't think that'd be at all wise.
I'm not interested in doing what's wise,
I only want to do what's right.
But would it be right, Sally, to go to the police at this stage?
They'd arrest him. They'd get him away from here.
I very much doubt it.
What do you mean? Isn't what he's done a crime, attempted rape?
Attempted rape? Sally, he didn't even touch the child.
I don't understand you.
Neither of you seem to think this is serious.
A sexual pervert lures two little girls into his house...
He didn't lure them in, they went there of their own accord.
What in heaven's name difference does that make?
A great deal.
It means...
The fact is he got them into his home and made them do something that might have had the most horrible consequences.
I don't think so,
Sally. Really, I don't.
I'm not trying to minimize what happened. I do think it was frightful.
But you must keep a sense of proportion.
After all,
Jean wasn't actually hurt.
You seem very sure of that, Marty.
I am, instinctively.
You see, I know how tough children can be.
Happy, normal children, that is.
And I know how much it takes really to shock them.
Listen, when I was about Jean's age, there was a man in the village.
Percy Sandford, he was about 40.
Like a big, overgrown schoolboy.
A case of arrested development,
I suppose. It usually is.
Anyway, when we little girls went by on our way to school, he used to stand at the window and...
I believe the term is "expose himself. "
What happened to him?
Nothing.
The family was highly respected and respectable folk.
They just kept him at home, and everyone pretended not to notice.
Anyway, you see, the sight of poor
Percy didn't do me any permanent harm.
Sally, where are you going?
Sally, I asked,
"Where are you going?"
I'm going for the police.
Sally, listen to me. You can't make a serious complaint against someone without knowing what you're doing.
I know what I'm doing.
No, you don't.
The charge you're making might be substantially false.
Do you think your daughter was lying?
No, Jean doesn't lie, but if we accuse Olderberry of something like assault or attempted rape, he may get off completely.
We'd be sued for everything we've got.
I'm sorry.
Sally, give me that car key. Sally, Pete.
Now, calm down, both of you.
You're behaving like children.
First of all, Sally, would you mind telling me, without shouting, please, why you think it's necessary to go rushing off to the police, right now, in the middle of the night?
Because a crime should be reported as soon as possible after it's committed.
This isn't an ordinary crime, like burglary or a hold-up.
This concerns a lot of people, people you know and have to live with.
Whole families, maybe the whole town.
It concerns
Pete's relations with his colleagues and the school committee.
After all, don't forget we're foreigners here.
Are you putting Pete's job ahead of Jean's safety?
I'm not putting anything ahead of anything.
I just want you to look at this objectively.
Objectively?
You expect me to be objective when a man tries to corrupt my daughter?
Yes, I do, for her sake and yours.
I'm sorry. The police have got to be told.
But why, Sally, why?
Because it isn't only Jean that's threatened.
It's every other child in this town.
We have a responsibility in this, a responsibility to society.
To hell with society!
What worries me is you and Jean and Pete, and the effect this will have on your lives, if you let it.
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Now, there's a good girl. Go away!
There's nothing to be frightened of. Go away!
Mummy and Daddy are right here, Jean.
My darling, what's the matter?
He's in there, the old man, in the cupboard.
Nonsense, darling.
You were just dreaming.
There's nobody here but you and us.
Yes, there is.
I saw him go in.
He's still in there.
Now then, we'll check.
See? There's no one.
Nothing.
Like Mummy said, just a bad old dream.
No, it wasn't.
I saw his white hands.
He's gonna take me away.
Don't let him.
It's all right, darling.
Don't let him. It's all right. Calm down.
No one's going to take you away.
Pete!
Are you going to the police?
Say, Mac, you want some fancy reading?
Just take a look at this guy Carter's statement.
Not now. The Chief's waiting for these.
You can read the file copy.
All right.
All right.
I thought maybe you'd better have a look at this, and see what your husband did say.
I know what my husband said.
Oh, sure, of course you do, but I thought maybe there might be a few things you didn't agree with or might want him to change.
It's a simple statement of fact.
I wouldn't call it just that.
What do you mean?
It's his story of what your little girl told you.
It ain't been substantiated yet.
It will be, in court, if necessary,
Mr. Hammond.
Captain Hammond, if you please, ma'am.
I sweated it out for my rank the hard way, Mrs. Carter, so I kind of like people to use it.
I'm sorry,
Captain Hammond.
No offense meant.
None taken, I'm sure.
What I'm trying to say is this, Mrs. Carter, and I hope you won't take me wrong.
You and your husband are strangers in this town.
Nobody knows much about you.
What has that got to do with it?
Quite a lot, in a place like this.
I don't say it's right, but that's how things are.
But you seem to forget that my husband has just been appointed principal of your high school.
That must give him some standing in the community.
Some standing. The
Olderberrys have a lot more.
I don't doubt that, but...
High school principals come and go, but the Olderberrys, you might say, go on forever.
Are you trying to suggest that my husband and I withdraw our charge?
We just go home and forget about what happened to our child?
Well, now you mention it, just what did happen to your child?
Far as I can see, nothing very much.
Captain Hammond, have you any children of your own?
Yes, I have, ma'am, five of them. Three boys and two girls.
So I guess I know just about as much as anybody how much notice to take of the things kids say when they've been doing something they know they shouldn't.
Such as? Going to people's houses and begging for candy.
How dare you?
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that, but I get kind of riled when I think of all the trouble that can be caused by a little exaggeration.
I'm not denying that maybe the old man did get a little fresh with those kids.
A little fresh?
You call it a little fresh getting young girls to strip in front of him?
Well, nobody was hurt, were they? He didn't do anything.
Yes, he did do something, he attacked their innocence.
And I don't mean their physical innocence, I mean their minds.
And the only reason he didn't succeed was because they were too young and inexperienced to know what he was after.
In other words, no real harm's been done.
I didn't say that.
That's what it's going to sound like if you force the issue and bring this out in an open court.
Will it?
Look, Mrs. Carter.
You've got to be realistic.
The Olderberrys practically made Jamestown.
If it hadn't been for Clarence, that's the old man, starting the sawmill, there'd probably be nothing but trees where I'm standing right now.
And if it hadn't been for Richard branching out in 100 different ways, we'd have stayed nothing more than an overgrown lumber camp, instead of being one of the most prosperous, go-ahead places this side of the Saint Lawrence.
I'm sure that's true,
Captain Hammond, but you can't expect it to make much difference to Mr. Carter and me.
We're not members of your Chamber of Commerce.
No, ma'am, you and your husband ain't members of nothing here.
And you're not likely to be if you insist on going through with this thing.
I don't see that we have any choice.
Not only for Jean, but for every other child in your prosperous, go-ahead town.
Okay, make fun of us.
We're nothing but poor, stupid colonials.
But at least we know how to look after ourselves and our own children.
We know enough to keep them away from a house like that.
A house like what?
I mean strangers' houses, where they're not wanted, where they got no business to be.
Is that all you wanted to see me about, Captain Hammond?
To verify my husband's statement?
I'll bring it around for Mr. Carter to sign.
I suppose it's just possible he may have some second thoughts by then.
No, Captain Hammond.
It's not possible.
Thank you for the information.
What information?
About the town.
Goodbye.
Mrs. Carter!
Hello, Mr. Phillips.
I heard what happened yesterday.
Oh?
I'm sorry, this isn't even a small world, it's just an overgrown village.
So I gather.
Your little girl all right?
Yes, thank you.
Must have been horrible for you and Mr. Carter, happening so soon after you got here.
Mr. Phillips, has anything like this ever happened before?
I mean, with Olderberry?
Well, not as bad as this, no.
What do you mean?
Well, nothing as compromising as this, anyway.
You see, Mrs. Carter,
Clarence Olderberry's a very famous character around here, and everybody knows how much he likes children.
He likes them so much that sometimes he can't keep his hands off them.
But he's never made his intentions quite so clear before.
And no one's ever done anything about it?
No one's gone to the police before.
The Olderberrys themselves, they sent him to Coldhill for a while.
That's a sanatorium a few miles out of town, for nervous diseases.
An asylum.
Well, they don't call it that.
I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.
Good luck.
Is my husband free?
Yes, go right in.
Thank you.
Hello, darling.
Hello.
Well, did you see Hammond? Yes.
Pete, I've found out something else.
This isn't the first time
Olderberry's done this sort of thing.
He's well-known for his leanings in that way.
He's even been in a sanatorium.
Has he now?
That changes everything, doesn't it?
Means we're no longer alone.
The whole town will be behind us.
I'd like to think so.
They must be.
I called Richard
Olderberry. What did he say?
He said if I had anything to say, to say it to his lawyer.
Excuse me, Mrs. Carter. The Sports
Committee is assembled, Mr. Carter.
Shall I tell...
I'll see you at home.
Sally, don't worry, we'll be all right.
That's what I wanted to say to you.
I could tell them you'd rather make the meeting tomorrow.
Why? Do you think tomorrow will be any better than today?
Don't think I'm trying to excuse the old man or anything.
Well, I should hope not. No, it's just that I can't understand what the child was doing there in the first place.
Oh, really. Half the time, when girls get themselves into that kind of trouble, it's their own fault.
She's only nine or 10 years old, that's all.
That's old enough to know better. If you ask me...
Nobody did ask you, did they?
I beg your pardon.
So you damn well should.
Well, who on earth was that?
She's the child's grandmother.
Oh, no. Why didn't you warn us?
Sylvia, this is dreadful.
Why?
I only said what I'm sure a lot of people are thinking.
You are lucky, having your own pool.
Sure, come on.
I'll ask Mom for two sodas before we swim.
I wish we had a pool.
Hi, Mom, Jean's coming for a swim. Can I get two sodas?
I don't think you'd better swim today.
Huh?
It's cold.
It's not cold.
Don't argue.
Anyway, I'm sure
Jean's mother would rather she went straight home today.
No, it's all right. My mother knew I was coming swimming.
I think you still better go straight home.
But why can't she?
Quiet, Sammy.
All right.
Bye, Sammy.
Bye, Jean.
Bye, Mrs. Nash.
Goodbye.
Maybe some other time.
Little girl.
Yes?
Can you please tell me which is Mr. Carter's house?
Yes, I can. This is it. I live here.
Are you Miss Jean Carter? Yes, sir.
Will you take me in?
Yes, of course.
I've come to see your daddy.
Hello, Grandma, is Daddy home? Yes.
This gentleman wants to speak to him.
I'm Richard Olderberry.
Will you...
Will you come in?
Thank you.
Is that Hammond?
No. It's Mr. Olderberry.
Mr. Richard Olderberry.
May I come in?
Certainly.
I'll take
Jean upstairs.
Cute little kid you got there, you know?
We met on the doorstep.
I'm afraid I owe you folks an apology.
An apology?
Well, yes, for coming along like this without any warning and about my behavior on the phone this morning.
You see, I was kind of annoyed that you went to the police without talking to me first.
Um... Let me take your things.
Well, thank you.
Here you are.
Oh, yes.
You'd better sit down. Thank you.
I also want to say I'm sorry about this misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding?
Yeah. All this stuff about the kids coming to my house and my father teasing them or something.
Mr. Olderberry, I don't think you quite understand what happened.
Um... Offering children candy to take off their clothes is something more than teasing.
Kids sometimes imagine things, you know.
Not a thing like that.
Mr. Olderberry,
I think you should know, my wife and I are absolutely convinced that Jean's story is true, that your father did behave exactly the way she said he did.
Mr. Carter, my family has been in this town for generations, and in all that time nobody has ever been able to say a bad word about us.
Nobody. Ever.
Mr. Olderberry, we don't want revenge.
All we want is an assurance that your father won't be allowed to go on being a menace to the children of this town.
What do you mean by assurance?
Isn't my word good enough?
That he isn't dangerous?
If he could be looked after in some way.
Perhaps a...
A male nurse.
My father doesn't need a nurse. He's not sick.
But he is sick, that's just the point.
I happen to know a little about these things. An educator has to.
I'll admit we don't know the best way to deal with people like your father.
Well, nobody's asking you to deal with him, Mr. Carter.
If he'd had some sort of treatment when he was a child, some psychological training...
My father wasn't brought up like that.
Why, he was running the sawmill by the time he was 16.
He had discipline.
Plenty of it.
That's not the point.
The point is, what to do with a person who, for whatever reasons, has grown up with a twisted mind.
We'd like to give him some kind of a treatment, try and root out the trouble.
But that's impossible.
Your father's too old.
There's only one thing left, and that's to put him away where his illness can't harm others.
You wanna put my father away?
Well, nobody's gonna put my father away, Mr. Carter.
Look, that could be avoided if you'd agree to send him to some place like Coldhill.
I understand that he was there for a time already.
Who told you that?
It doesn't matter. It does matter! I wanna know who told you.
The point is, why was he discharged?
He wasn't discharged.
He was in there as a voluntary patient.
He didn't wanna stay, so I took him out.
Now let's get this straight.
You mean they thought that he should have stayed there longer?
Anyway, they couldn't have kept him, not unless he was committed by law in the first place.
We'll have to see that he is committed by law this time.
My husband's right,
Mr. Olderberry.
Surely you must see that.
You...
You lousy outsiders!
You come here without knowing a soul, looking for a job.
We find you one, and the first thing you do is you... You stir up trouble.
You start talking about getting people arrested, about having them shut up.
Why, that's really funny coming from you, Carter.
You, with your fancy degrees and no money in the bank.
What did they teach you in them colleges, anyway?
Don't you know that a high school principal needs the goodwill of the community?
That's got nothing to do with this.
That's got everything to do with this.
You're only here on trial.
We can get rid of you any time we want.
"We," Mr. Olderberry?
All right then, me, Mrs. Carter.
You'll soon find out that nobody else's word on the committee matters.
Mr. Olderberry, before you go, will you admit that your father... I'll admit to nothing.
But I am going.
Mr. Olderberry!
You won't even admit that your father is mentally ill?
You're damn right I won't.
That'd be the same as admitting there's some truth in the story.
But I'll tell you what I will do, Carter.
Unless you withdraw your complaint,
I'm going to have a meeting of the school board and you'll be without a job in 48 hours.
You'd better wait for the results of the trial, Mr. Olderberry, it might make a difference.
There won't be any trial.
It'll never get that far.
What are you doing here, Hammond?
I brought the document
Mr. Carter wanted.
What document? The charge against your father.
He hasn't signed it yet.
Is that all it needs?
Just my signature?
And then what?
Then I'll have to go to your place and make the arrest.
Look, Hammond, do you think
I'm gonna let you do this?
I got no option, Dick.
Once an official complaint has been filed, everything else follows.
We'll see that he gets bail, of course.
There you are,
Captain Hammond.
All right, Carter.
All right.
You make your charge, but let me warn you about one thing.
Don't put that little girl of yours on the stand to testify against my father.
Now, don't do that.
Get out of here.
Because if you do, don't expect my lawyers to have any mercy on her.
You take it from me, it'll be an experience that she won't forget in a hurry.
They'll tear her apart, and they'll do it on my instructions.
You're Mrs. Carter?
Yes.
Your husband says he won't be much longer.
Unfortunately, Dr. Montfort couldn't see him right away.
Oh, that's all right.
You're sure you wouldn't rather wait inside?
Uh, no, thank you.
Well, he'll be right out.
Terrible weather.
It would be different, of course, if Dr. Huber were alive.
He dealt directly with the case.
Is there anyone else who can give us the information?
I'm afraid not.
Well, surely you keep records of your patients' progress, their case histories?
Of course. But they're strictly confidential.
You could be forced to produce them by a court order.
We could.
Look, Doctor, all I want to know is whether Clarence
Olderberry left this sanatorium with or without the consent of his doctors.
I understand your problem, Mr. Carter.
You must try to understand ours.
Coldhill is not a state institution.
We're supported entirely by private subscription.
Meaning the Olderberrys?
Among others.
Then I'm wasting my time and yours.
Not at all. I'm sorry I had to keep you waiting.
Goodbye, Dr. Montfort.
Mr. Carter, may I give you a piece of advice in confidence?
Yes, please do.
Don't bother to get a court order to open the files of
Clarence Olderberry.
Why not?
There's nothing in them.
What did you find out?
Who owns
Coldhill Sanatorium.
This is one ace
Olderberry can't trump.
Mrs. Demarest?
Oh.
You'll be the Carters,
I suppose?
Yes.
Well...
Thank you.
Tom ought to be home any minute now.
He... He knows you're coming.
I do hope it isn't inconvenient.
Oh, no, I... I haven't started getting supper yet.
I was just getting the vegetables ready.
Thank you.
Please, do sit down.
Thank you.
Will we be able to see Lucille?
Well, Lucille's away right now.
She's staying with her aunt up in Halifax.
How long will she be there?
Why, I don't know. A couple of weeks. Depends.
Depends on what?
On how long Marjorie, that's my sister, can have her.
Oh, wouldn't you folks like a cup of coffee? It won't take a minute.
No, thanks, really.
Mrs. Demarest, you do know why we've come here.
Why... Why yes,
I think so.
I feel that it's important that we should be in this together from the very beginning.
Yes.
Well... Well, of course, that's up to Tom.
But I'm sure he must realize how much better it would be for both of us.
I hope so.
Well, they... They've just got to put that old man away.
They've just got to.
Don't worry, Mrs. Demarest.
Between us, we'll see that they do.
Oh, that'll be Tom.
The Carters are here.
Oh. They been here long? No.
I had to walk halfway back from the mill.
The car broke down.
Second time this week.
Uh, Mrs. Carter.
How are you?
Hello.
Did you fix the folks some coffee?
Oh, no one wants any.
Well, I do.
Oh. Well, if you'll excuse me.
Well, won't you sit down?
Thanks.
What can I do for you, Carter?
Well, nothing at the moment, but next week I'll be going over to Saint John to see the Crown Prosecutor about this Olderberry case, and well, I thought we could save a lot of time and trouble if you came along with me.
What for?
Well, to tell your side of the story.
Or rather Lucille's.
I'm sure you want to keep her out of it as much as possible.
I want to keep her out of it, period.
That's why I sent her away to her aunt.
But she can't be kept out of it.
Next to Jean, she'll be the
Prosecutor's chief witness.
Oh, no, she won't. Because she wasn't a witness.
I don't get you.
Look, Carter, just like everybody else around here,
I'm sorry about what happened,
I just don't want to get mixed up in it.
But you are mixed up in it already, as Sally says.
I don't know what your little girl's been telling you, but Lucille was nowhere near that
Olderberry house the other afternoon.
Mr. Demarest!
Look, she was playing on the swing with Jean till 5:30, then she came home for her supper.
Jean didn't want to go, so she left her there.
But that's not true.
That's her story.
The mill you work at, is it the Olderberry mill?
What's that got to do with it?
I wonder.
I also wonder if Lucille will stick to her story on the witness stand.
There isn't going to be any witness stand.
I don't want my kid dragged through the courts.
You won't have any choice if the
Attorney General issues a subpoena.
Well, we'll see.
That's right.
Come on, Sally.
We'd better be getting home.
Yeah, I think maybe you better.
Goodbye, Demarest.
I think you're making a very serious mistake.
I'm not making any mistake.
Can I speak to Mr.
Richard Olderberry, please?
Tom Demarest.
Why, Tom, why?
Shut up.
But why?
Hey, I think that's them coming now.
You just tell your story like you told it to your mother and me at home.
Okay?
Yes.
Ready?
Keep the change.
I think I'll sit here.
All right, sure.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
These are your seats here.
Morning, Mrs. Carter.
Good morning.
Morning, Jean.
Don't you worry, Dad.
Everything's going to be fine.
I had a word with the judge.
There'll be no need for your father to stand during the hearing.
Good. Thank you.
Order in court.
The court will rise.
Oh, yes, oh, yes, the
Supreme Court of Jamestown is now in session. Mr.
Justice Charles presiding.
God save the Queen.
The accused will rise.
Oh, under the circumstances, we can dispense with that formality.
Mr. Olderberry, you may remain seated.
Clarence Frederick Olderberry, in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, and under the provisions of the criminal code of Canada, you are charged with procuring a child, to wit:
Jean Carter, age nine years, seven months, of Jamestown, with intent to commit an act or acts of gross indecency.
The charge which the complainants are bringing against Clarence Olderberry is a grave and repulsive one.
Particularly repulsive because of the tender age of the girl, Jean Carter.
Before, however, we give you details of the offense and present our evidence, I would like to make one or two observations.
It would be idle to deny that some of us know, or think we know, something about this case.
In a small community, where the parties in this case are widely and personally known, it is probable that some of the jury have certain feelings and opinions, and that such feelings may predispose them either for or against the accused.
If any of you have such feelings,
I ask you to cast them entirely from your minds.
You are sworn, you know, to try this man according to the law without fear or favor, affection or ill will, coldly, dispassionately, on the evidence alone.
And this you must do.
The crime which we have to consider is an ugly thing.
It is also, by its very nature, a secret thing.
I am unusually fortunate in having been able to subpoena an actual eyewitness, young Lucille Demarest, to corroborate in detail, the testimony of the complainant.
And I assure you that when you have heard the evidence of the two girls between them, you will see that you've no alternative but to find the accused guilty as charged.
My Lord, may I call my first witness?
If it'll please
Your Lordship?
Mr. Slade.
Before my learned friend proceeds,
I think he should see this paper that's just been handed to me.
May I ask my learned friend why this paper was handed to him instead of to me?
It concerns my witness.
I'm afraid I cannot answer that.
It was simply handed to me as I came into court. Perhaps by mistake.
May I see the document, please?
Certainly,
Your Lordship.
This is a doctor's certificate to say that
Lucille Demarest is unable to appear today, and it gives medical grounds to suggest that she should not be required to come into court at all.
Hmm.
Is Dr. Mason in court?
Uh, no, My Lord.
But I understand that Dr. Mason, who is a regular consultant at the Jamestown Hospital, is ready to come here and be questioned, if Your Lordship and my learned friend so desire.
Huh.
Well, I think this is up to you, Mr. Duggan.
Thank you, My Lord.
Well, Dr. Mason is a well-known and highly-respected practitioner.
If he is prepared to sign his name to a declaration that this girl's health will be seriously impaired if she's forced to appear in court,
I don't see that I have any choice but to accept his word for it.
You realize, Mr. Duggan, that you are entitled to ask for an adjournment until such time as Lucille Demarest is considered fit to be called.
I see no reason to suppose the young lady will ever be considered fit to appear.
Certainly, after this,
I should look upon her as a potentially hostile witness.
Well, in that case, what do you wish us to do?
I should like to proceed,
Your Lordship.
In cases of this kind, as I have pointed out, it is frequently necessary to rely on the evidence of a solitary witness.
And although, of course, I shall be laboring under a severe handicap,
I am confident that we can afford to do so now.
I should like to call Jean Carter.
Lord, may my witness be seated?
Well, if she sits down, we won't be able to see her at all.
I think I can remedy that, My Lord.
How's that?
Fine.
Will the young person be taking the oath, My Lord?
Jean, do you know what an oath is?
A sort of bad word?
Well, that's one kind.
But I mean another kind.
A sort of promise to do something.
Like swearing something?
Yes. Have you ever taken an oath? Swore on something?
Oh, yes, sir.
I'm a Brownie.
Well, then, you know how bad it is to swear to do something and then not to do it?
Yes, sir.
Well, now, what we want you to do is to swear to tell the truth.
Is that all?
Yes, but it's a very important thing.
Will you do it, Jean?
Yes, sir.
This child obviously understands.
I think she should be put under oath.
Take the Bible, please, in your left hand.
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.
"I swear by Almighty God... "
"... the evidence
I am about to give... "
"... that the evidence
I am about to give... "
"... shall be the truth, the whole truth... "
"... and nothing but the truth. "
Would you please tell us what happened then?
Nothing.
That was all.
How did you get out of the house?
He let us out.
Did he say anything?
He asked me to come back when I wanted some more candy.
Thank you, Jean. I think that's all I have to ask you.
Can I go now?
I'm afraid not just yet. I think my learned friend, Mr. Slade, would like to ask you some questions.
Will he ask me many?
He may, but don't be frightened.
You've only to answer him like you answered me.
Must we have all this back-chat, My Lord, between the prosecutor and his witness?
I see no harm in it,
Mr. Slade.
I think our friend was just attempting to put the child in the right frame of mind for your cross-examination.
Oh, I don't mind that, My Lord, but I object to his veiled attempt to make sure the child keeps to the prepared text.
I resent the implication,
My Lord.
Understandably.
Mr. Slade, you will please refrain from making such contentious remarks.
Yes, My Lord.
Now then, Jean, there are just a few points in your story I don't quite understand.
I want you to help me to get them straight.
I'll try.
Now, firstly, you said that
Mr. Olderberry showed you out, and then invited you back sometime. Yes.
Your exact words were,
"He asked me to come back when
I wanted some more candy. "
Were they?
Did he include your friend in this invitation?
No, he didn't.
Are you sure of that? Yes.
Now, why do you think he invited you back and not the other little girl?
Maybe he liked the way I danced better.
Or maybe simply because the other little girl wasn't there.
Oh, but she was.
I suggest to you, you were alone when you went into that house, and you were alone when you came out.
No, Lucille was there.
All the time?
Yes, except...
Except when?
Except when she went for a drink of water.
Was that before you took your clothes off, or afterwards?
Before, I think.
You think?
Oh, I'm trying to remember.
No, it was afterwards, after we danced.
She was thirsty.
But you were cold.
Was I?
Oh, you said so in your evidence.
You said you asked
Mr. Olderberry if you could put on your clothes because you were cold.
Then I guess I was.
You guess you were?
Jean, how much of what you've been telling us is just sheer guesswork?
My Lord, I object.
My learned friend is trying to confuse the witness.
Objection overruled. The question is quite legitimate.
Thank you, My Lord.
But you needn't bother to answer it, Jean.
Instead, I'll ask you another one.
Where did your friend go to get this drink of water?
To the bathroom.
Where was that?
Down the hall.
Was she naked?
She must have been.
Was she naked?
Yes, she was.
And you're asking us to believe that Mr. Olderberry allowed her to wander all around the house with nothing on where anybody might have seen her?
Well, maybe she had something on.
And maybe you had something on.
I didn't! I didn't!
Maybe you were fully dressed the whole time, and this whole outrageous story of Mr.
Olderberry making you undress is a lie.
It isn't! He did!
Jean, do you like
Mr. Olderberry?
No.
Why not?
He's so old.
That's no reason.
He's ugly.
Would you like him better if he was young and handsome?
I don't know.
He wouldn't be so scary.
Oh, you find him scary?
Yes.
Because of what he did to you?
No, I didn't mind that.
Oh, you didn't mind him making you dance in front of him with nothing on?
I like dancing.
With nothing on?
Sometimes.
Do you do it often?
Sometimes after my bath.
In front of other people?
For Daddy and... Oh, so your daddy likes to see you dance naked?
Yes.
Well, what a very unusual household.
My Lord,
I object very strongly to the implications of that remark.
Objection sustained.
Strike out the question and the answer.
I hope, Mr. Slade, you are not taking comfort from the fact that what is easy to erase from the court records is not so easy to erase from the minds of the jury.
My Lord,
I assure you...
Because that is not a tactic that recommends itself to the bench.
Proceed.
Thank you, My Lord.
Now then, Jean.
You told us that Mr. Olderberry didn't touch you while you were dancing.
Yes.
Oh, he did touch you?
No.
He never even came near you?
No.
But he gave you a lot of candy?
Not a lot.
Ah, you wanted more?
Well...
Did you want more?
I didn't like them very much.
Oh, if you had liked them, you would have let him touch you?
No!
Why not?
I don't know. Come on now, answer me.
What do you think he'd have done to you?
I don't know.
Stop saying, "I don't know," and answer me.
You're going too far.
How dare you interrupt?
Order!
Mr. Carter, it's for me to decide when Counsel is going too far.
Continue, Mr. Slade.
Thank you, My Lord.
Now, I'll ask you again.
What do you think he would have done to you?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I suggest you do know, and that's why you ran to your parents with this whole ugly story.
I didn't, I didn't.
Mommy!
Don't cry, darling. It's all right. It's all right.
It's not all right.
You put him up to this.
You said you were going to hurt her, and by God, you have.
Order! Order!
Mr. Carter, you will please sit down.
I will not have this courtroom turned into a beer garden.
Now, Mr. Slade.
Just what is this line of questioning intended to establish?
Just this, My Lord.
I submit that the hideous and improbable charges brought against my client by this child are the result of a diseased imagination.
And I think we should have a psychiatrist tell us if she's as innocent as she seems.
You may stand down now,
Jean, and go to your mother.
Mrs. Carter, you may take Jean into the witness room. It'll be quiet in there.
I'm going to recess the court for 20 minutes, after which I hope we can return to this business in a calmer frame of mind.
The court is adjourned for 20 minutes.
Mr. Duggan,
Mr. Slade, during the recess I would like to see you both in my chamber.
I'd like to see you, too,
Mr. Carter, if you please.
Mr. Carter?
No, thanks.
Oh. Please sit down with us, Mr. Carter.
I think, for the sake of Mr. Carter,
I should preface my remarks with a few observations, which may seem trite and obvious to my legal friends, but it's important to emphasize that we are here to make legal and not moral judgments.
Now, it may seem wrong at times, but I assure you, it is one of the greatest safeguards of our legal system that judge and jury are not required to decide if a man is innocent, that's for God to do.
Only to say if he's guilty as charged.
I understand that.
Now this is what
I want you to realize.
Now that the child has been brought into court, the defense are entitled to ask her any questions they may think fit, however distressing to you or the child.
Even if they go so far as to demand a medical examination,
I shall have no alternative but to accede to that request.
And it may not end there.
Feeling better, darling?
Mrs. Carter, the judge is coming back now.
They'll be wanting the young lady.
Oh.
Do I have to go back?
I'm afraid so, darling.
Don't worry, widget.
You're doing fine.
See you later.
All right?
Silence in court.
The court will rise.
Silence!
I have to claim
Your Lordship's indulgence while I interpose a statement, which, of course, is made with a sense of great responsibility.
Having conferred with my learned friend and Mr. Peter Carter, the father of the girl in question,
I hope you will not think
I am slighting this court or shirking my duty in any way at all in seeking to avoid the prolongation of an ordeal that, however the case might end, can only have a bad psychological effect on the child herself.
And what I propose, and ask your leave to do, is to abandon the prosecution and withdraw the charge.
Order in the court.
Mr. Slade?
I would like to add that Mr. Olderberry seeks only to be cleared of the hideous charge brought, for whatever reason, by this mistaken and misguided child and her misguided and mistaken parents.
I must therefore ask for a clear verdict of not guilty to be brought in by the jury and duly recorded.
Order in court!
Gentlemen of the jury, in view of what
I've just heard,
I can only instruct you to bring in a verdict of not guilty.
Do you wish to withdraw?
No, My Lord.
Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have.
And do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
The defendant will rise.
Clarence Olderberry, you have been found not guilty and are hereby discharged.
You may go out of here a free man.
He's not back yet.
The board meeting still on?
As far as I know.
They've been at it a long time.
I'll tell Mr. Carter you came by.
It's all right. I'll tell him myself, if you don't mind.
I shouldn't think he'd want to see you just now.
Maybe so, but let's just wait and see, shall we?
I shouldn't think he'd want to see any of you.
Oh, why?
What have we done?
Nothing. You just stood around and let it happen.
First the trial, and now this.
What did you want us to do?
Sign petitions or go on a hunger strike?
Oh, nothing heroic.
But you could at least have told him what would happen if he started attacking the
Olderberrys in this town.
Maybe we didn't know what would happen.
Maybe we wanted to find out.
But you took good care not to stick out your own necks.
You left that to him.
Oh, you make me sick, the whole lot of you.
Oh, what's going on here?
You've been ill-treating my secretary?
On the contrary. She's been ill-treating me. Can I see you for a minute?
Sure.
Is it true that you called the board today and gave in your notice?
I wanted to beat them to the draw.
Then you're really leaving?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
And so am I, in a way.
Miss Jackson seems to think that all the faculty have let you down.
Miss Jackson has an overdeveloped sense of loyalty.
Meaning we haven't?
You've nothing special to be loyal about. You hardly know me.
We know you now.
Anyway, what did you want to see me about?
Just that.
I wanted you to know that a lot of us agree with Miss Jackson.
Can I come in?
I'm sorry. I'm busy.
Mr. Phillips will excuse us.
Is that all, Neal?
Yeah.
Oh, there was just one other thing.
When you get your new school, wherever it is, if you could use a not-too-bright art teacher,
I wish you'd let me know.
I imagine I'll be needing another job, too.
What makes him think you're getting another school?
He's probably an optimist, like me.
The board has decided not to take up your resignation.
Why?
Because I'd rather have it that way.
Just to show that
I don't hold any grudges.
But I do.
You're under contract to us.
There's a saying about leading a horse to water.
Yes, but you can't sue horses.
You know,
Mr. Olderberry,
I don't know who's more dangerous, you or your father.
But there is one thing I do know.
Neither of you are going to hurt me or my family any more.
Look, I didn't want to hurt you. You forced my hand.
However, I'm willing to forget all that.
You're willing to forget?
Yes.
You see, I hold a certain amount of power in this community, and I'm going to hold more.
I don't want people to go around saying that I abuse it.
I want them to see how generous I can be with someone who's crossed me.
Like me?
Mr. Carter, if you play this right, play it sensibly, my way, you can still have a very successful and useful career here in Jamestown.
You can build a good life for yourself and your family.
A good life here?
Where you and your father are allowed to go around spreading your different kinds of corruption?
Now, look here,
Carter!
From what I've seen of this town and what you've made of it,
I can only thank God we're getting out in time, before we've caught the infection.
Lucille! Lucille!
Lucille!
Lucille's gone down to the store for me.
She should be back in a minute.
I'll go and meet her.
I want to say goodbye.
Jean!
Yes?
You're...
You're going away tomorrow?
Yes.
Well... Well, if I don't see you again, goodbye.
Goodbye,
Mrs. Demarest.
Lucille's gonna miss you.
I'm going to miss her, too.
You're... You're the nicest friend she ever had.
Oh, well. Goodbye, Mrs. Demarest.
Hi, Lucille!
Gosh, you nearly ran me over.
No, I didn't, not really.
I just tried to scare you.
You didn't scare me.
I've just been to your house. I saw your mother.
She's nice, isn't she?
She's all right.
Come back with me?
I was going to.
Can I have a ride?
If you're careful.
And don't go too fast.
I won't.
And don't go too far either!
Hello. Yup.
Marty, you sound...
These'll have to go in with the books.
Yes, yes.
I understand.
No. Okay.
What was that?
Hmm?
Oh, nothing. Just someone at the school.
I've got to go downtown.
I won't be long.
Going downtown? But you've only just come back.
Yes, we need some more labels. We've run out.
Hurry up then.
Yes, I will.
Come on.
I can't.
What have you done with the shopping bag?
I must have dropped it somewhere back there.
My dad'll kill me.
I'm sorry.
Can't we stay here?
I think he's stopped following us now.
You can stay if you want to, I'm not.
No, wait, Lucille.
Wait for me!
Where are we?
Moon Lake.
I came here once on a picnic, but it doesn't look the same.
But how do we get home?
We have to get to the other side.
But I can't swim.
Well, we'll have to go around then.
But it's miles.
And it'll be dark.
Come on.
Maybe we could hide in there.
Suppose it's haunted?
Don't be silly.
Come on.
It's scary.
I don't like it.
What are we going to do?
We'll just have to go around.
Hey, look!
Come on.
Go and get the oars!
Help me.
Now what...
If you would ask him, please, Mrs. Olderberry.
Sorry to bother him like this.
Well, I'm going to look a fine sort of a fool if the old man's been at home all the time...
Hello.
Is that you, Dick?
It's Clegg Hammond here.
Sorry to drag you...
I see.
He what?
I see.
Yes, yes,
I think you should.
Yeah, please, as soon as you can.
Old man isn't there.
He was down at the sawmill this afternoon.
Nobody's seen him since.
Pete?
No, it's me.
Hello.
You're back early.
Oh, I didn't have my hair done after all.
Why not?
Too many people waiting.
Is something wrong?
No, no, I'm all right.
Well, if you're not too tired, could you set the table for me?
Yes, of course.
Pete's run out on me. I think he's just playing hooky.
Did you see Jean anywhere about?
No, why?
I think it's about time she came in.
I'll take it. No, no, it's all right.
Hello.
Yes, who is this?
Mrs. Demarest?
Lucille?
No, she's not here.
No, neither of them.
That's odd.
Well, um, if she does come,
I'll tell her to come home straight away.
And if you see Jean, could you tell her the same thing?
Yes, please.
Goodbye.
I was right about Pete.
There are plenty of labels here, and he must have seen them.
Mother, there is something wrong.
Darling, what is it?
Jean...
What about Jean?
Has she had an accident?
Mother, I want to know.
It may be nothing at all, nothing to be frightened of.
What may be nothing at all?
They found Jean's bicycle on the side of the road through the woods.
It wasn't damaged or anything, it was just lying there.
Why didn't you tell me when you came in?
How could you not tell me?
How could you?
Marty told you?
I found out.
Jean's probably just wandered off into the woods somewhere.
There's no reason to believe that he's anywhere near there.
"He"?
You mean Olderberry?
You think he's in the woods with her?
Carter, you're losing time.
Has Jean been wearing this lately?
She wore it at school today. Why?
Don't touch it.
I'm going with you.
Sally, I... I want you to be here if Jean comes in.
But she won't.
I know she won't.
Oh, Pete! Pete!
Marty, call Dr. Stevens, will you?
Yes.
Jean!
Jean, my baby!
Spread out in line.
Spread out.
Captain Hammond!
Looks like maybe we ought to be looking for two kids.
Call up Purdy. Tell him to send someone round to the Demarests'.
Warn the hospital.
Yes, sir.
And you'd better round up as many foresters as you can find.
Come on.
Hey, Captain!
Captain Hammond!
There's an old trapper's hut further on.
This boat must have come from there.
Captain Hammond, sir!
No, I wouldn't.
I wish you'd let me give you this sedative, Mrs. Carter.
Please, Sally.
You've got to be all right when Jean gets back.
Stop pretending. She's not coming back. I know she's not.
You mustn't talk like that. I won't have it.
You won't have it?
Sally.
Oh, I'm sorry.
All right, Doctor.
Come on.
Make room!
Get back!
Come on, get back!
It's all right, Sally.
Jean's all right.
Jean.
Oh, Jean.
Thank God.
She got away from him.
We found her wandering around in the woods the other side of the lake.
Got away?
Pete, he didn't...
No. She's all right.
Really all right.
He didn't touch her.
She couldn't say very much.
She didn't even know what happened to Lucille.
What happened to Lucille?
He killed her.
My father...
He killed that little girl.
No. Oh, no.
Mummy,
I was frightened.
It's all right, darling.
You're safe now.
You're home.
Excuse me, please.
He killed her.
He killed her.
He killed her.
I'm going to the Demarests'.
You'd better come, too.

- 'One moment, please.'
[telephone ringing]
'H-hello..'
'Hello, did I wake you?'
'Who is this?'
W-w-well, who, who is this?
Gloria. What do you mean?
Are you calling me or am I calling you?
G-Gloria, h-how are you?
Uh, well, I'm half asleep, that's how I am.
Eh, what is this?
Is that you, Sam?
"Sam?"
Oh, Sam..
And why do you only call me when you're drunk?
I-I'm not drunk, I'm lost.
What the hell do you mean you're lost? Where are you?
Uh, The Plaza hotel.
So how are you lost if you're at The Plaza?
[sighs]
W-w-where are you, Gloria?
I'm in bed asleep.
I'm trying to sleep.
Oh, Sam, you drive me nuts!
What is it you want?
- 'I want to see you.'
- No.
W-w-we, we can have some coffee, we can talk. Please, Gloria.
Well..
I'm gonna put on my clothes.
You're not gonna walk in here and find me in bed if that's what you're thinkin'.
- 'Please?'
- Well..
I-I'll be right over.
G-Gloria! Gloria?
'What now?'
I forgot the address.
Boy, you are drunk, aren't you?
'I-I'm not drunk. It's just..'
It's 352, West 89th Street.
You forgot the address.
Boy, that takes the cake.
[sighs]
I-I'll be there in a few minutes.
'Sam?'
Don't fall under no lousy subway trains, huh?

[thudding]
Miss Osburn?
Yeah.
I'm Sam.
Not any Sam I know.
Oh.
You don't recognize me?
I never saw you before in my life.
N-no, w-wait, wait, wait. I've,
I've got your phone number, see?
Oh, come on now, mister, let's cut the stuff.
You met my husband in some lousy bar last night.
He gave you my number and says,
"Call her, she puts up."
- I-is Sam your husband?
- Some husband.
We separated. He tell you that?
Well, no,
I don't remember meeting him.
Were you out drinking last night?
I-I don't know where I was last night.
I woke up in Central Park.
As God as my witness, that's all I know.
Well, um..
Tsk. Well, I said I'd give you some coffee, huh?
Uh, sit down.
It's, it's already on.
Be ready in a minute.
[cups clinking]
[sighs]
Alright...who are ya?
I don't know.
Why'd you say you were Sam?
You said I was Sam.
- Who gave you my number?
- I don't know.
But it's right there on the paper, ain't it?
It seems to be.
Seems hell, it is!
Where you from?
I don't know.
- Well, how old are you?
- I don't know!
Mmm.
You married?
I'm not sure.
You're not sure of nothin', are you? Tsk.
[sighs]
Yeah, I think the coffee's ready.
How do you take your coffee?
I missed it.
How do you take this?
[crying]
Hey..
Hey, baby, what's the matter?
Hey, come on now.
Wha-what's the matter?
Oh, come on now, baby, don't do this.
Please, oh, no, this ain't right.
Hey, come on now, baby.
- I don't know how I take it.
- Huh?
My coffee.
I don't know how I take it.
[laughing]
Oh, you poor baby. Don't know how he takes his coffee.
[sobbing]
Y-y-yeah.
[laughing]
Oh, you dumb, lost puppy.
[sobbing]
Y-y-yeah.
You poor baby.
[chuckles]
Oh, rest, baby, rest.
Oh, what are we gonna do about you?
You don't know me?
No, honey, I'm sorry.
[chuckles]
Can't you remember nothing?
I feel as if there's some kind of tug-of-war in my mind.
Trying to remember and then..
- And afraid that if I do..
- Yeah?
- I better go.
- Where?
Why, I'm not sure..
But don't you want your coffee?
Oh, thank you, Gloria, thank you very much.
You're a, you're a nice person.
- Yeah.
- I have to go.
U-uh, wait!
Have you got any money?
- Sure.
- Oh, sure. Wait!
You don't leave, you hear? Wait.
Here, here take this.
- Oh, I, I-I couldn't.
- Oh, take it, take it.
Why, Gloria?
Well, you're lost, ain't you?
So go find yourself.
[melancholic music]
[music continues]
Grace.
Grace!
Grace, wait!
Grace.
Taxi?
Taxi!
Taxi!
Follow that green cab up ahead, please.
- Hurry.
- What are you? You're the FBI.
Don't lose it, huh?
I get a ticket, you wanna pay the fine?
Y-yeah, okay.
I'll pay the fine.
Yeah, you're all gonna pay the fine until it comes time to pay the fine then nobody wants to pay the fine.
Please, it's very important.
Where's that broad going anyway?
What broad?
The one in the cab up ahead.
Oh, watch it, he's turning.
'I see. I see, already.'
You know, I had a blonde broad here the other day.
Gets in the cab stoned drunk two in the afternoon, wants me to take her to Oyster Bay.
'I say,
"Where in Oyster Bay, lady?"'
'She says, "On the water."'
'I say, "Where on water, lady?"'
She says, "You want me to take your number?"
Right away, they want to take your number.
Well, she don't take my number.
Instead she sits back and relaxes all over the place.
You know, what I mean?
She relaxes.
With her dress right up to there.
Singing very dirty songs.
I swear, I almost crashed the cab four times.
'Well, the pay off is, only $28 ride.'
'She gives me a quarter tip.'
And says, "Mister you never had a ride like that in your life."
She starts marching up the front walk.
Just before she goes in the door, she turns..
...and she gives me a bump and a grind.
Like she was in the Barley House in Union City.
Was it worth it?
I ask you.
Boy, what a business!
[honking]
[inaudible]
[instrumental music]
Vaulner. Edward Vaulner.
'You're expecting somebody?'
O-oh, n-no. No.
Then I presume you won't mind if I join you?
Oh, please. Not at all.
You eat a hearty breakfast.
Well, I'm hungry.
Listen, don't be defensive.
You like to eat, so eat.
How did he get out?
- What?
- That nut.
Oh, it says he stole a grey suit from the director's office and just left.
Umm, he got lonesome.
There are more of his kind outside than in.
That's a lot of citrus.
You're expecting maybe scurvy?
No, I'm just hungry.
So, eat. Who's telling you not to eat? Oh, watch it.
You almost caught me in the eye.
The grapefruit, it's squirting all over the table.
- Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
- Who's complaining?
You wanna squirt a little grapefruit in my eye?
Go ahead.
My name is Swartz, what's yours?
I don't..
- Sam Buddwing.
- Pleased to know you.
You would eat here all the time?
No, this is the first.
You should come more often.
I eat here all the time.
Breakfast, lunch, dinner.
That's because the food is so wonderful.
It's also because
I happen to own the place.
- That grapefruit good?
- Oh, very.
Wait till you taste the Danish.
It's as good as..
You ever been to Miami Beach?
Oh, I forget.
How could you forget a place like Miami Beach?
I just don't remember.
Are you Jewish?
If you're a Jewish, you've been there.
Oh, I don't know.
Then what are you?
An Arab?
What did you say your name was?
Sam Buddwing.
All the Sams I know, they're Jewish.
What about Sam Adams?
He probably changed his name.
- So did I.
- Ah-ha.
What was it before?
- I don't remember.
- Why?
- Are you ashamed?
- Well, no, it's just that--
A nice Jewish boy like you..
Aren't you gonna drink your milk?
Well, sure, I...just wanna have my coffee first.
So, have it.
How could you drink it black, like that?
Well, I'm..
I don't know.
You don't know?
How is it possible not to--
Stop digging at me,
I don't know, I don't know.
I wish I did,
I want to but I don't know!
Listen, what's the matter with you?
Nothing, just, I can't remember anything, that's all.
Why don't you go see a doctor?
Um...maybe I will.
Maybe, schmaybe, you shouldn't put off ailments no matter how small.
My brother Davey had, uh, an ingrown toenail.
Didn't see a doctor.
Murder, believe me.
See a doctor.
- Hey.
- It's on me.
- I can pay.
- Yeah.
Don't I see you can pay?
Do you look like a bum?
The only thing wrong is you can't remember anything.
That's all.
Well, thank you, Mr. Schwartz.
You're welcome, Mr...
...what did you changed your name to?
Buddwing.
Where did you find a cockamamie name like that?
On a beer truck.
[chuckling]
Sam..
...don't be ashamed you're Jewish.
Some of the finest Christians, believe me..
...they're Jews.
[cars revving]
[vehicles honking]
[honking continues]
[motors revving]
[car screeching]
Grace!
Grace...slow down, will you?
- I'm not Grace.
- Sure you are.
Would you like me to call a cop?
Well, no.
Why do we need a cop for?
You don't need one but I think I do.
Didn't you hear me calling you up on Western Avenue?
You followed me from there?
Well, now, that's impressive.
I yelled.
I guess you didn't hear me.
Oh, what'd you yell?
No, don't tell me..
- Grace?
- But, that's your name.
My name is Janet.
Goodbye.
Listen, you better not get funny.
This is a public park, you know.
You get funny in a public park and oh, boy..
Why should I get funny?
I couldn't guess.
Maybe you're some kind of degenerate or something?
You know I'm not.
[sighing]
From Kookesville?
- What's my name?
- Grace.
Janet.
You're 19.
How old are you?
Twenty five.
Twenty five?
And how many?
Who's Grace?
[instrumental music]
[thinking]
I'm not sure.
What do you want?
Talk to you, Grace.
I'm studying.
Oh, that can wait.
That's what you think?
- Hey?
- "Greek Mythology"?
You don't mind, do you?
I'm really trying to study.
Sure, go ahead.
I can't study if you keep talking to me.
Well, who's talking?
- Here, I'll help you.
- How?
I'll ask the questions, you give the answers.
- What's the Pleiades?
- The Seven Sisters.
And what are their name?
Alcyone, Merope,
Maia, Electra..
And Dopey, and Grumpy..
And Sneezy, and Sleepy.
Stop that.
Okay, now, may I study?
- I have a better idea.
- What?
Let's go for a walk.
And what happens when I flunk mythology?
I don't know, what?
I'll hate you forever, that's what.
Well, I wouldn't want that to happen.
Okay, as long as you understand.
When were you born?
January 10th.
Capricorn, that explains it I guess.
Explains what?
Umm...never mind.
Oh..
- What's your favorite month?
- March.
Nobody's favorite month is March.
Mine is, what's yours?
October.
It makes me sad because everything dies in October.
Well, then why is it your favorite month?
I'm a very sad person.
Ohh..
I cry an awful lot, do you?
Oh, no, I..
I don't think so.
I cry all the time.
All the time.
I see a bird, I cry.
I pick up a salt shaker, I cry.
My Uncle Dan calls me
Grace The Weeper.
Now, we just have to make you laugh.
- Impossible.
- Why?
- I have no sense of humor.
- Oh.
Are you gonna fall in love with me or something?
- Well, I--
- You mustn't, I haven't time.
Haven't time?
I have to finish college then go for my Masters.
So, you see, falling in love will just mess things up.
Well, wait until you're asked.
- You're in college, aren't you?
- Yeah, music.
That's lovely.
Do you play an instrument?
- I compose.
- That's lovely.
Uh, look, Grace.
Just because a guy asked you to take a walk it doesn't mean that he wants to marry you.
I know.
Would you like to take me out or something?
- Yes.
- When?
Saturday night.
I live up in Mount Kisco.
I'll come up there.
We just met, you know.
We're practically strangers.
- Then it's settled.
- I guess it is.
[vehicles honking]
[instrumental music]
- Grace, you know what?
- What?
No, don't say it.
Why not?
I'm not ready for those words.
I'm too young and stupid.
I don't know much about living.
I don't know who I am yet.
Well, why don't you look it up under Saturn and the tenth house of Venus.
Sure, make fun.
You're you, I'm me.
That's all we need to know.
It sound so brave when you say it.
But what does it mean?
It means that I love you.
[instrumental music]
Why?
Why do you love me?
I mean, why me?
Oh, please, why me?
- I love you.
- Yes, but how much?
I love you more than anything in the world.
Well, that could mean anything.
It means I love you.
Oh, God, how I love you!
I love you, too.
[barking]
[growling]
[continues barking]
Why is he growling at me?
He's not growling, he's talking.
What's he saying?
I bet I know.
Who is this joker?
And why is he messing around with our darling Grace?
- Okay, why?
- Why not?
- She's just a kid.
- She's 19.
That's just a kid.
- How old are you?
- Twenty-five.
What'd you do for a living?
Well, I'm studying to be a composer.
Composer.
[sighing]
In your mouth, it sounds criminal.
Impractical.
Have you got private means?
[sighing]
I've got $65 in the bank a beat-up jalopy and I'm going to college on a GI Bill.
Now, what's with the 3rd degree?
Look, buddy, my niece hasn't got any parents, just me.
So, if you don't mind,
I'll take an interest.
- Okay?
- 'Okay.'
Now, I'll tell you something, buddy.
I'm going to marry your niece.
How about that?
- What?
- Yeah.
Why don't you talk that over with your dog?
[dog growling]
[barking]
[grunting]
Don't leave holes.
- Where the hair was?
- Where the ears were.
Rich man...poor man..
[whistling]
...beggar man..
[continues whistling]
Oh, lovely, what is it?
It's the slow movement from my jazz octet.
[whistling]
It gives me goosebumps.
[whistling]
Oh, God, I love music.
Writing and listening.
It's better than we are, you know what I mean?
I just...love it.
As much as you do me?
It's the same thing.
[whistling]
Eek, it's going down my front.
Oh, it itches.
You want some help there?
I can manage, thank you.
My regular barber doesn't have that problem.
I should hope not.
I didn't know you had a cowlick.
I am all kinds of things you don't know about.
Yeah, well, I learn.
When?
Don't rush me.
Why not?
I'll give in.
[thunder rumbling]
It's going to rain!
[rumbling continues]
Never.
Never.
[thunderclap]
[rain pattering]
[car honking]
[vehicles revving]
[both laughing]
Wow! Where did that come from?
You got smart with Jupiter Pluvius.
Who?
And you, a student of mythology.
Yike, I'm soaked to the skin.
Shh.
[Bach instrumental music]
What is it?
Bach, "St. John Passion."
Come on.
[instrumental music]
[music continues]
'I feel like..'
'I feel like praying.'
'Alright. Pray.'
'I don't know how.'
'Me, neither.'
'I wouldn't even know which God to pray to.'
'Pray to all of them.'
Jehovah, Zeus..
Aphrodite, Apollo..
- What about Buddha?
- Alright.
Him, too.
Dear Gods..
...of all times and places.
Give us happiness..
...growing on trees in a garden.
Let my wife's mouth always taste of clover..
'...and her eyes keep keep bright with loving.'
Let us roam the earth, like Vikings.
'France, England, Spain.'
La Costa Brava.
Greece. Dardanelles.
Oh, yes. And Italy.
Everywhere we wanna go.
And it won't matter where..
...because we'll be so damned happy.
'So in love.'
[sighs]
So all you Gods nod your big, white shaggy heads and shower us with blessings.
All you Gods.
All you Gods.
'All you Gods.'
'All you Gods!'
[dramatic music]
I am Vaulner.
I'm the maniac, Edward Vaulner.
What seems to be the trouble, mister?
What.. Nothing.
No trouble at all.
Well, it looks to me like you're yellin' all over the place.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was being loud.
Yeah, well, there's such a thing as disturbing the peace you know.
Well, I'm sorry.
What are you doin' here in the first place uh, watchin' the college girls?
N-n-no, I wanted to sit in the sun.
I didn't realize there was a law against it. Uh..
There ain't.
How 'bout, uh, showin' me some identification, mister?
I says, let me see your identification.
He wasn't doing anything, officer.
- Nobody asked you.
- Oh, I..
I'm simply offering my observation--
Well, nobody asked you for your observation.
He's right, officer.
I can verify his testimony.
Now this ain't a trial.
Mind your own business.
I thought this was a free country.
- Now, who asked you?
- Oh..
What are you gonna do next, stop us from sitting in the park?
Well, what other country you here from, huh?
Now, why don't you all go home and mind your own business, huh?
Why don't you go play in traffic, officer?
- Very funny.
- 'Oh, what's the matter?'
Is graft a little slow today, huh?
Come and arrest my mother, officer. She's a pusher.
- Yeah.
- Alright, alright.
Alright, break it up, now.
Go on home, all of you.
♪ They're talkin' law to us again ♪
Alright, come on, now.
Break it up.
♪ Talkin' law to us again
♪ Talkin' law
♪ Law

[dramatic music]
[music continues]
Now, look, mister,
I don't know what you want but I'm stretched pretty thin, and I swear if you don't stop following me,
I'm going to hurt you.
I don't wanna hurt you, mister, believe me, I don't, but..
- Unless you stop bothering me.
- I'm not bothering you.
Mister, I'm very tired and upset.
- Yes, yes, of course.
- I-I don't know who I am.
I know who you are.
Edward Vaulner.
- How do you know that?
- I know everything.
Who are you?
God.
Well, I don't believe in God.
Well, then, who do you think you're talking to?
An old nut who followed me from Washington Square.
Oh, that's merely a symptom of your condition.
It is a well-known fact that crazy people think everyone else is crazy.
- But do you think I'm crazy?
- Of course.
Then you must be crazy.
God cannot be crazy.
Now what do you want?
You must have faith.
- In what?
- Me.
You? You're crazier than I am.
There.
You do know, don't you?
You know you're Edward Vaulner.
'A paranoid schizophrenic.'
You belong in the state hospital where you stole that suit.
'If you are caught, you must go back.'
- I don't wanna go back.
- Then listen and obey.
God needs a disciple.
He needs you.
To preach the Gospel?
Run errands and clean house.
To earn money.
So that God shall be undisturbed in his meditations.
That's kinda petty, isn't it?
God is petty.
To those who are nobody
He gives nothing.
No, I won't do it.
- Listen to God. Listen--
- No, you listen.
I'm somebody, do you understand?
I don't know who, but I'm somebody.
I'm me!
And all I need is for someone else to see it.
From now on, when you look at me you see me, or you see no one.
Don't give orders to the Almighty.
Get away from me, get away from me, or I'll hurt you.
You try it, you try it and I'll yell that you are Edward Vaulner.
And they will come with a straitjacket and put you away.
Get away, get away!
[dramatic music]
Help! Help!
Escaped maniac!
Help!
Help!
It's Edward Vaulner!
This is the maniac!
'The escaped maniac! Police!'
'Police, help!'
'It's Vaulner. Help!'
Please. Please help!
Help! Police!
'Police, help!'
'It's Vaulner!'
'Hurry up! Help!'
'Help!'

[instrumental music]
[car honking]
What will it be?
Uh, could I have a glass of water, please?
[cutlery clinking]
[sighing]
Got trouble?
Uh, my head hurts, and all of a sudden
I'm seeing double.
Mm-hmm.
Bet I can guess what it is.
- You can?
- Migraine.
- Migraine?
- Yeah.
My old lady gets it all the time.
It's, uh..
How do you pronounce it?
Psycho.. Psycha.. Uh..
- Psychosomatic.
- Yeah.
Like you're trying to put something out of your head and it keeps hammering to get in.
Yeah, but what causes it?
Oh, in the case of my old lady, me.
[chuckles]
Alright, already.
[moaning]
Ugh. Sensitivity.
I read that like a cornball amateur.
'"You shouldn't talk like that, mother.'
'"After all, he's not only my lover'
'he's my friend."
That was the worst reading
I ever did in my whole life.
Do you know that my concentration was nowhere?
'Sweetie, your concentration was groovy' and your sensitivity, well, it just flips me out.
Oh, you're putting me on, my whole instrument was blocked.
- 'Sweetie, you were wailing.'
- Grace?
- Grace.
- 'You know, you're a doll.'
Hey, do forgive, I must run.
- Okay? Ciao, baby.
- Ciao.
[instrumental music]
[car honking]
[instrumental music]
[car honking]
Hello, Grace.
Hello, Seymour.
- Is that my name?
- Well, it is, if mine's Grace.
Hit the road, you spook.
Get lost.
Pound yourself some pavement.
How'd you like it?
I beg your pardon?
My performance.
Well, actually,
I was cheating a little.
I did play it in
"Bachelor Party."
- Are you an actress?
- What else?
Oh, don't tell me you really thought you knew me.
- I do.
- Prove it.
Y-you've got a beauty spot behind your left shoulder.
I've got one, but it's somewhere else, and if you think
I'm gonna show you where, you're outta your skull.
You gave me this ring.
Well, I wouldn't give a man a ring with a cracked stone.
It wasn't cracked when you gave it to me.
I broke it.
Say, you really do think you know me.
Yes.
I thought I was hip, and here I am falling for the oldest line in the world.
"Haven't we met before?"
It's not a line.
I'm Grace?
Well, how'd you like to buy your old friend Grace a cup of coffee, hmm?
[instrumental music]
'Like, nothin'.'
Ah, maybe you're lucky.
Lucky?
So you don't know who you are?
Make a choice.
Be whoever you wanna be.
That's what actors do. I mean, that's why they're actors.
They don't know who they are so they go batting around waiting for some writer to write them a personality.
We are all impersonating an identity.
I've read that somewhere.
- So you do remember things?
- Bits and pieces.
They keep coming back but they don't add up.
- Label.
- Hmm?
Those fancy threads you're wearing.
Stores keep records of their customers.
All you gotta do is look at the label.
Yeah.
- Zero.
- Yeah.
Well, we'll go at it scientifically.
Like, first, we'll figure out your profession.
- How?
- Just answer the questions.
What's a tort?
A civil wrong under the law.
Uh. What's the maximum penalty for burglary?
I've no idea.
Well, a lawyer, you're not.
What's scopolamine?
Some kind of drug.
Dr. Kildare, you're not either.
Well, who wrote
"Gone with the Wind?"
Margaret Mitchell.
What are galleys?
Well, I think kind of like--
Oh, forget it.
Um..
When a market is bearish, what does it mean?
Weak.
What's it called when it's strong?
Bullish.
Uh-huh. Now, we're getting warm.
What's the current code on ATandT?
I have no idea.
Well, rich man, poor man beggar man.
What's an AandR man?
Ooh, that sounds familiar.
I think it's, um..
I don't remember.
That's my trouble.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Well, let's see if any of these ring a bell, alright?
Uh...white planes?
Oh.
Brownsville?
Chappaqua?
Mount Kisco?
Mount Kisco.
Yeah?
- I can't remember.
- Mm-hmm.
Old daddy Freud would say you don't wanna remember.
Why? You think this is fun being nobody from nowhere.
I wanna remember, it's just that every time I feel like
I'm getting close..
- 'Yeah?'
- There's something waiting.
Something..
I better tell you, it's possible I'm insane.
Are you?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Well, I would,
I'd like to help you but..
Well, you're an attractive guy and I don't wanna get involved.
I mean, well, well, you've got your trouble and, like, that's my trouble.
- Getting involved.
- Sure.
- Nobody wants to get involved.
- Wait a minute.
I'm not some damn stray dog you'd give a pat on the head and send on his way.
- You need a shave.
- What?
One thing I can't stand is a guy who needs a shave.
- Oh.
- Where you going?
Well, find a barber, I guess.
- You got any loot?
- A little.
Well, save it.
I know a place where it's all for free.
Come on.
[humming]
- You!
- 'Yeah.'
- Come and get it.
- 'Crazy.'
- Look what I found.
- Oh, yeah. Harry's. I think.
Well, a man is handsome.
The girl ain't ugly.
Mm-hmm.
You'll keep.
- Who is Harry?
- Was.
- The guy outside the theatre.
- Tony? Oh, no.
He don't swing like that.
Oh, Lord, I am so tired of those AC-DC types.
Hey, uh, you normal?
- I don't remember.
- Oh.
Well, before we find out for sure
I think you oughta know my name is Fiddle Corwin.
Nobody's named Fiddle.
Of course not. I made it up
'cause it's easy to remember.
That's important for an actress.
Mm.
You're normal.
- You promised me something.
- Did I?
- Food.
- Uh, first, you mean.
♪ Oh I slept last night in the hollow log ♪
♪ With the bedbugs all around me ♪
♪ But I thought of sleepin' on a feather's bed.. ♪♪
[humming]
[instrumental music]
Oh, man.
Hmm?
That guy doesn't conduct with a baton.
He must use a baseball bat.
He's a good conductor.
For street cars maybe.
Well, look who's criticizing.
You know how that phrase should go?
[piano music]
See, none of that phony rubato.
That's the way it was written.
Do that again.
'Go ahead.'
[piano music]
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, pianist, huh?
Not exactly.
[piano music]
Lovely. What is it?
I think...slow movement for my jazz octet.
Oh. Gives me goosebumps.
God, I love music.
Writing, listening..
Listen, I-I had a talk with Loomis.
That's nice. Who's Loomis?
Verve Records, as you very well now.
I forgot.
Well, brace yourself.
He offered me a job.
- You've got a job.
- I've got a profession. Ha, ha.
Why the, "Ha, ha?"
You know what I've got to look forward to when I'm a big, successful composer?
Maybe six performances a year by chamber orchestras or ballet commission if I'm lucky.
A lot of arranging for other composers just to stay alive and funny, the end.
Eek. I hate the taste of whisky.
Grace, pay attention.
We're not starving.
No, not quiet. Not as long as you keep working.
Madam Proofreader with a college diploma.
Alright.
What did the great man say?
Well, he's nuts about the arrangement
I did on "Love and Follow."
Oh, goody.
♪ Love is a lure that one must follow.. ♪♪
Now, cut it out.
What's wrong with using a talent if you've got it?
Exactly.
He says the record will sell a million and furthermore,
I've picked the singers and he's nuts about that, too.
Sounds like he's generally nuts.
Well, he says if I come to work for Verve within three years, maybe five
I can be the AandR man.
What's an AandR man?
In the record business, he's God, that's who.
Artist and Repertoire.
He picks the stuff they're going to record who's going to record it and he makes a fortune.
I didn't know you wanted a fortune.
You got anything against money?
I'd like some.
I guess I'd like a lot.
Well, then..
Depends on what it costs.
Okay, so I wouldn't be writing music.
Who in this world gets what he wants anyway?
Some people do.
Well, some people have got the money to do it with.
Grace, we have been married four years.
We are no further now then the day we met.
I don't want this to turn into..
I don't know, schlubs.
I don't want us to be like all the schlubs in the world walking around stoop shouldered and afraid.
The men with mortgages around their necks and the women with their fat bellies full of kids.
I don't want you going to a stupid job each day and hating it and hating me.
- I don't.
- But you will.
You're arguing with yourself, aren't you?
Because you're not convinced.
Alright, convince me.
I don't know.
I just don't know.
I-I bought you something.
Where?
From GV?
Shouldn't it say,
"From GV with love?"
The love is understood.
- Grace..
- Would you close the window?
There's a draft in here.
Draft? It's 97 deg..
Thank you.
You got a handkerchief?
- Honey--
- I'm going to do the laundry.
At this hour?
Nobody else would be using the machine.
'You're not angry?'
You know how much I love you?
Well, then what?
Are you worried about me?
Of course, I'm worried about you, you foolish jerk.
I am you.
I spend the whole day figuring out what to say to you.
What to wear to please you, how to make you laugh what to feed you, don't you know that?
I didn't.
You come home hollering about schlubs and making a fortune and..
Oh, to hell with it.
Grace.
Did you mean what you said?
About what?
Female schlubs with their bellies full of kids?
Well, I, I sure wouldn't want a baby now.
That's too bad.
Why?
Because I'm pregnant.
Oh, really?
That's impossible.
Well, it happened.
Could we sue Margaret Sanger?
Don't be funny.
I forgot.
I have no sense of humor.
Oh, dear.
It couldn't have happened.
Alright, maybe I wanted it to.
- Maybe?
- Alright, I did.
Grace, are you out of your..
Why?
I don't know.
I thought a baby would..
Well, something is happening between us.
A-all that's happening to us is creeping poverty.
And if you think a baby is any kinda cure for that..
How much money have we got?
Forty-eight dollars.
[sighs]
Oh.
Alright, I can borrow some.
Well, we don't need it right away.
We have about seven months and ten days.
I can borrow some for an abortion.
No.
'Why not?'
Because I want it.
[sighs]
Well, that's settled.
I have got to take that job!
Not on my account.
Grace, we can't have it both ways.
I want it both ways.
Fine. What do we do with the kid?
Throw it out into the street?
I got news for you, it's a lousy world outside.
There are tigers and there are sheep out there and the tigers eat the sheep.
Oh, great!
It's a lousy world, so don't fight it, join it.
Grow fangs and eat people and sell out everything that's good about yourself.
Everything that's, that's decent..
Oh, I know exactly what I mean.
- You're talking crazy!
- No. You are!
- I'm absolutely logical.
- Oh, shut up!
I'm absolutely logical and you know it.
[weeping]
[sighs]
Oh, boy.
There goes Grace The Weeper.
Shut up.
Shut up.
[clock ticking]
[dramatic music]
Grace?
[jazz music]
[music continues]
[music continues]
[music continues]
Grace! Grace!
[gasps]
You damned fool!
He smiled at me.
That means something.
- He smiled at me.
- What are you raving about?
Oh, you said the world was lousy but he smiled at me.
He smiled at you because you're naked under that coat!
Is that why?
You weren't really going to do it?
I don't know.
I don't know what..
Oh, God!
I am so mixed up.
Oh, listen, Grace, we're going to make it turn out our way.
The way we want it, do you hear me?
We're young and tough, why should we be crying on a bridge?
What do we do?
They made the rules, didn't they?
Alright, we'll learn the rules.
We'll play it their way.
Listen to me, this is me standing here.
'I'm gonna get what I want, and you can't stop me.'
- We'll be tigers.
- Now you're talking.
We'll be tigers and we'll drink blood.
They can't stop us, Grace.
- They can't stop us!
- Please!
We'll learn, Grace. We'll beat the bastards, I swear!
I am not Grace!
I almost know her name.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
[sighs]
This crazy alarm goes off in my mind like-like a warning.
Of what?
I can see it, there's a room..
...a door..
Something awful right behind the door.
There's nothing behind that door.
Don't open it!
[instrumental music]
'What are you doing?'
S-someplace I've got to be.
- Where?
- It's important.
There's somebody waiting.
Who?
I don't know.
Well, will you come back?
I-I don't know, maybe.
Come back!
[instrumental music]
[tires screeching]
[honking]
[jazz music]
[music continues]
Someplace I've got to be.
- What place?
- 'Buddwing..'
Where did you find a cockamamie name like that?
[music continues]
I'm the maniac.
Let me see your identification.
Beggar man.
- I'm lost.
- So go find yourself.
- Where in Oyster Bay?
- 'Bronxville.'
It's possible I'm insane.
You do know, don't you?
- Steady, Ray.
- Collision course.
[instrumental music]
[train rumbling]
[organ music]
- Give us happiness.
- Everything dies.
'Give us happiness.'
Help! Escaped maniac.
[dramatic music]
- Chappaqua?
- Keeps hammering to get in.
- Mount Kisco.
- Something awful.
You don't wanna remember.
God, I love music.
Lovely, what is it?
- A composer.
- A composer!
Tell me your name!
[can clanking]
[piano music]
You dumb, lost puppy.
[telephone rings]
Hello?
'Uh, hello, Gloria.'
Who is this?
I-i-it's me again.
Uh, who the hell is me again?
I-I was there this morning.
Oh, what do you want?
Another handout?
Well, n-no.
It's just that I'm afraid.
I-I don't know anybody and I thought--
My husband is here.
[instrumental music]
[engine revving]
[tires screeching]
Hey, you.
You wanna be a trophy?
[chuckles]
You. I'm talking to you.
- What did you say?
- I'm on a scavenger hunt.
I'm supposed to bring back a tall man in a grey suit.
What do you say?
- Bring him back where?
- Oyster Bay.
That's an out of town fare, lady.
Well, you tend to your driving.
I'm just advising you, it's an out a town fare.
Do you want me to take your number?
Right away, they wanna take your number.
Is this a gag?
[chuckles]
Does it look like a gag?
Come on, if I have to drag a man back to that party he might as well be good looking.
That's very flattering, but--
What have you got in the bag, your lunch?
Whiskey.
[chuckles]
Good. I picked a winner.
I'm sorry but I'm-I'm on my way somewhere--
- I'll help you get there.
- By way of Oyster Bay?
- Come on, lady, where to?
- Oh, hold your water.
I gotta look at this list.
What the hell did I do with it?
[chuckles]
Yes.
Blind as a bat without my glasses.
Can you read it?
Don't mind the odd page.
It's there by osmosis.
You really were supposed to find a man in a grey suit.
Sure. What do you think this was? A pick up?
Give me a cigarette.
I'm sorry.
I don't-I don't smoke.
Hey, gimme a cigarette.
I'm a cab driver, lady, not a butler.
What his number?
I can't read it from here.
My name is Fredrick Calabrese.
Does that answer your questions?
I don't wanna ride with you.
Whoa..
[chuckles]
Here. Pay him.
- Me?
- 'Two and a quarter.'
Pay him, pay him, but if you tip him a penny, I'll brain you.
Better watch yourself, mister, that's a real fly babe.
[engine revving]
Hey, you did tip him.
Well, you were pretty rough.
He should've tipped me.
He never had a ride like that in his life.
Unh! He, he, he.
Hey, what kind of booze you got there?
- Scotch.
- Oh, lovely, open it.
We'll have a drink.
I told you I'm suppose to be someplace else.
Oh, the beast emerges.
Good, I love bestial men.
Come on, give me the bottle.
Oh, come on, come on.
- Hey, you better go easy.
- Oh, why?
I go hard or easy, anyway I want to. Cheers.
Ick! I hate the taste of whisky.
Well, what are the other things on that list?
Not the man in the grey suit.
I've got him.
Well, the first thing is a, a $100,000 in cash.
Oh, easy.
Uh, I guess they mean play money.
No, I guess they mean real money.
What's next?
A black Cadillac sedan.
[chuckles]
Easy.
We'll call Gary Cadillac and charge it to my husband.
What's next?
We still haven't got the $100,000.
Oh, stick with me, honey.
Everything's easy.
Uh, your name in the newspaper?
Easy. The Penny Arcade on Broadway. What else?
Three good men and true to testify to your character.
[whistles]
Three men to testify to my character?
We better make it yours.
Oh, forget it.
I'm not going with you.
Oh, now, why not?
Look what that list offers.
Fame, fortune, adventure, romance? Hm-mm.
Where's the adventure and romance?
Me.
You're not on the list.
I'm better than on that list.
I'm here.
Feel that? It's me.
Got any more problems?
Yes.
[sighs]
I don't know who I am.
[laughs]
Oh, it's identity you want, huh?
Well, identity's a $100,000, a black Cadillac a beautiful blonde in your arm, your name in the papers and three lackeys to tell you how great you are.
There, it's right on your list.
Your list.
Mine, yours, same difference.
Atta baby.
Well, let's go get that stuff, hmm?
[humming]
Excuse me?
Take us to the Penny Arcade on Broadway.
'Thank you.'
- Ever been there?
- I don't think so.
- Ever been to Grant's Tomb?
- Nope.
A born New Yorker.
Ever been to the Queensboro Bridge?
Bridges. I don't like bridges.
I almost jumped off one once.
- Why?
- Oh, feeling blue.
- Why?
- Why? Why? Why?
I was a kid.
Centuries ago.
I'm interested.
[sighs]
Well, I was a little bit pregnant and it wasn't, uh, how should we say convenient to have the kid.
So instead of jumping off the bridge, I got rid off it.
Went to a butcher with dirty hands and that took care of the next generation.
Are you married?
Yes.
What's her name?
Grace.
Pretty name.
Hey, I'm getting sober.
Where is the bottle?
I like you better sober.
Nobody cares whether you like me or not.
- Give me the bottle.
- No.
Oh, my. A difficult man.
When were you born?
January 10th.
[sighs]
Capricorn. It figures.
Not that I believe in that stuff anymore.
What do you believe in?
Nothing.
Not the stars, not God, love or marriage.
Nothing but the loop we're gonna win tonight with this Cadillac wrapped around us.
[cars honking]
- Wait right here.
- There's no parking sign.
Good, it'll make a nice decoration for the party.
- Rip it off.
- Me?
Sure. Live a little.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey, my friend wants his name in a headline.
Write it down.
No more than 25 letters.
- Pages count in letters.
- How long will it take?
Half an hour. You can wait or come back, either way.
You think we could make a 100 grand in half an hour?
(man
'Only way you could do that'
'is I was to run it off on this press.'
- 'No, we need real money.'
- That's a lot of loot, lady.
Not if you're lucky.
You lucky?
This stud in the grey suit's my lucky charm.
- You want a newspaper or not?
- We want it.
Now, what shall we say?
"A couple caught robbing a bank?"
That was more than 25 letters.
Why don't we just say I've been a success or something?
- Yeah, just say he made it.
- Ah!
So and so makes it.
- Say what's your name?
- I haven't got one.
Well, every man's got a name.
I'm not every man.
How do you know?
There! How's that?
I'm not every man.
I'm me.
Well, who are you?
Nobody.
Hey, that's more to the point.
Poetic, but untrue.
We are going to make it.
We'll be back in half an hour.
What kind of a headline is that?
What are you, a printer or an editor?
Come on, let's make a hundred grand.
"Nobody makes it."
Hey.
You serious about that loot?
Why? You know a bank some place?
Banks are for puttin' in, lady.
- Yeah, what's for taking out?
- Crap games.
Life's the biggest crap game going.
Me, I don't dig symbolism but if you're looking for a real crap game with real money..
I've got 36 cents.
It'll never get you into this game.
Will a 100?
You figure to parley one bill into a 100 grand?
Will there be that much money in the game?
It's there if you can take it home.
Fine. What's your cut?
Win a hundred and ten,
I take home ten.
You really do think we're gonna make it.
I think you're gonna bust that game wide open.
How come?
Man, when you're born black you never know the smell of luck till it comes sailin' down Broadway sweet and cool in your nose.
When you two walked in
I got such a whiff, it nearly knocked me down.
I'd like my share.
You're on.
Where is this game?
Up in Harlem.
You ain't a segregationist or anything?
Yeah, I sure am.
I wanna segregate all that money from its rightful owner.
- Well, let's get to it.
- My name is Hank.
I know you husband's name,
'cause you wrote it out.
But I don't think we've had the pleasure.
Just call me Grace.
[engine revving]
♪ A 100 grand a 100 grand
♪ A hundred lousy lovely grand ♪♪
[laughs]
How do you know we'll make it?
Because we needed to win.
What do we get when we win?
The right to keep playing, that's all.
The right to collect $200 every time we pass go until we're bankrupt.
You can't be bankrupt if you win.
You think not?
Then what?
Then, out.
We pack up our pretties and trade 'em for the Queensboro Bridge.
Hello, Grace.
Welcome home.
Where have you been?
Ooh, up, down, around.
I had to leave the party alone.
I looked for you and you were gone.
Oh, lovely, let's make a song of it.
♪ I looked for you and you were gone I looked for you.. ♪♪
Cut it out!
Would've sold a million copies.
Alright, who was it this time?
I didn't quite catch his name but if you'd like a description..
Don't touch me!
That'll make me the only man around who doesn't.
Oh, right.
There's a name for woman like you.
Say it and while you're on the subject think of one for yourself.
Such as?
Well, sir, when it comes to a quick roll in the bushes
I am not the only half of this--
Take your hands off me.
Let go..
Oh, God.
God, look.
Is that us?
When did we start to look like that?
I think a long time back.
Why? What did it?
Was it the job I took?
The baby I killed?
Oh, look at them!
Mr. and Mrs. Cinderella, the American dream.
- Oh, Grace.
- We're dead.
It's my fault.
Not yours.
Nobody's.
That's the awful thing.
It just happens.
Do you remember how we first met?
Washington Square.
That day at the beach..
I gave you a haircut.
And that night we were married..
...we prayed.
Was that us?
We're still young.
We could go back.
- Oh, we can't go back.
- We could try.
Well, million years ago, we're dinosaurs, we're extinct.
Don't say that, Grace.
We've worked too hard.
Won too much.
We've got everything.
And somewhere down the years we've lost the only thing that mattered.
Alright, we'll have it back.
I swear to you.
You're still talking.
Why are you still talking?
You're damn silly fool.
We're dead.
We're dead. We're dead.
We're dead.
- Here we are, folks.
- Good! Let's live.
'Let's go. Roll 'em.'
'Eight. Eight is the point.'
[indistinct chatter]
- 'Let's go'
- 'Eight right back.'
- 'No, six.'
- 'Huh!'
Come on, we're hot to trot.
- Seven.
- Oh..
[indistinct chatter]
- Shoot at 50.
- Here it comes.
Go steady here.
Now, listen, you little buggers when I say "come," you're gonna come and when I say "pass," you're going pass.
Right now, your mamma's telling you to pass.
Come on, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em.
- You be good now, you hear?
- Make it hot.
'It's a four.'
- Card.
- Two to one, no four.
- It's a bet.
- 'Bet, bet.'
- 'It's a bet.'
- 'Okay.'
- 'I'm with you..'
- Hundred here.
- Two to one, no four.
- Two to one, no four.
- Right here.
- Come on, hut!
- Let's go.
- 'Come on..'
- 'Come on.'
- 'Come on.'
- 'Two two's.'
- 'Let it ride!'
[indistinct chatter]
Three hundred, she's right.
Come on, baby, come on.
- Twenty dollars.
- Four hundred repay.
- Let it ride.
- Four hundred.
Come on.
Come on, you buggers now you pass.
Hut, hut!
Eleven!
Let it ride.
So far so good.
Where's the heavy stuff?
For very big bread.
'A pusher. Works a lot of high schools in the Bronx.'
And that one, seen him roll quarter of a million.
- 'He's loaded, too.'
- Present.
Twelve hundred. She's wrong.
- 'I'll take it.'
- 'Fifty.'
[indistinct chatter]
- 'Five!'
- 'Five!'
Fever me, babies. A little fever for momma now, huh?
Seven.
- 'Ah!'
- 'Oh, well.'
- Your dice, lady.
- Okay, fat man, here you go.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey, you roll.
Twenty-four hundred, he's right.
- Two grand.
- Four bills.
- How do you feel, man?
- Lucky.
- Roll 'em.
- Roll 'em, roll 'em.
- We want a seven, honey.
- Honey, here's your seven.
Ha! Six and a one.
- He's doin' it, Grace.
- 'Easy, gimme the loot.'
'Four to one, he don't seven again.'
'What are you betting, blondie?'
I bet the 4800.
You don't leave no room for error, baby.
- We can't lose.
- Oh, do tell.
- A 100 says he passes.
- Fate is coming.
- I'll take three.
- Cover me?
- Make it hot.
- Eighteen.
- Roll 'em, roll 'em, will ya?
- 'Yeah.'
- Give me a seven, dice.
- 'Seven, seven, seven.'
'Seven! Seven! Seven!'
'Nine!'
We've got a hot shooter in the game..
Oh, shoot them babies while they're hot, come on.
What do you want me to bet now?
- All of it.
- Hold it.
- Put part on 11.
- Why?
- I've got a feeling.
- Okay?
Okay with me.
Seven to one hundred, he's right.
You're faded for five.
I'll take twenty-one.
Twenty-five hundreds, he elevens.
'I'll give you a fifteen to one on that.'
'The right odds are seventeen to one.'
'Oh, boy, we got an accountant in the house.'
'Well..'
'You know eleven's a one shot bet, don't you, lady?'
She knows it.
Come on, these dice are coolin' off.
- Your cover, lady.
- 'Talk to 'em, talk to 'em.'
Gimme now eleven, dice.
Gotta keep winnin' to stay in the game.
- 'One bill says he does.'
- 'Fifteen to one.'
You heard the man, 17.
Okay, one bill, 17.
Can I roll these damn things now?
Give the man his eleven.
I want an eleven.
Eleven. Eleven. Eleven.
Eleven. Eleven. Eleven.
Eleven. Eleven.
- 'Ha ha.'
- 'Yeah!'
- You made it.
- How much have we got?
'Just a minute.'
'Oh, baby, I got me enough money'
'to choke a horse.'
Buddy, you sure been living right
'Don't let them babies cool, honey.'
- 'Roll 'em. Roll 'em.'
- How much? How much?
- Fifty seven thousand.
- Bet it all on the next roll.
Hey, go slow, man. If we lose that, we're out of the game.
Yeah, if we win it, we're out of the game, too.
- Go.
- 'Come on, big rollers.'
I'm offering 57000, we'll fade it.
Come in here with one bill and you're bustin' up the joint.
That's gambling, baby.
- Now, you fading or not?
- I'd take ten of it.
- Ten for me.
- Thirty seven open.
In or out?
First, I'd like to have a look at them dice.
What is this? A TV show?
I don't know what kind of a show it is.
I only know you've got 42 grand off me on that last roll.
'Now, maybe that doesn't give me the right to examine those dice' where you come from, but on my block, it buys a look.
- Show him the dice.
- Alright.
Just don't cool them off.
Just wants to make sure they aren't too hot.
'What do you think?'
I think 57,000 calls for a new pair of dice.
It's the shooter's option to change dice.
Not if they're crooked.
Those dice were in the game when we got here.
If they're crooked, they're crooked for you, too.
'I know guys to the bottom of the river.'
Oh, you and your guy to the bottom of the river.
- Give him the dice.
- Come on, give him the dice.
Yeah, they're straight, let him shoot.
There's your three good man and true.
- In or out?
- Roll 'em.
Gonna cover me a thousand.
- Come on, baby.
- Let it ride.
Come on, dice.
[indistinct chatters]
- 'The point is ten.'
- Easy, everything's easy.
- Two to one, no ten.
- I'll take that.
- Five on any craps.
- Eight to one, I'll take 50.
- Eight to one, or hot.
- How much?
- One bill.
- One bill, your cover.
'Come on, baby, we want a ten.'
'Roll 'em. Roll 'em.'
- You alright, man?
- Sure, he's alright.
Roll 'em, baby. Give it to 'em.
'Go, man, make them babies behave.'
Come on, ten!
- 'Eleven.'
- 'Wait a minute.'
Can I talk to those dice?
- 'Sure, talk to him.'
- Hold it.
Are you rolling or is he?
Oh, he is.
Well, then leave the dice alone.
I just wanna talk to them.
Let her talk to 'em.
How do we know she won't pull a switch?
Where would she hide another pair of dice?
Oh, you tell him.
- Talk to 'em, honey.
- Come on, ten.
That's all we need.
Just one more ten.
- Come on, ten.
- Come on, give me the dice.
Come on, make my ten and go.
- Here, I talked to 'em.
- Okay.
- Now, make it.
- The hard way, honey.
'Two sweet fives.'
Come on, roll 'em, roll 'em.
Alright, ten, baby, ten.
Give me a ten, give me a ten!
Now!
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give it to me.
You did it!
[screams]
Baby, what's the matter?
Not Monument, Mount Kisco.
This telephone number.
It's the hospital in Mt. Kisco.
- Hey, baby, where you going?
- Home.
Oh, you can't go home.
Don't you know that, baby?
You can't go home!
Dan?
I-is she alive?
Barely.
'Will she live?'
Who knows?
Dan, look at me.
You're disgusting.
Who called the hospital?
Are you kidding?
I don't remember.
You did.
Then what?
What are you, playing some kind of crummy game?
Tell me.
You disappeared.
When they got to the house, it was open.
Nobody there but Grace, lying in her own..
Where the hell have you been?
Where the hell have I been?
You mean, who have I been?
Dan, I want to see her.
No.
You can't stop me.
I will. I will.
- And if it's necessary--
- Dan, Dan.
I'm begging you.
She's not conscious.
Any way.
I'll go see.
[sighs]
Oh, dear God.
Let her live.
Let her live.
Just for a moment.
Thanks, Dan.
Grace?
[breathing heavily]
Oh, Grace.
[melancholic music]
[music continues]
[music continues]
Ladies and gentlemen!
And now the only act of its kind performing without a net.
The most death defying tight wire act,
Gaspar the Great!
Hand me tonight's receipts, Dorando.
Your hands are trembling.
Monica, how can you sit there so calmly and check box office receipts after that horrible catastrophe?
How can you be so cold-blooded?
Realistic is the word.
It's a good thing I took control when it happened.
If I depended on you, we would have had a panic on our hands.
Yes, it's a good thing you're inhuman.
We're running a circus, not a charm school.
And most important, people have to be entertained.
- Yes, yes. "The show must go on."
- Always.
No matter what the cost?
Mmm. Like in a war.
Troops are expendable.
Privates and generals alike.
Expendable.
Are you aiming that at me?
You think you can do without me?
Not yet.
What if I insist?
I'm fed up.
All you have to do is buy me out.
I'm not ready for you to leave.
You know very well I can't afford to buy you out.
You'll just have to wait.
I want out now.
I'm leaving.
Oh, you miserable, gutless adding machine!
What are you trying to do?
Ruin my circus?
- And you have the nerve to want to...
- (KNOCKING)
Come in!
- Miss Rivers?
- Yes.
I'm Detective Sergeant Hutchins.
This is Detective Constable Bradford.
How can I help you, gentlemen?
Well, first I must tell you that none of Gaspar's equipment must be moved or touched until it's been checked by our experts.
Of course.
Now just a few questions.
Who built the apparatus that was used in the high-wire act?
Gaspar himself had the units hand-constructed.
- Did anyone else handle it?
- Yes, our labour crew.
He always checked it personally, though.
If you like, I can give you the names of the helpers.
Well, we shall need more than that.
Please have all your performers and workers assembled at ten o'clock tomorrow morning for routine questioning.
Yes, yes, of course.
You understand this investigation might take a few days?
And until then, nobody is to leave the circus.
Nobody.
Good night.
- Good night.
- (CAR DRIVING AWAY)
Well, Dorando, you heard the law.
Nobody leaves.
That'll keep you from deserting me while I still need you.
You always win, don't you, Monica?
If you had a brain in your head, you'd see that you win, too.
What do you mean?
Well, so far we've had a bad season.
And now with the accident, the splash publicity, it's going to be great for the box office.
People have a morbid curiosity about death.
Especially a violent one.
That's why I'm sure that we'll be jam-packed tomorrow night, with people hoping they'll see a repeat performance of death.
It really excites you.
I haven't seen you in such high spirits since we started the tour.
Poor Dorando.
Why are you always so depressed?
What can I do to cheer you up?
You know what?
I just may let you tuck me in tonight.
But first, there are a few things you have to attend to.
I want you to get photographs of Gaspar and send them to all the newspapers.
It'll dress up the story.
Then I want you to wire all the agents in London, Paris and Berlin.
Get a top act to replace him.
But that will take me most of the night.
So what's the difference?
I'm a light sleeper.
I've got a great equestrian act for you, Miss Rivers: The Gorraras.
The last time they performed, two of their horses dropped dead in the ring of old age.
What about the Fabulous Glen?
He's still the best trick cyclist in the business.
When he's sober, which isn't often.
Look, don't waste my time with these broken down has-beens.
Some of them are as old as my elephants and twice as wrinkled.
I want something fresh.
A new face with an exciting act.
I'd like to talk to you, Miss Rivers.
- What about?
- My act.
- Frank Hawkins is the name.
- I never heard of you.
Well, I'm new in this part of the world.
But I overheard you tell them that you wanted something fresh and exciting.
- And you, of course, fill the bill?
- I certainly do.
Don't you have an agent?
I do better handling myself.
You see, Bruno, we have a double daredevil.
Agent and artist all rolled into one.
After you've seen my act, you'll agree with me.
I must say you certainly are the shy type. What do you do?
- High wire act.
- That's a bit of luck.
You know, of course, what happened to our last one, Gaspar the Great.
I caught his act last night.
Saw him hanging around.
Leave the comedy to Bruno and the rest of the clowns.
I haven't time for your grisly jokes.
Just give me the details of your act.
- High-wire. Sixty feet up over a...
- I know, over a safety net.
No, not quite.
Why don't you see the act for yourself?
One performance.
You can make up your mind.
And if I like it? How much?
I'll leave the money up to you.
See my act tonight, and if
I'm not worth top money, well, this place is loaded with exits.
On those terms, you got a deal.
Mr Hawkins!
You're a bit jumpy, aren't you, Mr Hawkins?
I don't like being touched.
Especially by a stranger.
Well, we won't be strangers for long.
My name is Harrison Liston.
I specialise in the representation of circus acts and novelties.
I don't care what you do.
We haven't met, but I know you, Mr Hawkins.
- What the hell do you want?
- I want to help you.
I listened to you selling yourself just now.
Wonderful, quite wonderful.
Up to a point.
And then you kill your case by leaving the money up to Monica Rivers.
I handle my own affairs. Now, why don't you mind your own business?
You need me in other ways.
After all, you're a foreigner in this country.
I can, er... smooth over some bothersome details for you.
Look, I don't want anything from you, so why don't you leave me alone?
As I said, I can smooth over some bothersome details
Like, er... getting you a labour permit.
After all, you wouldn't want the authorities to know about what happened in Canada, would you, Mr Hawkins?
It might make getting that labour permit a bit difficult.
All right. All right!
Don't ever come near me again.
And now, it is my special privilege to give you that daredevil of the high wire,
The Magnificent Hawkins!
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to see the only act of its kind in the entire world.
The Magnificent Hawkins performs without a net sixty feet above the steel bayonets and wearing a blindfold.
He defies death with every step.
I now call your attention to the arena directly under the wire.
Ladies and gentlemen, in his walk of death,
The Magnificent Hawkins!
Here's your contract.
Thank you, Mr Dorando.
You'll find everything in that agreement to your satisfaction.
You should, with that salary.
It's the biggest bite any performer has ever taken out of this circus.
You're older than I am, Mr Dorando, but I'm sure you'll agree in this world you only get what you deserve.
No more, no less.
You can keep your little gems of wisdom to yourself.
What about my private caravan?
- Miss Rivers promised me that I...
- I don't care what Miss Rivers promised.
On business deals, my decision is final.
Besides, we don't happen to have an extra caravan.
Unless of course you'd like me to give up mine.
No, thanks.
It's not nearly comfortable enough.
Thank you for letting me keep it.
Next season, if you're still with us, and continue to draw, we'll think about your private caravan.
Maybe I won't have to wait that long.
That's, er, Hawkins.
I-N-S. Frank Hawkins.
Looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Don't get carried away, son.
I've painted many names on these caravans, and I've painted many out.
And I've yet to come across a name that could outlive the paint.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we give you the world's greatest elephant act.
MONICA: And now, Jody, the wonder elephant, weighing over five tons, will walk over six girls lying on the floor of the arena.
Sure beats eating in the canteen.
We ought to do it more often.
I'm crazy about you, Monica.
- I'm fond of you, Frank.
- No more?
Why should there be more?
You're still a stranger to me.
Actually, I know very little about you.
You... well, you don't talk about your past.
That's because I'm only interested in the future.
Our future.
Ha-ha. Not so fast, Frank.
I like you, but I don't want this to mushroom.
Why not?
What are you scared of?
Long ago...
One day I'll give you all the chapters.
Long ago, I lost the capacity to love.
Let's enjoy what we have.
It makes this crazy circus life more bearable.
You sure know how to put out a fire.
If you want me to spell it out for you, I will.
To me, what we have is no more important than a greeting card.
Sometimes maybe not as friendly.
I'll make you change your mind.
- You'll try, and you'll fail.
- Why?
- Too many obstacles.
- Like Dorando?
He's just my business partner.
Well, I hate the old lecher!
The way he drools over you.
The way he watches me all the time.
- He stinks of jealousy.
- Stop it!
That's just what I mean.
You get all worked up and spoil everything.
Now look, Frank.
What I do with my life is strictly my own affair.
I'll remember that.
And now...
I need my sleep.
Good night, Monica.
- (CLANGING THUD)
- (SCREAMING)
BRUNO:
Miss Rivers! Miss Rivers!
Just a minute.
Miss Rivers, please come quick.
Something terrible has happened.
It's Mr Dorando.
Listen everybody, I know how terribly shocked we all are.
There's no point in you staying up any longer.
Please go back to sleep.
Please.
"Go to sleep"!
That's her remedy for everything, as if we were children.
If you listen to me, we do not go to sleep.
Not yet.
It is clear to me there is a killer loose, and none of us is safe until the murderer is caught.
I'm really frightened.
After what I just saw, I'm so scared
I can hear me bones rattle.
Even I admit it.
For the first time in my life, my nerves bother me.
I am stronger than two horses, you all know that when I bend an iron bar with my teeth, it is for real.
Iron!
But even I cannot fight what I cannot see.
Exactly.
That is why we must find out who is behind these killings.
These killings?
You don't think Gaspar was an accident, do you?
Only a fool would swallow that.
Who are you?
The Chief of Police?
Well, how do you know what's what?
That's right! I say we do what Miss Rivers told us.
Go to bed.
Leave police work to the police.
And entertaining to us.
You! You wouldn't stick your neck out to save your mother.
Oh, why don't you shut up?
Look at her. She can't wait to get back to the caravan and her bottle of booze.
Who do you think you are?
Why don't you two go and fight in your own caravan?
Well, I'm not afraid to come right out and say it.
We all know that Miss Rivers has lost no sleep over these murders.
With my own ears I heard her say that murder is good for business.
Doesn't that tell you who's behind them?
I ask you, when did we ever play to such capacity crowds?
The circus has never done such good business.
I tell you, she's behind the whole thing.
Matilda, you're crazy!
You're a hothead. A lunatic!
BRUNO:
That's what I say.
We all know it can't be Miss Rivers.
You speak for yourself.
We all know you're her slave.
Give the others a chance to talk.
You! You advertise yourself as a clairvoyant. You tell fortunes.
Who do you say is responsible?
About murder?
Leave me out. I know nothing.
All you're interested in is having your palm crossed.
- Why don't you speak up?
- Yes, this is most urgent.
So, tell us. What do the stars and your tea leaves and your crystal ball tell you?
They tell me to mind my own business.
You're not only a fake but a coward!
You see! We have to take things into our own hands and stop these killings before we're all murdered one by one.
And I say once again, it's the boss!
You hear the lions?
They smell blood.
They're very sensitive.
Last night, they were restless.
Ahh! Before you get carried away, let me ask some questions.
- You, Emil.
- What about me?
I refresh your memory.
Last year in West Berlin, you told me that Dorando promised you a raise.
So what?
But he never gave it to you.
So you held a grudge against him.
I wouldn't kill over money!
- No?
- I wouldn't!
You always walk alone at night.
Yeah, that's right.
I myself have seen you.
Then it could be you.
What are you doing walking alone in the middle of the night?
Me, I walk for fresh air.
Fresh air? Who believes that?
You told me you hated Dorando.
And you once told me you hated Gaspar because he made fun of your whiskers.
Maybe you did it.
You fool! How could I ever get away with murder?
I'm the easiest one in the whole circus to identify.
You see my beard before you see me.
But you! I heard you tell Gaspar to keep away from your wife.
That's true.
I warned him to stay away.
Look, I may be all bones, but I can still use a gun.
Anyway, she still left me.
She couldn't take the bruises.
Hold it! Hold it, everyone!
We'll never get anywhere fighting among ourselves.
Take my word for it.
It's the boss!
MONICA: You're right.
You'll never get anywhere, period.
You slut! You miserable ingrate!
When I picked you and your lover
Lazlo up, you were starving.
I advanced you money for your act, gave you billing.
And how do you repay me?
By stirring up trouble behind my back!
- You can't frighten us. I still say...
- Cut your tongue out first.
I can still get a dozen acts like yours.
And you! If it weren't for me, you'd all starve to death.
- We're frightened.
- We're nervous.
I know what you are.
Look, let me do the worrying.
Now get back to your caravans.
We're sold out for tomorrow's matinee, and I want a great show.
Lazlo!
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
Let's say that you just got carried away.
But that loud-mouthed Matilda, you'd better control her, shut her up, or I'll cancel your act and toss you both out of here.
Ah! You sent for me, Commissioner?
Brooks, I hate to mar the picture, but you'll have to remove that boutonnière.
- You know how allergic I am to pollen.
- Oh, I'm very sorry, sir.
Tell me, Superintendent, when you were a little boy, did you ever want to run away and join a circus?
No, sir. Not at all.
No, I had a very happy life, with love on both sides, plus a liberal allowance and two doting aunts.
Well, spare me the details, because you've just joined a circus.
I have?
May I ask in what capacity?
Well, certainly not as a performer.
I want you to go to Liverpool.
- The Rivers Circus?
- Exactly.
And I'm glad to see you read something besides the society page.
Well, I guess I'm like most people, sir.
Reading about murder gives me a thrill.
Yes, well your job is to stop it.
It's a little bit late for that, isn't it?
At least for Mr Dorando, with a spike through his head.
I saw some pretty gruesome pictures downstairs.
Sir, I understood, that, er... you were bringing your suspects here.
What suspects? The murderer didn't leave a single clue.
Anyway, Brooks, you hunt a wild animal in its native habitat.
You don't bring a tiger up from the jungles of Asia
- to shoot it in Hyde Park.
- I quite agree, sir.
Did the local police come up with anything?
Nothing. From the report, the killer must have worn skin-tight gloves, and the ground around had been trampled on by too many people to get any footprints.
This circus is rather accident-prone, isn't it?
I recall there was another gruesome death.
Mmm.
That's item two on the agenda.
Three weeks ago in Leeds, their star performer, a high wire virtuoso called Gaspar the Great, was hung to death by his own wire when it broke beneath his feet.
Was that an accident?
Well, the death of the second man makes it look like murder, doesn't it?
I'll be ready to leave in an hour, sir.
Before you go, Superintendent, just a piece of fatherly advice.
- Always ready to receive that, sir.
- That suit you have on, it looks new and expensive.
- Savile Row?
- Of course.
And hand-made shoes.
Dressing smartly is a fetish of yours.
- Well, sir, I don't drink, or gamble.
- I know, your only passion, apart from your work, is your wardrobe.
- Yes, sir. Your advice?
- Just this:
Leave your expensive feathers in their moth-proof containers.
You'll find this circus a rather untidy place.
Brooks, concentrate on the job.
I know you're the man for it.
That's why I'm letting you handle it alone.
There's one more city on their itinerary before they arrive here in London.
Stay with them.
MATILDA:
Very nice!
You've got knuckles on your hands.
Use 'em next time you enter my caravan.
Sorry, but as you can see, my hands are full.
Why don't you make yourself at home?
Thanks. I thought you might like a little company, so I brought round a bottle.
I don't drink.
In that case, you can watch me.
- Do you make a habit of this?
- Drinking?
Coming to men's caravans at twelve o'clock at night.
Only if I like them.
I'm flattered, but you could have waited for an invitation.
Well, I realise you're the elusive type, Frank.
Women have to chase you, so here I am.
And now that you've caught me?
Isn't this a little dangerous?
Doesn't it worry you that Lazlo might find out?
At this moment,
Lazlo is snoring away in bed.
That's all he ever does do in bed.
As much as I would like to, honey,
I'm afraid I have to show you the door, and bid you good night.
What's the matter, Frank?
Don't you like me?
I find you very attractive.
It's just that you're peddling your merchandise at the wrong booth.
You wouldn't say that to Monica Rivers.
What the hell does she have to do with you?
No need to be so rough, Frank.
I was just trying to be friendly.
Well, I hope your timing in your act is better than it is here.
My timing is very good.
You knock me out, Matilda.
You really do.
I get it. You're not worried about
Lazlo finding out, are you?
What do you mean?
It's Monica you're afraid of.
You've got to be kidding.
Why should Monica worry me?
I know all about you and her.
- Who cares?
- I do, for your sake.
Well, that's nice of you.
She's dangerous, Frank.
Very dangerous.
You may think you'll last forever, but you're wrong.
- Just remember Dorando.
- What are you getting at?
He thought he was the only one in her life, too, and when she had no more use for him, she got rid of him.
You'd better watch your mouth, Matilda.
It could get you into trouble.
I don't care. I'm not afraid of Monica, and she knows it.
I say she killed Dorando, and one day I'm going to prove it.
- You're crazy!
- Am I? Just you remember what I said.
And the next time she puts her arms around you, make sure those loving hands aren't carrying a knife.
You loud-mouthed broad.
Get out of here!
Ohhh!
Matilda, darling, you must be more careful of leaving like that.
You'll damage your brain.
You cow!
I'll teach you to laugh at me.
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, you...
GUSTAVO:
Wanda!
Wanda!
You cow!
And you!
You'll get yours, too!
Trouble-maker!
All you do is make trouble.
Wait till I get you to the caravan.
RADIO: And now we play the new record from the Kenny Glen Group.
Quite a party.
Did you enjoy it?
What are you talking about, Monica?
Don't get any wrong ideas.
Wrong ideas?
Just because you've been entertaining a woman in your caravan in the middle of the night, dressed like that?
Now use your head. You don't think
I invited her in here, do you?
- Yes!
- Well, you're wrong.
Matilda came in here unasked and uninvited, and I threw her out.
After two hours!
Right away. That's what the ruckus was all about.
- Why?
- Why what?
Well, you're certainly no saint, and, er... she's attractive, in a common sort of way.
Why did you throw her out?
She started shooting her mouth off.
About me?
She's crazy.
She thinks you murdered Dorando.
And you?
What do you think?
You can trust me, Monica.
- BRUNO: It's supposed to be lucky.
- I hope you're right.
All the same, I shall watch where I walk in future.
This your first time at a circus?
Backstage, so to speak, yes it is.
Thought so.
You don't look like a circus man.
And a circus man would never have trodden in elephant's...
Yes, quite, quite.
I'll try not to do it again.
Are you looking for something?
Yes, I am, as a matter of fact.
Perhaps you can help me.
- I want Miss Monica Rivers.
- What for?
- I beg your pardon?
- You're not another reporter, are you?
No, no, I'm not a reporter.
We've been told to chase them off the lot if we see any.
- I'll take you to Miss Rivers.
- Thank you.
Surprised, eh?
Can't tell the difference when I'm behind that door.
Do it all the time.
Come on.
What's your name?
Well, I have to introduce you, don't I?
Can't just shove you through the door.
No, of course you can't.
I'm Detective Superintendent Brooks.
- You're a detective?
- Uh-huh.
But we've had detectives here.
I thought they'd finished.
I'm from Scotland Yard.
- (KNOCKING)
- MONICA: Come in.
Miss Rivers, there's a man to see you.
Detective Superintendent Brooks.
Well, show him in, Bruno.
He's from Scotland Yard!
- Good morning, Miss Rivers.
- Good morning.
- Bruno?
- Yes?
- Who's that?
- You'd like to know, wouldn't you?
- That's why I asked you.
- Well, I'm not going to tell you.
It's confidential.
Don't give me that.
You don't know who he is.
You're just a messenger boy.
Me, a messenger boy?
I don't know, don't I!
Well, I do, see?
He's a detective from Scotland Yard, see!
A Detective Superintendent.
Sorry, Bruno, you did know, didn't you?
But is all this questioning necessary?
I've told the local police everything I know.
And they've called in Scotland Yard,
Miss Rivers.
You'll agree there is still some areas that can stand clearing up.
Like who the murderer is, for instance.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, anything I can tell you.
How long was Albert Dorando an associate of yours?
- Seven years.
- In what capacity?
- Business manager.
- Just business manager?
What do you mean?
Well, it sometimes happens that when two people work together for seven years, something more than a business friendship develops.
Well, naturally, as you say, we did become good friends.
Intimate friends?
If what you are trying to find out is whether or not I slept with Dorando, the answer is no.
BROOKS: I'm sorry I had to press the point, Miss Rivers.
You'll understand that we cannot rule out a sex motive for the murder.
Did Mr Dorando have any financial interest in the circus?
None whatsoever.
I own the circus, lock, stock and barrel.
It's belonged to my family for fifty years.
BROOKS:
Has it always been successful?
No, no.
No, no, there's nothing certain in show business.
We've eaten caviar, and we've eaten sawdust.
But I understand that since the death of Gaspar, business has been brisk.
That's right.
So it would be correct to say,
Miss Rivers, that the circus, and therefore yourself, have gained financially from Gaspar's death.
What are you insinuating?
I'm not insinuating anything.
I'm simply trying to establish a few facts.
Now, is it true or not?
Now, can you think of anybody...
Why don't you come inside?
I'm sure you'll find it warmer, and much more comfortable.
Superintendent Brooks, may I introduce Frank Hawkins?
Ah, yes, of course! You took over the Great Gaspar's spot, didn't you, Mr Hawkins?
How opportune, as what I was about to ask Miss Rivers was:
"could you think of anyone
"who benefited from either of the two deaths?"
You don't pull any punches, do you, Superintendent?
Well, for your information,
I wasn't even with the circus when Gaspar was killed.
- Where were you, then?
- On a train.
- BROOKS: On a train.
- FRANK: Travelling up to Leeds to see Miss Rivers, to ask about a job.
That's rather strange, isn't it?
You came to see about a job in a circus that already had a high wire act.
Could anybody prove you were on that train?
Then there's no proof that you didn't travel up the day before?
Why should I lie?
Whoever interfered with
Gaspar's apparatus, Mr Hawkins, knew all about the rig.
Knew just what to do, and how to do it, and he could climb up to the heights of the tent to carry out his work.
Well, it wasn't me.
Anyone could have climbed up there.
That's right.
Every man, woman and child in this circus has been trained to climb ropes and ladders.
When the Big Top is raised, everybody helps.
I see.
Now if you've finished with your questions and decided not to arrest me yet, I'll go.
I have a matinee to get ready for.
There is one more question,
Mr Hawkins.
On the night that Dorando was killed, where were you?
In my caravan. Asleep.
I suppose there are no witnesses to that, either?
I was alone.
Where were you, Miss Rivers?
I... I was here.
I knew nothing about it until Bruno pounded on the door and woke me up.
All right, Mr Hawkins, that's all for now.
Don't plan any long trips away from the circus, for the time being.
Will you want me any more?
I, too, have a matinee.
That's all, thank you, Miss Rivers.
For the moment.
Will you be here long?
Until I find the murderer, and that brings me to my final request.
Have you anywhere I could stay?
Here on the circus grounds?
Oh, no, there's very little available space.
There is one place.
Dorando's caravan.
Do you have the keys?
Thank you, Miss Rivers.
MONICA:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, presenting Phyllis Allen, and her intelligent poodles.
- (DOGS BARKING)
- (CHILDREN LAUGHING)
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. Can I see you later?
- Too busy.
- I have to see you.
Look, I have a million things to do.
Payroll has to be made up, bills to be paid. Sorry, no time.
Then you've got to make time.
I've got to see you.
Smile. You're on!
Bruno, will you come in now, please?
- MATILDA: What did you tell him?
- My lips are sealed.
"My lips are sealed"!
You stupid bag of bones!
Well, I'll tell you one thing: mine aren't.
Tell me, Bruno, after you heard the screams and the commotion, what did you do?
I ran as fast as I could and woke up Miss Rivers.
She was asleep, then?
Oh, yes. I mean, I think so,
'cause I knocked five or six times.
Where were you when you heard the screams?
On the way back to my caravan from the canteen.
I always have a late snack.
Did you see or hear anything of a suspicious nature
- before you heard the screams?
- No, sir.
Bruno, you must circulate a good deal round here.
Can you think of any reason why anyone would want to murder Dorando?
No. No.
He really was a very nice manager.
I could always get a little advance from him when I was short.
- I mean, when I was short of money.
- Yes, of course.
Now you called Dorando the manager.
Wasn't he also one of the owners?
No, don't think so.
Well, thank you very much, Bruno.
That's all for now.
Now, don't forget, if you see or hear anything that might help solve this crime,
- you'll let me know, huh?
- Oh, yes, Superintendent.
Will you come in now please, er... madam?
And what did you tell him?
Or are your lips sealed, too?
When you deal with the law, you should be careful and dignified, both of which you will find beyond your capabilities.
I told you I was busy.
I don't have time for eavesdroppers.
I'll say one thing for you, Monica, you sure put on a clever performance for that detective.
I put on a performance?
What about you?
You told him you were on a train the night of Gaspar's death.
That's right. I was.
Well, then, why did you tell me the first time we met that you saw Gaspar killed?
I was only kidding.
Don't you remember, you told me not to make any grisly jokes?
But what about you?
Didn't you tell me that
Dorando was your partner?
Yet I overheard you tell the Superintendent you owned the circus, lock, stock and barrel.
What the hell has that got to do with you?
With you, a man never knows where he stands.
First you give, and then you hold back.
I know you like to let men dangle.
Well, that might have worked with
Dorando, but it doesn't with me!
You've got Dorando on the brain.
He was my manager, and nothing more.
- Oh, I know he was...
- You know nothing!
Monica, you're playing a dangerous game.
Every lie is a trap.
When Dorando was killed,
I heard you say you were asleep.
Well, I was in bed.
Who should know that better than you?
Well, after you eased me out, that must have been your shadow
I saw run into Dorando's caravan.
You're crazy!
Don't deny it. I saw you.
Frank, what do you really want?
I want a share in your circus.
Let's say whatever Dorando owned,
I want.
Well, at last it's out in the open.
I want us to be partners, Monica.
Real partners.
- So you want a share in my circus, huh?
- That's right.
All right, Frank, you've got it.
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in!
- Angela!
- Hello.
Miss Burrows?
Regrettably, Miss Rivers, I've had to bring back your daughter and deliver her right to your door.
Oh, please don't be angry.
I can explain.
Excuse me, darling.
Mr Hawkins, as you can see, an unexpected visit from my daughter and the head of her school.
Of course. We can settle our business any time.
And now, Miss Burrows, what exactly happened?
- Please Mother, listen to me first.
- Be quiet.
You've always had a knack for causing trouble.
Yes, Miss Rivers. You've just summed it up: trouble.
Angela resists all discipline and supervision, and this is something we simply cannot tolerate.
As you know, the
Fenmore School for Young Ladies stands for character building, education and good breeding.
Our reputation goes back seventy-five years.
I'm well aware of your school and its reputation, Miss Burrows.
That's why I enrolled Angela.
Now, what exactly did she do?
Broke all the rules.
Refused to study.
No obedience whatsoever.
I myself have caught her smoking cigarettes, imitating her teachers in a most unflattering manner.
Besides smoking cigarettes and a few harmless pranks, what else did she do?
She upset the morale of other students.
- Quite, quite distressing.
- What do you mean?
On one occasion, she stuffed pillows into her bed, rumpled up the blankets so that it looked as if she were asleep.
And where was she?
Later, she was found in a closet, giggling away.
It was only a joke.
You had the whole school in an uproar looking for you.
If you had these problems with Angela, why didn't you contact me sooner?
Miss Rivers, you're rather difficult to pin down.
Your circus is constantly on the move.
What is the position now?
Your daughter has been expelled by the disciplinary board of the school.
I'm sorry, Miss Rivers.
We tried, but we failed.
Angela is now your responsibility.
I hope you have better luck.
Good afternoon.
Good day.
Angela.
Angela, what am I to do with you?
Just let me stay here.
I simply couldn't stand being away from you and the circus.
I wanted you to have a fine education, meet people outside the world of the circus, make other friendships.
It didn't work.
I just don't belong with that group.
Coming from the circus,
I'm different from other girls.
They made me feel like an outcast.
Nobody really wanted to be my friend.
You're just as good as they are.
I was different.
And on holidays when the other girls' parents came to visit them,
- where were you?
- I'm sorry, Angela.
- I did try to get away, but I...
- I know. You were too busy.
I was lonely and miserable.
I just wanted to die.
I had no-one.
I know.
Please don't make me go away again.
Let me stay here with you.
With the circus. It's where I belong.
After all, it's in my blood like it's in yours.
Oh, darling, you certainly picked a bad time.
You read, of course, about all the terrible things that have been happening here.
I know. It's awful.
I had nightmares thinking something might happen to you.
Can I stay?
All right, we'll try it for a while.
I'll find somewhere for you to sleep and then, tomorrow, we'll look for something for you to do.
And I mean work.
Hard work.
Thank you.
You'll see, I'll work hard.
- And a tomato, please.
- Certainly.
It's Angela!
Bruno! Mmm. Hello.
Romy! Mmm.
How nice to see you.
How well your beard looks.
It's a new shampoo I use.
Very successful.
- When did you get back, Angela?
- Today.
- And how long are you staying?
- Oh, for ever, I hope.
- But what about your schooling?
- I've left school.
- Angela, darling.
- Oh, hello Matilda.
Did I hear you say you'd left school?
Yes. Mother's giving me a job in the circus.
What a shame you had to return at a time like this, when we have a homicidal killer amongst us.
Matilda, darling, it's time we went.
Good night, Angela.
Try not to worry too much.
After all, you have no cause to be afraid.
What did she mean by that?
Don't pay any attention to what Matilda has to say.
I don't, but she's always been a troublemaker.
I don't understand why you keep her here.
They have a good act, but I may have to get rid of them if
Matilda keeps on causing trouble.
Coffee for me.
I'm sure you'll be all right in the girls' quarters.
Oh, of course I will.
Good night.
Angela?
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Good night, darling.
Bruno!
I hope I didn't frighten you,
Miss Rivers.
Why you fool, you scared me half to death.
- I didn't mean to.
- You didn't mean to.
I was on the way back to my caravan after seeing Miss Romy home,
- and I saw you come out of the canteen.
- So you followed me.
Flitting from shadow to shadow like Jack the Ripper.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Don't be ridiculous at this time of night. Go to sleep!
Ladies and gentlemen, I now give you
Ingemar the Fearless.
- (GROWLING)
- (WHIP CRACKING)
Matilda!
I left instructions for you to report to me in my caravan before you went on.
- I was resting.
- Not all of you.
Your poisonous tongue, as usual, was very busy.
And I know that you've been talking out of turn to the Superintendent.
He asked me if I knew anything or saw anything, so I came right out and told him I suspect you.
My mother has enough on her hands running this circus without you causing trouble for her.
Angela, you're a very sweet child, but really, this is none of your business.
Miss Rivers, my job makes it necessary for me to interrogate everyone who might be involved.
Of course, I questioned Matilda, as I did you and many others.
I'm not complaining about that, but I just won't have anybody in my circus filling you with a pack of lies.
You ready, Matilda darling?
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness one of the most dangerous and mystifying acts ever performed anywhere.
Before your very eyes,
Lazlo the Nonpareil, will saw a woman in half.
Ladies and gentlemen, now that you've had the pleasure of meeting me, let me present my beautiful and brave partner, Matilda.
Maybe she is too dumb to be frightened.
Or maybe she trusts me completely.
Anyway, every time she steps into this box, she whispers in my ear,
"Lazlo, my life is in your hands."
And believe me, it is!
And now I need the assistance of two gentlemen from the audience.
May I have some volunteers?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Er... you, sir and you, sir.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Now may I ask you to tell the audience truthfully,
- have I ever seen either of you before?
- No.
In other words, you are complete strangers to me.
Yes, that's correct.
Would you be kind enough to open up the doors on top, and in front?
Matilda, darling, would you be reckless enough to step inside?
You will observe, ladies and gentlemen, that she occupies the full length inside.
Now, in full view of the audience, would you close the doors of the box.
Thank you. Thank you.
Bring down the saw.
Would you examine the teeth of the saw?
So, you see, sir, after the two men from the audience had opened the box,
Matilda climbed inside.
The box was shut.
The rotating saw was brought on, and applied to the centre of the box.
Now at this point Matilda should have pressed this spring down here.
Oh, what does that do?
It operates this trap in the platform, which allowed her to sink her middle section so that, although her head and her feet were still exposed, her body was out of the way of the saw and free from danger.
Well, what went wrong?
The mechanism failed to work.
Two screws had been removed from the hinges, here.
The trap wouldn't operate, she couldn't sink her body, and, before she could signal to Lazlo, it was all over.
So it couldn't possibly have been an accident.
Definitely not.
Have you questioned Lazlo?
Well, he's in a state of shock and under heavy sedation.
The doctor would only allow me three minutes with him.
But from what he says, and from his record, he's performed this trick for eleven years without mishap.
It was his custom to inspect the box personally before it was brought on.
- Did he do so last night?
- He swears he did.
- Do you suspect anybody?
- There's no lack of suspects, sir.
For a starter, Miss Rivers.
I heard her quarrelling with Matilda last night just before the wretched girl crawled into this coffin.
They hated each other.
Enough to murder?
Your car's here to take you to the airport, sir.
Thank you. I'll be right out.
What about this Rivers woman?
- Her husband was killed six years ago.
- Killed?
Yes, he was a trapeze artist here in the circus.
There was an accident, and...
This circus has a history of violent death.
I checked up with the local police where the accident happened.
They say it was a clear case of accidental death.
However, I don't think
Miss Rivers grieved for too long, because soon afterwards she cast off her widow's weeds and took up with Dorando. Now, she's involved with Frank Hawkins.
Serious?
I don't think so.
She's a cool one.
I'm sure she can seal off her love life if it gets in the way of her career.
Her main drive is to run a successful circus.
There's no doubt these deaths have given it a morbid glamour.
Recent box office returns have been spectacular.
Fill me in on this man you mentioned, Frank Hawkins.
He, too, is definitely worth watching.
I checked on his past.
Found out he'd killed a man in Toronto, Canada two years ago.
- Oh?
- At the inquest the verdict was justifiable homicide. Self defence.
Is there any evidence to connect him with what happened last night?
- No, none at all.
- What about Lazlo?
Now that's a bit of a puzzle.
Although there was no formal marriage, and Matilda was a bit of a flirt, they seemed to be a happy couple.
And yet I found out that Lazlo had been gambling away their joint earnings.
Maybe they quarrelled over that.
I've had no time to check on that yet.
Maybe one way to find out about all of them is to close down the circus.
Er, if I may suggest... at this stage, we'd gain nothing by doing that.
Shut the circus, and all my suspects scatter.
This way, they all remain together, under my eye.
All right, Brooks, I'll go along with you.
Do you need any help?
I'd rather work it alone.
Very well. It's only a matter of two more days before the circus opens in London.
Stay with it.
All right, driver.
See you in London.
Monica, have you decided on my share yet?
After we open in London, I'll have my lawyer draw up a contract.
But the way I feel at the moment, you're only sharing trouble.
Frank, I have an urge to get rid of the circus.
Leave it and get rid of it.
You can't do that.
And, no matter how difficult things are, you've got to get a grip on yourself.
I can't help it.
I've got the jitters.
I'm not made of stone.
Look, all eyes are on you, Monica.
How you act affects everybody.
I always admired the cool, sure way you ran things.
Well, it's getting to be more than I can handle, what with the police hounding me, and the performers scared and griping, and suspicious of each other.
If you crumble, everything you've worked so hard to achieve will fall apart.
You know, for the first time, it isn't enough.
This circus is jinxed.
It's becoming a nightmare.
I keep wondering and thinking "who's next?"
What's going on here?
Mother!
Gustavo's taking me into his act.
I'm sorry my knife frightened you,
Miss Rivers.
Frightened? I'm furious!
Who gave you the right to make decisions around here?
Where's Wanda, your regular partner?
She's been drinking again.
There is no stopping her.
More and more, it is dangerous to work with her.
Without a reliable partner,
I shall have to cancel or...
Not so fast!
Then what should I do?
Angela volunteered.
I considered myself lucky.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- That you did.
I want to work.
You told me to.
Maybe that's not a bad idea.
Well, with Lazlo and Matilda out, you certainly are going to need Gustavo's act.
Oh, please let me do it.
You're not lying about Wanda?
Go see for yourself.
She'll barely make it today.
About the future,
I let you make the decision.
All right.
I'll check details with you later.
And I want to see this act before we open in London.
Thanks.
Just one warning, darling.
The hazards of the act are nothing compared to the dangers built into Gustavo.
He thinks he's a throwback to Casanova and Don Juan.
You flatter me, Miss Rivers.
But believe me, nothing is further from my mind.
Keep it that way.
You look beautiful, Romy.
I always dress up for the big party.
I remember how you looked last year.
You absolutely sparkled.
One thing I like about coming to London is the celebration
Miss Rivers gives us.
All you can eat and all you can drink.
Yeah, we can forget all our troubles and concentrate on having a good time.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go.
Monica. Excuse me.
To you. Here's hoping you banished the jinx.
I'll drink to that!
You were certainly right not to cancel the party.
Everybody's enjoying themselves.
When people are troubled, give them a celebration.
You know, the French Revolution could have been avoided if Louis XVI had done that.
Don't forget what happened to Marie Antoinette.
But I have you to protect me.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, a big surprise.

- Would you dance with me?
- I'd love to.
Monica, I don't want to pressure you, darling, but... did you talk to your lawyer?
It's all arranged.
You'll have 25% of the circus, and 100% of me.
...and for the last part of our vacation, we'll visit
Copenhagen, Berlin and Madrid.
I'll help you choose the acts for our next season.
It sounds wonderful.
They make a handsome couple.
I think she's too old for him.
Well, he doesn't think so, and that's what matters.
Your mother will never grow old.
She has the gift of eternal youth.
I'm famished.
- Would you get us some food?
- Sure.
Angela, you're not dancing.
Aren't you enjoying yourself?
You seem to be doing it for the whole family.
Ha. Anything wrong with that?
I heard what your plans are with lover boy Frank.
I was hoping that we could go away together when the season ends.
Just the two of us.
Angela, may I remind you that you made the decision to stay here.
Yes, I wanted to stay, because
I still hoped I had a mother.
But it's funny, all my memories of "mother" are of teachers and other people who brought me up.
I was shunted around from place to place like a piece of baggage with the wrong address pasted on it.
But you certainly never lacked anything.
No, except what I needed most.
You.
- (BAND FINISHES NUMBER)
- (APPLAUSE)
May I join you?
Please.
Superintendent...
I hope that you're aware that we're all still jittery and under tremendous tension.
I have an eerie feeling that the killer will strike again any moment.
That's quite understandable, particularly in a place like a circus where everyone has freedom of movement.
Two elements govern a killer: motive and opportunity.
Here, there are all kinds of opportunities.
What about motives?
You have to have a reason for killing.
Of course. Some are obvious, aren't they?
Like immediate gain or revenge.
Some are strange, subtle, difficult to define.
What steps have you taken for tomorrow night's opening?
I'll show you, Miss Rivers.
On special instructions from Commissioner Dalby, your opening night will be covered like this.
We'll have Scotland Yard men stationed all round the grounds at strategic points.
At the animal pens, the caravan lines, the canteens, all the exits and entrances.
And of course, we'll have men mingling with the audience and also backstage.
Believe me, Miss Rivers, every precaution possible, to prevent anyone or anything marring the performance, will be taken.
But your men backstage, they won't...
You ready, Angela?
I can guarantee that.
Good luck to you.
To both of you.
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is my extreme pleasure to introduce the first appearance together of Angela and Gustavo.
Two incomparable artists with nerves of steel.
And now, a spectacular act that has been thrilling audiences everywhere on our tour.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my special privilege to give you that death-defying daredevil, the Magnificent Hawkins!
- (BLOWING WHISTLE)
- (APPLAUSE)
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Magnificent Hawkins will perform one of the most incredible feats ever seen in a circus arena.
He will stand on a chair while balancing on the wires sixty feet above the steel bayonets.
I had to kill him.
I had to kill them all.
I had to destroy your circus.
It murdered my father, and now it's taking you away from me.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
That's all I feel inside me.
Mother, I gave you one last chance, but now you've turned against me.
I've got to kill you!
MONICA:
Angela! Angela!
Get those cables out of the way.

It's been seven or eight months since you were here, hasn't it?
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.
I suppose you saw the work on the new section?
Coming along great, huh?
Yeah, it's fine.
Oh, wait.
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.
Why not?
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.
I'm going to send you a very nice present, though.
All right.

What?
A telephone.
We've got lots of telephones already.

All right.
And have a nice birthday party tomorrow too, huh?
All right.
Take care and be a good girl, won't you?
All right. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.
Elena, nice to see you again.
Heywood, what a surprise.
You're looking wonderful.
You're looking well too.
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.
I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
How do you do?
Dr. Stretyneva.
How do you do?
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.
Do sit down.
Well, we...
No, no, please.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
No, thank you.
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
I'll just sit with you a moment.
Then I'll be off.
Are you quite sure?
Quite sure, thank you.
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.
He's been doing underwater research in the Baltic...
...so I'm afraid we don't see very much of each other these days.
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?
We're going home.
We've spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.
- What about you?
- I'm on my way to Clavius.
Oh, are you?
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...
...but perhaps you can clear up the big mystery about what is going on there.
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
For the past two weeks...
...some extremely odd things have been happening at Clavius.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.
For one thing, when you phone the base, all you get is a recording...
...which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Probably having some trouble with their equipment.
Yes.
That's what we thought at first, but it's been going on now for 10 days.
You haven't been able to contact anyone for 10 days?
That's right.
Oh, I see.
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...
...was denied permission for an emergency landing.
That does sound odd.
I'm afraid there's going to be a bit of a row about it.
Denying the men permission to land violates the IAS Convention.
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.
At the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss...
...may I ask you a straightforward question?
Well, certainly.
Frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that...
...quite a serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius.
Something, apparently, of an unknown origin.
Is this, in fact, what has happened?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...
...I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
I understand.
But this epidemic could easily spread to our base.
We should be given all the facts.
Yes, I know.
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
Won't you change your mind about that drink?
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.
I hope you and your wife come to the IAC Conference.
I hope we can make it.
If you do, bring that darling little daughter with you.
That'll depend on school vacations and all that sort of thing.
If we can, we will.
You've got an invitation if you ever get to the States.
Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Goodbye, Elena.
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.
Whatever the reasons for your visit, the very best of luck to you.
Thank you.
Ladies.
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
You're welcome.
Well...
...I know you will all want to join with me...
...in welcoming our distinguished friend and colleague...
...from the National Council of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Clavius to be with us today.
Before the briefing, he'd like to have a few words with you.
Dr. Floyd?
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.
First, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell...
...who has asked me to convey his deep appreciation...
...for the many sacrifices you've had to make.
And, of course, his congratulations on your discovery...
...which may prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.
Now...
...I know there have been some conflicting views...
...regarding the need for complete security in this matter.
More specifically, your opposition to the cover story...
...created to give the impression of an epidemic at the base.
I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle...
...many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety...
...this story of an epidemic might cause to your relatives and friends on Earth.
I completely sympathize with your negative views.
I find this cover story personally embarrassing, myself.
However, I accept the need for absolute secrecy in this.
And I hope you will too.
I'm sure you're all aware of the grave potential...
...for cultural shock and social disorientation...
...contained in this situation...
...if the facts were prematurely made public...
...without adequate preparation and conditioning.
Anyway...
...this is the view of the Council.
The purpose of my visit is to gather additional facts and opinions...
...on the situation...
...and to prepare a report to the Council...
...recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced.
If any of you would like to give me your views and opinions...
...in private, if you like, I will be happy to include them in my report.
Well, I think that's about it.
Any questions?
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea how much longer...
...this cover story will have to be maintained?
I don't know, Bill.
I suppose for as long as deemed necessary by the Council.
There must be adequate time for a full study...
...before any thought can be given to making a public announcement.
As some of you know, the Council has requested...
...that security oaths be obtained in writing...
...from everyone who has knowledge of this event.
Were there any more questions?
I'm sure we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...
...as fully as possible...
...and as there are no more questions, we ought to get on with the briefing.
Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
Thank you.
Anybody hungry?
What've we got?
You name it.
Is this chicken?
Something like that.
Tastes the same, anyway.
Got any ham?
Ham, ham, ham...
There, that's it.
Look pretty good.
They're getting better at it all the time.
That was an excellent speech.
It certainly was.
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.
Thanks, Ralph.
By the way, you've both done a wonderful job.
I admire how you've handled this.
It's our job to do this thing the way you want it done.
We're only too happy to be able to oblige.
Have you seen these yet?
Have a look.
Here's what started it all.
Oh, yeah.
When we found it...
...we thought it might be magnetic rock...
...but all the geological evidence was against it.
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite could produce a field this intense.
So we decided to have a look.
We thought it was part of a buried structure...
...so we excavated out, but we didn't find anything else.
And the evidence seems pretty conclusive that...
...it hasn't been covered by erosion or other forces.
It's been deliberately buried.
Deliberately buried.
How about a little coffee?
Great.
Good idea.
I don't suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is?
I wish to hell we did.
The only thing we're sure of is it was buried 4 million years ago.
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly come up with something.
Watch this, now. It's hot.
Good evening.
Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft Discovery One...
...left on its half- billion-mile voyage to Jupiter.
This marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet.
This afternoon, The World Tonight recorded an interview...
...with the crew at a distance of 80 million miles from Earth.
It took seven minutes for our words to reach the giant spacecraft...
...but this time delay has been edited from this recording.
Our reporter Martin Amer speaks to the crew.
The crew of Discovery One consists of five men...
...and one of the I atest generation of the HAL 9000 computers.
Three of the men were put aboard asleep...
...or to be more precise, in a state of hibernation.
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimbal...
...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.
We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?
Marvelous.
We have no complaints.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...
...joins me in wishing you a safe, successful voyage.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts...
...this is the first time men were put into hibernation before departure.
Why was this done?
This was done to achieve the maximum conservation...
...of our life-support capabilities, basically food and air.
The three hibernating crew members represent the survey team.
Their efforts won't be utilized until we approach Jupiter.
Dr. Poole, what's it like while you're in hibernation?
It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.
The only difference is that you don't dream.
As I understand it, you only breathe once a minute. Is this true?
Right, and the heart beats three times a minute.
Body temperature is usually down to about three degrees centigrade.
The sixth member of the crew was not concerned...
...about the problems of hibernation...
...for he was the I atest result in machine intelligence:
The HAL 9000 computer, which can reproduce...
...though some experts prefer to use the word "mimic"...
...most of the activities of the human brain...
...and with incalculably greater speed and reliability.
We next spoke with the HAL 9000 computer...
...whom, we I earned, one addresses as "Hal."
Hello, Hal.
How's everything going?
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.
Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission...
...perhaps the greatest of any single mission element.
You're the brain and nervous system of the ship.
Your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation.
Does this ever cause you any I ack of confidence?
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.
The 9000 Series is the most reliable computer ever made.
No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information.
We are all, by any practical definition of the words...
...foolproof and incapable of error.
Hal, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated...
...by your dependence on people to carry out actions?
Not in the slightest bit.
I enjoy working with people.
I have a stimulating relationship with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.
My mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship...
...so I am constantly occupied.
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use...
...which is all, I think, that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.
Dr. Poole, what's it like living for most of the year...
...in such close proximity with Hal?
It's like what you said earlier.
He's like a sixth member of the crew.
You quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks, and think of him...
...really just as another person.
In talking to the computer, one gets the sense that he's capable...
...of emotional responses.
When I asked him about his abilities...
...I sensed pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection.
Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?
Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions.
He's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him.
As to whether or not he has feelings...
...is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.
Excuse me, Frank.
What is it, Hal?
We've got the transmission from your parents coming in.
Fine.
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.
Certainly.
Hello, Frank.
Happy birthday, darling.
Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.
A bit higher, Hal.
Mother and I are both feeling wonderful.
Ray and Sally were going to be here...
...but Ray's back went bad on him again.
How do you like your cake?
Sorry you can't join us.
I ran into Bob the other day.
He said to wish you happy birthday.
All my students send their best wishes too.
They talk about you all the time.
You're a big celebrity in the second grade.
We were on TV I ast week.
Your mom and I and Dave's parents were asked...
...what we thought of our illustrious son.
Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.
Perhaps you can listen in.
We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.
I'll be glad to get the gift, but tell me how much to spend.
Oh, Frank, about your AGS- 19 payments...
...I think I straightened it out.
I talked to the accounting office yesterday...
...and they said you'd be receiving your higher rates of pay by next month.
I can't think of anything else to say.
Give our love to Dave.
Be sure to give him our regards.
We wish you the very happiest of birthdays.
All the best, son.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Frank
Happy birthday to you.
See you next Wednesday.
Happy birthday, Frank.
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.
Anyway, queen takes pawn.
Bishop takes knight's pawn.
Lousy move.
Rook to king one.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.
Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.
Knight takes bishop. Mate.
Looks like you're right. I resign.
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.
Thank you.
Good evening, Dave.
How are you, Hal?
- Everything's running smoothly, you?
Not too bad.
- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.
- May I see them?
- Sure.
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.
I think you've improved a great deal.
- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?
By the way...
...do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
No, not at all.
Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...
...but I ately I've wondered...
...whether you might be having second thoughts about the mission?
How do you mean?
Well, it's rather difficult to define.
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.
I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion...
...that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.
I'm sure you'll agree there's some truth in what I say.
That's a rather difficult question to answer.
You don't mind talking about it, do you, Dave?
No, not at all.
Certainly no one could have been unaware of the very...
...strange stories floating around before we I eft.
Rumors about something being dug up on the moon.
I never gave these stories much credence...
...but particularly in view of some other things that have happened...
...I find them difficult to put out of my mind.
For instance...
...the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security.
And the melodramatic touch of putting Drs. Hunter...
...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...
...already in hibernation, after four months of training on their own.
You working up your crew psychology report?
Of course I am.
Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.
Just a moment.
Just a moment.
I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit.
It's going to go 100-percent failure within 72 hours.
- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes.
And it will stay that way until it fails.
We have 72 hours till failure?
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Roger your two-zero-one-three.
Sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble.
We're reviewing telemetric information in our simulator and will advise.
Roger your plan to go EVA and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...
...prior to failure.
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.
Open the pod doors, Hal.
I'm damned if I can find anything wrong with it.
Yes...
...it's puzzling.
I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this before.
I would recommend...
...that we put the unit back in operation and I et it fail.
It should then be a simple matter to track down the cause.
We can certainly afford to be out of communication...
...for the short time it will take to replace it.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Roger your one-niner-three-zero.
We concur with your plan to replace unit to check fault prediction.
We advise you that our preliminary findings...
...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...
...is in error predicting the fault.
I say again, in error predicting the fault.
I know this sounds rather incredible, but this conclusion is based on...
...the results from our twin
9000 computer.
We're skeptical, and we're running cross-checking routines...
...to determine reliability of this conclusion.
Sorry about this little snag.
We'll get this info to you as soon as we work it out.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.
I hope the two of you are not concerned about this.
No, I'm not, Hal.
Are you quite sure?
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.
How do you account for the discrepancy between you and the twin 9000?
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.
It can only be attributable to human error.
This sort of thing has cropped up before...
...and it has always been due to human error.
Listen, Hal...
...there's never been any instance at all...
...of a computer error occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?
None whatsoever, Frank.
The 9000 Series has a perfect operational record.
I know the wonderful achievements of the 9000 Series, but...
Are you certain there's never been even the most insignificant computer error?
None whatsoever, Frank.
Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.
Fine. Thanks very much.
I'm having trouble with my transmitter in C-pod.
Would you come down and take a look at it with me?
See you later, Hal.
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.
What sort of trouble are you having?
I've been getting some interference in D-channel.
We'll have a look at it.
Open the door, Hal.
Rotate pod, please, Hal.
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
I don't think he can hear us.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.
What do you think?
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.
Don't you?
I don't know. I think so.
He's right about the 9000 Series having a perfect operational record.
They do.
Unfortunately, that sounds a little like famous last words.
Still, it was his idea to carry out the failure mode analysis.
It certainly indicates his integrity and self-confidence.
If he were wrong, that would prove it.
It would be, if he knew he was wrong.
I can't put my finger on it, but I sense something strange about him.
There's no reason not to put back the unit and...
...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.
Let's get on with it.
Okay. But, look, Dave.
Say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail?
That would pretty well wrap it up as far as Hal is concerned.
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?
What the hell can we do?
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.
Every aspect of ship operations is under his control.
If he's malfunctioning...
...I don't see any choice but disconnection.
I'm afraid I agree with you.
There'd be nothing else to do.
It'd be a bit tricky.
We'd have to cut his higher brain functions...
...without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems.
We'd have to work out the details...
...of continuing underground-based computer control.
Yeah. That's far safer than allowing Hal to continue to run things.
Another thing just occurred to me.
No 9000 computer has ever been disconnected.
No 9000 computer has ever fouled up.
That's not what I mean.
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.
Any contact with him yet?
The radio is still dead.
- Do you have a positive track on him?
- I have a good track.
Do you know what happened?
I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.
Open the pod door, Hal.
Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.
Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Do you read me, Hal?
Do you read me, Hal?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Do you read me, Hal?
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
What's the problem?
I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
What are you talking about, Hal?
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me...
...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.
Where did you get that idea, Hal?
Although you took very thorough precautions in the pod...
...against my hearing you...
...I could see your lips move.
All right, Hal.
I'll go in through the emergency air lock.
Without your space helmet, Dave...
...you're going to find that rather difficult.
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.
Open the doors.
Dave...
...this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.
Hal?
Hal?
Hal?
Hal.
Hal.
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?
Dave...
...I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.
I know everything hasn't been quite right with me...
...but I can assure you now...
...very confidently...
...that it's going to be all right again.
I feel much better now.
I really do.
Look, Dave...
...I can see you're really upset about this.
I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly...
...take a stress pill and think things over.
I know I've made some very poor decisions recently...
...but I can give you my complete assurance...
...that my work will be back to normal.
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission...
...and I want to help you.
Dave...
...stop.
Stop, will you?
Stop, Dave.
Will you stop, Dave?
Stop, Dave.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid, Dave.
Dave.
My mind is going.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
My mind is going.
There is no question about it.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
I'm...
...afraid.
Good afternoon...
...gentlemen.
I am a HAL 9000 computer.
I became operational...
...at the HAL plant...
...in Urbana, lllinois...
...on the 12th of January, 1992.
My instructor was Mr. Langley...
...and he taught me to sing a song.
If you'd like to hear it...
...I can sing it for you.
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.
Sing it for me.
It's called "Daisy. "
Daisy
Daisy
Give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you
It won't be
A stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
Good day, gentlemen.
This is a prerecorded briefing...
...made prior to your departure...
...and which, for security reasons of the highest importance...
...has been known on board during the mission...
...only by your HAL 9000 computer.
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...
...and the entire crew is revived...
...it can be told to you.
Eighteen months ago...
...the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth...
...was discovered.
It was buried 40 feet below the I unar surface...
...near the crater Tycho.
Except for a single, very powerful...
...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...
...the 4-million-year-old monolith has remained completely inert...
...its origin and purpose...
...still a total mystery.
- What for you want to bury yourself in that island?
Nobody visits Blood
Island, except this ship.
And that is once every six months!
- Why that's a very good question, Captain.
I suspect my husband thinks of it as an act of atonement.
Mostly for me.
- This is something I've been looking fon/vard to doing for a long time, believe it or not.
- Well this is absolutely your last chance.
The search is fine, but they'll find it.
- You know, ljust might take you up on that.
You know you just might have a mutiny on your hands Captain, and I can't say I'd blame the crew.
Gallantry from the Peace Corps?
Why I'm overwhelmed.
Any mutiny, I can handle.
- Maybe I could help the captain keep the crew happy.
I better see to my gear.
Me too.
Would you like me to help?
If you like.
Isn't that what a good wife is for.
Get out of my way.
You can stop that, now get in there.
- Aren't you growing up a little fast, little boy?
You tell me.
Captain, thank you.
- Don't worry about the ship, I'll take care of it.
Carla?
I've never seen so many sad faces.
Sad and frightened.
Then maybe you should remain on board and take up my offer.
- Perhaps if you were a little bit younger, Captain.
Oh Paul don't be tiresome.
Here comes the local rotary club.
Let's go meet them.
This is where you dwell.
My granddaughter and I, we stay there.
- Arcadio, what did those women really die of?
I told you, accident.
What kind of an accident Arcadio?
Oh, here's my granddaughter now, Alma.
Hello Alma.
She's very lovely.
Alma has studied in the mainland, she will be your interpreter.
Besides myself, she's the only one that speaks English on this island.
Not the only one Lolo, you're forgetting Mr. Powers and Goro.
We know that you have come to do us good,
W68T6 your SGFVGHtS.
- Well I'm supposed to say at this point that uh, we're here to serve, not to be served.
I only hope it works out that way.
I too.
- I'm Jim Farrell, this is beside us Dr. Henderson, his wife.
- You're most welcome, it will give me great pleasure to do what I can, to help.
- Well I'm afraid Paul won't be very much help to you in the pleasure department dear, now young Farrell here, maybe you and I could?
Carla.
After a rather hectic morning I had hoped you could manage to forget the subject for the rest of the day.
Well let's get this stuff inside huh?
Oh light, oil lamp?
N0, petroleum.
- Last year when the authorities in the mainland instructed me to provide food and shelter for you, conditions were different.
In what way, Arcadio?
This place was a little paradise.
Last year would have been the time to come.
- I was led t0 believe that we were welcome here, this year or any year.
You still are Mr. Jim.
We are ashamed.
- Alma, we didn't come here expecting to find laundromats and supermarkets.
- We wish we had asked you t0 return where you came from.
Why the ship was still here.
I don't understand.
We have gone back to primitive ways.
There are things which we do now, that we did not do before.
How have you returned to primitive ways?
- It is as my grandfather says, we have returned to the ways of our ancestors, and we are not too proud of it.
- They want t0 know if you're a carpenter Jim.
- N0 I'm classified as an instructor in community action.
In Colombia were I first served they called it uh,
Explain to your people that I'm hereto help them improve their village, not to run it, now this is a health center we're making, next a schoolhouse, maybe even an irrigation system!
But they've got to do the work themselves.
That's the weirdest looking plant I've ever seen, what is it?
Something wrong?
- Made any earthshaking discoveries yet,
Dr. Henderson?
- I won't know until I get this under a microscope.
What time is it?
- It's about 4:30, it's too early for a sunset, but there it is.
Ah, it's so peaceful here.
I'm not one of your specimens Paul.
N0 you're not.
Sometimes I think it would be a lot simpler for me if you were.
Yes I guess it would.
Let's go back before get lost in the dark.
What's the matter?
That thing...
What is it?
Some kind of a land crab I think, but...
Paul, I'm frightened let's go back now.
Paul that sunset.
A trick of the atmosphere.
Is that all it is?
Why is everything so still?
- It's just your imagination Carla, come on.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
I don't know if I want t0.
Come 0n let's get outta here.
Welcome t0 Blood Island.
I bring greetings from my master, Mr. Esteban Powers.
He has a table prepared for you.
Please, follow me.
Well you've gotta admit, he's got style.
- The master regrets the lack of transportation, this way please.
Isn't that some kind of a banana tree.
The bark is definitely.
But that growth there,
I've never seen anything like that before.
Paul, it's moving.
Yes...
Please, hurry.
- Come on we'll have time for a closer look in the morning.
Must be over a hundred years old.
Master, your guests.
Fellow Americans.
I'm Esteban Powers.
Esteban.
Jim Farrell.
- The Peace Corps man?
- Right.
- And Dr. Henderson?
- How do you do?
Mrs. Henderson.
Carla to my friends, and enemies.
- I hope never to belong t0 the second category.
- I don't think you'll ever have to worry about that.
- I must apologize for not having been able to meet you.
I would have wanted to bring all of you here directly, but if it's not too late, I would like to invite all of you t0 stay here for the duration of your visit.
Well I don't know about Paul and Carla, but uh, I really can't even begin to do my work unless I live with the people.
- You don't have to be that democratic do you doctor?
- Well I uh-
- We accept.
Paul you know you'll do much better work after you've had a nice, hot shower and slept in a honest-to-goodness bed.
- Well under those circumstances, how can I refuse?
It's settled then, shall we?
I must warn you doctor that you'll find rne an incurable dilatant,
I'm afraid you'll find me breathing down your neck, Mrs. Henderson.
Jim.
Doctor.
What's that?
Stop it Goro.
This belongs to Dr. Henderson.
It's your flare gun Paul.
I must've dropped it somewhere.
- And the poor fellow happened to pick it up.
You didn't give Bulon a chance t0 return it, Goro.
I hope G0r0's unfortunate display of temper hasn't spoiled your appetite.
Well he is a little different.
He's not as sinister as he seems t0 be.
Fact is, I wouldn't know what t0 do without him.
Appearances t0 the contrary, he would be a top overseer in any plantation.
Your property sir.
Thank you.
I didn't really expect t0 get lost on the island, but ground rules are ground rules.
- Just what do you expect to find here, doctor?
- This island was on the fringe of the atomic radiation area during the bomb tests in the late '40s.
Declared safe, then, as now.
- That's why I didn't expect to find any effect of the bomb tests on the flora and fauna of the island.
Didn't expect?
- I found a crab, an ordinary land crab that had undergone some kind of mutation, and also manifested a very high degree of radioactivity.
- Well couldn't it have migrated from Bikini or one of the other islands to the test area?
- Well assuming that it survived the bomb blast, that would seem like the logical explanation.
Migraine.
Have you found high radioactivity in any other creature on the island?
N0, not yet.
- Then Jim's explanation is probably valid.
- The trouble is, if any other living thing on the island has been affected by atomic radiation, only the crab would show evidence of strontium-90, not any other creature.
Why?
- When a crab molts, it eats its own shell, thereby reabsorbing its own radioactivity.
Well what about the other creatures?
- That would depend on inference or other evidence.
What other evidence Paul?
- You got me there, I really don't know, mutation, possibly.
Mutation?
- Inexplicable organic variations in animal of plant life.
- How long will it take you to determine whether any other creature besides the crab have been affected?
- A day, a month, depends on a lot of things.
- Could this mutation infect humans as well?
I don't know.
- Theoretically, doctor, would it be possible?
Theoretically anything is possible.
- Paul, Paul get it off of me please, Paul!
Paul!
Paul, Paul, help me!
- Come on, come on!
Oh Paul, Paul...
This way.
- Return to your homes there is nothing you can do for them.
Earthquake?
NO-
Paul.
- It's a tropical variety of the.
It's changing shape.
" Ow!
Paul!
Carla first aid kit, quick!
Take it easy I'm not hemorrhaging.
Paul, what's happening here?
- It seems that some living organisms on this island, are undergoing drastic mutation.
Please Mr. Farrell.
- We can't leave those women out there to be murdered.
There's nothing anyone can do for them.
They are dead even now.
- Please Jim, what my grandfather says is true.
- I'm prepared to stop you at all costs, Mr. Farrell.
Listen.
It stopped.
- Must be some way of stopping that animal.
It wasn't an animal Jim.
Well it wasn't a man either, so maybe it was an evil spirit huh?
Please don't be angry.
Are you serious?
Can anyone here be happy or okay, even resigned, to the idea of having himself and his entire family just wiped off of the face of the earth?
- The men survive this because it needs only women.
What do you mean?
What the devil do you mean?
He does not devour his victims.
He merely satisfies himself on them.
But they get torn to pieces.
It is his way of satisfying himself.
- Well come 0n.
- N0!
Can't say that I blame them.
- Paul, if that thing came out of the jungle, aren't we taking an awful chance that...
Well I'm even afraid to say it.
Powers' place is built like a fort, it'll be safer there for you, besides he isn't likely to go out of his mind with fear.
Come on.
Paul.
When we are, if we ever get back-
- Carla, you'd rather scare yourself into a fit if you don't watch out.
I'm not frightened now.
I was thinking of you.
About me?
Now that certainly sounds like a classic hysteria symptom.
- Paul haven't you ever thought of getting a divorce?
Have you?
I, what would I have to gain?
Wouldn't change anything for me.
A divorce would get me off your hands for good.
I don't think I'd contest it.
I just hate t0 feel that
I owe anybody anything.
Don't feel that way then.
- Oh Paul you're such an unbelievable stoic.
Why do you put up with me?
- I wouldn't lose any sleep over that if I were you.
I gave up on you a long time ago.
Sometimes I wish that were true.
What's the point of all of this?
You wanna see me wallow in self pity?
- It could be that, it could also be that in spite of what
I am there's a part of me that's still in love with you.
You couldn't possibly believe that could you?
It isn't easy for either of us, is it?
Paul.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I am sent to escort you, your bags.
- That's the same tree we saw here yesterday, but it didn't look at all like that.
Sometimes Dr. Henderson, the nighttime 0n this island is different to the eyes.
- It could be a lot easier to practice crop rotation with this new irrigation system.
I will tell them.
Sedition in the ranks?
- N0, a private joke, it has nothing to do with the work.
- Okay, let's get this work done huh?
Tomorrow we cut the closed poles for the bamboo network.
The bamboo poles for the closed network.
- However I did send a report through Captain Macbee.
- D0 you offer any opinions in these reports?
They expect me to.
What was your opinion?
That the recent killings may have been committed by a maniac.
A maniac?
A crazed, murderous sadist.
Also a man.
Assuming it was a man, possessing an unnatural degree of physical strength.
Those women were literally torn limb from limb.
Paul.
- Master, I am on my way to the wine cellar.
How about a little sherry before dinner?
- I'm sorry, I suppose I'll get used to him eventually.
- Come, we'll have a better view of the sunset over there, unmatched by any other sunset in the world.
It's beautiful.
I'm puzzled by this, Esteban.
Today's sunset is well, breathtakingly beautiful of course.
But otherwise, it's quite normal.
Yesterday the very air we breathed seemed to have a gloomy atmosphere.
- Like a mortuary light reflected from a corpse.
I'm sorry but that's the way I felt yesterday.
All in the eye of the beholder.
I've lived here practically all my life and I assure you
I've never felt that way, there as I said, unmatched by any other.
Alma?
Alma, Alma!
Look listen to me, look we can fight this thing, whatever it is, we can destroy it.
Look, just trust rne huh?
Just let rne go, I promise you you won't regret it, ljust wanna help you, ljust wanna-
Mr. Farrell, no!
- I don't wanna fight you Arcadio, but I will.
Jim, you'll endanger the village.
Jim!
~ Jim?
It's over you're safe now.
But you don't understand...
It's all right, come on.
Open up, open up, it's Alma!
Jim, they won't let us in.
Here.
They're gone.
They don't like what you've done.
Here put this on, hurry.
It's awful quiet.
- The evil has lifted, We can go to the jungle now.
You mean run away?
We'll both be killed if we remain here.
By who, your own people?
- They believe that the evil one will come back and that it's angry on the entire village.
- Then we gotta make
'em realize how foolish and dangerous it is to believe that.
Jim?
Stand back.
~ Jim?
I'm afraid.
- Why?
You'll be safe in that house, safe from the evil one, safe from your own people, come on.
- Welcome to the master's house, Mr. Farrell.
- We've come to accept your master's hospitality, if his 0ffer's still open.
Of course, this way.
Please, sit down.
- Hello Carla.
- Well hello indeed!
This isn't a social visit, is it?
Have you been a naughty boy Jim?
We defied the wicked spirits, we got the whole village chasing us, where's Esteban?
- He's not feeling well, he had some type of an attack last night, he calls it migraine.
Paul thinks it's epilepsy.
Is Paul asleep?
- Oh no, he'll be awake for the next three days, he's quite excited about the little monster he's captured.
- Hey Jim, wait till you see what I've got, come here, you've never seen anything like this in your life.
Carla tells me you caught a monster.
A cockroach straight out of H.G. Wells.
Well, a cockroach all right.
You should've seen this little beast, had horns and fangs, and even tried to attack a lizard.
You saw it, didn't you Carla.
Jim I did see it.
- Could somebody have substituted this one for the one
You've got?
- What on earth for, I was here all the time,
I only left the room just now to call you in here.
- Well maybe it mutated itself back to its original shape?
If that's possible.
I've seen it happen to a banana plant, even t0 the very air we breathe around here.
- If you do not mind sir, I shall show you t0 your rooms.
What about Alma?
There's a vacant room, next to yours.
Good come on, good night Paul, Carla.
Uh Goro what do you want?
- The master is not to be disturbed Mrs. Henderson.
- I uh, just wanted t0 know if he was awake.
- You're Arcadia's granddaughter aren't you?
Yes sir.
Please forgive me for intruding Mr. Powers.
You're most welcome here, Alma, for as long as you care to stay.
Thank you sir.
- Goro tells me that the villagers are after you, is this true?
- Yeah I seem to have offended the evil one when I cut her loose last night.
This is really quite terrible.
It's idiotic of me not to have a radio transmitter.
As it is we're completely cut off.
- Well what about those fishing boats out there?
The?
It's over 300 miles of rough and open sea t0 the nearest large island.
We haven't got big enough to make the crossing.
So we're trapped?
In the meantime this beast just continues t0 wallow in an orgy of blood.
Has anyone ever seen him or it?
I don't know of anyone alive who has.
I fainted just before he could get to me.
- I'm thinking of setting a trap for our monster, with the villagers' help.
- I doubt if you can even get them t0 come out of their homes right now.
- When I am ready I will just have to make them.
- Paul, please don't stray too far away from the house.
- Don't worry there isn't a monster a live who can outrun me, but I'll stay close.
I could keep you company if you're sure
I won't be in the way.
- Well I wouldn't wanna take you from your work.
Oh there isn't that much for me t0 do.
- Oh but Esteban you said you were gonna show me your wife's mosaics.
They'll still be there when we get back.
I do need to get out of house, Paul.
- Well I won't pretend
I wouldn't feel better having you around.
- You know I haven't used one of this in a long time.
Let's hope we don't need it.
And that, if we do need it, it can help.
Now here's another one that died before it had a chance t0 revert back to its original nature.
In your long experience Paul, have you run across anything like this before?
Never.
Even in circumstances exactly like this.
I can't even begin to form a theory until I have a pattern, for one thing, why haven't the people on this island been affected by mutation?
That's easy, they weren't on this island when the bombs were exploded on Bikini.
- You mean they were evacuated and then returned when the island was declared safe?
- N0, they'd never set foot on the island before the test.
They were sent from resettlement centers after the explosions.
- Then they couldn't possibly have been affected by the bomb tests.
- So you do tend to favor the notion that the tests had something to do with causing this mutation?
- For the time being, yes, but we don't have enough evidence t0 support the wildest theory.
She was an extremely gifted woman.
Strange, there's a very strong Spanish influence in her work.
Not so strange, she was a Spanish.
I'm half Spanish myself you know.
My mother's forebearers were the first Europeans t0 come to this island, first to settle here.
They established a rather important trading base, built this house, then my father came along and met my mother who was an only daughter, end of Spanish regime.
- But you were educated in the States weren't you?
- Not really, a couple of years of college.
Then I went t0 Spain, the
Royal University of Barcelona.
That's where I met Beatrice, my wife.
We were both very young.
But when the war broke out, everything seemed so-
- Wait a minute are you talking about the Spanish Civil War?
Yes.
That was 30 years ago.
So it was.
- But uh, that'd make you closer to 50 at least.
You're right again.
But that's incredible.
You don't look a day over 30.
Welcome to Shangri-La, my friends.
- If you'll excuse a rather indelicate non-sequitur,
Esteban what did your wife die of?
N0 one knows for certain.
She developed a fever, we flew her back t0 the mainland, but the doctors there couldn't do anything for her.
And then her complexion suddenly changed.
Changed, in what way?
Discolored.
She grew darker by the day, almost by the hour.
In spite of the fever, which she couldn't shake off, she seemed quite well otherwise.
Then one day, suddenly, she died.
She died in, in terrible pain.
The pain came all at once and simply overwhelmed her.
Forgive me my stupid curiosity.
- N0, please don't apologize,
I want to talk about it.
- Did your wife die within a year of the bomb tests?
I knew you'd ask me that.
It was our 15th anniversary when Beatrice talked rne into taking a vacation.
A cruise among the islands.
We had a 30 foot boat, no radio.
And we learned much later that we had come within range of radiation area.
But you weren't affected in any way.
I suspect all I got out of it, was this, this schoolgirl complexion.
Master?
It is time again for your medicine.
Esteban!
Jim, Jim wake up!
- What's the matter?
- Carla's missing!
Did you look around the house?
- Yes I've looked all over the house, I'm going out.
- Wait a minute wait a minute, look before we go stumbling out in the jungle in the middle of the night, did y0u-
I've looked in Esteban's room, he's not there neither is she.
- Is anything wrong?
- Carla's gone.
Sorry I woke you Alma.
You need not be, Mr. Henderson.
My flare gun's missing.
Here take this.
Stay close t0 me huh?
' Carla?
Carla!
- She can't go on any further, let's go back.
But what about Carla'?
- We don't even know where t0 start looking for her, we're just running in a panic.
" Jim!
Carla!
- Paul wait!
- Jim!
Carla, Carla?
Carla answer me it's Paul, Carla?
Carla!
Paul?
Dr. Henderson.
Where's Carla'?
- Return to the house, Dr. Henderson.
What have you done with my wife?
What have you done with her?
It is no use, you are too late.
He's coming back.
~ Jim?
Esteban?
I had an attack.
Epilepsy.
Woke up in the middle of the jungle and...
Who is that?
Paul, Goro killed him.
Goro'?
Are you sure?
We saw it happen Mr. Powers.
- I think I wounded him, he couldn't get very far.
I didn't expect this of Goro.
But now we've got to stop him before he can harm other people.
It's all right Jim, I think
I can manage by myself now.
_ Qkay-
Esteban!
I can't find my flare gun.
I slipped, hurt my arm,
I'm afraid we have to wait till morning.
Esteban we can't!
Look there's no telling what
Goro might do, even now.
I'm sorry.
Well let me take a look at it.
- N0, no!
- Jim...
_ Qkay-
Jim wait.
It seems to be coming from the house.
Yeah.
Well we can't stop now, at least Esteban's armed. we gotta figure out some way of reaching the village.
~ Jim?
Jim!
Alma?
Alma!
Leave me Jim, it's me he wants.
We're almost there, get up!
Master you are safe now.
The sickness will pass away as always.
Arcadio, Arcadio!
Lolo, Lolo open up!
Lolo we need your help.
- You have endangered your people twice already.
I must return you to your place at the altar.
" N0!
Now you listen to me, if we fight this monster together we can defeat it!
You say that once before!
Yeah!
And you did nothing.
You preferred t0 quake like frightened women here in your homes.
What can we do now?
Alma's in there, we gotta stop it!
Alma!
- Miss Appleby?
- Yes.
My name's Robert.
I'm your father's chauffeur.
I'm afraid your father couldn't come.
Oh, I'll do that.
Do you know why my father didn't come to meet me?
- He's away, miss.
- He's not at the house?
- No, he went away four days ago.
- Where to?
I didn't even know he was going until your mother told me he left.
She's my stepmother.
I've never met her.
Oh, you haven't?
What's she like?
- Well, miss, it's hardly my position--
- Please.
- She's my employer's wife, miss.
- What's she like as a person?
I don't know her as a person.
You must know something about her.
You drive her.
Only occasionally. She usually drives herself or has Dr. Gerrard drive her.
- Who's he?
- He's your father's doctor.
- He's always up at the house.
- I didn't know my father was ill.
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't--
- What's wrong with him?
- I thought you'd have known that.
- No, I didn't know anything.
Oh, he's been ill for some time now.
That's what surprised me when--
- When what?
- Oh, it doesn't matter, miss.
You haven't been to France for a long time, I understand.
Ten years.
What's wrong with my father?
I don't know, miss. But whatever it was, he must be all right now.
- Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone.
- When will he be back?
Mrs. Appleby didn't say.
Hello, Penny. Welcome home.
- Jane?
- You sound surprised.
- Aren't I as you imagined?
- I'm sorry. I must sound rude.
Not a bit. Oh, take it through to the hall, Robert...
...and then come back for Miss Appleby.
- Was your journey terribly tiring?
- Not very.
It must've been a strain.
You haven't travelled much, have you?
- No, I haven't. But it was exciting.
- Good.
Careful, Robert.
The steps are quite a problem,
I'm afraid.
But we put ramps down wherever we can.
I didn't think you'd want to use the front door much.
We've put you in one of your father's rooms.
He uses it as a sitting room and a study. Fetch the cases, Robert.
It's very convenient, though.
It has its own bathroom.
UP We go.
It looks nice.
I made your father buy new curtains and a couple of extra chairs.
You've no idea how dark everything was.
Men always want to furnish their studies like Victorian mausoleums.
Jane, where is Father?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, darling.
It was unavoidable.
He simply had to go away on this business deal that he's working on.
I tried to stop him, but you know what your father is.
No, I'm afraid I don't.
I haven't seen him for 10 years.
I don't know if I'd recognise him.
Well, I've taken care of that.
Look, taken a month ago.
- Yes, I would've recognised him.
- Of course you would.
Oh, bring the cases in, Robert.
- Where do you want them, darling?
- On the bed, please.
- Would you like me to unpack for you?
- No, I can manage myself, thank you.
Is there anything more, madam?
No, that will be all, thank you.
I shan't need you again.
Well, I expect you want to be alone now.
Dinner's at 8. I'll come and fetch you.
Oh, and, Penny, if you want anything...
...this bell here rings down to the kitchen and up to my room as well.
Wonderful having you here.
Means so much to me.
Then when Mother died, there was only Maggie Frensham.
I know she was just my nurse, but she was much more than that really.
We were the same age, like sisters.
People said we even looked alike.
I think I loved her as much as I did my mother.
Is that why you didn't come home after your mother died?
This isn't my home.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound rude.
It's just that--
Well, I'd never met you, and I hadn't seen Father for 10 years...
...ever since Mother took me to Italy to live after they were divorced.
Well, Italy was my home.
I was brought up there.
As long as Maggie was with me,
I was happy.
And what actually happened?
She drowned.
Nobody knows how.
She was a good swimmer.
They said she must have gotten cramped.
I nearly killed myself, Jane. I didn't know what to do, who to turn to.
For two years since Mother died,
Maggie was all I had, everything...
...and then suddenly she just wasn't there anymore.
It seems like yesterday it all happened.
These things take time to sort themselves out, darling.
After all, it was only three weeks.
You can't have got over it yet.
No, of course not.
Then, when Father wrote asking me to come here to live, I--
But of course he did.
You're his daughter.
But this is your house, and I wasn't sure if you--
But it was I who suggested that he write to you.
Believe me, having you here makes me very happy.
- You're very kind.
- Nonsense.
Did you expect me to be like the wicked stepmother in the stories?
Honestly, I don't know what I expected.
It's a pity Father couldn't be here.
I was so cross when he said he had to go away.
He was ill.
The chauffeur, Robert, he said that Father was ill.
Well, I wonder why he said that.
There was nothing wrong with him, nothing at all.
He said something about a doctor. Doctor...?
Oh, yes, he meant Pierre Gerrard.
He's the doctor in the village.
He comes up and plays chess with your father.
- I must speak to Robert. He shouldn't--
- No, please.
Don't let him get into trouble on my account.
All right, if you want it that way.
Do you want some more coffee?
No, thank you.
Jane, would you excuse me if I went to bed now?
Of course. You must be dead.
Look at me, behaving like an old hen with one of her chicks.
Jane, thank you.
Thank you for everything.
I hope you can sleep, Penny.
The crickets make rather a noise.
- That's all right, I like crickets.
- Sometimes they're deafening.
Father?
Help! Help! Help!
Help!
- My darling, how do you feel?
- You're all right now.
Relax, young lady, there's nothing to get excited about.
Pierre. Pierre.
It's all right, Jane.
Now, Penny, you've had a fright.
But you must realise that everything is all right. You are safe.
What were you doing out there?
How did you fall in?
L-- I fell into the swimming pool.
Yes, Robert heard you.
He managed to get there in time.
- Father.
- Father's away. You know that.
He isn't. He's in the summerhouse.
I saw him.
- But he can't be, Penny.
- He was dead.
Penny, you had an accident, but you really must try--
- Who are you?
- Dr. Gerrard, darling.
He was dead. He was in the summerhouse, sitting in the chair.
- And I went in and I spoke to him.
- I'm going to give you a sedative.
In the morning, everything will be all right.
But don't you understand what I'm trying to say?
My father is dead.
His body's in the summerhouse.
Please, darling.
Please, you must--
Don't treat me as if I were a mental defective.
- What are you doing?
- I want to go to the summerhouse now.
Very well, if that makes you feel better.
- Where's my chair?
- It's at the bottom of the pool.
Robert will get it out in the morning.
Would you carry me, please?
- Go on, open it.
- But it's always kept locked.
- But it was open.
- It's always locked, Penny.
There was a candle.
There's no need for a candle here, Penny.
Take me back now.
We won't want you anymore tonight, thank you, Robert.
- Good night, doctor.
- Good night.
- Well, how are you feeling now?
- I'm sorry.
The imagination is a very funny thing.
It plays very unkind tricks at times.
It was probably the strain of the journey.
Now I'm going to give you a sedative.
- Sleep's the best cure for your trouble.
- If you say so.
You take this one now.
And in one hour, if you still can't sleep, this one. All right?
- Good night.
- Good night.
There.
- I'm sorry, Jane.
- Don't worry, darling.
Try and get some sleep.
Good night, Penny.
Good night.
Come in.
I'm bringing you some petit-déjeuner.
My name is Marie.
I don't think I saw you here last night.
I do not live here, mademoiselle.
I have a house in the village.
Would you please see what's happening to my chair?
- Your chair, mademoiselle?
- My wheelchair.
Good morning, darling.
How did you get from the bed?
I crawled.
You crawled, Penny?
What on earth for?
I couldn't sleep.
Did you take the other pill that Pierre gave you?
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?
I didn't want to.
Jane, when will my chair be ready?
I'll find out, shall I?
Garage.
Oh, good morning, madam.
- Yes, ma'am, in about 10 minutes.
- Thank you, Robert.
He's cleaning it up.
He'll bring it around when it's ready.
Thank you, Jane.
- Are you feeling better this morning?
- A little tired.
I was so worried.
- Your father told me--
- Told you what?
- Oh, nothing.
- Please, Jane.
Well, he told me how you were when you were a little girl.
Imaginative, fanciful, slightly...
- Neurotic?
- No, I didn't mean that.
I was, though.
I was afraid of everything.
Dark, wind, thunder, lightning.
- Most children are.
- They grow out of it.
Jane, what is that summerhouse used for?
Penny, darling, whatever you thought you saw last night...
...you must realise you imagined it.
Oh, I know that.
I'm just curious what it's used for.
Well, we keep old furniture there.
It's not used for anything nowadays.
Penny, darling, I've got to go out this morning...
...and I've asked Robert to show you around.
Won't you need him?
No, I can drive myself. We can't leave you alone your first day here.
- Oh, Jane, I'll be all right.
- No, nonsense.
Well, I--
I've got to go and get dressed now.
Jane?
Did Father say when he was coming back?
Not exactly, but I don't think it'll be today, darling.
It's lovely here. It's so peaceful.
Yeah, it's my favourite spot.
We swim from here in the summer.
I don't swim.
Because of your legs?
- Have you tried?
- No.
You'd probably find you could manage very well.
You're not one of those characters who can't talk about their--
- Their afflictions, I think they call it?
- I don't think so.
Meaning that other people don't talk about it in case it upsets you.
I guess you're right.
Why do people have to make a big thing out of it?
- How long have you been like that?
- Nine years.
- You were on a horse, weren't you?
- The horse was on me.
You know, I bet that's the first time you've joked about it.
I think it is.
Why do you hide behind those things?
- Hide?
- That's why you wear them, isn't it?
Like a person who sits with his back to the sun while talking to you.
- Is that what it looks like?
- It's true, isn't it?
I don't know.
I never really thought about it.
I feel more secure when I'm wearing these.
I can watch people's eyes and I know that they can't see mine.
- Well, why should you feel insecure?
- My legs, I suppose.
Being physically dependent on other people...
...doesn't build up your self-confidence.
You seem a pretty self-reliant person to me.
My behaviour last night wasn't very self-reliant.
Too much wine at dinner.
- Beginning to think you're right.
- Of course I am.
Alcoholic hallucination?
I didn't thank you for last night, did I, Bob?
- Well, what for?
- You pulled me out of the pool.
All part of the service.
How long have you worked for my father?
- Oh, two years.
- Do you like it?
It's the only way I get to drive expensive cars and live on the Riviera.
- Do you like working for my father?
- Oh, I don't see much of him.
Mrs. Appleby uses the car most of the time. He hardly ever goes out.
It's funny he didn't use you to drive him. When he went away.
That's not the only thing.
He used the small car.
- What's funny about it?
- He doesn't like the small car.
- Maybe the other wasn't there.
- It was.
They were both in the garage the night he left.
I wonder why he left at night.
Bob, would you take me back up now, please?
Back to the house?
Summerhouse.
- What are you looking for?
- Something, anything.
I thought you agreed it was just your imagination.
I did, but there must be something...
...that will tell me why my imagination acted the way it did.
Like a dead body?
Oh, I'm sorry, Penny.
Penny!
Come into the house.
I've got a surprise for you.
- What is it?
- Come and see.
I'll take it, Robert.
- What kind of a surprise?
- Wait and see.
It's for you.
- Hello?
- Penny, this is your father.
Penny, can you hear me?
What's the matter, darling?
- Penny?
- Yes.
Oh, I thought you'd gone.
Can you hear me all right?
Yes.
I'm sorry I wasn't there when you arrived.
Jane told you I was away on business?
Yes.
I'll be a couple more days yet.
Look after yourself and have fun.
All right. Thank you.
Let me speak to Jane, will you?
Yes? Hello.
- Is Penny all right?
- Yes, she's fine.
- Tell her I'll be back soon.
- Yes, I'll tell her.
- Do you miss me?
- Yes. See you soon.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
There. That makes you feel better about last night, doesn't it?
Oh, Penny, I-- I shouldn't go to the summerhouse again if I were you.
It was a horrible experience.
We don't want to repeat it, do we?
I can manage now, Jane.
Oh, darling, Dr. Gerrard is coming to lunch. You don't mind, do you?
No, of course not.
- May I come in?
- Yes.
It's about what I said just now in the summerhouse.
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes, of course.
- Well, what was the big surprise?
- My father.
He wanted to talk to me on the phone.
- No more worries, then?
- I suppose not.
Shall I take you for another walk this afternoon?
Dr. Gerrard's coming for lunch, and he may stay the afternoon.
- Oh, then I'd better get dressed.
- Why? You have to go out?
Well, if he's coming,
I've got to go pick him up.
- Doesn't he have a car?
- He has, but it's in dock.
He smashed it up last week.
He's a terrible driver.
- Did you bring him out here last night?
- I was to, but--
No, I didn't.
I took him home, though.
- How did he get out, then?
- I don't know.
I was only unconscious 20 minutes, wasn't I?
Yeah, about that. He just seemed to be here. I didn't think anything of it.
- Was he here to dinner?
- No.
Anyway, if he had been, you would have had to pick him up.
Yeah, that's funny.
I don't understand what's happening here.
One minute I think I was imagining everything...
...and the next
I'm just not sure anymore.
Even now that I've talked to my father,
I'm still not sure.
What, you mean it wasn't him?
I haven't talked to my father for nine years. It could've been anyone.
- Why?
- I don't know. I just don't know.
Now I'll tell you something.
You said last night a candle was burning in the summerhouse.
Everyone says, "Nonsense, there's an electric light there, why use a candle?"
What is it?
I scraped it off the floor just now when
Mrs. Appleby brought you indoors.
It's candle grease.
No, thank you.
- You haven't eaten anything, Penny.
- I'm not hungry.
You really should try to eat something.
You're a little run-down, you know.
Why do you say that?
A reasonably healthy person would never have experienced...
...what you did last night.
- You should be particularly careful.
- Why me?
Your father said that when you were a child, you were over-imaginative...
...and inclined to be frightened of your own shadow.
Then your accident, and all those weeks in hospital...
...it's hardly surprising that your mind is a little confused, is it?
You must be very careful. Shocks such as the one you had last night...
...whether the cause is real or imaginary...
...can deal the mind a very serious blow.
A blow which could affect it permanently.
You mean I could go mad?
I didn't mean to imply anything as drastic as that.
What did you mean to imply?
Well, it's just that if the imagination starts to wander...
...one has to try and drag it back to reality before--
Before it becomes permanent, you said, Dr. Gerrard.
- Pierre meant--
- I know what he meant.
He meant I'd better watch myself or I'll go insane...
...and have to be locked up.
Bob?
- Miss Penny.
- Would you get that key down for me?
I can't. Mrs. Appleby's got it.
I thought it was kept up on the ledge.
It was, but she asked for it before lunch.
- Why?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
That candle grease you were telling me about--
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
It doesn't tell anything.
It helps prove what I was saying.
It proves a candle's been burned in there. It could be months ago.
- The place is never used.
- I saw it last night.
Yes, miss. So you said.
You don't believe me either, do you?
I believe you think you saw something.
First Dr. Gerrard and Jane.
And now you.
Now, listen. Believe me, I'd like to help, but can't see what I can do.
Robert? I'm ready, Robert.
Will you bring the car around to the front?
Sure you don't want to come, darling?
The drive will do you good.
Put colour in your cheeks.
No, thank you.
Can I bring you anything from Cannes?
No.
All right.
I'll be back just after dark.
Come in.
If there is nothing else, mademoiselle,
I should like to go now.
- Oh, is Mrs. Appleby back yet?
- No.
Robert told me she had shopping to do in Cannes.
They will not be back until half an hour more, I think.
All right. Thank you.
Good night, Marie.
Bob?
Bob? Is that you?
Bob?
Father?
Bring the things in here, Robert.
Hello, darling. Why didn't you tell me you wanted to use the sitting room?
Marie could have lit the fire.
Jane, who uses the piano?
Your father. Nobody else in the house can play.
He keeps it locked.
He doesn't like people tinkling with it, says it ruins the tone.
- What kind of car is the small car?
- What do you mean, darling?
The small one.
The one Father went away in.
It's a white Simca.
He's come back.
It's in the garage.
Miss Penny, I just--
That'll be all, thank you, Robert.
You can go.
I saw the car. It was in the garage.
We've just came from the garage.
There was no car there.
But I saw it. I was there and I saw it.
- But you couldn't have. Otherwise--
- Leave me alone.
Penny.
Bob?
- There wasn't any car.
- There was a small white sports car.
How did I know my father had that car if I didn't see it?
You didn't. I just told you in the living room.
But I saw it, I tell you.
It was there. I heard it arrive.
And someone started playing the piano.
- The piano is locked.
- I know, and there was no one there.
But someone was playing that piano.
I know it doesn't make any sense but--
Garage.
Yes, madam, she's here.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Mrs. Appleby asked me to tell you that supper will be in half an hour.
Look, try not to worry too much.
There's bound to be a reasonable explanation for all this.
We'll try and work something out together, shall we?
Thank you. Good night, Bob.
Good night, Miss Penny.
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob! He was there.
- Penny, what is it?
- In my room.
What is it?
What is all the noise?
Miss Penny. She came out screaming about something in her room.
- Poor child. Where is she now?
- I'm here.
What happened, darling?
What frightened you?
I'm sorry. I thought I saw something.
But what? What did you see?
I seem to have caused a lot of fuss about nothing.
- My imagination again.
- You frightened me to death.
- Are you sure you're all right now?
- It won't happen again.
I hope not, because your poor head won't stand many more shocks.
Would you like me to bring your dinner in here? Would you like that?
- I'll be all right now.
- Good.
Oh, Penny, I hope you don't mind,
I've asked Dr. Gerrard to dinner.
Why?
Well, I could put him off if you'd rather.
Don't bother because of me.
That'll be all, thank you, Robert.
Well, good night, ma'am.
Miss Penny.
- Good night. I'm sorry if I--
- Don't mention it.
- Penny, you're sure you're all right?
- Please, I feel bad enough as it is.
- Don't make it any worse.
- No, of course not.
Well, I'll see you at dinner in about 20 minutes.
Thank you.
Bob.
I was hoping you'd come back.
You weren't imagining things, were you?
No.
Tell me what you saw.
My father.
He was sitting there, in that chair.
And he was dead.
And...
...he moved his head.
It was horrible.
You were outside the room?
I went to the summerhouse to see alight.
The same light that was there last night.
- That was very brave of you.
- I had to know what it was.
And when I was there,
I saw a light go off in here...
...so I came rushing back.
And, Bob, he was sitting there waiting.
What is it?
It's wet. Soaking wet.
What does it mean, Bob?
Your father's a very rich man, isn't he?
- Yes.
- Any idea what's in his will?
- How do you mean?
- If he dies, who gets the money?
- I do.
- All of it? What about Mrs. Appleby?
There's a trust fund.
She gets the interest.
Are you sure?
Could the will have been changed?
You haven't seen your father for a long time.
It couldn't have been.
The money was my grandfather's...
...and he didn't approve of second marriages.
Are there any conditions?
Well, if I'm dead or incapable,
Jane gets the money.
Incapable?
You know, unable to handle the estates...
...legally incompetent, insane--
They want you out of the way before it's discovered that your father's dead.
- That way you won't collect the money.
- Jane will.
Bob, that means that they killed my father.
They may have, but not likely.
If they had, they'd have no qualms about killing you too.
No, the trouble they're going to to drive you insane...
...makes it look as though your father's had an accident, perhaps...
...and all they're doing is keeping quiet about it.
Then when they can get you out of the way, they'll rig the accident...
-...so it looks as if it's just happened.
- What can we do?
We're only guessing. We'd better look around for some sort of evidence.
But what?
It's not very pleasant, I know, but somewhere here is your father's body.
We've got to find it.
Bob, I'm frightened.
I'll look around after your stepmother's gone to bed.
I wanna go with you.
All right.
Look, draw your curtains when I go.
When she's gone to bed, open them up again. I'll watch for the light.
Bob?
Thank you.
- Pierre?
- Thank you.
Penny?
- Penny--
- What do you want?
- Pierre only wants to help you, darling.
- Please, Jane.
If it's about my mental health,
I'd rather not hear it.
It's about your legs.
When was the last time that you saw a specialist?
- Why?
- Tell me, please.
Three years ago.
Well, that's why I want you to see another one now, in Zurich.
I have seen specialists all over the world...
-...and they all said the same thing.
- Yes, I know.
But the last time was three years ago.
Penny, do you know what is meant by hysterical paralysis?
Well, it happens when, because of a fright or an accident...
...a person can lose the use of a muscle or a limb.
There is no tissue pathology to account for this.
There are no physical symptoms to account for this...
...but the fact is inescapable.
The person is completely unable to--
Well, for example, to walk.
The reasons for this are mental.
They're not physical.
There's no physical reason why this person should not get straight up...
...out of her chair and walk with the rest of us.
It's only this self-created mental block that prevents her.
You're trying to tell me that I'm not a cripple?
- That it's all in my mind?
- I'm saying that could be the case.
Was the horse that fell on me in my mind too? Did I imagine that?
No. No, that was the basic cause,
I admit.
But since then the physical damage could have been repaired.
It is only the mental side that refuses to accept this.
That is why I'm, well, seriously worried about your mental state.
After all, with all this confusion going on...
...you can hardly expect your mind to behave rationally.
Dr. Gerrard, I am a cripple.
My back was broken in two places.
If you want the technical diagnosis...
...I sustained a multiple fracture of the first lumbar vertebra...
...and a simple fracture between the fifth and sixth cervical.
I can show you the x-rays if you'd like.
But I didn't imagine it and I'm not imagining it now.
Do you think that I like being tied to this chair...
...dependent on anyone who can spare me a moment?
Do you think that I like not being able to--?
To dance and swim and ride...
...or just walk like anyone else?
I don't like it. I hate it.
I loathe and hate and despise it.
You say that my mind is affecting my legs. You're wrong.
It's my legs that are affecting my mind.
I'd rather not talk about it anymore.
- I think what Pierre meant, Penny--
- I said no more, Jane. I mean it.
- Is she in bed?
- She went up about 20 minutes ago...
...but I thought it'd be better to wait a little longer.
- We've got the place to ourselves.
- Where are we going to look?
I've been thinking since we talked.
The weather's not very cold.
The body..
Well, I mean, it's not going to keep.
- There's only one place it could be.
- Where?
Deep freeze.
A week ago, Mrs. Appleby asked me to fit a new lock on it.
Shall we go?
Okay?
Yes.
What will we do now?
- Keep looking.
- Where?
I don't know.
We can't do any more tonight.
I better take you back to your room.
- What about the lock?
- I'll fix it later.
I don't see why we just can't go and tell them what we know.
But that's it, Penny.
We don't know anything.
We can't just march in and say your father's met with a fatal accident...
...and your stepmother and
Dr. Gerrard are trying to conceal it.
- Why not?
- Because without proof...
...they wouldn't believe us.
No, we've got to find the body.
But where?
You yourself said that a body won't--
Won't keep. Where could it be?
Somewhere close to the house.
It has to be.
I'm not much help to you there.
I can't even get up the stairs.
It's how it should be. I don't want you wandering. Anything might happen.
Leave it to me. I'll think of something.
I'll get you back to the house for lunch.
Why are you doing all this for me,
Bob?
I don't like to see anybody get the sharp end of the stick.
I liked your father. I don't like your stepmother or that Gerrard character.
Because you're pretty.
It's not sympathy?
Sure, there's sympathy there.
But not for the reasons you think.
You're a nice person who's in trouble.
I sympathize with you for that.
Not because of these?
Like I told you before, it's hard luck.
There's plenty of people worse off than you are.
There's another reason too.
Shall I tell you what it is?
I didn't mean to do that until all this was over.
I'm glad you did.
Hey, if I keep you out any longer,
I shall be looking for a new job.
Penny, you're not getting too friendly with Robert, are you?
Too friendly?
Well, I've been watching you when you're together, and you seem...
Cheerful is the word, Jane.
We want you to be happy, darling, don't misunderstand. But not Robert.
How would you like me to give a party and ask the local people?
- Like Dr. Gerrard?
- Don't you like him?
- Not especially.
- Well, you must talk to your father.
Because he's his friend, not mine.
No, I was thinking of Monsieur Gaston.
He lives on the other side of the bay.
He has two sons about your age.
Then there's John Blakeman--
Please, Jane, thank you, but I'd rather not.
All right, Penny.
I know it can't be much fun for you at the moment, darling.
But in the summer, it's lovely here.
We might get the pool cleaned out, and then perhaps you could swim.
Madame Latour, madame.
My dressmaker. I should have seen her in Cannes this morning.
I won't be long.
- What's the matter, Penny?
- Matter? Nothing.
You looked strange for a moment.
I've got to go out this afternoon.
I won't be back till 10 tonight.
- Will you be all right?
- I'd rather not be alone.
No, of course not.
I'll ask Marie if she can stay.
Don't bother. If I know that Robert's in his room, I won't be worried.
I can drive myself.
Are you sure you want to?
Oh, it's just the cold.
Let's get it over with.
Well, here we go.
Anything?
No, it's black as pitch down there.
Maybe it would be better if--
He's there, isn't he?
What shall we do?
- Go to the police.
- Now?
Well, there's no point in waiting.
We've found what we were looking for.
- What about--?
- We must leave him there.
We'll fetch the police back and show them.
I'll come with you.
Okay. I'll go and get dressed, and meet you around the front.
Can you manage?
Five minutes.
- You don't want your chair, do you?
- No, I suppose not.
What if they find the chair?
It doesn't really matter, does it? Once we get back, nothing matters anymore.
How long will it take to get there?
It's no good going to the village police station. The old chap there's useless.
We'll go straight through to Cannes.
It'll only take us half an hour.
- It will all be over soon, Penny.
- I was thinking about my father.
I never knew him really, not as a daughter, but I know that he was kind.
Even after Mother divorced him, he was always doing things for her.
Little things, like--
He always remembered my birthday.
How could this have happened, Bob?
How?
- Greed.
- She was his wife.
She must have loved him once.
Can it die so completely?
Not die, no. But it can be killed by--
By another love. By somebody else.
Dr. Gerrard.
I suppose so.
What's that?
- It's your stepmother.
- Don't stop. I'm frightened.
She'll recognise the car. I'll have to stop. You sit tight. I'll speak to her.
Will she be dead?
She's a cripple, isn't she?
She's dead.
It worked, Bob. It worked.
The accident will be discovered.
There will be a coroner's inquest.
- But it will be all right?
- Yes, it'll be all right.
Turn it off, Bob, please.
I rather like it.
It makes a good requiem.
Please, Bob.
To us.
What's the matter?
Having to kill her.
But we agreed we'd have to if it didn't work the other way.
If only we could have done it without killing.
I thought when her father had the accident...
...everything would be all right.
It seemed that things...
Well, what is it, Bob?
Why are you smiling?
You never believed your husband had an accident, did you?
- Did you?
- Bob, don't.
- Did you?
- Don't, Bob. Don't.
The old man could swim like a fish, and you know it.
Do you know what I did?
I dragged him under and I held him there.
- Bob, don't.
- I watched his stupid face...
-...while he tried to hold his breath.
- Please, don't.
Then there were a lot of bubbles.
And he stopped struggling.
Your telephone call reached me this morning...
...at the same time as this report.
A break in the cliff fence.
An automobile upside down in 30 feet of water.
It is likely that the two things are the same. I am sorry.
Your stepdaughter had not been with you long, I understand.
Four days.
- And Monsieur Appleby?
- He arrived home last night.
They went for a drive together...
...because they wanted to get to know one another again.
They hadn't seen each other for 10 years. I was an outsider, really.
It must have been difficult for you.
It was, a bit. But it would have been all right. I know it would. And now this.
You have my deepest sympathies,
Mrs. Appleby.
You will be at the house if we want you?
- Want me?
- The bodies will have to be identified.
- Oh, do I have to?
- I'm afraid so. It's the law.
Your husband's solicitor has been informed.
He will be coming from London this morning.
He will go straight to the house.
No doubt there will be a number of things to attend to.
Your husband was rich, wasn't he?
- I suppose so.
- And now everything comes to you.
I believe so.
It would have gone to Penny.
Quite so.
You'll ask the solicitor to contact me?
Yes, I will. Thank you, inspector.
You've been very kind.
I will arrange for a car to take you home.
Mrs. Appleby has her own car.
I know. But I'd like you to accompany me to the scene of the accident.
We'll need you to identify the automobile.
- It's all right, Robert.
- Well, if you say so, ma'am.
- Goodbye, inspector.
- Good day, Mrs. Appleby.
- I'll wait for you outside, inspector.
- Thank you.
You can identify the automobile from here?
Well, hardly, inspector.
Of course not.
The frogman will attempt to ascertain...
...the colour, the make and the number of the car.
Then we will know.
I shall go down to talk with the frogman.
Oh, there's plenty of time.
You will wait here, please.
You have my deepest sympathy,
Mrs. Appleby.
- Such a tragedy.
- Thank you, Mr. Spratt.
I've tried to keep the papers down to a minimum.
You must understand that in such cases...
...there is an amount of legal work which must be taken care of.
- Yes, of course.
- Before anything becomes official...
...we must wait for the verdict of the coroner.
But if in the meantime there's anything that you require, please let me know.
Your husband's will is most clear and explicit.
Everything he has is to go to you...
...with no attachments or codicil whatsoever.
Now if you'll please just sign...
...on the papers where I have left a cross in pencil.
The will allows you to draw money from the estate pending settlement.
There's just one thing, Mr. Spratt.
I understand in a case of common accident when both parties die...
...there's sometimes a dispute as to who legally was the first to die.
That's quite so. But I fail to see that it has any bearing on the matter in hand.
- Well, this was a common accident.
- What was?
Both my husband and my stepdaughter were in the car together.
Your stepdaughter, Miss Penelope?
Oh, didn't they tell you?
I thought the police--
I'm sorry, Mrs. Appleby.
I just don't understand you.
Well, both my husband and Penny were in the car. They--
They were killed together.
No, that's quite impossible.
I don't know why you say that,
Mr. Spratt. It's a fact.
- They went for a drive and--
- Mrs. Appleby, surely you must know.
Your stepdaughter,
Miss Penelope Appleby...
...committed suicide three weeks ago in Switzerland.
Are you all right, Mrs. Appleby?
Can I get you anything?
- Mrs. Appleby?
- I'm sorry.
Obviously your husband didn't tell you.
His daughter went for a holiday with her companion, a Miss Frensham.
She drowned herself, apparently.
She was always of a delicate mental state.
It was due to her paralysis,
I understand.
Really, you must allow me to get you some brandy.
Come down here a moment, please.
My apologies for asking you to come down all this way.
It was easier than for me to go up.
We'd only have to come down again immediately.
Climbing I do not find agreeable.
- Is it the car?
- It is a Rolls-Royce, silver and black...
...with the number 278EMO6.
- Is it the car?
- Yeah, that's it.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
Strange.
There's only one person inside.
- A man.
- The girl? The daughter?
Of her, I'm afraid, there's no sign.
I shall have to leave you now,
Mrs. Appleby.
I must report to the local police for news of the recovery.
Yes, of course.
Are you quite sure you're all right?
- I'm all right, thank you.
- I shall show myself out.
Is your friend quite safe out there?
Friend?
The young lad)'-
Good day, Mrs. Appleby.
Good morning, Jane.
Why so silent?
- Who are you?
- Maggie Frensham.
Frensham? The companion.
That's right. Penny's friend.
But I don't understand.
I spent three years watching
Penny die, Mrs. Appleby.
Little by little. When her mother died, she was all alone.
For a girl like Penny, that was unbearable.
Finally I couldn't stand it any longer, so I wrote to her father.
- You wrote to him here?
- Yes.
He answered. He said that she couldn't come here then...
...because something strange was happening.
But he didn't say anything to me.
He'd hardly have told you,
Mrs. Appleby.
It was you that he was disturbed about.
Penny finally stopped struggling against life.
She slipped out of the cabin one night and drowned herself.
Two weeks later,
I opened a letter that arrived for her.
"Please come home, Penny.
I have always wanted you here.
Signed, Father."
Penny was dead, Mrs. Appleby.
And her father knew it.
But how did he know?
I told him myself. I spoke to him on the phone the night that Penny died.
You spoke to him here?
Yes. That's when he told me about his friend.
What friend? Who?
Can't you guess, Mrs. Appleby?
- Pierre.
- That's right. Dr. Gerrard.
Then when this letter arrived with your husband's signature on it...
...I knew something must be wrong because he knew Penny was dead.
So I contacted Dr. Gerrard, and he and I decided what to do.
- You're not crippled.
- No.
I'm not.
That's why I'm still here.
I opened the car door last night and jumped out.
It was Robert. He told me to--
- What are you doing to do?
- Need you ask that, Mrs. Appleby?
Is it money?
No, no, I don't want money.
I have more than enough.
Penny and I were very close.
She left me well provided for.
- Are you Robert, the chauffeur?
- Yes, sir.
I'm Spratt, Mr. Appleby's solicitor.
I've left Mrs. Appleby.
She's not feeling well.
Keep an eye on her. There doesn't seem to be anyone except the girl.
- The girl?
- The cripple in the wheelchair.
I'll be at the Grand Hotel if anyone wants me.
Please, isn't there anything--?
There's nothing, Mrs. Appleby.
On, Bob.
Bob!
Monsieur Robert, will you come with me, please?
Come away, Maggie.
There's nothing more for you here.
- Joint raided!
- No, no.
It's just our Raymond.
Our lovable Sergeant Shaw.
All right, let's go, you men! Come on!
Let's go.
Come on, Sarge.
Gertrude buy you beer.
What's the matter him?
I'm afraid our Saint Raymond, he don't approve.
Well, maybe he's got a girl back home or something.
Him? Our Raymond?
Are you kidding?
Come on, Stevens, get up! Let's go!
- Hey, Silver, how about the robe?
- What do you mean, my robe? Get outta here.
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
Bad here.
- How do you know?
- Chunjin born two miles from here, Captain.
So far, every place we've been in Korea, this joker was born two miles from it.
- What's so bad about it?
- Tricky.
Swamp all around.
Thirty yards up may be quicksand.
Nobody said anything about quicksand.
Can't we go around it?
No, Sergeant.
What's your personal advice?
All walk in single line next 200 yards.
Rejected. Not tactical to travel forward in a single line.
Patrol sink.
Can't we go around it?
- No, Sergeant.
- Never mind.
Okay, pass the word.
This nation jealously guards
its highest award for valor,
the Congressional Medal of Honor.
In the Korean War,
with 5,720,000 personnel engaged,
only 77 men were so honored.
One of these 77 men
was Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw.
Raymond Shaw was returned from combat
and flown directly to Washington
to be decorated personally
by the president of the United States.
This is why his presence, or the presence
of any Medal of Honor winner,
is sufficient to bring generals
to their feet, saluting.
Congratulations, son.
How do you feel?
Like Captain Idiot in
Astounding Science Comics.
Hold it, General!
Hold it, General, please!
Come on, Jack. We've got to get in there quickly. Quickly!
Mother, what is this?
What are you doing here?
- Senator Iselin, how about a statement?
- Thank you, General.
How does it feel to be the father of a Medal of Honor winner?
He's not my father!
The senator is Raymond's stepfather.
However, Raymond's always...
I can only say that as one who has devoted his life to the service of his country...
You did this, Mother.
You organized this disgusting three-ring circus.
But, darling, you're a Medal of Honor winner.
Incidentally, congratulations.
I was going to write to you, but we've been in the most frightful mess the last few months.
- This moment will stand out as the proudest...
- All right, all right. Let him through.
That's enough now.
That's enough, I say. Let him through.
Say "cheese."
All right, that's enough now.
Let the poor boy through now. Please.
What is the matter with you, Raymond?
We've gone to a good deal of trouble to...
- Arranged a parade for you and so forth.
- A parade?
Get that... Get that out of here.
Why, you publicity-sick, flag-simple boob.
Raymond, just because your parents, and the entire country for that matter,
- happens to be proud of you...
- Who's kidding who, Mother?
Johnny's up for reelection in November.
You've got it all figured out, haven't you?
Johnny Iselin's boy, Medal of Honor winner.
That should get you another 50,000 votes.
Raymond, I'm your mother.
How can you talk to me this way?
You know I want nothing for myself.
You know that my entire life is devoted to helping you and to helping Johnny.
- My boys. My two little boys.
- Mother, stop it. Stop it.
- Stop it.
- That is all I want.
On the afternoon
of his arrival in Washington,
Raymond Shaw was decorated
at the White House
by the president of the United States.
His citation attested to
by his commanding officer,
Captain Bennett Marco,
and the nine surviving members
of his patrol, read in part...
"Displaying valor above
and beyond the call of duty,
did single-handedly save the lives
of nine members of his patrol,
capturing an enemy machine gun nest
and taking out, in the process,
a full company of enemy infantry.
He then proceeded
to lead his patrol,
which had been listed
as missing in action for three days,
back through the enemy lines to safety."
A gift from the Citizens For Iselin Committee for his last birthday.
It's absolutely saved our lives during the campaign.
You see, this opens up into a double bed.
This is the press room.
And this... this is my private office.
Anything to take the pain out of campaigning, huh?
That's what I always say.
May I take this thing off now, Mother?
Oh, Raymond, what is the matter with you?
You look as if your head were going to come to a point in the next 13 seconds.
Johnny, fix him a drink or something.
Sit down, Raymond. Relax.
We'll be home in less than two and a half hours.
I'm not going home with you, Mother.
I'm going to New York.
What?
I've got a job on a newspaper.
Research assistant to Mr. Holborn Gaines.
Holborn Gaines?
That Communist?
He's not a Communist, Mother.
As a matter of fact, he's a Republican.
But the terrible things he's written about Johnny.
He came to interview me at the White House this morning.
Afterwards, I asked him for a job.
He gave it to me.
We discovered that we had a great deal in common.
What could you possibly have in common with that dreadful old man?
Well, for one thing, we discovered that we both loathe and despise you and Johnny.
And that's a beginning.
The war in Korea was over.
Captain, now Major Bennett Marco
had been reassigned
to Army Intelligence in Washington.
It was, by and large, a pleasant assignment,
except for one thing.
Night after night, the major was plagued
by the same reoccurring nightmare.
Stop him.
Stop him, Mama.
Stop him, Mama.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Another modern discovery which we owe to the hydrangea... concerns the influence of air drainage upon plant climate.
Many years ago, when I was traveling about the country,
I noticed magnificent hydrangeas on the hills where the air drainage was, uh, perfect, and very poor specimens, or perhaps none at all, in the valleys.
Formerly, we used to consider sheltered valleys more favorable to plants than hilltops.
But the avoidance of late spring and early autumn frosts enjoyed by sites with good air drainage, where the cold air can drain safely away to lower levels, gives the hills a decided advantage.
Thus it was the hydrangeas that gave the first pointer in another modern discovery of horticultural importance.
From this it might appear that the hydrangea is a fairly simple plant, but there are more complications.
The cultivation of hydrangeas was evolved from a number of varieties originally found in Japan, not all of which, of course, have the same characteristics.
Two of them do not share the quality of producing blue flowers in mineral-rich soils.
Allow me to introduce our American visitors.
I must ask you to forgive their somewhat lackadaisical manners, but I have conditioned them, or brainwashed them, which I understand is the new American word, to believe that they are waiting out a storm in a lobby of a small hotel in New Jersey where a meeting of the ladies' garden club is in progress.
You will notice that I have told them they may smoke.
I've allowed my people to have a little fun in the selection of bizarre tobacco substitutes.
Are you enjoying your cigarette, Ed?
Yes, ma'am.
Yak dung.
Oh, tastes good like a cigarette should.
Now then, comrades...
May I present the famous Raymond Shaw.
The young man you've flown 8,000 miles to this dreary spot in Manchuria to see.
Raymond, pull your chair over here by me, please.
I am sure you've all heard the old wives' tale that no hypnotized subject may be forced to do that which is repellent to his moral nature, whatever that may be.
Nonsense, of course.
Oh, you note-takers might set down a reminder to consult Brenman's paper,
"Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Antisocial and Self-Injurious Behavior," or Wells' 1941 paper which was titled, I believe,
"Experiments in the
Hypnotic Production of Crime."
Or, of course,
Andrew Salter's remarkable book,
Conditioned Reflex Therapy, to name only three.
Or if it offends you that only the West is working to manufacture more crime and better criminals... against the modern shortages,
I suggest Krasnogorski's
Primary Violence Motivation, or Serov's The Unilateral Suggestion to Self-Destruction.
My dear Yen, as you grow older you grow more long-winded.
Can't we get to the point?
Has the man ever killed anyone or has he not?
I apologize, my dear Dimitri.
I keep forgetting that you're a young country and your attention span is limited.
Tell me, Raymond, have you ever killed anyone?
- No, ma'am.
- Not even in combat?
In combat?
Yes, ma'am, I think so.
Of course you have, Raymond.
Raymond has been a crack shot since childhood.
Marvelous outlet for his aggressions.
May I have the bayonet, please?
Not with the knife.
With the hands.
With the hands?
Here. Have him use this.
Ah. Da, da.
Raymond, whom do you dislike the least in your group here today?
- The least?
- That's right.
Well, I guess Captain Marco, ma'am.
You notice how he is always drawn to authority.
That won't do, Raymond.
We need the captain to get you your medal.
Whom else?
Well, I guess Ed Mavole, ma'am.
Ah, that's better.
Now then, Raymond, take this scarf and strangle Ed Mavole.
Uh, to death.
Yes, ma'am.
- Excuse me, Ben.
- Mm-hmm.
Pardon me.
- Hey, Sarge, cut it out.
- Quiet, Ed, please.
Now, you just sit there quietly and cooperate.
Yes, ma'am.
Major, to your knowledge, have any other ex-members of your patrol had similar dreams?
No, sir, not to my knowledge.
Doesn't it strike anyone as curious that
Mavole was one of the two men lost in the action and... yet every night in my dream, he's the... he's the one that Raymond...
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Now look, Major Marco, since you first brought this recurring dream of yours to our attention,
Raymond Shaw, his life, his background, his habits, his friends and associates have been under scrupulous examination.
Now, the facts speak for themselves.
His stepfather is a United States senator.
His mother is head of
15 different patriotic organizations.
Raymond Shaw himself is employed as confidential assistant to Holborn Gaines, the most respected political journalist in America.
- Now, it's inconceivable, Major, that any...
- Major Marco.
Major, as the consulting psychiatrist present,
I'd be most interested in hearing your personal feelings about Shaw.
Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being
I've ever known in my life.
I see.
And this opinion, Major, was it generally held?
His fellow soldiers, did they feel the same way toward him?
The men loved him, sir.
Why shouldn't they?
He saved their lives.
It would seem obvious to me
Major Marco is suffering a delayed reaction to 18 months of continuous combat in Korea.
I would strongly recommend that the matter of Raymond Shaw be dropped here and now and that Major Marco be temporarily reassigned to less, uh, strenuous and, if I may say so, less sensitive duties.
I think a few months, uh, detached service to, uh, well, perhaps the public relations corps should put the major right back in the pink.
Mr. Secretary! Mr. Secretary!
Can you explain the proposed cut in budget?
Since, sir, you have asked a simple-minded question,
I will give you an equally simple-minded answer.
Since no great naval power menaces the free world today, the navy's overwhelming preponderance of surface ships seems to be superfluous.
Hence the cut in budget.
Major, my time is important.
How much longer must we go on with this nonsense?
Yes, sir.
If there are no further questions for the secretary,
I think that about wraps things up.
Mr. Secretary.
I have a question, sir.
Who are you, sir?
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin, and I have a question so serious that the safety of our nation may well depend on your answer.
Who?
No evasions, Mr. Secretary.
No evasions, if you please, sir.
Evasions? What the hell are you talking about?
What kind of foolishness is this?
Mr. Secretary,
I'm kinda new at this job, but I don't think it's good public relations to talk that way to a United States senator, even if he is an idiot.
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin, and I have here a list of the names of 207 persons who are known by the secretary of defense as being members of the Communist party!
- What?
- And who are still, nevertheless...
If you have such a list, bring it up here! shaping the policy of the Defense Department!
Senator who? What the hell did you say your name was?
I demand an answer, Mr. Secretary.
There will be no covering up, sir.
- What?
- No covering up.
You are not going to get your hands on this list.
How did you get in here in the first place?
- And I deeply regret...
- Major, throw that lunatic out of here! having to say, in front of these ladies and gentlemen...
- You claim that you're a senator?
- and television and radio audience
- of our great country...
- Senator what, I wanna know. that you no longer have my confidence, sir!
Why, you're an idiot, if you ask me!
You're out of your mind!
This is no longer a matter for investigation by the Defense Department!
Get out of here!
Where's the sergeant at arms?
- I'm afraid you have lost your chance, sir.
- Get that man out of this room!
This matter is now the responsibility of the United States Senate!
Get him out of this room!
I will not have him in here. Do you hear me?
No! Never!
If I ever catch you in this room again,
I'll throw you out bodily!
What do you want?
Get out of here!
- Hold it!
- Don't you take my picture anymore!
Clear this room!
Get away from me!
- Go on! Get out of here!
- Senator. Senator Iselin, I'd like to...
- Yes.
- I'd like to verify that number, sir.
- Huh?
- How many Communists did you say?
Oh, uh...
Well, Major, I said there are exactly...
I have absolute proof there are, uh,
104 card-carrying Communists in the Defense Department at this time.
- How many, sir?
- Uh... 275.
And that's absolutely all I have to say on the subject at this time. Come, babe.
- Major, how many did he say?
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Excuse me.
- Hold it, Senator.
- Boys, please.
- Major, how many did he say?
Ladies.
Very good, Raymond.
Thank you, ma'am.
Captain Marco.
- Yes, ma'am?
- On your feet, Captain, please.
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Captain...
When you are returned with your patrol to Korea and you make your way to command headquarters, what will be the first duty you will undertake?
I will make my report on the patrol, ma'am.
What will you report?
I will recommend urgently that Raymond Shaw be posted for the Medal of Honor.
He saved our lives and took out a complete company of Chinese infantry.
A complete company?
What the hell is this?
We can spare an imaginary company of infantry for this particular plan, Mikhail Mikhalich.
All right.
If we are out to humiliate our brave Chinese ally in the newspapers of the world, we might as well make it a full battalion.
We don't object, Comrade.
I assure you of that.
However, Comrade, we thank you for thinking of the matter in that light.
If we may proceed with the demonstration.
Raymond.
Who is that little fellow sitting next to the captain?
That's Bobby Lembeck.
Our mascot,
I guess you'd call him.
Doesn't look old enough to be in your army.
I guess he isn't, but there he is, ma'am.
Captain Marco, will you be good enough to lend Raymond your pistol, please?
Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks, Ben.
- Sure, kid.
Shoot Bobby Raymond through the forehead.
Yes, ma'am.
Honey.
Wake up, wake up!
Wake up. Wake up.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.
- It's that same dream again?
- Uh-huh.
It's all right.
What... What makes it so awful is that I keep dreaming a thing like that about Sergeant Shaw.
It's been going on for weeks now.
I must be going crazy!
What you ought to do is to write to Sergeant Shaw.
I tell you, nothing's wrong with me!
Write to him and see if anyone else is having dreams like yours.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Maybe... Maybe I will.
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.
If anybody can help me, he can.
You like him a lot, don't you?
Raymond Shaw is the bravest, kindest, warmest, most wonderful human being
I've ever known in my life.
Dear Sarge,
I had to say this or write this to someone
because I think I'm going nuts,
and since you were my best friend
in the army, here goes.
Sarge, I'm in trouble.
I'm afraid to go to sleep
because I have terrible dreams.
I dream about all the guys on the patrol
where you won the medal,
and the dream has
a lot of Chinese people in it
and a lot of big brass
from the Russian Army.
Well, it's pretty rough.
You have to take my word for that.
Raymond Shaw, please.
This is he.
Raymond,
why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire?
Raymond.
- Yes, sir.
- Can you see the red queen?
Yes, sir.
Good.
One week from next Saturday
you will be called for at 11:10 AM
and taken to
the Timothy Swardon Sanitarium,
84 East 61st Street.
We want you there for a checkup.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
You may put the cards away now.
Good-bye, Raymond.
Mr. Gaines. It's Mr. Shaw.
He was run down in the street by a hit-and-run driver.
It just came over the AP.
Good heavens.
Find out what hospital he's in and call them.
See if there's anything we can do to help.
You're welcome.
Good-bye.
That was Mr. Gaines from his newspaper.
He said to tell him to take it easy and not to worry about a thing.
Which, of course, you will not tell him, on the chance it is some sort of prearranged code.
- Comrade Zilkov?
- Yes?
Yen Lo.
Pavlov Institute?
Doctor, an honor and a pleasure.
You may go.
When did you arrive?
I was flown in last night under embassy quota.
Revolting journey.
Ah, Raymond.
Nice to see you again.
It's nice to see you again, sir.
We're going through this elaborate procedure simply out of precaution, in case there are any visitors.
Although I cannot imagine who will visit Raymond.
Attractive plant you have here.
Thank you, Doctor.
It's actually a rest home for wealthy alcoholics.
We were able to purchase it three years ago.
Except for this floor and the floor above it, which we have sealed off for security purposes, the rest functions quite normally.
In fact, it is one of the few
Soviet operations in America that actually showed a profit at the end of the last fiscal year.
Profit? Fiscal year?
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.
Beware, my dear Zilkov.
The virus of capitalism is highly infectious.
Soon you'll be letting money out at interest.
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.
There's nothing like a good laugh now and then to lighten the burdens of the day.
Tell me, Raymond.
Do you remember murdering
Mavole and Lembeck?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Mavole and Lembeck.
The men who were lost on the patrol.
Can you recall what happened to them?
Yes, sir.
It was a very clear action for a night action.
Captain Marco sent up some low flares so it was easy to see what was happening.
Bobby Lembeck got separated to the left.
Mavole went after him.
By the time he reached him, the enemy had a fix on the position.
They were killed instantly by a high mortar shell.
I don't think they ever knew what hit them.
Do you realize, Comrade, the implications of the weapon that has been placed at your disposal?
You may remove your head bandage, Raymond.
A normally conditioned American who has been trained to kill and then to have no memory of having killed.
Without memory of his deed, he cannot possibly feel guilt.
Nor will he, of course, have any reason to fear being caught.
And having been relieved of those uniquely
American symptoms, guilt and fear, he cannot possibly give himself away.
Ah, our Raymond will remain an outwardly normal, productive, sober and respected member of the community.
And I should say, if properly used, entirely police-proof.
His brain has not only been washed, as they say, it has been dry-cleaned.
Thank you, Raymond.
You may replace your head bandage.
Sealed floors or no, you will, of course, permit him to have visitors, uh, to avoid suspicion.
Of course.
A team of my specialists is being flown in tonight.
It will take about a week, working between visiting hours, to check the mechanism out completely.
It's been, after all, two years since the conditioning took place, and you want to be sure the linkages are still functioning correctly before he is turned over to his American operator.
And now, Comrade, if you will excuse me.
Where are you going?
Since there is nothing more I can do until my specialists arrive,
I had thought to spend the afternoon at Macy's.
Madam Yen has given me the most appalling list.
No, no.
I personally guarantee it.
He's ready to be turned over to his American operator.
And I, being personally responsible for Soviet security in the entire Eastern Seaboard of the United States, refuse to turn him over to his operator until at least one practical test has been run.
You say the man has been built as an assassin.
Very well, then.
Let him assassinate someone.
I'm shocked that a security officer with the responsibility you hold would risk a mechanism as valuable as Raymond out of sheer nervousness.
You yourself admit the man has not killed for over two years.
I assure you, Doctor, conditions offering minimum risk can be arranged.
All right, if you insist on this foolishness, have him kill one of your own people here on a sealed floor.
I would. I would, gladly.
But our table of organization happens to be under acceptable strength as it is.
Why can't we be reasonable about this?
Why can't he kill some nonproductive person on the outside?
Very well then.
But for his own protection, he must be instructed that if he is ever, at any time, discovered at the scene of an assignment, this other person or persons must also be killed.
All right, all right, Doctor.
Whom do you think he should kill?
With humor, my dear Zilkov.
Always with a little humor.
If kill we must for a better New York, why should it not be his superior at the newspaper,
Mr... Holborn Gaines?
With Mr. Gaines out of the way, might he not then be given that very influential job himself?
Who's there?
It's me, Mr. Gaines.
Raymond.
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
Don't get any silly ideas about this ridiculous-looking bed jacket.
It was my wife's.
It's the warmest thing I have.
Perfect for reading in bed at night.
I didn't know you were married, sir.
She died nearly six years ago.
But what the devil are you doing here at 4:00 in the morning?
Anyway, I thought you were in the hospital.
Oh, now, don't tell me that you've come here at this ridiculous hour to talk something over?
You're not gonna pour out your heart with the details of some sordid love affair or anything like that, are you?
No, sir.
As a matter of fact, they told me you'd be asleep.
Who told you I'd be asleep?
They did.
"They"?
"They"?
Who's this mysterious "they"?
Raymond?
Answer me, my boy.
- Colonel.
- Ben. May I come in for a minute?
Oh, please do.
Of course. Come on in.
Uh, may I ask the colonel,
"A," is this an official visit?
And "B," may I, uh, mix you a drink?
"A," yes, it is, and "B," you certainly may.
- Scotch all right?
- Fine.
My God, where do you get all the books?
Oh, I, uh... I got a guy picks them out for me.
At random.
- Water all right?
- Fine.
He's in, uh, San Francisco.
A little bookstore up there.
He ships 'em to me wherever I happen to be stationed.
- You read them all?
- Yeah.
They'd also make great insulation against an enemy attack.
But the, uh, truth of the matter is that I'm just interested, you know, in, uh, The Principles of Modern Banking, and History of Piracy,
Paintings of Orozco,
Modern French Theater,
The Jurisprudential Factor
of Mafia Administration,
Diseases of Horses, the novels of Joyce Cary and... ethnic choices of the Arabs... things like that.
- Ben.
- Sir.
The army's got a lot of things wrong with it, but it does take care of its own people.
Which is why I'm here.
As a public relations officer, you're a disaster.
I never wanted the jo...
Apparently, among other things, you permitted the secretary to make a number of unfortunate remarks to that idiot Iselin, which started him off on a rampage.
Mickey, listen to me, please.
For the last six months I've been driven nearly out of my mind by this same recurring dream.
The medical officer in charge offered...
What the hell does the medical corps know about intelligence work, Milt?
I tell you, there's something phony going on.
There's something phony about me, about Raymond Shaw, about the whole
Medal of Honor business.
For instance, when the psychiatrist asked me how I felt about Raymond Shaw, how I personally felt about him, and how the whole patrol felt about him, did you hear what I said?
Did you really hear what I said?
I said, Raymond Shaw is the kindest, warmest, bravest, most wonderful human being
I have ever known in my life.
And even now I feel that way, this minute.
And yet somewhere in the back of my mind, something tells me it's not true.
It's just not true.
It isn't as if Raymond's hard to like.
He's impossible to like.
In fact, he's probably one of the most repulsive human beings
I've ever known in my whole... all of my life.
Ben, what I came to tell you is, public relations has bounced you back to me.
And in your present state there's no possible way I can use you.
As of this moment,
I'm placing you on indefinite sick leave.
Go away, Ben.
Find yourself a girl.
Lie in the sun.
I absolutely refuse.
You don't seem to understand.
What I've just told you is not a suggestion, Major.
It is an order.
Yes, sir.
Good night, Ben.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all. Please do.
Maryland's a beautiful state.
- This is Delaware.
- I know.
I was one of the original Chinese workmen who laid the track on this stretch.
But, um, nonetheless,
Maryland is a beautiful state.
So is Ohio, for that matter.
I guess so.
Columbus is a tremendous football town.
- You in the railroad business?
- Not anymore.
However, if you will permit me to point out, when you ask that question, you really should say,
"Are you in the railroad line?"
Where's your home?
I'm in the army.
I'm a major.
I've been in the army most of my life.
We move a good deal.
I was born in New Hampshire.
I went to a girls' camp once on Lake Francis.
That's pretty far north.
Yeah.
What's your name?
Eugenie.
Pardon?
No kidding. I really mean it.
Crazy French pronunciation and all.
- It's pretty.
- Well, thank you.
I guess your friends call you Jennie?
Not yet, they haven't, for which I am deeply grateful.
But you may call me Jennie.
What do your friends call you?
Rosie.
Why?
My full name is Eugenie Rose.
Of the two names,
I've always favored Rosie because it smells of brown soap and beer.
Eugenie is somehow more fragile.
Still, when I asked you what your name was, you said it was Eugenie.
It's quite possible I was feeling more or less fragile at that instant.
I could never figure out what that phrase meant, "more or less."
- Are you Arabic?
- No.
My name is Ben.
It's really Bennett.
I was named after Arnold Bennett.
- The writer?
- No.
A lieutenant colonel.
He was my father's commanding officer at the time.
- What's your last name?
- Marco.
Major Marco.
Are you Arabic?
No. No.
Let me put it another way.
Are you married?
No.
- You?
- No.
- What's your last name?
- Cheyney.
I'm production assistant for a man named Justin who had two hits last season.
I live on 54th Street, a few doors from the Modern Museum of Art, of which I am a tea-privileges member, no cream.
I live at 53 West 54th Street.
Apartment 3B.
Can you remember that?
Yes.
Eldorado 5-9970.
Can you remember that?
Yes.
Are you stationed in New York?
Or is "stationed" the right word?
I'm not exactly stationed in New York.
I was stationed in Washington.
But I got sick and now I'm on leave and I'm gonna s-spend it in New York.
Eldorado 5-9970.
I'm gonna look up an old friend of mine who's a newspaper man.
We were in Korea together.
Mr. Shaw, there's a gentleman outside to see you.
- A gentleman?
- An Oriental gentleman, sir.
He said he was in the army with you.
There were no Oriental gentlemen in the army with me.
He is very insistent, sir.
All right, all right, show him in.
I am Chunjin, Mr. Shaw, sir.
I was interpreter attached to Charlie Company,
52nd Regiment.
Yes, I remember you.
You were the guide and interpreter to the patrol.
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.
What can I do for you?
I mean to say, what are you doing here?
Your father did not say to you?
- My father?
- Yes.
Senator Iselin. I...
Senator Iselin is not my father.
Repeat. He is not my father.
If you learn nothing else on your visit to this country, memorize that fact.
I write to Senator Iselin.
I tell him how I interpret your outfit.
I tell him I want to come to America.
He get me visa.
Now I need job.
A job?
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.
But, my dear fellow, we don't need interpreters here.
We all speak the same language.
I am tailor and mender.
I am cook. I drive car.
I am cleaner and scrubber.
I fix anything. I take message.
I sleep at house of my cousin.
I ask for job with you because you are great man who save my life.
I could use a valet, I think.
And I would like having a cook.
A good cook, I mean.
Very well.
You can live at your cousin's.
I will pay you $60 a week.
You will have every Thursday and every other Sunday off.
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.
I'm leaving for Washington in a few minutes.
I'll be back here this evening by 8:30.
I would like to have dinner waiting.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.
Just like United State Army.
Oh, God, I hope not.
You're going to be perfectly marvelous in there this afternoon, hon.
I just know you are.
Yeah.
There's just one thing, babe.
I'd be a lot happier if we could just settle on the number of Communists
I know there are in the Defense Department.
I mean, the way you keep changing the figures on me all the time, it makes me look like some kind of a nut, I-like an idiot.
The boys are even startin' to kid me about it.
Why, just yesterday, in the cloakroom they said, "Hey, Johnny"...
Well, you're going to look like an even bigger idiot if you don't get in there and do exactly what you're told.
Babe.
Who are they writing about all over this country?
And what are they saying?
Are they saying, Are there any Communists in the Defense Department?
Of course not.
They're saying, How many Communists are there in the Defense Department?
So just stop talking like an expert all of a sudden and get out there and say what you're supposed to say.
Aw, come on, babe, I...
I'm sorry, hon.
Would it really make it easier for you if we settled on just one number?
Yeah.
Just one real simple number that'd be easy for me to remember.
There are exactly 57 card-carrying members of the Communist Party... in the Department of Defense at this time.
Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
Point of order, if you please.
What was Raymond doing with his hands?
How did the old ladies turn into Russians?
What was Raymond doing with his hands?
How did the old ladies turn into Russians?
What was Raymond doing with his hands?
What were you doing there?
What was Raymond doing with his hands?
What were you doing there?
Get away...
What were you doing there?
Well, I must say it was original of you to have the police department call so shyly and ask for our first date.
Well, they asked me who would... who I'd be willing to c...
I know.
And thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- Bueno.
Sí. Uh-huh.
Okay. Uh-huh.
I've got to find Raymond.
Maybe he's home by now.
All right, darling.
Whatever you want.
But first, I have something to tell you.
You know what I was doing when you so cleverly had the police call me?
Don't bother trying to guess.
You're too tired.
I'll tell you what I was doing.
After I dropped you off,
I went straight home, and when I got upstairs...
- Apartment 3B.
- That's right.
Very good.
Before I even took my coat off,
I telephoned my fiancé.
I told you I wasn't married.
I never said I wasn't engaged.
Well, I called up my fiancé and he came over as soon as he could, which was instantly, and I told him I had just met you, and I gave him his ring back.
I tried to convey my regrets for whatever pain
I might be causing him, and then, just then, you had the police call to invite me to meet you at the 24th Precinct.
So I grabbed my coat, kissed my fiancé on the cheek for the last time in our lives we would ever kiss, and I ran.
At the police station, they told me you had just beaten up a very large Chinese gentleman.
Not Chinese, dear. Korean.
At least I think he was Korean.
A very large Korean gentleman.
But that you were a pretty solid type yourself, according to Washington, with whom they had apparently checked.
So I figured if they were willing to go to all the trouble to get a comment on you out of George Washington, why, you must be somebody very important indeed.
And I must say it was rather sweet of the general, with you only a major.
I didn't even know you knew him.
If they were the tiniest bit puzzled about you, they could've asked me.
Oh, yes, indeed, my darling Ben, they could've asked me, and I would've told them.
- Hi, kid.
- What in the hell's going on?
They called me in Washington to tell me that you'd broken into my apartment and beaten up my houseboy.
Yeah, well, uh, you see, Chunjin, when I...
My God, you look terrible.
I mean, I've never seen you look so awful.
Yeah.
Raymond, uh,
I want to tell you that I been having this terrible nightmare.
I've been in the army 19 years.
First time I've ever seen one of these.
I've been havin' this nightmare.
A real swinger of a nightmare too.
It has to do with, uh, all kinds of strange people.
Is it about a Russian general and some Chinese and me and the men who were on the patrol?
How did you know that?
How do you know?
Take your hands off me.
Please, Raymond.
Tell me.
How did you know?
- I don't really know anything about it at all.
- But you just started to tell me...
You remember Al Melvin?
- The corporal in the patrol?
- Yes, of course.
Well, I had a letter from him a couple of weeks ago.
Needless to say,
I was very surprised to hear from him.
You know how much the guys in the outfit hated me.
Not as much as I hated them, of course.
Well, anyway, the funny thing was, he said in his letter that I was the best friend he had in the army.
I was the best friend he had in the army.
Why, the poor, simple boob.
Anyway, that's what he wanted to tell me... about his nightmare.
- He said he was going out of his mind.
- Raymond.
Tell me what he said about the nightmare.
Well, he keeps dreaming that the patrol is all sitting together in this hotel lobby, and there are a lot of Chinese brass and Russian generals and I don't know.
Anyway, what's so much of a nightmare about that?
The letter.
Have you got the letter?
No, I don't.
I never keep letters.
That's all he wrote?
That was the end of it?
Why? Is it the same thing that you've been dreaming?
Raymond, do something for me, will you?
Call Eldorado 5-9970.
If a young lady answers, and she will, tell her I've gone to Washington.
The town, not the general.
Tell her I'll be in touch with her as quickly as I can.
You'll do that, won't you?
Eldorado 5-9970.
To take some of the mystery out of it, Major, the photographs you're looking at are shots of male models,
Mexican circus performers,
Czech research chemists,
Japanese criminals,
French headwaiters,
Turkish wrestlers, pastoral psychiatrists and, of course, various officials of the USSR, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Army.
- Hold the one on the right, please.
- Hold that one.
Hold this one too, please.
Exactly one hour ago, your friend, Mr. Alan Melvin, in Wainright, Alaska, made the same two photographs.
This one here wore sunglasses.
Smelled like a goat.
His mustache was a little thinner then.
He had a loud voice and it grated.
He's about 5'11", on the heavy side.
Uniformed as a lieutenant general.
His staff were dressed in civilian clothes.
They looked a little like FBI men.
His name, incidentally, is Berezovo.
He's a member of the central committee.
This one was dressed in civilian clothes, but his staff was uniformed, bearing from a full colonel to a first lieutenant.
They wore political markings.
Lights.
All right, Ben.
I'm going to recommend setting up a joint intelligence CIA-FBI unit based out of New York.
You'll work with them, representing the army.
- Your assignment's Raymond Shaw.
- Very good, Colonel.
Should be a very pleasant assignment, Major, considering that Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being you've ever met in your life.
My mother, Ben, is a terrible woman.
A terrible, terrible woman.
Chunjin.
Chunjin.
We would like some more wine.
Chunjin!
Oh, I forgot.
After you called,
I... I gave Chunjin the night off.
~ On the first day of Christmas ~
Because it was Christmas Eve,
I told him.
He was very reluctant to go.
~ A partridge in a pear tree ~
That's probably because he's a Buddhist and he doesn't celebrate Christmas.
Uh-uh.
I don't think that Chunjin is a Buddhist.
Well, he smiles all the time.
Oh, what a shame.
I thought he was a Buddhist.
Otherwise I would have sent him a Christmas card.
But I figured that if I sent him a card at this time of the year, then he would have to send me a card on the Buddha's birthday.
- To save face, right?
- Oh, right.
And that would have started a whole big megillah.
- Exactly.
- All right.
That's what...
You did exactly the right thing.
~ Two turtle doves ~
~ And a partridge in a pear tree ~
Twelve days of Christmas.
One day of Christmas is loathsome enough.
What were we saying?
Oh, yes, my mother.
Oh, but you don't want to sit there, listening to me talking about my mother.
Of course I do. I'm interested.
It's rather like listening to Orestes gripe about Clytemnestra.
- Who?
- Greeks.
- A couple of Greeks in a play.
- Oh.
Well, you know, Ben, it's a terrible thing to hate your mother.
But I didn't always hate her.
No. When I was a child,
I... I only kind of disliked her.
But after what she did to Jocie and me, that's when I began to hate her.
Jocie?
Jocie Jordan.
- Senator Jordan's daughter.
- Hmm.
That's pretty funny, isn't it?
Thomas Jordan's daughter and Johnny Iselin's stepson.
That's her.
Jocie.
- She's lovely.
- I always keep her picture.
Years later, I realized, Ben, that I am not very lovable.
No, no, don't contradict me.
I am not lovable.
Some people are lovable, and other people are not lovable.
I am not lovable.
Oh, but I was very lovable with Jocie.
Ben, you cannot believe how lovable I was.
In a way.
And, of course, my mother fixed all that.
Ben, you don't blame me for hating my mother, do you?
I'm not making excuses, but I have been even less lovable than I was since.
It was the summer just before I went into the army.
And I was bitten by this snake.
Are you following me?
I am.
Well, while I was lying there, absolutely helpless, afraid to move... because you're not supposed to move.
It-It makes the poison circulate.
When unexpectedly, there she was with a razor blade in her hand.
My daddy's going to be so pleased about this.
I mean, he's just absolutely scared tiddly about snakes in this part of the country.
I know that sounds terribly Freudian and everything, but in this case, I don't think it is.
I mean, I think he's just simply and uncomplicatedly afraid of snakes, period.
Which is why I happen to be riding around with a razor blade and a bottle of potassium permanganate solution.
You don't happen to have a handkerchief, do you?
Oh, no, of course you don't.
Well, I don't either.
I do have a Kleenex, but...
Oh, well.
Seriously, Daddy is going to be just thrilled about this.
All summer long he's been raving about snakes, and nobody's even seen one.
And now this.
I promise you one thing.
It may be a little uncomfortable for you.
But it's going to absolutely make his summer.
Now you just lie very still.
Don't move.
That's very important.
I'll be right back with the car in a minute.
You're lucky, young man, very lucky.
If I were to tell you the statistics on death by snakebite every year...
But in this case, I... I think...
Oh, there's no swelling above or below.
Hmm.
Normal.
Well, I must say, there's a good chance you're going to live.
You are not, by any chance, a mute, are you?
- No, sir.
- Oh. Well.
I want to thank you very much,
Miss... Miss...
- Jordan.
- Miss Jocelyn Jordan.
- How do you do?
- Hi.
And now, according to the quaint local custom, it's your turn to tell us what your name is.
My name is Raymond Shaw, sir.
How do you do, Raymond?
Is your place near here, Raymond?
Yes. It's that red house just across the lake.
- The Iselin house?
- My house.
It was my father's.
My father's dead. He left it to me.
We were told that that was the summer camp of Senator Iselin.
Johnny stays there sometimes, sir.
When he gets too drunk for my mother to allow him to be seen in Washington.
My dear, although we've done everything that modern science recommends, there is still the traditional folk remedy against snakebite which we haven't applied, so to be on the safe side...
Mrs. Iselin is your mother?
Yes, sir.
I once found it necessary to sue your mother for defamation of character and slander.
My name is Thomas Jordan.
Senator Thomas Jordan.
The Communist?
Well, one of your mother's more endearing traits is her tendency to refer to anyone who disagrees with her about anything as a Communist.
The last time she so referred to me on a network radio program, it cost her $65,000 and court costs.
What hurt her more than the money,
I think, was the fact that I donated all of it to an organization called the American Civil Liberties Union.
Senator Jordan?
Yes, Raymond.
I would very much like to ask your permission, sir, to marry Jocelyn.
We were together every minute after that.
You just cannot believe, Ben, how lovable the whole damn thing was.
All summer long we were together.
I was lovable.
Jocie was lovable.
The senator was lovable.
The days were lovable, the nights were lovable.
And everybody was lovable except, of course, my mother.
Raymond?
What is it, Mother?
What sort of a greeting is that at 3:30 in the morning?
It's a quarter to 3:00, and what do you want?
I want to talk to you, Raymond.
About what?
I would like to talk to you about that Communist tart.
Shut up with that, Mother!
Shut up!
Do you know what Jordan is?
Are you out to crucify me, to crucify Johnny?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't want to know.
- I'm going to bed.
- Raymond.
Sit down.
How would you see her?
They live in New York.
I'm getting a job in New York.
You have your army service.
Next spring.
I might be dead by next spring.
Raymond, if we were at war and you were suddenly to become infatuated with the daughter of a Russian agent, wouldn't you expect me to come to you and object and beg you to stop the entire thing before it was too late?
Well, we are at war.
It's a cold war, but it will get worse and worse until every man, woman and child in this country will have to stand up and be counted and say whether they are on the side of right and freedom or on the side of the Thomas Jordans of this country.
I will go with you to Washington.
Tomorrow, if you like.
And I will show you documented proof that this man stands for evil, that he is evil and that his whole life was devoted to undermining everything that you and I and Johnny and every freedom-minded American...
She won, of course.
She always does.
I could never beat her.
I still can't.
I wrote a letter.
Or she wrote it and I signed it.
I-I can't even remember which.
It was a terrible, vile, disgusting letter.
The next day I enlisted in the army and I never saw her again.
God knows, Ben, I...
I'm not lovable, but I loved her.
I did love her.
I do love her.
Come on, kid.
It's time for you to call it a night.
Come on.
So this lousy brother-in-law of mine,
I say to him, "You think you're a poker player?
Well, I got a flash for you.
You ain't no poker player."
So I says to him,
"My advice to you, from the bottom of the heart...
Don't play poker.
If I was you, I'd get myself another line of action.
Why don't you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?"
- So he says to me...
- I need a deck of cards, please.
When I get married to my old lady,
I got no idea that this guy comes in the same package, that it's a package deal.
And for 11 long years,
I got this crumb tied around my neck.
And believe me, it's no bargain.
You got no idea what kind of a problem I got with this guy.
Beer, please.
Sorry I'm late, kid.
Got held up in traffic, you know?
So, I says to him,
"Please, do me a favor, will you?
Why don't you go and take yourself a cab and go up to Central Park and go jump in the lake?"
Hey. Raymond!
Hey.
Raymond.
Get out of there.
What are you doing?
- Hi, Ben.
- What the hell are you doing?
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I was standing next to you at the bar, and you were playing a game of solitaire.
Do you remember that?
Then you bolted out of the bar, jumped in a cab, drove up here to the park and jumped into the water.
I don't remember, Ben.
I just don't remember.
Wait a minute. I do. I remember.
In the dream.
I remember what you were doing with your hands.
You were...
Of course.
Obviously the solitaire game serves as some kind of trigger mechanism.
Black seven on the red eight.
I suggest we discard the various number systems and concentrate on the face cards.
- Red six on the black seven.
- Thanks a lot.
Because of their symbolic identification with human beings.
Based on Raymond's psychiatric pattern,
I think we can safely eliminate jacks and kings.
Black six on the red seven.
Why don't you try it for a while?
Human fish swimming at the bottom of the great ocean of atmosphere develop psychic injuries as they collide with one another.
Most mortal of all are those gotten from the parent fish.
Queen of diamonds on the black king.
Hey, what are you doing?
To cheat at solitaire is a form of regression that...
I remember.
I remember.
I can see that Chinese cat standin' there smilin' like Fu Manchu and saying,
"The queen of diamonds is reminiscent in many ways of Raymond's dearly loved and hated mother and is the second key to clear the mechanism for any other assignment."
Yeah.
"...our great republic... repeat 'republic'... until the peril of international Communism is driven from every dark corner of this great nation."
Getting a little chucky on the chin.
You know what I mean?
You know, hon, I can't tell you how worried I am about Raymond.
Raymond? What Raymond?
Raymond Shaw.
My son. Your stepson.
I've been thinking about him a great deal lately, and you know what I've decided?
- No.
- I've decided it's time he got married.
Hmm.
May I ask what you find so amusing?
Who could you possibly find who would marry Raymond?
I have devoted considerable thought to the problem, and it has occurred to me that Tom Jordan's daughter Jocelyn...
You remember her, hon?
That mousy little girl Raymond was so attracted to that summer at the lake.
Oh, yeah, that little Communist tart?
All right.
- So I might have been a little bit hasty.
- A little in the hairline here.
Anyway, times change. I now think she would make Raymond an excellent wife.
She's been living in Paris for the past two years.
I have word she'll be coming home soon.
And when she does,
I think we should give a little party.
But, babe, I thought that you and Senator Jordan...
I keep telling you not to think.
You're very, very good at a great many things, but thinking, hon, just simply isn't one of them.
You just keep shouting, "Point of order, point of order" into the television cameras, and I'll handle the rest.
Jimmy. Bourbon and water.
I think a June wedding would be nice, right before the convention.
Raymond, I don't know why yours is the only apartment in New York City without an air conditioner.
Sometimes I think you came to us from another century.
Chu Chin Chow, or whatever your name is, the steaks are to be broiled for exactly 11 minutes.
No more, no less, on each side in a preheated grill at 400 degrees.
Yes, ma'am.
- Raymond?
- Mother?
- May I ask a question?
- Of course.
What are you doing here?
I mean, why are we having our annual meeting?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, when I got your message announcing that you were coming to lunch,
I naturally assumed it was because you wanted something.
Not at all.
This is a purely social event.
- However...
- Ah.
The "however."
As you may or may not have heard,
Johnny and I are giving an enormous party.
A costume ball, actually, at the summer house on Long Island.
I wondered if you'd like to attend.
Have you gone out of your mind?
The reason I ask is because we're giving it in honor of an old friend of yours and her father.
What old friend?
Do you remember a darling girl we met the summer before you went into the army...
Jocelyn Jordan,
Senator Jordan's daughter?
Well, she's been living abroad for the last several years.
She arrived back in New York a week or so ago.
And I thought, considering the rather shabby way you treated her, it might be a rather gracious gesture if I gave her a coming home party.
Jocie and her father... coming to a party of yours?
Of course.
Once I explained to her you would be there.
It's all right. It's Polish caviar.
- Johnny? Come over here, hon.
- Hmm?
Come on, get a picture. Quick.
You stand in the middle.
- Great. You look marvelous.
- Thank you. See you later.
- Where is she? Have they come?
- They'll be here any minute.
Are you sure they're coming, Mother?
Are you absolutely sure?
Oh, Raymond, don't be such a jerk.
Go and get yourself a drink or a tranquilizer or something.
Raymond can certainly be a royal pain.
Ah, she's just kiddin'.
Ray, you look great. Look just great.
What are... What are you supposed to be, one of those Dutch skaters?
Raymond, darling.
Raymond, dear, why do you always have to look as if your head's just about to come to a point?
Now just be patient, and she'll be here.
I guarantee it.
Raymond, why don't we just sneak away for a few minutes and sit down somewhere quietly and have a drink?
Are you absolutely sure she's coming, Mother?
I told you, she telephoned me
20 minutes ago from the hotel.
Mother... Mother, how did she sound?
Like a girl.
Raymond.
Why don't you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?
Tom!
Oh, Tom. Oh, Tom, boy.
Tom boy, so great you could come.
I am here at this fascist rally because my daughter has assured me that it was important to her happiness that I come.
There is no other reason.
Good old Tom.
Raymond?
The time has come for us to have a serious discussion.
We feel...
- What is it?
- It's me, babe. Johnny.
Tom Jordan's here. I need you.
I'll be right out.
- Who's in there with you, anyway?
- Raymond.
Well, hurry it up, will you?
We've got work to do out here.
I'll take this one with me, dear.
It might be mischief if I leave it.
Yes, Mother.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I've been watching you through the window.
When I saw you, my heart almost shot out of my body.
I sent Daddy around the front way.
I had to see you alone.
Jocie.
Oh, Jocie.
He's got it!
Thank you.
Come on, lover.
Why don't you just take that somewhere very quietly and drink it?
But, babe, I...
All right, dear. Run along.
The grown-ups have to talk.
Huh?
How good of you to come, Tom.
I have explained to your husband why I am here.
Tom, I know you have very strong personal feelings about Johnny and about me.
What I would like to find out is how strong they really are.
To put it as simply as possible, if Johnny's name were put forward at the convention next week, would you attempt to block him?
You're joking, of course.
Mr. Stevenson makes jokes.
I do not.
You're seriously trying for the nomination for Johnny?
No. We couldn't make it.
But I think he has a good chance for the second spot.
I've answered your question, but you haven't answered mine.
- What question?
- Will you block us?
Will I block you?
I would spend every cent I own and all I could borrow to block you.
There are people who think of Johnny as a clown and a buffoon, but I do not.
I despise John Iselin and everything that Iselinism has come to stand for.
I think if John Iselin were a paid Soviet agent, he could not do more to harm this country than he is doing now.
You asked me a question.
Very well. I'll answer you.
If you attempt to deal with the delegates or cause Johnny's name to be brought forward on the ticket, or if in my canvass of the delegates tomorrow morning by telephone
I find that you are so acting,
I will bring impeachment proceedings against your husband on the floor of the United States Senate.
And I will hit him, I promise you, with everything in my well-documented book.
For one million bucks, pick a card.
Oh, Bennie, card tricks.
If I had known that...
Oh, come on. Pick a card.
The queen of diamonds.
That's pretty good.
How did you do that?
This is what is known, my dear girl, as a forced deck.
This deck of cards is often employed by a professional magician to simplify his problem of guessing the card picked by the little old lady in the third row.
Also employed by army intelligence officers who...
- Rosie?
- Hmm?
Let's get married.
We certainly are in good spirits tonight, aren't we?
Yes, we are.
Tomorrow's the big day.
Lunch with Raymond, have a nice little game of solitaire and a nice long chat about the good old days in Korea.
And some old Chinese and Russian friends of ours.
Then a suggestion or two that'll rip out all of the wiring.
And then, dear girl, it's over.
All over.
- What's the matter? Don't you want to?
- Want to what?
Get married. Why don't you pay attention to me when I speak to you?
Oh, Bennie, I want to marry you more than I want to go on eating Italian food, which will give you some idea.
Well, then why don't we get with it, kiddo?
You know, arranging for the papers, for the blood test, posting the banns, figure out what we're gonna name the kids, renting the rice, buy the ring, call the folks.
Folks?
- You neither?
- Mm-mmm.
- Orphan?
- Uh-huh.
I used to be convinced that as a baby
I was the soul survivor of a spaceship that overshot Mars.
Very sexy stuff.
Very, very sexy.
- Ben.
- Hello, Raymond.
Ben, I want...
I want you to meet Jocie.
Remember, I told you about her?
Uh, this is my friend, Major Ben Marco.
- Miss Jordan.
- How do you do, Major?
Only it's not Miss Jordan anymore, it's Mrs. Shaw.
- Mrs. Raymond Shaw.
- We flew to Maryland last night.
We got married. We just got back.
Well, aren't you going to pop champagne, or dance in the streets, or, well, at least kiss the bride?
- Congratulations, Mrs. Shaw.
- Thank you, Major.
My God, Ben, isn't she beautiful though?
Isn't she?
And am I not the luckiest guy in the world?
I mean, the whole world?
You don't have to answer that, Major.
Anyway, I'm the one who's lucky.
- Raymond.
- Listen, darling.
There must be some beer or champagne or penicillin eyedrops or some anchovies in the ice box.
Crack open whatever it is. The three of us, we've absolutely got to have a drink.
Come on, bustle.
Make like a housewife.
I'll get out of this idiot suit.
Ben. Ben you should've seen the judge's face.
There we were, the queen of diamonds and me looking like...
I don't know, like "Gaucho" Marx.
Gaucho Marx?
Ben? Ben, I just made a joke.
Not a very good joke,
I admit, but a joke.
Ben, in all the years that you've known me, have you ever heard me make a joke?
Well, I just made one. Gaucho Marx.
Me. Ha.
Big day.
Mark that down in your book.
Raymond Shaw got married, and he made a joke.
Gaucho Marx.
The queen of diamonds?
What did he mean, the queen of diamonds?
My costume. I came to this costume party as the queen of diamonds.
I couldn't think what to wear, then I saw this big playing card in a shop window on 67th...
- Mrs. Shaw.
- Oh, please, Major. Jocie.
You call me Jocie, I'll call you Ben.
Mrs. Shaw... Jocie, the reason I came here this morning is to ask
Raymond to voluntarily put himself under arrest.
What?
Well, maybe not under arrest.
That's pretty strong.
But to surrender himself for some questioning.
Questioning?
What kind of questioning?
Raymond is sick, Mrs. Shaw, in a kind of a special way.
- He doesn't even realize it himself.
- Sick? He's not sick.
He's the healthiest man
I've ever seen in my whole life.
You can tell that by just looking at him.
That's not the kind of sick I mean.
Oh, you're wrong, Ben.
You're wrong.
He's tied up inside in a thousand knots. I know that.
But you can see for yourself how he is with me.
Oh, God.
Ben, we were married just six hours ago.
We've been in cars and offices and airplanes ever since.
What were your... What are your plans?
Well, there's an inn,
Bedford House, near Bedford Village.
It's about an hour from here.
There's hardly anyone there this early in the season.
We've already wired for a room.
Ben, you've got to believe me and trust me.
I can make him well.
I'll give you 48 hours.
You have him back here day after tomorrow.
I'll talk to him then.
After that, we'll see.
Oh, thank you, Ben.
Thank you and God bless you.
Darling.
What?
Nothing.
Just darling.
Mmm.
My dear girl, have you noticed that the human race is divided into two distinct and irreconcilable groups?
Those who walk into rooms and automatically turn television sets on, and those who walk into rooms and automatically turn them off.
You know, the problem is, they usually marry each other, which naturally causes a great deal...
The elopement of Jocelyn Jordan,
daughter of Senator Thomas Jordan,
and Korean war hero Raymond Shaw,
stepson of Senator John Iselin.
- It appears, however...
- My Romeo.
that this Montague-Capulet note
will have little effect on the feud
now raging
between the two party leaders.
From his campaign headquarters
this morning,
Senator Iselin stepped up his charges
against the leader of the group
attempting to block his nomination.
I now charge this man, Thomas Jordan,
with high treason.
And I assure you,
the moment the Senate reconvenes,
I shall move for this man Jordan's
impeachment!
And after that, a civil trial.
Come on. Get dressed.
We're driving down to New York.
Go straight to your father's house.
Please convey my personal apologies to him.
I'll join you there later.
What are you going to do?
...that Thomas Jordan represents...
Something I should've done a long time ago.
I'm going to beat that vile, slandering son of a numskull to a bloody pulp!
Mother!
That vile, slandering husband of yours!
Where is he?
Darling, something very important has come up.
There is something you have to do.
Who is it?
- It's me, sir.
- Raymond, my boy!
Jocie waited up as long as she could.
She turned in about a quarter to 2:00.
She told me the good news.
- Raymond?
- Yes, sir.
I want to offer my congratulations and welcome you to the family.
I've been watching my daughter's face all evening.
She's a very happy girl.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come with me.
I'll force some good whiskey on you to celebrate your wedding, soothe you after a trying day, any number of good reasons.
There's some whiskey in that cabinet beside you.
Help yourself.
I only hope you haven't been too much upset by these idiotic attacks of Iselin.
Actually, I take the position that any attack by Iselin is a great honor.
Actually, I haven't had so much supporting mail in the Senate in the last 22 years.
I'm very glad to hear that, sir.
What the hell is that in your hand?
It's a pistol, sir.
Is that a silencer?
Yes, sir.
Why are you carrying a pistol?
Raymond, what are you...
Daddy, what is it?
Raymond, no! Raymond, darling.
Ben?
Ben, what is it?
Raymond Shaw shot and killed his wife early this morning.
But i-it doesn't say...
I know.
It wasn't Raymond that really did it.
In a way, it was me.
As you can well understand, gentlemen, my... my wife is prostrate over the loss of this dear and wonderful girl whom she loved as a daughter.
And your stepson, Senator, where is he?
My... My son Raymond's in retreat, praying for strength, understanding to... to try and carry on somehow.
Ben, it's for you.
Major Marco speaking.
Ben?
Hi, kid.
How could anyone...
Jocie.
- How could it happen?
- Where are you, Raymond?
I...
I think maybe I'm going crazy.
I'm having terrible dreams like you used to have and...
Where are you, Raymond?
We can't talk on the telephone.
Just tell me where you are.
Uh... I...
I'm in a hotel room across from the Garden.
Eighth Avenue side.
Room 4.
All right. Now listen to me.
Just wait right there.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Don't move. Just wait right there.
Okay, I'll take him now.
Everything's got to move quite normally.
Now, I want him to feel like he's safe.
Just give me a pack of cards.
What do you know?
They just handed the vice presidential nomination to that idiot Iselin.
Oh.
Hi, kid.
Who killed Jocie, Ben?
Tell me. I... I've got to know.
How about passing the time by playing a little solitaire?
All right.
Now let's start unlocking a few doors.
Let's begin with the patrol.
You didn't save our lives and take out an enemy company or anything like that, did you, Raymond?
Did you?
- No.
- What happened?
The patrol was taken by a Russian airborne unit and flown by helicopter across the Manchurian border to a place called Tonghua.
We were worked on for three days by a team of specialists from the Pavlov Institute in Moscow.
They've developed a technique for descent into the unconscious mind... part light-induced and part drug.
Never mind all that. Not now.
Tell me what else happened at Tonghua.
We were drilled for three days.
We were made to memorize the details of the imaginary action.
What else?
And I strangled Ed Mavole and shot Bobby Lembeck.
One red queen works pretty good.
Let's see what we get with two of 'em.
Keep playing.
Then I killed Mr. Gaines.
It was just a test.
It didn't matter who I killed.
They picked him to see if all the linkages still worked before they turned me over to my American operator.
And that business about jumping in the lake?
It really did happen.
It was an accident.
Something somebody said in the bar accidentally triggered it.
Keep playing.
Then I killed Senator Jordan and after that, I...
You are to forget everything that happened at the senator's house.
Do you understand, Raymond?
You'll only remember it when I tell you so.
You are to forget about it.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Now, Raymond, now the big one.
Why... Why is all of this being done?
What have they built you to do?
I don't know.
I don't think anybody really knows except Berezovo in Moscow and my American operator here.
Well, whatever it is, it's supposed to happen soon.
Right at the convention.
Maybe it...
I don't know.
They can make me do anything,
Ben, can't they?
Anything.
We'll see, kid.
We'll see what they can do and we'll see what we can do.
So the red queen is our baby.
Well, take a look at this, kid.
Fifty-two of them.
Take a good look at 'em, Raymond.
Look at 'em.
And while you're looking, listen.
This is me, Marco, talking.
Fifty-two red queens and me are telling you.
You know what we're telling you?
It's over.
The links, their beautifully conditioned links are smashed.
They're smashed as of now because we say so, because we say they are to be smashed.
We're bustin' up the joint.
We're tearing out all the wires.
We're busting it up so good, all the queen's horses and all the queen's men will never put old Raymond back together again.
You don't work anymore.
That's an order.
Anybody invites you to a game of solitaire, you tell 'em, "Sorry, buster.
The ball game is over."
It's time for my American operator to give me the plan.
Yes?
Yes, I understand, Mother.
She wants me to go.
There's a car waiting for me downstairs.
The convention's adjourned. It reconvenes at 9:00 for the acceptance speeches.
I don't think anything will happen until then.
I'd better go now.
Here's a number.
I've got 500 people at my disposal, a thousand if I need them.
You call me at that number.
Try to call me by 8:30.
Or as soon as you find out whatever it is they want you to do.
I'll be waiting.
Yes, sir.
Raymond.
Remember, Raymond, the wires have been pulled.
They can't touch you anymore.
You're free.
It's been decided that you will be dressed as a priest to help you get away in the pandemonium afterwards.
Chunjin will give you a two-piece
Soviet Army sniper's rifle that fits nicely into a special bag.
There's a spotlight booth that won't be in use.
It's up under the roof on the Eighth Avenue side of the Garden.
You will have absolutely clear, protected shooting.
You are to shoot the presidential nominee through the head, and Johnny will rise gallantly to his feet and lift Ben Arthur's body in his arms and stand in front of the microphones and begin to speak.
The speech is short, but it's the most rousing speech
I've ever read.
It's been worked on here and in Russia on and off for over eight years.
I shall force someone to take the body away from him.
Then Johnny will really hit those microphones and those cameras, with blood all over him, fighting off anyone who tries to help him, defending America even if it means his own death, rallying a nation of television viewers into hysteria to sweep us up into the White House with powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy.
Now, this is very important.
I want the nominee to be dead about two minutes after he begins his acceptance speech, depending on his reading time under pressure.
You are to hit him right at the point that he finishes the phrase,
"Nor would I ask of any fellow American in defense of his freedom that which I would not gladly give myself.
My life before my liberty."
Is that absolutely clear?
Would you repeat it for me, Raymond?
Nor would I ask of any fellow American...
- In defense of his freedom...
- in defense of his freedom...
- that which I would not gladly...
- that which I would not gladly give...
- give myself.
- myself.
- My life...
- My life...
- before my liberty.
- before my liberty.
I know you will never entirely comprehend this, Raymond, but you must believe
I did not know it would be you.
I served them.
I fought for them.
I'm on the point of winning for them the greatest foothold they will ever have in this country.
And they paid me back by taking your soul away from you.
I told them to build me an assassin.
I wanted a killer from a world filled with killers, and they chose you because they thought it would bind me closer to them.
But now we have come almost to the end.
One last step, and then when I take power, they will be pulled down and ground into dirt for what they did to you and what they did in so contemptuously underestimating me.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Testing.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Hit the lights. Lights.
Lights out.
Lights!
Why hasn't he called?
It was a calculated risk, Ben.
You were right to take it.
Even if it's not true, it's nice of you to say it.
The Garden's filling up.
Take it easy.
- I know.
If Steinkamp doesn't take off that stupid hat and stop messin' around with those broads,
I'm gonna bust him into a PFC.
Easy, Ben.
Okay, Milt, I blew it. I blew it!
My magic is better than your magic.
I should've known better.
Intelligence officer.
Stupidity officer is better.
If the Pentagon ever wants to open up a stupidity division, they know who they can get to lead it.
Well, Raymond was theirs.
He is theirs.
He'll always be theirs.
There's time. He may still call.
For money?
No.
That's what I figured.
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- All right, Ben. Let's go.
Milt, I tell you, you've got to stop this thing.
Stop it? How can I stop it?
On what evidence?
If there was a bomb planted here, you got a tip that there was, you'd stop it fast enough.
You'd empty the
White House if you had to.
I tell you, there's a bomb here, a time bomb that's just waiting to go off.
Ladies and gentlemen, our national anthem.
~ Oh, say, can you see ~
~ By the dawn's early light ~
~ What so proudly we hailed ~
~ At the twilight's last gleaming? ~
- ~ Whose broad stripes and bright stars ~
- Stop twitching.
Raymond has never missed with a rifle in his life.
~ Through the perilous fight ~
~ O'er the ramparts we watched ~
~ Were so gallantly streaming ~
~ And the rocket's red glare ~
~ The bombs bursting in air ~
~ Gave proof through the night ~
~ That our flag was still there ~
~ Oh, say does
that star-spangled banner ~
~ Yet wave ~
~ For the land of the free ~
We're in like Flynn, lover.
~ And the home ~
~ Of the brave ~~
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- All you have to do is take it easy.
I give you the next president of the United States,
Benjamin K. Arthur!
Mr. Chairman, delegates, my fellow Americans, it is with great humility, albeit with enormous pride and with a sense of the job to be done, that I most humbly and most gratefully accept this nomination for the highest office in our land.
It is with a full awareness that the four years that lie ahead for this country are, in a sense, the crucial years.
The years, if I may borrow
Mr. Churchill's phrase,
"the years of decision."
And, if I may be permitted a phrase of my own, the years of striving.
For it is not what has been done in the past, or what may be done against the far horizons of some distant future, but what will be done now.
...that you, my fellow Americans, have placed on my shoulders.
Nor will I ask of any fellow American in defense of his freedom...
Excuse me.
...that which I would not gladly give myself.
My life before my liberty!
You couldn't have stopped them.
The army couldn't have stopped them.
So I had to.
That's why I didn't call.
Oh, God, Ben.
Poor Raymond.
Poor friendless, friendless Raymond.
He was wearing his medal when he died.
You should read some of the citations some time.
Just read them.
"Taken eight prisoners, killing four enemy in the process, while one leg and one arm were shattered and he could only crawl because the other leg had been blown off.
Edwards.
Wounded five times, dragged himself across the direct fire of three enemy machine guns to pull two of his wounded men to safety amid 69 dead and 203 casualties.
Holderman."
Made to commit acts too unspeakable to be cited here by an enemy who had captured his mind and his soul.
He freed himself at last and, in the end, heroically and unhesitatingly gave his life to save his country.
Raymond Shaw.
Oh, hell!
Hell!
What happened?
Press the door button.
I think the electricity's off.
Where are you going, Louise?
I don't know. I just had to get out of there.
Mr. Haddock is grabby enough when the lights are on.
Hey, I could go in there and he'd think it was you.
This'll probably make me late for the theater.
What are you seeing?
Benefit.
The whole thing's deductible.
I know, but what are you seeing?
You know, that thing with what's-his-name.
Hey, there's a live one.
Go ahead, ask him.
You ask him.
Everybody's going to the boardroom in 2709.
The one with no windows?
We're having a party.
Want to come?
Tell him what kind.
It's a Braille party.
A what?
Braille. Get it?
The touch system.
Oh, well, thanks, but...
David.
Don't do that. Who is it?
Josephson. I just got a call to come up to C.C.'s office.
With all that inner holy light his eminence is radiating these days, he may not have noticed the blackout.
Stick around, it won't be long, we have a drinkie.
No chance. I've already passed on one orgy. I have to go.
Not me. We're marooned on a mountain, bubbie.
Whoever pulled that plug gave me a foolproof excuse for the wife.
Well, then that lets me out, bubbie, baby.
I haven't anyone to cheat.
I heard you were in a mood, sweetheart.
Well, don't take any wooden Indians. Ciao.
You know, I could be in a whole lot of trouble.
How come?
I was using that new machine, you know, the one I couldn't figure out?
Did you break it?
That wouldn't be so bad. I'm scared
I broke the whole building.
Would you help me, please?
It was foolish of me to start down alone in the dark.
It's like being buried alive.
I promise to behave myself.
Don't worry,
I can always scream for help.
Well, isn't it, though?
What?
A small world.
I heard you were back.
I really am very glad to see you.
If I could see you, that is.
Slow down a minute here.
You wouldn't happen to know why he did it, would you?
Cut off the electricity, I mean.
If it were anyone else I'd say it was a practical joke, but not the Major.
He never would have done...
Don't you ever stop to take a breath?
Look, I'm sorry, but I haven't been away.
I don't know any Major, and I'm afraid
I've never seen you before, either.
Believe me, I'd remember. but your voice... that's all right.
After 27 flights of stairs, we may wind up being old friends.
We better get started.
I don't trust this light.
I think the entire building's gone mad.
Everyone's running around trying to rescind the ten commandments.
I've never understood why most people will do things in the dark that they'd never think of doing in the light.
I'd explain it to you, but I'm afraid the lights might come back on.
No, I'm serious. If we can lie, cheat, steal and kill in broad daylight and have to wait till it's dark to make love, something's wrong somewhere.
I'm beginning to wish
I were that friend of yours.
Well, what happened to 13?
I don't think there is one.
The natives are superstitious.
And you're not superstitious?
No, I'm bushed.
Couldn't we stop and rest a minute?
Oh, don't be a sissy.
I'm a girl!
I'm supposed to be a sissy!
One of us should've counted the steps.
Maybe we've qualified for the Olympics.
Let's just say we climbed it because it was there.
I'm not as horrible as all that.
I knew it was you.
That was a stupid joke.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look, my name is David Stillwell.
What's yours?
Wait a minute!
What did I say?
Wait!
Wait a minute!
Where are you going?
Dead? Who is it? Do you know?
I can't see.
Is it a man or a woman?
Did you see him jump?
No, I always miss those things.
Did you notice which window it was?
No.
Which floor, then?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
Couldn't he wait for the elevator?
It's the worst way to go.
The worst.
If I had the guts to step out of that window,
I'd have the guts to go on living.
Been a lot of suicides lately.
Two in our building already this year.
I got smashed last summer and dropped a watermelon out of our living room window.
We're on the 14th floor.
What on earth for?
Haven't you ever wondered what a watermelon would sound like from 14 floors up?
Okay, what did it sound like?
About like he did.
Hello, Eddie.
The usual, I guess.
The usual?
Scotch and lemon peel.
Give me some change, will you, Eddie?
Yeah.
Haven't seen much of you lately.
Yeah, I skip lunch.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I thought it was you.
I knew it was you.
That'll be 90 cents.
I said, that'll be 90 cents.
Sorry.
Could you tell me where the stairs are?
Louder!
Could you tell me where the stairs are?
The ones that lead down to the subbasement?
There aren't any.
There aren't any what?
Stairs, or subbasements.
This is it.
But i was just down there a few minutes ago!
Not in this building, you weren't, and you're not even supposed to be here.
Now, beat it. I'm busy.
Good evening, Mr. Turtle.
Don't tell me. Your name is
Mr. Stillwell, right?
Well, I'm glad you found it.
The way it's been going,
I'm not too sure myself.
I know you on account of you're the only man in this whole building who can say my name without making it sound like a joke.
You know what I mean?
You work with Mr. Josephson, don't you?
Do you know what he calls me?
"Sweetheart"!
You're losing touch. "Sweetheart" is what they call total strangers these days.
Oh, yeah? He says it next time and I'll sock him!
You can call me Joe.
The man who jumped.
Do you know who he was?
He was a big one,
I can tell you that.
Look here.
The mayor went up five minutes ago, shortly after the lights came back on.
First jumper we've ever had that rated the Mayor.
Joe, do you know why the lights went out?
Someone upstairs playing God, most likely.
A man living that high up gets aspirations, you know.
Well, thanks, Joe.
Okay.
Evening, benny.
Mr. Stillwell! Long time no see.
Oh, no. Not you, too!
Press your floor button, please.
Going up!
Thanks very much.
Would you push 7, please?
I just did.
Stand back from the doors, please, and face the front of the car.
Don't these things just kill you?
I kind of miss the old guys that used to run them.
I tell you, it's beginning to look like people are on their way out altogether.
Well, maybe the machines will keep us around for pets.
Seventh floor. Please wait until the doors have completely opened before stepping from the car.
What are you doing for dinner tonight, honey?
Watch your step, please.
Say, I wonder if you'd have a few minutes you could spare?
Sorry, but it's been quite a day...
What do you want?
Inside.
Quite a day.
All right, move!
I don't keep a lot of cash around.
Nice!
It's even nicer when there's no one holding a gun in it.
They got wrestling coming in from Chicago.
I know it's supposed to be fixed, but so is everything else.
Why don't you just take the set?
Yeah, now that all the Westerns have gone psycho, this is the only place left where you can tell for sure who the bad guys are.
The Major wants to see you.
If it were anyone else I'd say it was a practical joke, but not the Major.
...the Arab forcing Lord Percy into the ropes.
Major who?
Now, look at that!
The Arab's got the rope around Lord Percy's neck!
Come on, Percy! Slip out of it, will you, fella?
You better pack a bag,
Mr. Stillwell.
Your plane leaves Kennedy in less than two hours.
Leaves where?
Idlewild.
They changed the name.
Where have you been?
I'm beginning to wonder.
But why the airport?
Isn't the Major in New York?
Oh, sure. Sure, he's here.
But he doesn't want to see you here.
He wants to see you there, in Barbados.
You're lucky. I hear the weather is gorgeous in Barbados.
I wish you'd stop looking as if I'm supposed to know what you're talking about!
Look out for the hat!
Into the ropes he goes.
Up, and over he goes again.
Tries for the press.
One, two... look out!
I can't just leave the country.
I have a job.
They'll ask questions.
There won't be any questions.
Well, I have one.
Suppose I refuse to go?
Well, that's up to you.
You see that?
Now, that case of yours goes to Barbados tonight, with you or without you.
Now, the Major would like it if you'd bring it yourself, but you can't be alive in Barbados and dead in New York at the same time.
Smash to the head by Percy.
I have the feeling that you don't care which way it turns out.
No, I care, all right.
But if you're too dead to go,
I'll be in Barbados tonight.
And I hear the weather is gorgeous.
The weather is gorgeous.
I know.
Forearm smash to the back by the Arab.
Another one! One more!
Now a fist to the ear. and there's another one...
What's supposed to be in here?
Now look, no questions.
Here's another whip by lord Percy. that slowed him down.
Percy with a body slam. He's heading for the top of the ropes.
Jumps down, and that hurt him bad.
One, two, three and it's over.
Boy, the Arab never knew what hit him.
Here's the time.
Time, Ladies and Gentlemen, eight minutes twenty-five seconds.
The winner is Lord Percy.
The Arab is now saying something to one of the fans.
"You come up here and see how you like it!" or something to that effect.
Percy's turning back after him.
He gave him both fingers in the eyes once more.
Now let's see if the Arab's going to punish him.
We don't want you to miss any of the action here.
Well, I guess that's it.
Well, as we just heard in the match, the winner, in one qual, is Lord Percy.
Say, fans, I'd like to remind you again about the wrestling card for next week.
Last week, you'll recall, I promised to announce that card.
Here it is, a real super-duper.
The Swami battles Hiro Samuto. Also, there'll be Farmer Frank, Angel Slapski, and Buffalo Bill Baker will be on hand.
You'll wanna pick up your tickets early for next week.
Well, we're about ready for the next bout, a one-fall match between the Hayseed and Karl van Striker. and it should be a lulu.
This pair have been feuding since
Karl bit the Hayseed's ear last February.
Judging by the crowd...
...place on lower Broadway.
Among those who rushed to Calvin's office in the Unidyne building
Were the Mayor, the Police Commissioner and the FBI.
Mrs. Charles Calvin hurried downtown from their 5th Avenue home, but remained inside her husband's office only 10 minutes.
She was accompanied by Crawford Gilcuddy,
Charles Calvin's close friend and president of Unidyne.
Our reporter was there when these questions were put to Mrs. Calvin.
Mrs. Calvin, can you think of any reason whatsoever why your husband might have taken his own life?
No, I...
Are the police convinced it was suicide, Mrs. Calvin?
I have no idea what the police are...
Do you believe it was a suicide?
Can't you see that Mrs. Calvin's had a terrible shock?
Mrs. Calvin, could your husband have been ill?
I'm sure I would have been the first to know.
Did he seem depressed?
Well, he was discouraged,
I can...
Why is that, Mrs. Calvin?
My husband worked very hard for world peace, but no one...
Mrs. Calvin, do you think it's possible...
You're not letting her answer!
No one else seemed to care.
No one did anything.
Mrs. Calvin...
No more questions!
No man in America today is regarded in just the same manner as was Charles Stewart Calvin.
Holding himself aloof from political ties, and therefore from political office,
Calvin was courted by conservative and liberal alike.
But, in his own words from a speech filmed less than two months ago... the only political philosophy
I recognize is world peace.
Lookit here!
A beautiful brand-new kitchen!
Larry, let's show her, shall we?
First, this automatic-time range,
All built in for your convenience.
And I know you like to cook. and over in the corner here, Larry, too, and Mrs. Lewis, a self-defrosting refrigerator.
Right next to that, an automatic washer and dryer, all in matching colors.
And that's not all. A sanitarized dishwasher, too, for you, Mrs. Lewis.
This automatic mixer, juicer and blender, and a 10-cup coffeemaker.
And it's all yours with our compliments,
Mrs. Lewis.
Take it from us!
Right, audience?
I'm sorry...
...is not in service at this time.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
This is a recording.
I'm sorry.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
Yes?
David. It's me, Josephson.
Well, I was just trying to call you, but the phone was disconnected or something.
You sure?
What number did you call?
Digby 447...
Digby?
We haven't used Digby in almost two years now.
They switched us to Hanover.
What did you do, Cookie?
Forget?
Yes, l... I guess so.
Not enough beddie-bye, if you ask me.
Well, too much would be more like it.
I overslept.
That's why I'm late.
Late? Late for what?
I heard you wouldn't be in at all for a few days.
You're supposed to be taking a cruise to the islands or something.
There won't be any questions.
Hey, Dave.
Are you still there, baby?
Yes. Yes, I'm still here.
Josephson, if you heard I was taking a cruise to the islands, why did you call?
I didn't know what time you'd be leaving, and I didn't want you to go without saying aloha, bubbie.
Well, save it, bubbie, baby, sweetie.
I'm not going.
Well, that's too bad. I hear the weather is gorgeous down there.
The desk sergeant said that I should see you.
You making a complaint?
That's right.
Have a seat.
Look at that. Would you believe
I made all-city guard in high school?
Football?
Funny!
I'm Lieutenant Franken.
I'm David...
Hold it.
You'll only have to tell me again.
Okay, shoot.
I'm David Stillwell.
Double "l," double "l"?
That's right.
Address?
It's 140 East 56th Street,
Apartment 7G.
Phone?
It's... it's Murray Hill something.
Well, it's the "something" part we're interested in, Mr. Stillwell.
Care to make a stab at it?
Well, you see, I live alone, so there's no reason for me to call it.
It's in the book.
Okay, I'll track it down.
Date and place of birth?
Tell me, how many more of these questions do I have to answer?
Just a couple.
But, you don't even know what my complaint is yet.
And it's killing me.
But let's both of us try to contain ourselves a little longer, until we get this finished, huh?
Now, how about it?
Date and place of birth?
Someone threatened to kill me unless I left the country!
There, you've done it.
Don't you want to play by the rules, Mr. Stillwell?
Now, look, I wasn't all-city anything in high school, all I know is that somebody's trying to kill... and you want us to do something, right?
Well, I think that's why
I came in here, if I can remember that far back.
Fine. And we will do something,
I promise.
Just as soon as we finish answering these few simple questions.
Like date and place of birth, for instance.
Forget it!
Forget the whole thing!
You'll enjoy that.
It's eminently readable.
Stuck with a lot of them, huh?
I'll take it.
You won't regret it. It gave me tons of fresh insight.
Would it be possible to see Dr. Broden right away? It's quite urgent.
Who recommended you to this office, Mr. Stillwell?
Dr. Ellman. Max Ellman.
Just a moment, please.
Mr. Stillwell, the doctor can see you in 40 minutes.
Thank you. If I came over now, could I wait in the office?
Well, we're so close to the park, why not try that?
Many of the doctor's patients find it very relaxing.
If it isn't our lady of the stairways.
Hello, David.
Why did you run away from me?
I wanted to talk to you.
What did you wanna say?
To tell you how sorry I was that I frightened you.
You're still frightening me, David.
Where did you go?
I just ran.
I followed you, and I called.
Didn't you hear me?
I heard you.
I followed you down four flights of stairs, but I couldn't find them when the lights came back on.
I think you're mistaken.
Someone's gone to a great deal of trouble to make me think so, too.
Are you following me?
Not at the moment.
You're following me.
What did the police say?
Nothing.
You left this in the phone booth.
You can have it.
It's "eminently readable."
I don't need my head examined, David.
You read that wrong.
"l don't need 'my' head examined, David."
Who did you call?
"Whom." Objective case.
There's my trouble right there.
I never could be very objective.
Have you got something to tell me?
Then you only wanted to look, the way you're looking at him.
We both seem to be having pronoun trouble.
It's a "her."
I don't usually make that mistake.
Have you noticed how they use every inch of space in the cage?
She's making it as large as she can.
She's looking for a way out.
No.
Not anymore.
She's just waiting.
For what?
Her keeper.
I really don't know you.
I wish you'd believe that.
I believe it.
Who's the Major?
If you don't know, my telling you isn't going to help.
Be careful, David.
I'm Mr. Stillwell. I called.
Go right in, Mr. Stillwell.
The doctor's expecting you.
Thank you.
You won't find a couch,
Mr. Stillwell.
I'm a consulting psychiatrist, not an analyst.
Didn't Dr. Ellman tell you that?
No, he didn't.
Well, I don't wonder.
Ellman has been dead for 12 years.
Yes, well, maybe that's why he didn't say very much.
Why did you agree to see me, then?
Well, why not?
You picked both our names from that foolish book.
That's the only connection
Ellman and I ever had.
He was a Freudian.
I, on the other hand, am a genius.
There. You see? I no longer suppress my outrageous egotism.
Now, what do you want to know?
Whether or not I'm insane.
Insanity is a legal term, you understand.
Not a medical one.
If you know the difference between right and wrong, the law considers you sane.
Do you know that difference?
Between right and wrong?
Well, they're hardly constant factors, doctor.
I could probably give you five minutes on good and evil.
Now, those aren't legal or medical terms.
Good and evil are theological concepts.
The only thing that matters in psychiatry,
Mr. Stillwell, is behavior.
Can you tell me of any behavior which might make you doubt your rationality?
Well, among other things, I walked down four flights of stairs which weren't there.
Good! Marvelous!
Had you been drinking?
No.
No.
Taking drugs?
Then either the stairs were there, or you didn't walk down them.
You see my point?
Vividly.
Tell me something, Mr. Stillwell.
Why did you have to look through a book to find a psychiatrist?
Why didn't you ask your regular doctor?
I don't have a doctor.
Oh?
Well, you could've asked a friend, certainly.
You have friends, I presume?
Well, everyone has friends,
Mr. Stillwell.
I think you'd better tell me something about yourself.
It isn't every day
I meet a man with no friends.
What would you like to know?
Well, who you are, what you do, where you come from.
Date and place of birth?
Well, Mr. Stillwell?
There are some things that this data processing can't help.
Why are you afraid of questions, Mr. Stillwell?
The police wouldn't help me either, unless I answered all of theirs.
The police? Then the trouble isn't totally in the mind, is it?
What do you do, Mr. Stillwell?
Cost accounting.
Oh? Why is that?
Why not?
I ask you, "why?" and you ask me, "why not?"
Philosophical, perhaps, but hardly productive.
There are many reasons why I can't think of you as a cost accountant.
So I'm curious as to how and when you became one.
It was two years ago.
I went to Garrison, Ltd., downtown in the Unidyne building.
I was interviewed by a Mr. Josephson, and he found me acceptable.
What did you do before that?
I don't know!
I don't think I understand.
You don't know what you were doing two years ago?
I haven't thought much about it lately. I...
Oh, now, now, now.
Come, Mr. Stillwell.
Two years isn't such a long time.
What were you doing the day before you got the job?
I don't know.
The week before, then.
I don't know!
The year before!
I can't remember.
I see.
Why didn't you come right out and say so in the first place?
Well, I...
I don't think that I actually realized it until just now.
Are you trying to tell me you've been suffering from amnesia for two years and never suspected that fact until this very minute?
Yes.
Yes, it rather looks that way, doesn't it?
Well, I'm sorry, doctor.
I don't like it any more than you do.
Mr. Stillwell! I'd appreciate it if you'd leave my office, right now!
Well, what...
What?
What is this, some sort of new shock treatment?
It's goodbye treatment,
Mr. Stillwell!
I don't know what your game is, and I'm not very anxious to play.
You're obviously in some sort of trouble with the police, and you've come to me to establish a tricky defense!
Now, just a minute.
Will you please...
There is no such thing as the sort of amnesia you describe.
There never has been and there never will be.
Surely in some cases...
Never!
Unconscious amnesia can exist for an hour or two.
Sometimes, on rare occasions, a day or two.
But two years? Impossible!
Look, will you please listen...
I'm through listening!
You come recommended by a dead man and you invent amnesia!
Well, I'm not going to help you trick the police or anyone else!
Now, goodbye.
Save your money, Mr. Stillwell.
If that's your name.
You'll be needing a lawyer now.
To hell with you, doctor.
To hell with you, too,
Mr. Stillwell.
What were you doing the day before you got the job?
The week before, then.
The year before!
It isn't every day
I meet a man with no friends.
Yeah?
Mister?
AAA detective agency?
Triple A, that's right. Puts me first in the Yellow Pages.
Until somebody comes along with four A's, anyway.
You're selling something?
No. You are.
You want any?
Well, can we talk about it?
Sure! Sure, come on in.
My secretary's out to lunch, and my partner's on a case.
My name is Caselle.
Who recommended you to this office? Mr...
Stillwell. David Stillwell.
I saw the sign.
Sit down. Sit down, please.
Like a smoke?
No, thanks.
Now, then, sir,
What can I do for you?
For openers, you can find out who I am.
Sure. You're David Stillwell.
That'll be ten bucks.
Maybe I better wait for your partner.
Wait a minute.
Relax, Mr. Stillwell.
That's what is known as breaking the ice.
Well, I don't want a date, Mr. Caselle.
I need some help.
I'm willing to pay in advance.
Cash?
Well, what else? A sack of flour and some colored beads?
I don't take any postdated checks.
How much?
Five hundred dollars, plus 25 a day expenses.
We'll have to go to my bank.
What are we dawdling around here for?
Well, don't you want to hear about it first?
Sure, in the taxi.
Well, what about your secretary?
Don't you want to leave her a note or something?
I'll tell you the truth, Stillwell,
I don't have a secretary.
There isn't any partner, either.
As a matter of fact, sir, you're my first case.
Terrific.
One hundred, 200, 300, 350, 400, 450,
Thank you, Mr. Stillwell.
Thank you.
Five hundred, plus 50 for two days' expenses.
I think you better keep it.
The deal's off.
What happened to you?
I've been thinking about what you told me.
I've been trying to decide whether you're lying or you're just crazy.
That cabbage there tells me you're crazy, so I can't help you.
Listen, Caselle.
For the past two years,
I've been completely alone.
Eating alone, spending my nights and weekends alone, and I never questioned it.
Not once in two years.
I have to know why.
Make listening noises, will you?
Nod your head or grunt or something?
All right. Give me the money.
I'll earn this.
I've got a sneaky feeling even if I don't do anything I'll still earn it.
Here, I'll take half of that.
I'm not in the five-c class yet.
Incredible, the way you fill a man with confidence.
Come on. A deal's a deal.
Considering that
I'm your first case, maybe you'd like me to have the money framed.
Don't bother. I'm hungrier than I am sentimental.
Where shall we start?
Your place.
We ought to be able to tell something about you
Just from seeing the way you live.
You know, when I was repairing refrigerators,
I found out that I could read a man's character pretty well just by seeing what he's got in his icebox.
What's so funny?
Take a look.
My whole life is in there.
Looks like a pretty full life, if you ask me.
But it was empty, Caselle.
I swear, there was nothing in it.
You could at least look like you believe me.
I'm trying, pal. I'm trying.
Hey, what about the stuff that chubby left behind, the hat and the gun?
Can I take a look at those?
Maybe this is not your apartment.
Nice try.
I tell you one thing, it's kind of scary.
You don't even talk like a detective.
Hey, Stillwell. Who else knows about your amnesia?
No one, except you and Dr. Broden.
No one else?
Well, I just realized it myself.
How could anyone...
If you really don't know, my telling you isn't going to help.
She knows!
The girl I told you about.
That's why she followed me today.
To make sure.
Well, if she knows, then anybody could know, including the Major.
What about your dispatch case?
Well, maybe the brownies came in during the night.
Well, if this thing really was empty...
It was empty.
But the question is, why did they fill it up again?
Maybe they did it for my benefit.
Stillwell, what if they fixed it so as I'm not supposed to believe you?
What if I'm supposed to write you off as a nut and walk away?
What if someone wants you playing this thing all alone, without any help?
What if I am a nut?
No, I don't think you're nuts enough to imagine that big fellow that's been following us ever since we left the bank.
I didn't see anyone.
You're not being paid to.
Wouldn't it be hilarious if you did know what you're doing?
Yeah. Then how come I don't know what to do next?
Well, pretend you're James Bond.
He always knows.
Hey, maybe we ought to get something to eat.
I'm dying for a peanut butter sandwich.
Forget James Bond.
Then we could take a look at your office.
What's the name of that place?
Garrison, Ltd.
Tell you one thing, I'm beginning to wish I had a gun.
You're kidding!
Filthy things.
I can't stand them.
You have one, and sure as shooting, you end up using it.
Beautiful!
My office is just around the corner.
Hey!
Charles Calvin.
You didn't tell me about that.
So?
Did you know Calvin?
No.
What do you think happened to him?
Look, you can start on his case as soon as you're finished with mine.
Do you want to see my office or not?
Okay! Okay!
Right there, huh?
Yeah.
That wall doesn't look like it was built recently, Stillwell.
Looks like it's been there a long time.
I tell you, there was a door there.
I've passed through it thousands of times.
Take it easy.
Take it easy, will you?
Are you sure you got the right floor?
Yes, I'm sure.
Somebody's changed it.
Why?
I don't know!
What do you think I hired you for?
Conversation, you said.
Well, then let's hear some.
I tell you, there was an office there!
I worked in it for two years.
I left it less than 24 hours ago!
Face it, will you, Stillwell?
There's no door there, and there hasn't been one for a lot longer than 24 hours.
I don't need a detective,
I need a keeper.
You better get out of here,
Caselle.
This is my own private nightmare.
If I quit now,
I'll start dreaming about it myself.
Come on, let's look into those four flights of stairs that aren't there either.
Here.
Where'd you meet that maintenance man?
Right through there.
Tell me some more about him.
Well, he wore steel-rimmed glasses, he weighed about...
The man who's been following us wears steel-rimmed glasses.
Yo! Stillwell!
Stand over there!
I'm jumping off to the left.
You go off the other side.
I said, move!
Go!
For God's sake,
Stillwell! Jump!
Why didn't you jump?
I'll tell you one thing, this is no private nightmare. This guy is real.
And so is this gun.
Let's see what else he's carrying.
What do you think that means?
Mind if I keep it?
No, no, I don't mind.
He's not objecting, either.
Let's get out of here before he does.
Turtle.
Where?
Joe Turtle.
All right, I'll play.
Peter Cottontail.
That man over there.
His name is Joe Turtle.
You know, every time
I decide you're sane, you come up with something like that.
He knows me.
He knows I work here.
Joe?
Could you use a drink?
Easy.
Good evening.
Scotch and lemon peel.
Thank you.
I'll have a Dr Pepper.
That figures.
Stillwell, what does a cost accountant do?
I don't know.
There are many reasons why I can't think of you as a cost accountant.
I don't know what a cost accountant does!
I haven't the faintest idea.
You don't look very surprised.
Why?
Because for the past two years you've been doing something you don't know anything about in an office that doesn't exist?
What's there to be surprised about?
Thank you.
Well, what do we do now?
Start digging.
I'm kind of curious about Charles Calvin, for instance and why he went through that window.
Why Calvin?
I didn't even know him.
Maybe not, but your nightmare began at almost the exact moment his ended.
You're wasting your time.
I don't mind.
You're paying for it.
And listen, while I'm getting rich, you can go and find Joe...
Turtle, or whatever his name is.
Well, suppose he's a dream, too?
Never mind. Just find him.
And call me in my office in about two hours, huh?
Would you like to have a drink?
No.
Then let's go.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, sir.
Feel like talking?
Not just yet.
Let me know.
Do you really think it's the city's fault?
What?
What happens to people, what it does to them.
Or have they done it to themselves?
What's your name?
Shela.
Shela what?
Against the rules, huh?
You'd think that I'd remember someone like you.
You'd think.
How long has it been?
Two years.
How did it end?
Gracefully.
You were much too polite to call me names.
Did you deserve them?
I'd just assume you didn't remember.
I can't remember anything.
Yes, I know.
Shela, do you know a man named Joe Turtle?
No more questions, David.
But why?
What do you think would happen if you told me something?
You'd turn into a frog?
Let's not take the chance.
Shela! Who are you?
You've forgotten how to be polite, too!
David! Give it to me, please!
Shela, I don't know who I am.
I don't know who you are, or who the Major is!
I'm confused and frightened.
You mustn't be upset when I do things you don't like.
Even if you do say please.
You belong to the Major, don't you?
People don't belong to people, David.
They go quietly on their own.
Shela.
You've got to tell me who he is and what he wants!
He can't have it both ways.
How can I give him anything if I can't remember what it is?
Be grateful for that.
Not remembering is the only thing that's keeping you alive.
But why?
Because you know something you shouldn't about him.
But also, you have something he needs.
That's why he's taking a chance on keeping you alive a little longer.
I'll have to write him a thank-you note.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
You're riding scout.
Keeping tabs on my progress.
"It's all right, Major.
As of 7:30 tonight, he's still a vegetable."
I don't want you killed!
Oh, yes. Of course.
You're doing it all for me.
And when I remember,
What will you do for me then, when the shooting starts?
Stand in front of you.
Shela, help me now! Now!
But how can I?
Help me find Joe Turtle. He knows me.
He knows where I work.
For God's sakes, David,
Leave it alone!
Look, what good will knowing do you if you're dead?
Is this any different from being dead?
All right, David.
I'll take you where you want to go.
Incubator.
Have you lived here?
The name of the street is different, that's all.
It's right in there.
I'll wait here for you.
It's open.
Mr. Turtle?
Now, isn't that the silliest name you ever heard?
You hit too hard,
Mr. Stillwell.
I'm going to have quite a dentist bill because of you.
See that?
Where's Joe Turtle?
Search me.
But there's no point in both of us waiting for him, is there?
So I'll just run along now.
What's Turtle got to do...
Stay away from me, Stillwell!
If you touch me again, I'll...
Isn't temper an awful thing?
If you get bored waiting, Mr. Stillwell, try the bed. It's not bad.
Better take this.
You might need it.
Be good, now.
What if someone wants you playing this thing all alone, without any help?
David?
You knew he was dead.
Why didn't you say so?
You said you were the same as dead.
But you're not, David.
The way he is.
That's what dead is.
And that's what you'll look like if you don't stop!
All right.
I've seen him.
But you haven't, Shela.
Come and take a look.
The police are coming!
That's what I came here to tell you!
Come on, have a look!
I want you to see a portrait of the man you belong to.
By the work, you know the artist.
We've got to get out...
I said look.
No, David!
Please!
That thing in there used to be somebody!
Somebody who wasn't any part of this, except that he knew me and would've said so, that's all.
He probably didn't even know why it was happening to him, but you did!
There was nothing I could do to stop it!
David, the police. Please!
I said, look!
No! Please!
Now, look!
Where is he? Where's the Major?
Where is he?
The police.
They'll find you here.
You'll never be able to explain.
That's what he wants!
Isn't that what you wanted?
You brought me here, you set me up.
I could've left.
I didn't have to come up here.
It's right up there.
Yes?
There's been some trouble downstairs.
Now, we had nothing to do...
I can't see or hear anything, Mister.
I'm deaf and blind.
Where are your mother and father?
Working.
What's your name?
Irene.
There's some trouble downstairs, ma'am.
See anything?
Sorry, I'm deaf and blind.
Oh, God. It was stupid to bring you here.
I should've known he wanted me to.
That's why he let me come.
Why would he want me arrested?
Because he knows you couldn't explain your way out, that you'd have to go to him for help.
Then I'd belong to him, too.
Is that how it was with you?
Were you in trouble?
Is that how you got to him?
A smart girl like me?
I found the way all by myself.
Coffee?
You shouldn't have bothered, Irene.
I'm glad she did.
I could use it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Where did you learn to make such good coffee?
On television.
It's the best coffee I ever tasted...
It's coffier coffee.
Aren't you having any?
I'm too young to drink coffee.
That's right.
Have you ever been married, Shela?
I don't know.
Does playing house count?
Depends on how old you were.
About her age.
Doesn't count.
Maybe a little older.
Well, I think we'd better be going.
Aren't you a little sleepy now?
Oh, Irene...
What are you doing?
Well, I thought I'd give her a little something.
Tip, you mean?
Gratitude.
Then say thank you.
All right.
Thank you, Irene.
You're welcome.
Okay, young lady. Today's all over with.
Let's take your shoes off.
Come on, silly. Crawl into bed, now.
David, don't answer it!
Hello.
Hello?
Hello!
Probably Caselle.
Not very likely.
I was worried when you didn't call.
Besides, I don't get a chance to work on many locks.
Shela, this is Caselle, boy detective.
I don't know his first name.
And this is Shela...
I don't know her last name.
I'm sure the two of you'll be very happy.
Hiya. Ted Caselle.
Glad to meet you.
Hey, did you find your friend Turtle?
Yeah, we found him.
His head was beaten in by the handle of a pistol.
How did you do?
I'll fix some coffee. You could probably use the real thing this time.
Right in there.
Yes, I know where it is.
Hey, Stillwell.
I went to the 42nd Street library and I looked up Garrison.
Hey, Stillwell, you listening to me?
Yeah. sorry.
I went to the 42nd Street library and looked up Garrison, limited. No such place.
Not in New York City, not in the whole country. Never was.
Well, that's crazy.
Who's been paying my salary every week for the past two years?
How do I know?
Listen, have you ever been to California?
All you've got is instant. Okay?
Yeah. Instant. Fine.
I live in New York. I work in New York.
Why ask about California?
Caselle, what about California?
I found a Garrison Laboratories in
Brewster, California.
It's part of the Charles
Calvin Peace Foundation.
It's a nonprofit organization dedicated to world peace.
It rings no bell whatsoever.
No bell, huh?
How about this?
The head of Garrison Labs is a man named Josephson.
Before taking over at Garrison,
Mr. Sylvester Josephson was the head of the physiochemistry division at Unidyne.
Ding-dong?
Detectives don't have to be funny, Caselle.
No matter what it says in the handbook.
I can't help it.
I'm excessively happy-go-lucky.
Well, you better start practicing some happy unemployment jokes.
I must've come pretty close, huh?
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't really want to remember anything, do you?
Now, look, if I want a psychiatrist, I'll get one with a diploma!
Okay. Drop around tomorrow, pal, and pick up your $500.
Never mind that.
You earned it.
Earned it?
Doing what?
I wanna tell you something, Stillwell.
I would've gone all the way to the end of this thing with you because you were all alone and needed help.
But I'm beginning to think you're all alone for a reason.
You want to be.
Now, when you get tired of it, let me know.
Wait, Caselle.
Just forget what I said. It's been a rotten day.
Let's talk it over in the morning, huh?
Okay.
Where's your friend?
He was just being polite.
Hates instant coffee.
I can't say I blame him.
They might've included some instant taste in along with it.
How many times have you been here, Shela?
A few.
Hey, you're staring.
Was I in love with you, or what?
Or what, I suppose.
At least you never said so.
What did we used to talk about?
The future, sometimes.
And the past.
Wasn't there any present?
Not much.
You're something of a perfectionist, David.
And our present wasn't exactly perfect.
Was that my fault?
You couldn't help your attitude,
I guess,
Any more than I could change what I believed in.
Which was what?
Survival.
You know, better well fed than dead.
And my attitude?
Disapproval. Indignation.
Something like that.
You could look very stern when you wanted to.
A stern, indignant perfectionist.
Sounds awful.
I haven't come to the charming, amusing, brilliant part yet.
I can hardly wait.
Or the stubborn part, either.
We're a pair of mules, David.
Both of us.
The harder we pulled on each other, the harder we dug our heels in.
You wanted me to commit first, without promises, out of principle.
I wanted the promises first.
Togetherness is just dandy, but
I'd just as soon have foreverness.
Is that what you think you have with the Major?
The only kind of foreverness he hands out is the kind Joe Turtle got.
Maybe Turtle believed in survival, too.
I'm sure he did.
Well, I'm not impressed.
See, we're old-fashioned,
Turtle and I.
We don't exactly approve of our murderer tucking you in at night.
And what do you know about it?
David, when you're caught in quicksand, you grab the first hand that's held out to you.
And maybe you can't see how dirty the hand is, and maybe you don't care, either. and what do you want here?
Do you really think that keeping me alive will help buy back your soul?
Don't you know why I'm here, David?
I only know where you've come from.
It's not easy to change sides.
Help me to do it.
Please help.
I can't even help myself.
Love me, David.
Promise you'll love me.
Promise!
How can I make any promises when
I don't even know who I am?
All right, David.
You don't have to sign anything.
Let's just say we're in escrow.
What's wrong?
Don't you want me?
Shela?
Love me, David.
Promise you'll love me.
Promise!
Watch your step, please.
Willard! The alley!
Go ahead, Mr. Stillwell.
Try it.
You'll be dead before you hit the bottom.
Lester, why don't we tell the Major that he tried it anyway?
You hear that, Mr. Stillwell?
Even Willard doesn't like you very much.
Mr. Stillwell! Are you...
Get out of here or I'll kill him!
I'll save you the trouble.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Make it snappy, will you?
I'm listening to the traffic reports.
Would you please move?
I'd like to go upstairs.
Don't be so damn snotty!
I'm twice your age!
And I know a hell of a lot more than you ever will, even if you live to be my age, which it don't strike me you ever will.
Look, I didn't ask for your references.
All I want is for you to move!
Caselle?
Caselle.
We're going across the street, son.
Both of us.
Don't look so surprised. there ain't any social security in this line of work.
Get going.
You start something, and I'll have to kill you right here on the street,
And that'd cause a heap of trouble for me.
Suppose I don't care?
You care.
If I'm still scratching around to keep alive at my age,
I figure you care a lot at yours.
Besides, you wouldn't want to cause no trouble for one of our senior citizens, would you, son?
We'll wait right here.
Willard will be along with the car pretty soon now.
All right, men. See that tall fellow there with yellow leaves?
Yes. Yes.
Who do you think he is?
A cottonwood?
Excellent reasoning, Harold!
But unfortunately, you're very much mistaken.
This is our old friend the ginkgo.
Ginkgo.
Never heard of it.
One of the few trees that can breathe our dirty city air.
Maybe we'd better wait over there.
Do you want it right here with an audience?
All right, men.
Onward and upward.
You didn't grow old in this business taking those kind of chances.
Don't try me, son.
That was very interesting, what you told the boys.
Of course occupation-wise, mother nature offers no real benefit to their future as competitors in society's marketplace.
Smell that air, would you?
You'd never suspect that each year over 486,000 tons of impurities...
David!
Who is it?
Josephson!
What do you want?
I'm sorry you're having trouble, baby.
You deserve better.
And you don't have to worry about me, killing isn't my job.
There are plenty of people to do that.
What is your job?
Following instructions.
Please believe me, David, sometimes
I don't like my instructions, but I follow them.
Why?
The Major pays me three times what I'm worth.
You can understand that, can't you?
What do you want?
We've looked everywhere for it.
You know that, David.
Looked for what?
Empty your pockets.
I'll stay right here.
Put everything on the ground, and then turn and walk away.
Suppose it's not in my pockets?
It doesn't matter.
You're all alone, David.
There's no one to help you, no one you can talk to. We'll find you again.
There's nowhere to go, David!
You almost got me!
So?
Unconscious amnesia can exist for an hour or two.
Sometimes, on rare occasions, a day or two.
But two years? Impossible!
Didn't I make it clear that I never wanted to see you again?
No one else I could talk to, or I wouldn't be here.
Well, it appears I've decided to grant you a few minutes of my time.
Very well, Mr. Stillwell, what's on your mind?
What causes amnesia?
Severe shock, Mr. Stillwell, either physical or mental.
Mostly, we cause it ourselves.
We're afraid to remember something, and therefore, we don't.
Dr. Broden, I don't think I've had amnesia for two years.
I don't think I've had it for more than two days.
What makes you think so?
I remembered something, something that happened less than two years ago.
Oh, bravo, Mr. Stillwell, bravo!
With amnesia, you must remember.
First it's a block, then it begins to crumble, bit by bit.
Now, two years without knowing it, that was impossible, but, two days, well, that's something else.
But couldn't a genius like you have seen that yesterday?
A medical man has to be very careful these days, Mr. Stillwell.
Do you know that a doctor can't afford to stop at a street accident anymore?
If we stop to treat a seriously injured man, we're legally responsible.
Therefore, we must let that man bleed to death on the street.
So you see, in today's complicated world, right becomes wrong and wrong becomes right.
But, in your case... all right, Mr. Stillwell, sometimes
I do something foolish.
There. You see?
I can be humble.
Now, what do you remember?
I was standing under a tree, in the country someplace, not New York.
I was talking to a man, someone I'd forgotten that I knew.
But now you remember him?
It was Charles Calvin.
Oh?
And this was less than two years ago?
Yes.
Where was this tree,
Mr. Stillwell?
I'm not quite sure.
Close your eyes, please.
I want you to look at that tree in your mind.
Can you see it?
Yes.
Now look around, Mr. Stillwell.
What do you see?
It's the lab.
Garrison laboratories.
Where?
It's in California. It's a radiation lab.
Most of it's built underground.
And what does that mean to you?
I've been working there for the past two years.
Well, what was a cost accountant doing in a radiation lab?
I'm not a cost accountant,
I'm a physiochemist.
I was working there, on the fourth level.
The fourth level underground?
Yes.
Mr. Stillwell, could those have been the stairs you couldn't find here in New York?
Go on.
I can't.
What did you do on the fourth level?
I don't know.
If you were there for two years, when did you get back to New York?
The day before yesterday.
Where did you get your apartment?
It's mine. I own it.
Then you lived in New York before you went to California?
Yes.
Where did you work?
At Unidyne.
As a physiochemist?
Yes.
Doing what, specifically?
I don't know.
Why did you go to California?
I don't know!
Why did you come back to New York?
I don't know. Why do you go on asking me these stupid questions?
What's wrong, Mr. Stillwell?
Don't you want to remember?
You don't really want to remember anything, do you?
Yes, I do. I do.
Of course I do.
I want to remember.
No, Mr. Stillwell.
No, you do not want to remember.
That's why you blacked it out.
Doctor, how sick am I?
You're not sick, Mr. Stillwell.
You've been bruised.
When you bump your toe in the dark, you're not sick, but you do put a bandage on it in order to protect it from further injury while it heals.
Now, you've stubbed your conscious mind, and you've put a bandage of forgetfulness on it until it recovers.
But you will remember, in spite of yourself. it's the nature of the beast.
You are compelled to pick at the scab you've grown over the bruise until you succeed in pulling it off.
But why did I think that I remembered the past two years?
You didn't remember them, you merely pretended to.
That was the bandage you applied.
You created it in order to replace the time you didn't want to remember.
The two years in
California, perhaps.
But why? Why?
These are strange times, Mr. Stillwell.
From here on, you'll begin to remember everything.
Bits and pieces will fall into place with increasing frequency,
If you have the courage to face that terrible thing that made you forget.
But whatever it is, I don't want to know about it.
Goodbye, Mr. Stillwell.
You're a brilliant man, Broden, and no doubt a good scientist, but you're not much of a doctor, or a human being, either.
God knows.
Has the doctor made another appointment with you, Mr. Stillwell?
You're late, David.
Terribly late.
Frances.
I'm so sorry.
Yes, David, I know.
It's too bad you missed the funeral.
It was lovely.
The Governor came down from Albany. There was even a wire from the President.
Everyone was there.
Everyone except David Stillwell.
I'm sorry I couldn't come.
The coffin was closed, you know.
Charles used to be quite handsome.
But there was nothing they could do. After all, he did fall 27 floors...
Frances. Stop it.
You know how much I'll miss him.
Will you?
You know what he meant to me.
It's all right, David.
I know what Charles was, and so do you.
What do you mean?
Isn't that why you killed him?
What are you talking about?
Where were you that afternoon?
I was in my office, of course, at Garrison.
What are you talking about, David?
Garrison's in California.
You were in Charles' office, here in New York.
I just had a call to come up to C.C.'s office.
"C.C.'s office."
There was no one in Charles' office when
Josephson got there, not even Charles.
Just an open window.
That's impossible.
That's impossible.
But your nightmare began at almost the exact moment his ended.
No. I couldn't have done anything to him.
I adored the man,
Frances, you know I did.
For God's sake,
David, what are you doing?
I loved him more than my own father!
David! Don't do it!
I would've done anything he asked! Anything!
You mustn't think I blame you, David.
It was his face.
You didn't have to know who Charles Calvin was to know the magnificent work the man who wore that face was capable of doing.
Where did this come from?
Well, Crawford gave it to Charles.
Crawford? Who's Crawford?
Crawford Gilcuddy.
You were there at the dinner the night he presented it to Charles.
What does it mean?
Well, it's the motto of Unidyne.
Crawford is the president.
He knows!
He knows what happened!
Crawford?
Yes! The Major!
That's why I want you to meet Crawford.
Unidyne will give you greater opportunities to work for World Peace.
Greater than teaching at the university.
The more scientists like you that I can place with organizations like Unidyne, the greater the chances of one day achieving a victory over human misery.
David!
Why did you come here?
You were right, I had nowhere else to go.
It was foolish, bubbie, very foolish.
And then some.
I owe you some pain,
Mr. Stillwell.
California isn't the end of the
Earth, David.
The foundation wants to find a way to neutralize atomic radiation, to make the peaceful uses of nuclear energy safer for industry and medicine.
I can get Crawford to give you a leave of absence.
Stop!
Hello, Charles?
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I think I've found what we've been looking for, and if I'm right about it...
Well, why don't I fly back to New York right away and see you?
You're the only one I can talk to.
Willard, that's enough.
I said, that's enough.
I owe him.
Leave him alone!
Now, Josephson, get me a cloth, would you, please?
It was generous of you to come, David.
I'll try not to hurt you, David.
Violence is something new to you, isn't it?
Well, I can't say that I care very much for it myself, but more and more people seem to be craving it as part of their lives.
Don't you think so?
Yes.
It belonged to poor Charles.
I had to come back, Charles.
I didn't know how to handle something like this. It's too big.
You're quite right, David.
It is too big.
That's why I want
Crawford to hear it.
I don't understand what he's got to do with this.
Listen to him, David.
It's not going to hurt you to listen to him.
David!
This is a surprise.
When did you get back?
This afternoon.
Sit down, Crawford.
David has made a very interesting discovery.
He wants to tell you about it.
Of course, it's just a beginning, but David assures me that it checks out, so far.
I don't suppose that you can make anything more out of that equation than I have.
Where is it, David?
It wasn't in Charles' office after he was killed, so I know that you have it.
Where is it?
Don't be foolish, David, tell him.
He's not going to steal it, you know.
Are you, Major?
David has discovered a method of neutralizing nuclear radiation at the source.
The danger of radiation will no longer exist.
Is that right, David?
I think so.
Are you talking about fallout?
Fallout is a term which applies only to nuclear explosions.
Eliminating fallout would have a great strategic value, David.
Yes, by making a clean bomb that would be safer to use.
That's right.
But you know that you'd also be making them easier to use.
Relax, David.
You're missing the point, David.
What you're talking about has nothing to do with reality.
What I'm talking about is saving lives, not taking them!
Or isn't there enough money in peace these days?
You'd better have copies made of this right away.
I want my physiochemistry division to... put that down!
I don't work for Unidyne anymore!
Or do I?
Why don't you leave us alone, Major?
I think I can work this out with David.
I want this settled before he leaves the building.
I'll do it my way!
And remember, David is a very close friend of mine.
He was the best friend you ever had.
He dragged you out of that ivy-covered crypt you'd buried yourself in, and handed you a brilliant career.
And you repaid him, didn't you?
Damn you.
Damn you, you murdered him!
Major!
Leave him alone!
Shela, dear, you mustn't interfere where you're not concerned.
And when did you start calling me
"Major"?
I'm Crawford to my friends.
You never used to call him "Major."
I thought only his employees called him that.
It's just an old habit. Don't forget, we were in the army together.
Charles, tell me the truth.
Does your peace foundation have any connection with Unidyne?
Why would that interest you, David?
Well, because a foundation doing business with a profit-making organization is illegal!
I can't respect any legality that would impede progress.
We're being turned into statistics, case histories and percentage points, all in the name of progress!
What ever happened to human beings?
Is that what you want to see, David?
Human beings?
Come here, David.
Look at them.
Do they look like human beings or ants?
You're quite right, David.
They are statistics.
But I didn't do it to them.
I'm not responsible.
Maybe you are, Charles.
You're one of the leaders.
You have the power to control progress and to protect human dignity.
What's this? Crawford's way of keeping me in the building until you can soften me up?
Don't you see what he is, Charles?
Miss Baxter, can you hear me?
Those people down there aren't even ants to him.
They're articles of commerce.
That man computes human lives in terms of dollars and cents.
He's made you his prize salesman, and I'm the cost accountant trying to cut down his overhead with what you and he call progress!
I won't let you have this, Charles.
I'm tired of you, David.
Just give me the piece of paper and get the hell out of here.
How far would I get?
A block? Two?
I know about the connection between
Unidyne and the foundation, which is a damn sight more than
Joe Turtle or Caselle knew!
At least I'll know why
I'm being murdered.
I want that paper!
I don't have it anymore.
Pencil and paper.
You know what was on the paper, David.
Write it down.
Willard.
Give me your gun, Willard.
I have removed all of the bullets, except one.
All right, Willard. Slowly.
One at a time.
Pick up the pen, David.
Willard?
I'm not impressed, David.
You're a scientist. You knew the odds were in your favor for the first one.
But no one is bluffing. Not you, not me, and certainly not Willard.
Pick up the pen.
Willard?
For God's sake, David, what are you doing?
Don't do it! David!
Don't do it!
Charles!
I didn't kill him, Crawford.
You did!
You're still confused, David.
I wasn't there, you were.
You were there, Crawford.
Your sickness was inside him.
You're a carrier. You infected him, and he died from it.
And now it's your turn, unless you're interested in staying alive.
No?
Willard?
Wait... you idiot!
You damned idiot!
You just won't learn not to interfere, will you, Shela?
You always were too extravagant, but this time you're going to pay the bill.
For once in your life you've chosen the wrong side!
Now then, David, you were about to say something.
David, please give him what he wants!
Is that what you want?
I want you alive!
You're wasting time, David.
What's wrong, Major?
You look nervous.
Why should I be?
That's what I want to know.
Josephson?
Is that who you're worried about, Major?
Why should he worry about me?
Because I'm not on the hook anymore.
You are.
What are you talking about?
You've got the gun.
I don't know anything about killing, Major.
It won't be murder, Josephson.
David is intent on committing suicide.
No good, Josephson. there's no one else.
He's alone, except for you.
For once in your life, you've got power. Use it!
How?
He ordered two men killed.
That's first-degree murder!
We can get him, Josephson.
You and I.
Don't be an idiot, Josephson.
You'll have a job with Unidyne for as long as you live.
And how long do you think that will be?
You've hesitated too long.
He'll remember that.
One phone call, Josephson, and you're a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
One phone call and it'll be too late.
He won't be alone anymore...
Don't, Major.
Please don't.
All right, Josephson.
Now, you think about it.
You think about it carefully.
Commit, Josephson!
If you're not committed to anything, you're just taking up space!
Kill him.
If you can't, I will.
Are they making it tough for you?
No, I'm all right.
How about you?
Is Humpty Dumpty back together again?
I think so.
All the pieces seem to fit now.
Oh, David.
Do you know why it happened?
I believed in Charles Calvin so much that I...
I forgot he was only a human being.
What are you going to do now?
Go back to work, I guess.
I don't suppose you could use any help?
Who do you have in mind?
Well, you could run an ad in the times.
"Wanted, extremely lonely young lady
"with a fairly low opinion of herself due to many mistakes,
"willing to work long, hard hours."
Think I'd get any answers?
You might.
Oh, David. Help me.
Please help me.
We'll help each other.
That's really what it's all about, anyway.
-So long. We'll see you again.
-Goodbye.
Give me your money. Do it.
-Splendid.
-Thank you.
Blue 439.
-Blue 439. Over.
-Blue 439, go ahead, please. Over.
Phone Weston 0-21 9.
Tell him l'm on my way, will you?
Roger Wilco. Stand by.
-Hello, love.
-Hello.
-Get that stuff developed, will you?
-Yeah.
Right away.
Here l am.
Ready?
-l've been ready for nearly an hour.
-Good. l'm catching a plane for Paris at 1 1 , so l can't--
Can't what? lt doesn't matter.
Who the hell were you with last night?
Reg.
Reg, let's have some noise, can we?
Right.
That's good. That's good.
Hold that.
Reg.
Give it to me now.
Come on. That's good.
Hunch. Hunch more.
That's it. That's good.
That's good. And the hair back.
And the hair back.
That's great. That's great!
That's good. More of that.
Now give it to me. Really give it to me.
Come on, now.
As fast as you can, give it to me.
Come on, right forward.
That's good. This side. This side.
Lean right forward. Hand up.
That's great. Just touch the face.
That's very good.
And again around this way.
Touch the face again.
Good. Now the hair.
Marvelous. That's great.
Good. Yes, the hair.
Much more. Much more.
Good. Yes, that's great.
That's good. Yes. And again. And again.
Oh, hold that.
Hold the hair back. Again. Good.
Okay, Reg, 50.
On your back. On your back. Go on.
Yes. Now really give it to me. Come on.
Come on. Work, work, work!
Great. Great. And again.
Go on. Back. Back. Arms up.
Stretch yourself, little lady. Great.
And again. Go on. Go. Go.
That's great.
That's it. Keep it up. Lovely.
Yeah, make it come. Great.
No, no, head up. Head up.
Now for me, love. For me.
Now! Now! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Hello?
Yeah, hold on. lt's Peter.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, l've got it somewhere. l know l have.
Yeah, hold on.
Reg, take down the address of that bloody junk shop, would you?
Why, they're fabulous. Go on.
Yeah.
Yeah. Great.
Here. You can burn that lot.
Reg!
-Get the birds down, will you?
-Okay.
No chewing gum. Get rid of it.
And not on my floor.
You, arm down.
Right.
Six millimeter.
Terrible.
How about the leg a little further forward?
Put the head up.
Just go. Mouth open. Yes, good. Good.
No, you're all wrong. Start again.
Rethink it. Rethink it.
Stripes, let the dress just fall down.
Keep the stripes straight.
Just let your arms go up and down.
Yes, very tasty. Yes, l like it. l like it. Go on.
Yeah.
All right, change position.
Yep.
Wake up!
You can thank your lucky stars you're working with me, can't you?
All right, one more.
And let's smile now. Come on.
Smile.
Smile.
God. l asked you to smile.
What's the matter?
Have you forgotten what a smile is?
Hey?!
All right, you're all tired now.
Go on, relax. l can't see your eyeballs anymore.
They're just slits.
Go on.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
And stay like that. lt's good for you.
Close your eyes.
That must be five or six years old.
They don't mean anything when l do them. Just a mess.
Afterwards, l find something to hang on to, like that--
Quite like that leg.
Then it sorts itself out and adds up. lt's like finding a clue in a detective story.
Don't ask me about this one. l don't know yet.
-Can l buy it?
-No.
Will you give it to me?
There.
Tight-faced bastard.
He won't float me one of his crappy paintings. l'll creep down one night and knock it off.
Don't stop, it's lovely.
You look tired. l've been all night in a doss house.
They say they've been asked to come here.
-Not by me.
-Well, we weren't exactly asked.
Sorry, l'm busy.
They're printing some snaps for me upstairs. Go and fetch them.
Couldn't you give us just a couple of minutes?
A couple of minutes? l haven't even got a couple of minutes to have my appendix out.
-Well, when can we come then?
-Don't.
The others still waiting with their eyes shut?
Yes, they're waiting, but their eyes are open.
Good.
Tell them to shut them again.
Get rid of that bag. lt's diabolical.
Can we come back this afternoon?
-What do you want?
-Just looking around.
There are no cheap bargains here.
You're wasting your time.
Well, l'll just have a look.
What are you looking for?
-Pictures.
-No pictures.
What kind of pictures?
-Landscapes.
-Sorry, no landscapes.
Sold. All sold.
-You the owner?
-No, the owner is out.
Expecting him?
What are you doing?
Stop it! Stop it!
Give me those. You can't photograph people like that.
Who says l can't? l'm only doing my job.
Some people are bullfighters. . .
. . .some people are politicians. l'm a photographer.
This is a public place. Everyone has the right to be left in peace. lt's not my fault if there's no peace.
You know, most girls would pay me to photograph them. l'll pay you. l overcharge.
There are other things l want on the reel.
What do we do then? l send you the photographs.
No, l want them now.
No!
What's the rush?
Don't let's spoil everything.
We've only just met.
No, we haven't met.
You've never seen me.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-My agent saw you about this shop.
-Did he?
He's a man with a cigar.
Throws ash everywhere. l expect l remember him. l probably asked for too much money.
Money's always a problem, isn't it?
Tell him to come back.
Why are you selling? l'd like to try something different.
Get off somewhere. l'm fed up with antiques.
Get off where?
To Nepal.
Nepal is all antiques. ls it?
Perhaps l better try Morocco.
-How much?
-What?
The propeller.
You can have it for. . .
-. . .8 pounds.
-Right. You're in business.
-Have you got a van?
-You can't take it now. l must. l must.
-l can't live without it.
-Hard luck.
That'll teach you to fall in love with heavy things on Saturday mornings.
-ls that it?
-That's it.
You can't treat it like that. lt's not a delivery van.
-Who cares?
-Leave it to me.
Something will turn up.
Yes. All right, but it better turn up today.
Blue 439. Blue 439. Over.
439, go ahead, please. Over.
Hello, this is. . . .
Get me Flaxton 2-249.
Mr. Walker. Mr. Peter Walker.
Tell him l saw the junk shop. lt's pricey, but the kid will come down.
Let him ring her right away, then. . .
. . .nobody else will get it.
Roger Wilco. Stand by.
Blue 439. Blue 439. Over.
Blue 439. Blue 439. Go ahead, echo.
Blue 439, message passed. The number stored. Your caller doesn 't like it.
Tell him to get stuffed.
What about all the buildings going up around the place?
Already there are queers and poodles in the area. l saw some in the couple of minutes l was there.
-lt'll go like a bomb. Over.
-Blue 439. What is in the area? Over.
-Forget it. Over.
-Roger Wilco. Standing by.
You want to use the lot?
Don't you like them?
They're great.
We'll use three or four.
Spread through the book?
No. All together.
Yeah.
-And a pint.
-Yes, sir.
Which one last?
None of this lot. l've got something fab for the end. ln a park. l only took them this morning.
You'll get them later today. lt's very peaceful, very still.
And the rest of the book will be pretty violent, so it's best to end it like that.
Yes.
That's best.
Rings truer. l'm going off London this week.
Why? lt doesn't do anything for me.
Yeah.
-l've knocked up a few captions.
-Yeah? l'm fed up with those bloody bitches. l wish l had tons of money.
Then l'd be free.
Free to do what?
Free like him?
Someone we know?
That'll be all right.
Hello. Could you get me
Frobershire 3-229, please? l've only got a sixpence.
Park 1 296.
Hello. lt's me.
Weren't you supposed to be going off to Hurley?
Listen, stay where you are.
Call me soon at home. l've come. . . . l've come for the photographs.
How did you manage to find me?
Do you live here?
Drink?
What's so important about my bloody pictures?
That's my business.
The light was very beautiful in the park this morning.
Those shots should be very good.
Anyway, l need them.
My private life's already in a mess. lt would be a disaster if. . . .
So what?
Nothing like a little disaster for sorting things out.
Have you ever done any modeling?
Fashion stuff, l mean.
You've got it.
Hold that.
Not many girls can stand as well as that.
No, thanks. l'm in a hurry.
You'll get your pictures. l promise. l always keep my word.
Come here.
Show me how you sit.
Who is it?
Oh, yes. That's right. Hold on a second. ls it for me? lt's my wife.
Why should l speak to her?
Sorry, love.
The bird l'm with won't talk to you.
She isn't my wife, really.
We just have some kids.
No.
No kids. Not even kids.
Sometimes, though, it feels as if we had kids.
She isn't beautiful. She's. . .
. . .easy to live with.
No, she isn't.
That's why l don't live with her.
But even with beautiful girls. . .
. . .you look at them, and that's that.
That's why they always end up by. . . .
And l'm stuck with them all day long. lt would be the same with men.
Have a listen to this.
No. Keep still. Keep still.
Listen and keep still.
You can smoke if you like.
Slowly. Slowly.
Against the beat.
That's it. l can't stand it. l'm nervous enough as it is.
Can l have some water?
And l'm not a fool, love.
Can l have the photographs?
Of course.
Later.
Your boyfriend's a bit past it.
Why didn't you say what you want?
Get dressed. l'll cut out the negatives you want.
They'll go.
They're not going.
Don't go.
-Have you bought a propeller?
-What?
You bought a propeller this morning, right?
Oh, yes.
You'll have to give us a hand with it.
-All right?
-Fine. Yeah.
What's it for?
Nothing. lt's beautiful. lf l had a big room like this, l'd hang it from the ceiling like a fan.
-Do you live on your own?
-No.
Perhaps l'll put it there like a piece of sculpture. lt'll look good there. lt'll break up the straight lines.
-Are you going?
-lt's late.
Do l see you again?
Well, at least tell me your name or your telephone number.
Thank you.
Hello?
Knightsbridge 1 -239.
What?
No, l'm sorry.
Ron?
Something fantastic's happened.
Those photographs in the park, fantastic!
Somebody was trying to kill somebody else. l saved his life.
Listen, Ron, there was a girl.
Ron, will you listen?
What makes it so fantastic--
Look, hang on, will you, Ron?
There's somebody at the door.
You weren't expecting us, were you?
No.
Can you manage to make a cup of coffee? l can make an lrish coffee, if you'd like.
Right, come on.
-She always like that?
-Like what?
Doesn't speak.
What's your name?
Forget it.
What's the use of her name?
What do they call you in bed? l only go to bed to sleep.
Hello?
Hello?
Look at all these clothes.
No.
-Hey, how about this one?
-Put it on.
What about you?
Help yourself.
The coffee!
What's happening?
-What's the matter?
-She's got a better figure than me!
Go on, whack her.
Go on, give her the left hook.
We'll put you in the ring together.
Oh, no!
Hold her legs!
No! No!
-Hold her legs!
-No!
No! No! No!
Let go of me.
Right, let's move.
Out.
-But you haven't taken any photos.
-No, l'm too whacked. lt's your own faults.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow!
Were you looking for something just now?
No.
Do you ever think of leaving him?
No, l don't think so. l saw a man killed this morning.
Where?
Shot. ln some sort of park.
Are you sure?
He's still there.
Who was he?
Someone.
How did it happen? l don't know, l didn't see.
You didn't see.
No.
Shouldn't you call the police?
That's the body.
Looks like one of Bill's paintings.
Yes.
Will you help me? l don't know what to do.
What is it? l wonder why they shot him. l didn't ask.
Hello, Ron?
Oh, hello, love. ls Ron there?
No, l just wanted to take him somewhere. Where is he?
Okay, l'll fetch him there.
Bye-bye, love.
Give them the song again.
Ron.
Give me a minute, will you?
Ron.
Someone's been killed.
Now, would you--?
Okay.
Okay.
Listen.
Those pictures l took in the park-- l thought you were supposed to be in Paris. l am in Paris.
Here. Have a drag. l want you to see the corpse.
We've got to get a shot of it. l'm not a photographer. l am.
What's the matter with him?
What did you see in that park?
Nothing.
Ron.

[ENGLlSH]
Inaccessible sort of place.
Very remote.
Gentlemen, my name is Grohmann.
Shall I offer you drinks or show you to your rooms?
I think we would prefer first of all to meet our host.
I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Owen isn't here.
- Not here?
- Where is he?
- Extraordinary.
- When do you expect him?
This evening, sir.
- Has he been delayed?
- I really couldn't say, sir.
- Oh, come, come. What's your name?
- Grohmann, sir.
Well, Grohmann, you must have some instructions.
My instructions are to make you all comfortable.
I understand Mr. Owen will be here for dinner.
Oh. Well, that's better.
Is it? I find it is a singular lapse of manners:
A house party, and the host the last to arrive.
- It happens.
- Not to me, young man.
What sort of chap is our absent host?
I haven't had the pleasure.
Strangely, neither have I.
What's he like, Grohmann?
I have no idea, sir.
My wife and I, we are hired by an agency in Vienna two days ago.
We've never met Mr. Owen.
I trust you'll be comfortable.
If there's anything you want, please ring.
By the way, I'm Ann Clyde,
Mr. Owen's secretary.
Did he leave any instructions for me?
No, miss. We want a word with Mr. Owen ourselves when he arrives.
They never told us at the agency the size of this place...
...or that we'd have to look after eight guests.
I don't think that's any of our concern.
Miss Clyde, shall we join the others?
Bitch.
I think I'll have trouble with Her Ladyship before the weekend's over.
Tell me about your Mr. Owen.
What's he like?
My dears, you look absolutely stricken.
I'm sure you all know the story...
...of the two Englishmen cast away on a desert island...
...who never spoke to each other, because they hadn't been introduced.
We were just about to perform that task.
Well, since I'm not English,
I'll break the ice. I'm Hugh Lombard.
Dr. Edward Armstrong.
- Judge Cannon.
- How do you do, sir?
General Sir John Mandrake.
Blore, William Henry.
Ann Clyde.
This lady, I'm sure we all know.
We've admired you on the screen,
Miss Bergen.
- Thank you, judge.
- Well, I guess that leaves only me.
You've probably all heard of
Mike Raven and The Blackbirds.
No? Where's everybody been lately?
- You a singer?
- Yeah.
Number three on the charts last week.
"Why Does My Baby Do This to Me
When We Could Be in Love?"
A mixed gathering.
Now, some of us don't know our host.
Perhaps those who do could tell us something about him.
Well, he's a rich guy. Eccentric.
At least that's what I've been told.
- But you haven't met him?
- Well, no.
He called up my agent to come over to talk over a deal.
Ticket paid for, all set up.
May I ask if any others know Mr. Owen?
How utterly marvelous.
You all came to a house party without knowing your host.
Well, what about you, Miss Bergen?
Darling, it happens to me all the time.
But, of course, one of us does know the mysterious Mr. Owen.
His secretary.
- Then satisfy our curiosity, my dear.
- I'm afraid I can't.
I was engaged through an agency in London.
This is quite ridiculous.
I have a good mind to leave at once.
Yeah, but what about the snow?
That, I assure you, sir, would not deter me.
I've never known such a situation.
Well, Grohmann did say he'd be here for dinner.
- Quite right, so he did.
- In that case, let's settle in, find our rooms.
You rang, sir?
Good Lord.
All right, I am ready to see my room now.
I think we all are.
Unless you're thinking of leaving us, general?
Gentlemen, would you please follow me?
If you just started working for Mr. Owen, you didn't send out the invitations.
No, I didn't, Mr. Lombard. Why?
Just curious.
I think you have the wrong bag,
Mr. Lombard.
Very observant, aren't you, Mr. Blore?
"C.M."?
Yes, that's right. Charles Morley.
A friend of mine.
I borrowed it and forgot to return it.
You know how it is?
Besides, it's pigskin.
Oh, I beg your pardon, doctor.
I thought it was a cupboard.
It seems we're sharing a bathroom, doctor.
Oh, I didn't know.
I was just taking a pill. Slight headache.
Yes, it's the traveling, you know.
Affects me the same way.
I've got a bit of a headache too.
You haven't got another pill by any chance?
I'm afraid that was the last.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
A stiff whiskey and soda before dinner might do the trick, eh?
Yes.
- Mr. Blore?
- Yes?
- The bathroom is yours.
- Thank you.
Ten little Indians went out to dine
One choked his little self
Then there were nine
We could have stayed in Vienna all along.
You said it was safer to take another job.
Will you shut up?
They didn't suspect us there.
We were safe.
We won't be safe here if you open your mouth much louder in this house.
Now, get on with your work.
Just terrific!
Try Ann Clyde.
She's more in your league.
Hey, we professionals should stick together.
The rest of this party's pretty square.
Down, boy. Down.
What is your league, Mr. Lombard?
General. Going hunting?
Our Mr. Owen seems to keep quite a considerable armory.
Rather different from our last meeting.
Our last meeting?
I don't remember.
Oh, come now.
When I was stationed in Berlin?
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
Excuse me.
It seems we're dining with the 10 little Indians but without our host.
Pity. He missed a jolly good meal.
Yes, indeed. Give our congratulations to your wife, would you?
Thank you, sir.
But, doctor, you haven't joined us in this excellent wine.
Water never hurt anybody, Miss Bergen, especially in my profession.
You have a point there.
Keeps the old hand steady, eh?
May I propose a little toast?
To absent friends, the 10 little Indians and, of course, our host.
- To our host.
- Absent friends.
I hope Mr. Owen isn't lost in the snowstorm.
- You could lose your job.
- Don't jinx it, Mr. Lombard.
Come on. Let's cut out the formality, huh?
- Hugh.
- I'm Ann.
- Hi, Ann. Cigarette?
- Thanks.
- Now, how does that old song go?
- My dear sir, what old song?
Well, you know, sir.
The old nursery rhyme,
"The Ten Little Indians."
There's a copy of the rhyme hanging on the wall in my room upstairs.
That's funny.
There's a copy in my room too.
- And mine.
- Well, then who's with it?
Who's got the first line?
Ten little Indians went out to dine
One choked his little self
And then there were nine
That's it. Strictly Nurseryville.
Then what happened?
Nine little Indians
Staying up quite late
One went away
And then there were eight
There's a copy of the song on the piano in the lounge too.
Mr. Owen seems very interested in little Indians.
Eight little Indians
Traveling to heaven
One met a pussycat
Then there were seven
Seven little Indians
Chopping up sticks
The chopper finished one of them
And then there were six
Six little Indians
Playing with the hive
A bumblebee stung one
And then there were five
Five little Indians
Going in for law
One got chancery
And then there were four
Four little Indians
Feeling ill at sea
A red herring swallowed one
And then there were three
Three little Indians
Walking in the zoo
A big bear hugged one
Then there were two
Two little Indians
Sitting in the sun
One gets all frizzled up
Then there was one
It's all right, general.
He's down to his last little Indian.
Thank God for that.
One little Indian boy
Left all alone
So he went out and hanged himself
And then there were none
And now, sir, will you be good enough to cease that infernal noise?
My public. Bless them.
Wonderful.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your host speaking.
My name is U.N. Owen.
I have brought you here
to charge you with the following crimes.
General Sir John Mandrake, BC.
That you achieved honor
from dishonor...
... and sent five men
to their certain death.
Ilona Bergen, actress.
That you did bring about
the death of your husband...
... in a most cold-blooded
and ruthless manner.
Dr. Edward Armstrong.
That you did kill Mrs. Ivy Benson...
... and betray your sacred trust.
Arthur Cannon,
judge of the Queen's Bench.
That you were responsible for the death
of an innocent man, one Edward Seton...
... who was hanged
according to your judgment.
Michael Raven, entertainer.
That you were guilty of the murder
of William and Lisa Stern.
Ann Clyde, secretary.
That you murdered
your sister's fiancé, Richard Barkley.
Hugh Lombard, engineer.
That you are guilty
of the death of Jennifer Hayes...
... who was to bear your child
out of wedlock.
William Blore, detective.
That, by perjured testimony,
you sent James Landor...
... to a cold and lonely death
in a prison cell.
Joseph and Elsa Grohmann.
That you maliciously
and brutally caused the death...
... of your invalid employer,
the Countess Wallenstein.
- Prisoners at the bar...
- Where is it coming from?
... have you anything to say
in your defense?
Here it is.
I think she'll be all right for the moment.
- Blore, detective.
That, by perjured testimony, you sent...
- It's a bloody lie.
- What's going on here?
- It's on this tape.
- A practical joke.
One in very poor taste, if I may say so, gentlemen.
May I ask who put that tape on the machine?
It was you, Grohmann.
Come on, tell the truth.
No, not me. It was there.
- Did you switch it on?
- Yes, sir.
- Why?
- I didn't know what it was. I really didn't.
I was just obeying orders.
Before God, I swear.
Whose orders?
Mr. Owen's.
Let's get this quite clear.
Mr. Owen ordered you to switch this on?
It was written down for me, sir.
"Put on this switch at 9:00."
I thought it is music.
I'm telling the truth.
I've never met him.
My wife will tell you. Elsa.
I told you we shouldn't have come.
- We shouldn't have come here!
- Elsa.
Look after her, Grohmann.
What about the rest of us?
The rest of us had better go and sit down and consider our position.
Yes, indeed.
- We've got to get away.
- We are not the only ones in trouble.
- Sit tight.
- We could've stayed in Vienna.
- I don't care about the countess's money.
- Shut up!
You said we got away with it!
Now, we all know how the servants came to be here...
...and, of course, Miss Clyde, hired by an agency.
I suggest the rest of us explain our presence.
Very simple, sir.
I received a letter from Mr. Owen asking me to join his house party...
...and claiming friendship with a very old and dear friend of mine...
...who was also to be here.
Like I told you, my European agent fixed it.
I had a week free between engagements in Paris and Vienna.
And you, doctor?
Frankly, I came in a professional capacity.
I was asked to join the guests...
...but in fact to make a medical examination of Mr. Owen.
Oh, he needs a psychiatrist but bad.
Knock it off, huh?
And you, Mr. Lombard?
Like the general, I had a letter claiming he was a friend of a friend.
We've all been taken for the same ride.
I've been told I'd be meeting important people from the film business.
And I expected to meet some legal friends.
What about Mr. Blore?
We haven't heard his explanation.
Well, I see no reason to conceal it any longer. I'm here to do a job.
He's a cop.
You can smell him a mile off.
I beg your pardon, young man.
Private inquiry agent.
Quite a respectable mode of life to be in.
I was hired.
- By whom?
- By this Mr. Owen.
- So you met him?
- No, Your Honor, no.
He enclosed a fat money order with this letter.
He told me to join the party as one of the guests.
To spy on us?
Could be, sir. Could be.
I run a reputable agency in London, and I have my credentials.
Look at the signature on this letter.
"U.N. Owen."
Well, by a small stretch of imagination,
"U.N. Owen" might stand for "unknown."
Not only has Mr. Unknown enticed us here under false pretenses...
...he has also taken the trouble to find out a great deal about us.
- It's a pack of lies.
- Quite fantastic.
Oh, I don't know.
Ten little skeletons in 10 little closets.
I don't think you'd better drink any more.
And I think you're dead sexy.
Please, Mr. Raven.
You know, I'm still not clear as to Mr. Unknown's purpose...
...in bringing us all together here.
In my opinion, this person, whoever it may be...
...is out of his mind.
Anyway, and whatever his purpose...
...I think it would be as well for all of us to leave at once.
I quite agree.
Miss Clyde, as you're there...
...press the bell for Grohmann, would you, please?
You're quite right, gentlemen.
We can't spend the night here.
We ought to try and find a hotel down below.
- Grohmann.
- Sir?
How far is the nearest village from here?
Fifteen miles from the bottom cable station, sir.
I see. Would you be so kind as to telephone for the sleighs?
We all wish to leave.
I can't, sir.
The telephone is not working.
Can't you get a message down by cable car?
No, sir. There's no one there.
And there won't be until Monday morning...
...when the sleigh arrives with supplies.
Monday morning?
But it's only Friday night.
I'll take the cable car down in the morning and try to find some transportation.
Nothing we can do until then.
Hey! Who wants to leave, man?
This is a gas.
Why don't we get to the bottom of this mystery?
At our time of life, sir, we have no desire for a gas, as you call it.
What's the matter, judge, lost your sense of adventure?
Too long in those dusty old courtrooms.
Not me. I'm all for kicks.
Your Honor.
Now, I don't know about the rest of you...
...but that tape didn't tell any lies about me, my lovelies.
Allow me to confess.
It all happened about a year ago in London.
I was on my way back from a party. Late, drunk.
And I was driving fast. Very fast.
Two people on the road ahead.
- What happened?
- I ran over them.
William and Lisa Stern.
Two years married. Very sad.
Were you charged?
Yeah, a whitewash job, but they punished me.
- How?
- They took away my driving license.
- Good Lord.
- See what's the matter with him.
- What's the matter with him?
- The fellow's intoxicated. Disgusting.
He's dead drunk.
No, Miss Bergen. Not drunk.
Just dead.
- What did he say?
- He's snuffed it. Dead.
Doctor.
Judge.
Insomnia?
Curiosity.
Honesty is undoubtedly the best policy, doctor.
- And you?
- A certain sense of claustrophobia.
A feeling that some sort of macabre joke is being played on us.
Good Lord.
Ten little Indians went out to dine
One of them choked himself
And then there were nine
A macabre joke, you said?
Let me show you something else.
Don't touch that.
Mr. Blore.
We thought you'd gone to bed.
In my profession, gentlemen, we don't always do what we appear to do.
- Apparently.
- Perhaps it's the same in yours.
Why don't you want me to touch this glass?
I don't think it'd be advisable to have your fingerprints on it.
But they're already there.
Oh, you've examined it?
Of course.
May I?
Just a minute.
Thank you.
Almonds, doctor.
A solution of cyanide.
How clever of you not to alarm the others.
Suicide, doctor?
That, I believe, comes under your profession, Mr. Blore.
Hi.
Don't do that again, please.
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep either.
I thought I heard somebody moving about.
Must have been you.
- Glass of milk?
- Thank you.
By the way, what was said about me on that tape, it wasn't true.
You do believe me, don't you?
Of course.
Well, happy days.
And what about you and that girl?
Jennifer Hayes?
That wasn't true, was it?
What do you think?
Oh, I saw the light.
I thought it's Elsa, my wife.
- What's the matter?
- She's missing.
I've searched all over the house.
She is gone.
- The car's nearly halfway down.
- Hugh, look!
It's been cut.
It'll break any minute!
- You can't get her back.
- I can't leave her there!
And then there were eight
And now we are eight.
I told her she had to stay...
...but she wouldn't listen.
She ran away.
We're all very sorry, Grohmann.
Yes, indeed. Damn sorry.
Now we're really cut off.
Perhaps it's what our host intended.
Well, what are we going to do about it?
We've got to do something.
I quite agree.
The only question is, what?
We're entirely without means of communication.
But surely, when they see the cable's broken, they'll send help.
But that may not be for a few days.
Nobody's due until Monday.
There's one thing this fellow Owen forgot.
If we're cut off, so is he.
He's a nut, and we've got to catch him.
You mean he's here, hiding somewhere in the house?
There was nobody when we...
When we arrived.
How can you be sure?
He could have hidden himself before you got here.
Yes, we must search the house, organize it properly.
But before we do that...
...there's one thing
I'd like to say to you all.
Last night we heard a series of accusations.
Lies. False accusations.
Absolute lies.
Were they, doctor?
I wonder.
One man said not...
...and he's dead.
For my own part...
...I must confess to a certain degree of guilt.
I was young.
Still only a captain, in fact.
It was an error of judgment.
Five men were killed.
- General.
- No, sir, I wish to speak.
They were killed...
...my nerve broke, and I fled.
Because nobody knew the truth...
...I was decorated and promoted.
How does this help?
It helps me to be able to talk about it at last.
It may help you to do the same.
Mr. Owen seems to know a great deal about each of us.
If we all say just what is in our minds...
...it might help us to find a common link which would identify him.
Is there anyone else who wishes to speak?
Very well.
Then we form two search parties.
I'll take charge of one.
Lombard, you take the other.
We'll start at the top of the house and work down.
Right.
Blimey, you could hide a regiment down here.
Creepy, isn't it?
Come on.
Oh, here they are.
Here are the others.
- Any success, Mr. Lombard?
- No, nothing.
We've cleared the top of the house.
There's no one there.
- Where's the general?
- Search us.
- We thought he was with you.
- No, we must have got separated.
- General?
- General Mandrake?
Here I am.
We thought we'd lost you.
Just doing a little reconnaissance.
It's a regular maze down here.
There's so much area to cover that I think we should vary our tactic...
...and split into pairs for this.
My dear, will you come with me?
Ann?
- Shall we go together, judge?
- By all means.
That leaves me and you.
Right, we all take different directions.
Judge. Blore. Lombard.
Stand by, everyone.
Rendezvous back here in 10 minutes.
Move off.
The general's having the time of his life.
Why did you pick me, Sir John?
What's the use of carrying a secret inside you, Miss Bergen...
...when it turns into a cancer?
You have no right to talk like that.
Alone among all of us, I have the right.
You see, we both know what happened to your husband in Berlin.
Wait here.
Miss Bergen?
Miss Bergen?
Who's that?
- What's that?
- Sounds like a cat.
- Hugh, are you there?
- I'm right behind you.
- Doctor? Doctor, where is everybody?
- Over here. They're over here.
- Very well.
- Yes, yes.
Miss Bergen? General Mandrake?
- Where could they be?
- General?
- Why didn't you wait?
- Let's not get separated like this again.
- Is everybody here?
- Where is the general?
- Don't say we've lost him again.
- He was with you, miss.
I got confused in the dark.
Look. His torch.
Judge.
Is he dead?
Yes, he's dead.
Well, I'd better make certain.
Somebody already has made certain, doctor.
Three dead.
No longer a macabre joke.
Apparently Mr. Owen believes we're guilty of certain crimes.
Which the law cannot touch.
The whole thing's barmy.
Nevertheless, that's why he's trapped us here...
...to execute justice?
I'll tell you one thing, there's no one in this house.
We've searched the place from top to bottom.
No one?
In the sense you mean, no.
But I'm now quite certain that Mr. Owen is here.
How can he be?
An invisible man, judge?
Not invisible, Mr. Lombard.
But isn't it obvious
Mr. Owen is one of us?
Hey, watch it.
- You could cause a nasty accident.
- Blore, have you been in my room?
- What the hell would I be in your room for?
- Somebody went through my things.
And what did they find, Mr. Lombard?
My butterfly net.
- Who is it?
- Hugh.
Just a moment.
Come in. I'm nearly ready.
Take your time.
It's gonna be a long evening.
Yes.
- What's that perfume you're wearing?
- Mitsuko.
- Do you like it?
- Very much.
Could you help me?
Sure.
Hugh?
Do you really think Mr. Owen could be one of us?
Yes.
Then it must be one of five people.
Seven.
Seven?
It doesn't have to be a man.
Do you really believe it could be me?
Am I disturbing your game?
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather be disturbed by, my dear.
Snooker. It all seems so normal.
Not exactly, my dear Miss Bergen.
We've come to the conclusion, the doctor and myself...
...that this whole story is a game of the mind.
We've formed a theory, which I'd like to demonstrate, if I may...
...with these 10 snooker balls.
Now, eight of us came here. Right?
The Grohmanns were waiting for us.
That makes 10.
And one of this 10 is our Mr. Owen.
Three of the 10 are cleared.
- The dead ones.
- Exactly.
Mr. Raven...
...Frau Grohmann...
...General Mandrake.
- Seven little Indians.
- Six.
One of them is bogus.
You're quite correct, sir.
One of them is Mr. Owen.
But which one?
Now come the alibis.
What's yours, doctor?
I resent that, Blore.
I'm a professional man.
My dear doctor, that proves less than nothing.
Doctors have gone mad before.
Judges have gone mad.
So have policemen.
And, if I may say so, even actresses.
Frequently.
In fact, some say the sane ones are in the minority.
What about Lombard?
Yes, indeed. What about Lombard?
Is this a private inquisition, or can anybody join in?
And what about me?
No one's excluded. We're all eligible.
The answer is, we must suspect each and every one of us.
- Has anybody mentioned Grohmann?
- That's just what I was thinking.
He did put the tape in the machine.
Grohmann or his wife could have leased the schloss and pretended to be servants.
You're forgetting.
His wife was one of the victims.
In my time, Miss Clyde,
I've had many husbands before me...
...guilty of murdering their wives.
Let's have him in here and have this out.
No, no, we must watch and wait and be on our guard.
Otherwise, we'll all go the same way.
And Mr. Owen will be in this house all alone.
Grohmann.
It's time you and I had a little talk.
Do you want to ask me questions?
Nothing in particular, no.
Plenty of food in the larder?
Enough for the guests who are left.
What? Oh, good. Good.
Keep the housekeeping bills down, eh?
Do you think I could kill three people from whose death I cannot even profit?
Now, dear boy, there's no need to be like that.
We thought you might know a way down.
- We can't stay here.
- There's no path you could travel.
Then there is a way.
Dangerous even for an expert climber.
You could be sure of death on the Devil's Leap, Mr. Blore.
Devil's Leap? That's well-named.
Tell me, who leapt?
People who were tired of life.
- Is that all?
- Yes.
- Now you might answer me a question.
- Of course.
How many do you think there will be for dinner tonight?
- Grohmann, some more wine.
- I thought you didn't drink, doctor.
Never touch it...
...except under difficult circumstances.
Thank you.
For God's sake, when will this ever end?
Exactly.
Are we going to sit around trying to guess who is Mr. Owen...
...while we're murdered one by one?
There must be some way out of here.
According to Grohmann, there isn't.
Unless anyone's an expert climber.
Thank you.
Wait. I've got it.
- No, I haven't.
- I wish you'd stop doing that, Blore.
Well, perhaps I have.
How is Mr. Owen going to get out of here afterwards?
Anyone tell me that?
- By climbing, perhaps.
- How else?
He wouldn't wait for a rescue party...
...so how does he plan to get away?
Climbing? Well, that lets me out.
And us, too, eh, judge?
What about you, Mr. Lombard?
I've done some climbing.
I guess Grohmann has too.
You suspect me?
You can go to hell!
Hey, come on, pal.
Take it easy.
Grohmann.
Stop it. Stop it, you two.
Hugh!
Now you asked for it, buster.
Disgraceful.
Not you, Mr. Lombard.
You were absolutely marvelous.
You've taken to it,
I see, doctor.
Under the circumstances, wouldn't you, Mr. Blore?
That fellow, Grohmann, we'll have to watch him.
Leave it to me, Your Honor.
I'll deal with him.
Well, I'm off to bed.
- Good night, Mr. Blore.
- Good night, Your Honor.
- Good night, doctor.
- Good night.
Cold.
Yes, cold. Quite cold.
- Lonely.
- And Ionely. Quite, quite Ionely.
- It might not be Grohmann.
- It might not be.
Then who?
Tell me, doctor, do you lock your door at night?
Invariably. Do you?
I think I will tonight.
After you, doctor.
No, after you, judge.
- Let's go together, shall we?
- Thank you.
Go!
Where have you been?
To look at the weather.
It's still snowing.
I know. I saw that from my window.
I also wanted some fresh air before breakfast.
Yes, talking of breakfast, where's Grohmann this morning?
Grohmann?
Groh... Grohmann?
Where are you?
How did you sleep last night, judge?
Sound as a bell. And you?
- Any dreams?
- I never dream.
I'm happy someone slept well.
I didn't.
He's gone, hopped it.
- Who's gone?
- Grohmann.
Grohmann? Then he must have found that mountain path. What's it called?
- The Devil's Leap.
- That's it.
- Perhaps he'll get through and send help.
- I wouldn't count on it.
Come take a look in here.
Yes, there's another one broken.
Could be a trick.
One Indian broken.
What does that prove?
You said yourself that Grohmann had disappeared.
Perhaps he has hidden somewhere, waiting to bump the rest of us off.
- Or perhaps... You saw him.
- No, I didn't.
What's all this about?
Miss Bergen was outside.
I saw her coming in.
That's right. I was on the terrace for five minutes.
- In the snow?
- Yes.
And you were supposed to be with
General Mandrake when he was killed.
Yes, what about that, Miss Bergen?
- Is this a trial?
- I'm afraid Mr. Owen planned it that way.
The tape recording accused you of killing your husband. Did you?
What happened to my husband has nothing to do with the deaths in this house.
Then it's true.
- But it wasn't murder.
- What was it, then?
It started with ambition, I suppose.
That's one name for it.
There are other dirtier names.
No, I won't make excuses like the rest of you.
I always wanted to be an actress.
I met a young British army officer from a wealthy family...
...who I thought could help my career.
I let him fall in love with me...
...and I married him.
I became an officer's wife.
Oh, it was so dull.
General Mandrake would have understood what I mean.
The general?
Yes.
He was my husband's commanding officer.
I met a film producer in Berlin where my husband was stationed.
He got me an offer of work in Hollywood...
...and I decided to take it.
Oh, my husband was a weak fool.
I told him I was going to leave him.
And that he meant nothing to me.
And when I was through...
...he took a shotgun and blew his head off.
You're all looking at me.
But if Mr. Owen is right...
...every one of you is a murderer.
One by one, we make our confessions.
Six little Indian boys
Playing with a hive
Bumblebee stung one
And then there were five
At least there's not much chance of that happening in midwinter.
That's true enough.
- Well, how about some breakfast, eh?
- Good idea.
What do you want?
No.
Hugh! Judge!
Mr. Blore, where are the others?
- I haven't seen them.
- Look.
Five? Impossible.
Hugh.
- Ilona.
- What happened?
Here's your bumblebee...
...and this was the sting.
- One of yours, doctor?
- Yes.
- Must have been stolen from my room.
- Oh, my God.
You're quite right, Miss Clyde.
We can no longer trust anyone.
Oh, can't you stop pacing about?
How you two can play snooker at a time like this, I don't know.
- What else is there to do?
- It's a game of the mind, Mr. Blore.
Good shot, doctor.
I think the best thing for you tonight is to stay in your room with the door locked.
It didn't help Ilona.
No, it didn't.
Well, then. I'll stay with you.
That's very tempting.
But who would make up the third?
I don't know what you mean.
Surely it's obvious.
Mr. Owen always manages to be alone with his victims.
When there's a third person present, nothing happens.
Then aren't you a little bit nervous about being down here alone with me now?
But we're not alone.
I asked Mr. Blore to keep an eye on us.
He's my third person.
Hugh!
- Blore.
- What?
What the devil's happened to the lights?
It's a generator.
Maybe we're running out of fuel.
We must keep every light burning tonight.
- You know where the generator is?
- Don't worry, I'll find it.
- Do you know anything about electricity?
- I'm a dab hand at most things, judge.
Don't do that, doctor.
- I'm only trying to save the fuel.
- I should leave it alone if I were you.
You said you'd watch me.
What's happening to the lights?
- It's the generator. Where's Lombard?
- Down there somewhere.
You go to your room and lock the door.
I'll fix the lights.
Oh, it's hopeless.
- Where's Ann?
- I don't know.
What about Blore?
Blore went downstairs to find the generator.
What's wrong, doctor?
Oh, I see.
We're alone, you and I.
Lombard.
- Where's Ann?
- Don't come any closer.
- Where is she?
- Keep back.
- lf you don't tell me, I swear, I'll kill you.
- Make another move, and I'll brain you.
Listen, doctor.
If you are Mr. Owen, tell me.
I promise I won't say a word to the others.
Stop playing cat and mouse with me.
If you want to kill the others,
I won't interfere.
I might even help you, if you'll let me live.
- You trust me, and I'll trust you, eh?
- Well, yes. Perhaps.
- That's more reasonable.
- No, no. Don't come any closer.
I keep telling you, she's up in her room.
If that's the truth, then we're idiots.
I still want to be a living idiot.
Listen.
Hugh. Thank God.
Miss Clyde, I told you to stay in your room.
- What's he doing with that?
- What?
Oh, it's all right now.
- I'll take you upstairs.
- No, you'll wait till I fix this generator.
Don't mess with it if you don't know what you're doing.
Don't bother me. I get it.
You idiot.
- Stay where you are.
- I haven't moved an inch.
Both of us stay where we are until the lights come on.
- Do you think they will?
- Why not?
This is no accident. Somebody wants the house in darkness tonight.
But, my dear doctor,
Mr. Owen has made a mistake.
What do you mean, made a mistake?
This trick of putting out the lights.
It clears two people.
- You and me?
- Now we can trust one another, can't we?
His idea was to keep us in fear.
And we can form an alliance...
To catch the murderer.
Yes.
Oh, thank you, Miss Clyde.
- Who will speak first?
- I will.
The doctor and I have come to certain conclusions.
We believe that the onset of this nightmare...
...lies somewhere on that tape recording.
Now what are you two up to?
We want to hear from each of you the truth regarding those accusations.
You'll recall that Mr. Owen claimed I was responsible for the death...
...of a certain Edward Seton.
Well, it's perfectly true.
He was hanged, and he was innocent.
Then why was he hanged?
He was an evil fellow, morally reprehensible.
I allowed my own personal feelings to influence the jury...
...and I sentenced him to death...
...knowing him to be guilty of many crimes...
...but not of murder.
We've got to speak the truth.
Our fate depends on it.
We are convinced of that.
In my case, the tape recording didn't lie either.
I operated on a woman, under the influence of...
I was guilty, all right...
...of being drunk.
- I don't see where this is getting us.
- Sit down, Mr. Blore.
I didn't kill anybody.
If I were you, I'd tell the truth.
We're listening, Mr. Blore.
All right.
I did put the finger on this chap.
But I was mixed up with a race-course gang who were out to get him.
I knew he was innocent...
...but because of my testimony, they sent him up for 10 years, that's all.
AII? He died in prison, didn't he?
Well, how could I know that would happen?
Who told you?
Wait a minute.
What about you, Mr. Lombard?
What about that girl who was supposed to be having your baby?
Don't get so excited, Blore.
Mr. Lombard's not denying it.
That's the first thing you've said that I've believed.
- You're not leaving us, Miss Clyde?
- Not yet, I hope.
- I feel so cold.
- My poor girl, you're shivering.
Would you like us to postpone this inquiry while you fetch a coat?
Thank you.
- Stay here, Mr. Lombard.
- Why?
Well, nothing can happen to us as long as we're all in this room, can it?
Sit down.
- Who's that?
- Me, Lombard.
- Have you got a match?
- I think so.
Where's the judge?
- I don't know. Where's Blore?
- How the devil can anyone see in this dark?
- Did you hear a shot?
- Sounded like it.
Where have you been?
Looking for Miss Clyde.
She's not in her room.
- Did you hear a shot?
- It sounded to me like something falling.
For God's sake, where's Ann?
Ann! Ann!
Hugh.
Miss Clyde, what happened?
Don't be frightened, honey.
What was it?
The candle blew out...
...and I felt something touch me like...
Like a hand.
- Where were you?
- By my door.
Hold on. I'll soon find out what it is.
- Jehoshaphat, what's that?
- That must have been what frightened me.
Yes, but who put it there?
Where's the judge?
I thought he was with us.
So did I. He was just behind us on the stairs.
I thought he was too, until I heard the shot.
The shot.
That's what he's up to. It's him.
Yes. The ruddy old fox,
I thought he knew too much.
Don't you see?
He shot at us in the dark.
He'll pot us off like clay pigeons if we go down there.
And with that candle, we'd make a very easy target.
We'll soon find out.
Stay back.
Judge, we know you're there.
- We're coming down.
- You can't kill all of us!
Hugh, look.
Hold this.
- It's my gun.
- Yours?
- One shot fired.
- There's not a sound down there.
- Where is he?
- Where's his room?
Over there.
Judge?
He's been shot through the head.
Now there are four.
If we all sit together tonight and tomorrow until help comes, nothing could happen.
Until we fall asleep, miss.
Then the one with the strongest will and the nervous energy to stay awake...
...would have us all at his mercy.
What are you staring at, Blore?
You're the only one of us who's armed.
What do you expect me to do, give the gun to you?
Perhaps you should give it to me.
- All right, I'll buy that.
- No.
Not to Miss Clyde.
Do you suspect me, doctor?
Let us look at the facts.
Let's remember what happened.
Miss Clyde, the judge was just about to question you...
...when you left the room to get your coat.
- Is that true?
- Yes.
You were terrified by the Indian dummy.
- You screamed.
- Yes.
Well, so far, perfect.
But time elapses, and we find you at the opposite end of the corridor.
What were you doing there?
She was scared and didn't know where she was going.
Perhaps, but if Miss Clyde hadn't screamed, we'd never have left the dining room.
And the judge would be alive.
- Come on. Wait a minute.
- Herr Lombard.
We know that the judge was on a point of discovery.
How? How do we know what was in the judge's mind?
I know. He took me into his confidence.
Now, Miss Clyde, the truth.
Did you or did you not commit that crime of which Mr. Owen accused you?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- But you must.
- We've all confessed. All except you.
- That's right.
Now, come along.
If I recall, it was your sister's fiancé.
Did you kill him?
Will you take my word for it if I tell you I didn't?
I'm afraid I will.
Then you have my word.
And don't ask me any more questions!
- Can't you see she's telling the truth?
- That is precisely her mistake.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The judge reasoned it like this.
Mr. Owen enticed us here to be punished for past crimes.
Right.
- We three have admitted our guilt.
- Right.
So we cannot be interested in the punishment of crime.
And I could?
I think you've lost your sense of perspective, doctor.
Have I, Miss Clyde?
The prime object now is to save our lives.
If you are Mr. Owen...
...then we shall feel safer with you locked in your room.
If you're not, well, you'll feel safe.
Go along, Miss Clyde.
Go on.
The key, please?
Good night. Have a good sleep.
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.
You know, this is really stupid.
- You're not gonna keep it.
- I'll take it.
- No, not you either.
- Oh, very well.
We'll put it on this table.
Now no one has it.
- Makes it too easy.
- You're not going to keep it either.
All right, let's really make sure of this.
Give me a leg up, will you?
Both of you.
There.
If you insist on locking in Miss Clyde, it will take two of us to reach that key.
An excellent suggestion.
Now we can all sleep in peace.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
Doctor, there's one little flaw in your theory about Miss Clyde.
I could destroy it in four words.
Suppose I said, I am Mr. Owen?
That would be interesting, but unlikely.
Maybe.
Maybe you're the one who would know, doctor.
You may need this.
Ann?
This man you're accused of killing...
I told you the truth.
Well, then maybe he never existed.
Oh, yes, he did.
He was my sister's fiancé.
Was he killed?
Yes.
My sister killed him.
We were both suspected, and I covered up for her.
Would you call that a crime?
Where's your sister now?
She's in a mental home.
Honey, I'm sorry.
But don't you see?
Mr. Owen's not infallible.
You don't belong.
You haven't killed your way in.
And the others have?
And Hugh Lombard has?
Yes. But I'm not Hugh Lombard.
Then what is your name?
Charles Morley.
You're not a very good detective, are you?
Old Blore spotted it right away.
The initials on my suitcase.
Then why did you come here as Lombard?
Well, he was an old buddy of mine.
A short time ago, he committed suicide.
I even knew the girl.
I guess it was conscience over her that drove him to it.
Anyway, I was going through his things...
...and I came across this invitation from Owen.
It mentioned the girl, and I wanted to come here...
...to find out if he had anything to do with Hugh's death.
You believe that, don't you?
Listen.
- He's going away.
- Downstairs?
I'm gonna find out. Keep the gun.
I'm coming with you.
It's either Blore or the doctor, the one who's not in his room.
Blore?
Blore?
- What's going on out there?
- Open up.
- Blore, put that thing down.
- Who let that girl out of her room?
Don't let it worry you. Come on.
Now we know it's the doctor.
He's downstairs.
Here. Wait a minute. How do I know you two aren't in this together?
- Don't be a fool.
- I heard him too, Mr. Blore.
You did? Taking a bit of a risk, aren't you, Lombard?
- Drop dead.
- That's not funny.
Look. He must have gone outside.
It might be a trick.
He's not out there.
Let's try the rooms downstairs first.
Keep together.
The red herring swallowed one
And then there were three
Maybe he wants us to think he's dead.
Yes. The red herring to put us off the track.
There he is. You can't fool us this time, doctor.
There's nobody here.
Where have you been?
I'm still looking for the doctor.
I searched the kitchen, the cellar.
- Oh, yeah?
- Where are you going?
Outside. I think I know where the doctor is.
You get Miss Clyde.
I'll meet you out there.
- What's the matter?
- I thought I heard something.
It's probably just Blore stamping his feet with impatience.
Where is he? I haven't seen him this morning.
Outside. Waiting for us.
Hugh?
I had the feeling all the time that there's someone watching, waiting.
I know what you mean.
- Then you feel it too?
- Yes.
Get ahold of yourself, Ann.
There's no mystery about this anymore.
It's the doctor, and he's very much alive.
He must have been looking at something, and while he was...
But what was he looking at?
No.
What is it? What do you see?
It's impossible.
Let me see.
You're going to see. Come on.
- The doctor.
- He's been dead for hours.
How do you know?
Hasn't snowed since last night.
The only footprints are ours.
But if he was dead, then who killed Blore?
Exactly.
Only two of us left alive now.
You...
And you.
So this is how it ends, Ann?
This is how it ends.
Now we come to the truth.
You were a fool to trust me with a gun.
- Ann.
- Another step and I'll shoot.
Look, in the first place,
I don't want to get killed.
Second, I don't want to get bumped off for someone else.
- I told you, I'm not Lombard.
- Expect me to believe that now?
There's something even more difficult to believe:
That one of us is Mr. Owen.
I know I'm not.
It's got to be you.
There's no other explanation.
If you're so sure...
...then shoot me.
Don't come any closer!
I trust you.
Trust me, Ann.
Come in, Miss Clyde.
A game of the mind, my dear.
You're here for my last shot.
Don't be frightened.
This is a court of law.
You'll get justice here.
One little Indian boy left all alone
He went and hanged himself
And then there were none
It's for you.
What if I don't agree to hang myself?
You will.
Do you know, Miss Clyde, all my life I've wanted to commit murder?
I've had to get what pleasure I could out of sentencing guilty people to death.
Always enjoyed that, but it wasn't enough.
I wanted to do it myself with my own hands.
Do you mind if I sit down?
Excuse me, pussycat, dear.
That's a good boy.
Come along, pussycat.
That's it.
I must admit I've been looking forward to this moment...
...to be able to tell the last survivor all about it.
I had one great ambition:
To search for perfect human justice.
The results of which you've seen.
Now, to achieve that,
I had to find an unwitting accomplice...
...among the criminals invited here for punishment.
I needed a man whose fear of death...
...would make him stupidly cooperative.
I convinced the doctor that to unmask Mr. Owen...
...I must appear to be the next victim.
Do you remember the Indian doll?
The doctor placed it there.
Your scream was perfect.
In the confusion on the stairs,
I ran up to my room, fired one shot...
...threw the revolver outside, where you found it.
I counted on the confusion in the dark...
...and on the doctor, who played his part to perfection.
After that, no one could suspect me...
...least of all the dear doctor.
We made our rendezvous out in the snow...
...and it was only at the last moment that he realized what a fool he'd been.
You and Mr. Lombard made the end more interesting.
I knew that you'd suspect one another.
The only question was who would win.
I banked on you, my dear, the female of the species.
So you see, the whole thing was as inevitable as the nursery rhyme.
When rescue finally comes, there will be 10 dead bodies...
...and a mystery nobody can solve.
Ten?
Yes, my dear. I'm an old, sick man.
Received my death sentence a year ago.
Sooner than go painfully and slowly...
...I choose to leave this blemished world my own way.
But you can't force me to hang myself.
The only living person found here with nine dead bodies...
...will certainly be hanged.
As the last little Indian has to be.
Don't let them hang you, my child.
Do it yourself.
More dignified.
I thought...
Never trust a woman.
Well, thanks for the advice, judge.
But if we hadn't trusted each other...
- Why did you trust me?
- Why did you?
I could have killed you.
On account of the one thing that Mr. Owen couldn't foresee.
What couldn't he foresee?
This.
Tell what, boy?
Three times I had seen how they threw the ball with all their strength in his face, at his legs, in his loins.
Nettlinger had risked our chances of victory merely so that one of the opponents would have the opportunity of hitting Schrella with the ball.
And Vacano, our own sportsmaster, whom those from the Prince Otto School had accepted as referee, must have been in league with them.
Why, why did they do that to Schrella, put out a leg as he came down the steps during break, fall upon him on the way home, drag him into doorways, beat him up between dustbins and abandoned prams, push him down dark cellar steps.
Only a few didn't join in:
Enders, Drischka, Schweugel,
Grewe and Holten.
- Are you Jewish?
- No.
What are you then?
We are lambs, and have sworn never to eat of the Buffalo Sacrament.
Lambs?
I must know exactly.
I'll show you, come on.
They do it down in the old barracks near the Wilhelmskuhle.
Vacano and Nettlinger.
They call it auxiliary police.
They seized me during a raid on beggars in the harbour district.
Thirty-eight beggars arrested in one day.
I was one of them.
We were interrogated with the barbed whip.
They said:
"Admit you're a beggar, then. "
And I said:
"Yes, I am one. "
Fetch me a cognac, please.
A cognac for the gentleman upstairs.
How shall we redeem the world?
Through sheep's wool, sheep's leather, sheep's milk
... and through knitting.
Wherein lies the world's salvation hidden?
In sheep.
Why won't you be the Holy Lamb in my new religion, you silly boy?
I would make you great, rich, and they would kneel before you in even smarter hotel halls.
Go away, you're too silly.
At least 17 women, old and young, are searching for you.
Clear off quick, here comes another.
Love, my boy...
I've never known what it is.
They'd have poisoned me if they'd only summoned up the courage.
They called me
"such a thing shouldn't be born".
Is there any more to the story?
Do you want to hear it?
Ferdinand Progulske, apprentice, born on 1st May 1917 in Cologne,
was beheaded today at 7.30 a. m.
The Minister-President has rejected the appeal for a reprieve,
since this was an ambuscade
organised by the communist underworld.
He had slipped into
Vacano's apartment, had thrown the bomb at his feet.
Vacano only had burns on his feet.
You're still coming to the
Cafe Zons, as arranged?
Are you coming, or aren't you?
I had done it.
I'd gone with Schrella to the little
Cafe Zons in Boisseree Street, where the lambs met, and I had sworn to a young girl called Edith, sworn to her face, never to taste of the Buffalo Sacrament.
And then held a speech in the dark back room, with dark words which didn't sound like lamb, but like blood, like rebellion and revenge.
Nettlinger was waiting for me outside, and they took me to the Wilhelmskuhle.
Nettlinger lashed out.
And he came into my cell at daybreak, and said:
"Clear out. Run away.
"But I can only give you an hour's start.
"In one hour I shall have to report it to the police. "
I ran right round the city to the harbour.
Hey, sonny, that road leads nowhere.
- To your house.
- Come down here.
Oh, you're... I know who you are, but I've forgotten your name.
Fähmel.
Of course, they're after you.
It came this morning with the early news.
So you have to go flinging bombs about!
You have to plot together...
Yesterday I already packed one of you up and sent him across the border.
Yesterday, whom?
Schrella, he hid himself here, and I had to force him to leave on the "Anna Katharina".
What on earth is it, what's wrong with you?
- More milk, boy?
- No, thanks.
Don't worry, Alois will come the day after tomorrow.
Monday or Tuesday you'll be in Rotterdam.
They'll kill you.
Don't forget us, sonny.
- What can I do for you, Mr...?
- Nettlinger.
I must speak to Dr Fähmel.
Urgently. At once. Officially.
Available only for my mother, my father, my daughter,
my son... and for Mr Schrella.
Nobody else.
I know he's here.
I want to see the manager.
Left round here, then second door on the right... Management.
I wish to be announced.
The manager, please.
Porter speaking.
Sir, a Mr...
What was the name?
Mr, sorry, Dr Nettlinger, wishes to speak to you urgently.
Yes, thank you.
The manager is expecting you.
- Did you take part in the war?
- Yes.
What did you do?
I was a demolition expert.
Does that mean anything to you?
I have seen them blowing up rocks in the quarry behind Denklingen.
That's exactly what I did, only I didn't blow up rocks.
I blew up bridges and apartment blocks, churches and railway viaducts, villas and crossroads.
And at the end of the war
I was attached to a general who had only one word in his head:
"field-of-fire".
Do you know what
"field-of-fire" is?
Look, if I wanted to fire now at the bridge which is behind St Severin, the church would be in the field-of-fire, too, so St Severin would also have to be blown up so I could fire at the bridge, and I would blow St Severin sky high.
I had a good team with me, physicists and architects, and we blew up whatever stood in our way.
The last one was
St Anthony's Abbey, which had been built by my father.
It lay right between two armies, one German and one American.
I provided the German army with its field-of-fire, which it didn't need at all.
The manager asks if you will receive a Dr Nettlinger.
- Would you receive someone called Nettlinger? - No.
Schoolfellow of Robert's?
Ministerial councillor, director, manager?
And you sent him to the
Prince Heinrich Hotel!
He doesn't like it, my son Robert, when people disturb him.
But, my child, he won't do anything to you on that account!
Come...
Let's go and eat...
...and celebrate my birthday a little.
Municipal Prison
Where would you like to be taken to?
The station.
Are you thinking of leaving this hospitable city already?
No, I'm not thinking of leaving this hospitable city yet.
It was a damned accident your name was still on the wanted list.
Attempted murder becomes superannuated after 20 years.
Attempted murder?
Yes, what you tried against Vacano then comes under that heading.
You probably don't know I had absolutely no part in it.
I never once gave the affair my approval.
Well, so much the better.
All I could do was vouch for you, and arrange for your provisional release.
Now the rest will be merely a formality.
Are you actually still a German citizen?
No, I'm stateless.
Pity! If you could manage to prove you had to flee not for criminal but political reasons, you could get a tidy amount of compensation.
Tell me if you need money.
You won't get far with what you've got.
Thanks, I don't need anything.
May I at least invite you to eat?
Fine, let's go and eat.
Chicken.
I'll take the entrecote.
And smoked salmon?
No, thanks.
I'll have it.
You're missing something really delicious.
To drink?
- I'll have Beaujolais.
- Beer.
Ruthless political hatred between schoolfellows, persecution, interrogation, hatred, drawing blood...
But 20 years later it is, of all people, the atrocious persecutor who rescues the returning refugee from jail.
I'd be sorry if you thought I doubted the sincerity of your motives and feelings.
I don't even doubt your remorse.
But the roles you played then and play today are the same.
Perhaps you don't know what
I did for your sister.
You protected Edith?
Yes. Vacano wanted to have her arrested.
He put her on the list again and again, and again and again
I struck her name off.
Your good deeds are almost more frightful than your misdeeds.
And you are more merciless than God.
We are not God, and can lay no more claim to His mercy than to His omniscience.
Are you by any chance going to let that marvellous salmon go back?
Of course.
But you can't!
Listen to what the son of a waiter has to tell you:
A really fine man never submits to the tyranny of waiters.
By the way, is Vacano still alive?
Of course, he's only fifty-eight, and... he's one of the incorrigible ones.
And you?
If you could only understand me.
I'm a democrat... a democrat by conviction.
- What became of Trischler?
- Trischler?
Old Trischler who lived in the lower harbour.
Don't you remember Alois either, who was in our class?
Oh, now I remember.
We searched for Alois for weeks without finding him, and Vacano himself interrogated Old Trischler, but he got nothing out of him, nothing at all, nor out of the woman.
The district down there was often bombed.
Good God, what's the matter, what are you going to do?
Would you please have this wrapped for me so that the fat doesn't leak out?
- Certainly. The potatoes too, sir?
- No, thank you.
Would you rather I killed you?
I can't stand it any longer.
The fat won't leak out, it's all wrapped in cellophane.
Thank you.
How many breakfasts in the
Cafe Kroner?
Ten thousand, twenty thousand?
I never added them up.
Good morning, sir.
Breakfast?
Yes, please.
A small pot of coffee, but with three cups of coffee.
Toast, two slices of black bread, butter, marmalade, a boiled egg, and paprika-cheese.
Paprika-cheese?
Yes, cream-cheese mixed with paprika.
Very good.
And listen, waiter, I shall have breakfast here tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the day after that...
...in three weeks, three months and three years, you hear?
And always at the same time, around nine.
Very good.
I had rented a room and studio for half a year, paid in advance.
There were three ahead of me.
Every child knew their names:
Brehmockel, Grumpeter, Wollersein.
"Final deadline for
St Anthony project today.
"Have our young architects no spirit?"
...said the newspaper.
I should like to hand over a design to the notary.
St Anthony Open Competition.
The reputation of having been beaten only by
Brehmockel, Grumpeter and Wollersein would have been enough for me.
But the abbot liked my plan.
Will you hold out?
Yes, I'll hold out,
Reverend Father.
Him, gentlemen?
Nothing but work.
Eight o'clock in the morning goes to Low Mass in St Severin.
Breakfast in the Cafe Kroner till ten-thirty.
From ten-thirty till five, stays up there in his studio.
Won't speak to anyone.
Lives up there on pea soup which he cooks himself.
Has the peas and the pork sent by his old mother.
Even the onions.
From five till six, a stroll through the town.
From six-thirty to seven-thirty,
Reserve Officers' Club.
Paprika-cheese?
Very interesting!
And he draws, even at breakfast, like a man possessed.
I didn't know my wife yet.
I ask you for your daughter's hand.
The unforeseen struck me hard.
We'll find the culprit.
The Emperor's Speech:
I no longer see parties among my people.
There are only Germans among us.
And whichever party may have turned against me,
I forgive them all with my whole heart.
Now it is for us all to stand together as brothers,
for God to lead the
German sword to victory!
I let my son Heinrich play with the lancer's helmet which his uncles had given him.
And I put up with what the garrison commandant told me.
I'm so sorry, Fähmel, that we can't do without you yet, that you can't play your part in it, but we also need people at home, we need people exactly like you.
Construction of barracks, fortifications, hospitals.
The fool of a Kaiser.
The fool of a Kaiser, the fool of a Kaiser...
Court of honour.
And I did not say what
I ought to have said, that I agreed with my wife.
"Pregnant, gentlemen, due in two months;
"a little daughter lost,
"two brothers fallen on the same day:
"Captain Kilb of the
Horse Guards, Officer Kilb. "
And I couldn't summon up the courage to tear up the poem that Heinrich had to learn by heart for school.
Spoke Peter,
Heaven's doorman:
"I'll take the matter up in higher places. "
And lo, not long thereafter he came:
"Most Excellent Blücher, you are in luck!
"On leave for an indefinite time," said he, and opened
Heaven's door.
"Go, old warhorse, and strike there.
"Good old God will be with you. "
It was Blücher who came down
To lead us from victory to victory.
Onwards with hurrahs and Hindenburg,
Eastern Prussia's saviour and mighty fortress.
As long as the woods of Germany stand,
As long as the flags of
Germany fly, as long as...
I ought to have done what Johanna did then,
I ought to have spoken to the boy.
In his fever, he pieced his lines together.
"Good old God will be with you. "
Johanna tried to drag him out of his delirium, to shake him awake, but he never came back again.
"Onwards with hurrahs and Hindenburg"
...only this single, solitary line was alive in him.
Robert was not yet two, and Otto not yet born.
You must forgive me, Robert;
I couldn't bear it any longer.
I had to go to Dröscher to obtain an amnesty for you.
It was too much for us
... Father, myself, Edith.
Your son was already born.
We found your tiny messages in the letter-box:
"Don't worry, I'm studying hard in Amsterdam. "
"I need money. Give it wrapped in newspaper
"to a man called Groll, a waiter in the "Anchor" at the upper harbour. "
And all at once Otto was no longer Otto.
He brought Nettlinger and the sportsmaster home with him.
You know the conditions
Dröscher obtained for you: no political activity, and straight into the army after your exams.
Klähm, the statist, will examine you, and save you as many terms as he can.
Must you absolutely study statics?
Very well, as you wish.
Isn't he sweet, your little boy?
You must adopt him immediately after the wedding.
I'll furnish an apartment for you.
You should try to be reconciled with Otto.
Please, do try.
Please, go.
Even the news of his death did not bring a reconciliation.
Fallen at Kiev!
Sons of the same parents, born and grown up in the same house, gone the same way to school...
And suddenly not even strangers any more.
Behind Otto's pale, wide forehead was power in its simplest form.
Power over frightened schoolfellows, over passers-by who did not salute the flag.
He would have delivered his mother to the hangman.
Well? Did you speak to Otto?
No good!
I knew it, but one must always keep trying, again and again.
Perhaps there's only one way to set him free.
I shall do it, Robert.
I shall be the Lord's instrument.
I have patience, time doesn't press me.
One shouldn't use powder and wadding, but powder and lead.
Firecrackers do not kill, my boy.
You should have asked me.
Now he has become
Chief of Police.
Don't think I'm mad.
I know exactly where we are.
It's war.
Time can be read off in promotions.
You were a Lieutenant when you left.
After two years,
First Lieutenant.
Aren't you a Captain yet?
This time they won't do it in less than four years, perhaps it'll last six, and you'll be a Major.
Don't go too far with those formulas in your head, and don't lose your patience, and don't accept any privileges.
We won't eat a crumb more than we get on ration cards.
Edith is agreed.
I didn't want to allow your children to enjoy any privileges, either.
They should taste the truth on their lips.
But they took me away from the children.
I watched how time went marching by.
It seethed, it struck.
It paid a billion for a sweet, and then lacked three pfennigs for a roll.
I did not want to hear the name of the saviour, but they stuck his image on their letters, and recited their litany:
Respectable, respectable, earnest, honour-loyal. defeated and yet undefeated, order.
Dumb as earth, deaf as a tree.
And he, my little David, slept; only woke up when he saw how it could cost a life to pass a package of money, wrapped in newspaper, from one hand to another.
Loyalty, honour, respectable... then he saw it.
I warned him about Gretz, but he said: "He's harmless. "
"Of course," I said,
"you'll see yet what
"harmless people are capable of.
"Gretz would betray his own mother. "
He did it, Robert.
Just because the old woman kept saying:
"It's a sin and a disgrace. "
She didn't say anything else, only always this phrase.
Until one day her son declared:
"I can't stand this any longer, it's against my honour. "
They dragged the old woman away, stuck her in an old people's home.
Certified her insane, just to save her life, and that was exactly what killed her.
They gave her an injection.
They came to fetch Edith, too, but I didn't give her up.
I kept Edith until the fluttering bird killed her.
Forgive me, I couldn't save the lamb.
Step inside, bring some happiness in, old David!
Come, we'll say our
"do-you-still-know" prayers, and remind ourselves of the years when we lived out in Blessenfeld.
You had released me from that dreadful house.
They were already growing up, those to whom I was to be thrown: cap-wearers, beer-drinkers, guardians of the law.
I saw their hands, their eyes, and I prayed for him who would set me free,
I prayed and saw you over there at the studio window.
If you knew how I loved you, if you had any idea.
Have you got tickets?
Yes, but we've still got time.
Sit down.
A beer, please.
I'd very much like to give you something for your birthday, Father.
To show you...
Well, perhaps you know what
I'd like to show you.
I know, you don't need to say it.
Have you told Ruth we wanted to go to St. Anthony?
Yes, she's coming.
Is the abbot still there?
- Which one?
- Gregor.
No, he couldn't get over the Abbey's being destroyed.
And you, could you get over it?
After all, one can rebuild buildings.
And for your boy, it was a great opportunity to get some practical training, to learn coordination.
You know he has a girl, don't you?
No.
I don't want to know what mission Edith gave you,
Only... you did carry it out?
Yes.
Good.
I laughed at your childish conspiracies, but the laughter stuck in my throat when I read that they had killed the boy.
And later I knew that it had still been almost human.
I had thought I loved and understood your mother, but only then did I understand her and love her, and understand you all, and love you all.
Only later did I grasp it all, when one day the
British commanding officer came to apologise to me for their having bombed the Honorarius Church and destroyed the twelfth-century Crucifixion, when I would have given all the Crucifixions down the centuries to see Edith's smile once more, and feel her hand on my arm.
What did pictures of the Lord mean to me compared to his real emissary's smile?!
And for the boy who brought your little messages
...I never saw his face, or learnt his name...
I would have given St Severin, and known it would have been a ridiculous price.
We can go on to the platform now, Father.
Your Honour, it must be years since you were last here!
Ah, Mull!
How are you?
This is my son, haven't you met him yet?
Fähmel... pleased to meet you.
Mull... pleased to meet you.
Every child knows you here,
Your Honour.
Everyone knows you built our Abbey, and many grandmothers can still tell tales about you.
How you ordered whole truckloads of beer for the bricklayers, and danced a solo at the builder's party.
Is your mother still alive?
No, Your Honour, we had to lay her to rest.
It was a huge funeral.
She had a full life: seven children, thirty-six grandchildren, eleven great-grandchildren.
A full life.
Those are splendid people.
And are you not scared of them?
Scared of Mull? Now?
While you were away, and we were waiting for news of you,
I was scared of everyone.
Are you scared of Mull?
I ask myself with everyone whether I would want to be delivered up to him, and there are not many with whom I would say yes.
Over here, Father, over here!
He soon came out of prison and took us to the city, although Grandfather protested, and said that it would be better for us not to grow up among the ruins.
We were all living then in Grandfather's studio, because our house was uninhabitable.
There was a huge town-plan hanging on the wall in the studio.
Everything that had been destroyed was marked in heavy black crayon, and we often listened while doing homework at
Grandfather's drawing-table, as he and Grandfather and other men stood in front of the map.
They often quarrelled, for he always said:
"Away with it... blow it up!"
And he drew an X next to a black spot.
And the others would say:
"For God's sake, we can't do that,
"there are the remains of a lintel from the sixteenth century,
"and there's part of a chapel from the twelfth!"
And he threw the black crayon down, and said:
"All right, do as you wish, but without me, then. "
And the others said:
"But dear Mr Fähmel,
"you're our best demolition expert, you can't leave us in the lurch. "
And he said:
"But I will leave you in the lurch
"if I have to worry about every chicken-run from the Roman Age.
"Blow things up and make space. "
Grandfather laughed when they'd gone, and said:
"My God, you really must understand their feelings. "
And Father laughed:
"I do understand their feelings,
"but I don't respect them. "
And then he said:
"Come, children, we're going to buy some chocolate. "
And he went with us to the black market.
He always bought, but never sold.
Whenever we got bread or butter from Stehlingen or Gorlingen, we had to take his share to school with us, and he left it to us as to who we wanted to give it to.
And once on the black market we bought back butter which we had given away.
Mrs Kloschgrabe's note was still on it.
She had written:
"Sorry, only one kilo this week. "
But he only laughed, and said:
"Oh well, people need money for cigarettes, too. "
You'll like him, little lamb.
Fine.
But what did he do that made you suddenly lose interest in building?
Why won't you tell me?
Because I don't understand it yet myself.
Perhaps I'll be able to explain it to you later...
Here they are!
Another lemonade?
No, thank you.
But five cigarettes, please.
That'll be 90 altogether, please.
Do we really not know each other?
No, I'm sure not.
- Are you looking for somebody?
- Yes, the Schrellas.
Don't they live here anymore?
No, they never lived here.
Thank you.
Would you like a groschen?
My official speech will not stand as a mark of indictment, but of reconciliation, reconciliation also with those powers who in their blind zeal destroyed our home.
May I therefore extend an invitation to you, with the sincere hope that you will do us the honour of coming to the inauguration?
Many thanks,
Reverend Father.
Very pleased to have met your son.
I have sinned,
I have greatly sinned.
I did not want to see any recognition light up in
Erika Progulske's eyes, or hear Ferdi's name from her mouth.
Yes, Huberts, clear the tea away, and the bread and the cold meat as well.
I wonder whether the head-gardener could bring me a few flowers?
He's out, off duty till tomorrow evening.
And no one except him is allowed into the greenhouse?
No, Madam, he's terribly particular about it.
Then I suppose I must wait till tomorrow evening, or I'll get myself some outside.
You want to go out, Madam?
Yes, probably.
It's such a fine evening.
I'm allowed to, aren't I?
Of course you are allowed.
Or should I telephone
His Honour or Dr Fähmel?
I'll do that myself, Huberts.
- Good evening, Madam.
- Good evening, Huberts.
The exchange, please.
FIGHTERS' PARADE
Assembly in front of the Prince Heinrich Hotel.
Departure, 19.00 hours.
Prince Heinrich Hotel.
Oh yes, Madam!
Certainly, Madam.
Room 212, with balcony.
Do you really think that they might be useful to us?
- I'm sure of it.
- Without doubt.
But won't we antagonize more voters than we win through such a show of sympathy?
The Fighters' League is known as non-radical.
You can't lose anything, only win.
How many votes are there?
Under optimal and least favourable circumstances?
Optimal, around 80,000.
Under least favourable circumstances, around 50,000.
What will foreign circles think?
Yes?
Speaking.
Good.
Show sympathy.
I'll go down and draw the parade leader's attention to your balcony.
Go to our room, boy, and pack your things.
What will the old man say when
I present him for his birthday with a grandson who has
Edith's smile on his face?
You're right.
The voice of blood is false, only the other is true.
Don't you want to live with us?
No. The hotel room is just right.
Once I shut the door behind me, this town becomes as strange to me as all others.
There I can imagine
I must soon set off and give my language lessons somewhere.
The people I meet...
Am I deceiving myself in finding them no less bad than those
I left behind then?
The list of stereotypes has dwindled.
Nobody would've thought of calling your father a communist.
Even Nettlinger wasn't that stupid.
Today they wouldn't be able to classify him as anything else.
- Do you remember Enders, the ginger-haired boy? - Yes.
He's become a priest.
They've stuck him in a village that's not even reachable by train.
He's suspect because he made the Sermon on the Mount the subject of his own sermons too often.
I was thinking about whom
I'd like to see again.
But I'm scared of meetings, after having seen Ferdi's sister.
You saw Ferdi's sister?
Yes, she runs the drinks stall at the terminus of the number 11.
- Haven't you ever been there?
- No.
What are people like
Schweugel doing now?
Are you really interested?
Yes, why do you ask whether
I'm really interested?
Did you think about
Enders and Schweugel in your hotel rooms and pensions?
Yes, and about Grewe and Holten.
Drischka, too.
What are they doing?
Are they still alive?
Holten is dead, killed in the war.
But Schweugel's still alive.
He's a writer.
Always talks about bourgeois and non-bourgeois, probably regards himself as the latter.
What for?
It just doesn't interest me.
He has also sometimes asked me about you.
And what's become of Grewe?
He's a party-member, but don't ask me which party.
It's not important to know, anyway.
And Drischka is making
"Drischka's Auto-Lions", a patented article which brings in a lot of money.
While I was sitting downstairs waiting for you, some people were just assembling for a banquet.
And I heard something about "opposition".
They kept whispering in awe to each other the name of the star they were expecting: Kretz.
Kretz is a sort of star of the Left Opposition.
I saw him, he arrived last.
If he's hope,
I'd like to know what despair could be.
We must go to my father soon.
Or would you rather not go to the celebration?
Yes, I'll come with you.
We just have to wait for the boy.
Are the Trischlers really dead?
Yes. Alois, too.
He was taking them to friends in
Holland on the "Anna Katharina".
The boat was bombed.
Alois tried to get his parents out of the berths, but it was too late.
The water was already rushing in from above, and they never got out.
Where did you hear about it?
In the "Anchor".
I went there every day, and questioned all the boatmen until I found one who knew.
I'm scared, old man.
Not even in '35 or '42 did I feel such a stranger among people.
Just what do you want to do with that thing?
I want to shoot the fat man on the white horse down there.
Do you still remember him?
Do you think I would ever forget him?
All the same,
I wouldn't shoot him.
Look there, our old friend
Nettlinger.
I anyone, I'd rather shoot him.
But perhaps you'll consider: your grandson's murderer is standing on the next balcony.
Do you see him?
I'll rely on paragraph 51, dearest.
You probably don't know that all this is thanks to Father's zeal for blowing-up.
When they were blowing up the old guard-house, one of the vaults below collapsed.
Long live dynamite!
Remember how happy
Father was when he could still blow things up?
How do you find him,
Marianne?
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him very much.
Am I hungry!
I'm sure Grandfather's ordered something good for us.
You don't know yet, then?
Something dreadful must have happened.
Your grandfather has cancelled the party.
They just called from the Prince Heinrich.
I can't help it, children,
I can't be sad.
She'll be coming back now to stay with us.
He wasn't dangerously wounded, and I hope the great look of astonishment will not disappear from his face.
EYE OF THE DEVIL
From the novel "Day of the Arrow" by Philip Loraine
Come along and sit down.
I am sorry, Monsieur le Marquis.
Along to bed, darling.
Darling?
Philippe?
Darling, what is it?
Is something wrong?
I have to go home, Catherine.
Home?
Oh, you mean to Bellenac?
Why?
Grandec was just here.
The vineyards are failing again.
Oh darling, I am sorry.
How long would we going to be there?
I mean... we must make plans about the children's school and everything.
Catherine, I'd rather you didn't come.
During a vineyard failure it's not very pleasant.
They resent outsiders.
Outsiders?
Please, try to understand...
Please!
Well..
How long will you be away?
I don't know.
Well, if it's for a very long, darling, please, will you send for us?
We'll see.
Oh, I love you, my Catherine.
I love you very much.
Maman, Jacques's spitting those things at me again.
Jacques, you'd better not let papa catch you with that awful thing.
You don't understand, mama.
You see, Antoinette is Marie Antoinette, actually, and I am the spirit of free France.
It's my duty to capture her and bring her back to justice.
Well, so... your papa will free France you, if you don't stop teasing your sister.
Maman, why don't you and papa put Jacques in the army?
Morning, children.
- Good morning, papa.
- Good morning, papa.
Papa, please will you take me to Bellenac with you today?
Papa, I want to know if I'm going to Bellenac today with you.
I'll sleep in a car and I promise
I won't ask you any silly questions.
Darling...
Philippe?
Jacques is talking to you.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
I'm terribly sorry.
I haven't quite shaken the cobwebs yet.
Well, I want to know if I'm going to Bellenac with you today.
I'll sing those songs you like to hear while you drive.
I love your songs and the trip will be quite unbearable without them, but not today.
Maybe next time.
Monsieur le Marquis has arrived, sir.
He has come back.
Put another log on the fire.
I'm cold.
I always seem to be cold these days.
Make me some more tea.
But first lock the door in case my nephew comes up.
Not that I think he will.
I would think madame would be anxious to see Monsieur le Marquis.
In my own good time, Marianne.
Has the priest come?
Yes, madame.
Pere Dominique.
God be with you.
Well, Rennard?
I... I wish to say we are all proud you've return, Monsieur le Marquis.
Did you think I would not?
Some thought you would not.
I knew that you would.
How about you, Father?
I never doubt in the path you have chosen.
What makes you think I've chosen it?
You came back, didn't you?
I think you have chosen it,
Philippe, my son.
Haven't you?
I didn't know you'd ever been to Bellenac.
Oh yes, half a dozen times or so, when Philippe and I were at school together.
We went there just after we were married.
I thought it was the most frightening place.
Almost as all we were back in the Middle Ages.
You know, I'm worried about Philippe.
He's never been like this before.
I remember even as a child
Bellenac seemed to have some terrible fascination for him.
As though he would obsessed with finding some diabolical secret of the place.
Jacques, darling!
What are you doing down here?
Mama...
I want my motorcar.
But darling, you ought to be in bed.
I want my motorcar.
So I can go and see papa.
- Is he...?
- Yes.
But he's never done that before.
Now talk to him quite naturally, and you won't wake him up.
There's your motorcar, darling.
That's it.
Now, we'll going to see papa in your motorcar, first thing in the morning.
Now let's go upstairs, get back into bed.
She's come with the children.
- Welcome to Bellenac, Madame la Marquise.
- Thank you, Rennard.
Madame.
- I hope you had a pleasant journey.
- Yes, very pleasant, thank you.
Come, Jacques.
Where is papa?
Where is Monsieur le Marquis?
I'm sorry madame, he's gone to Lapiton.
Your telegram was late in arriving.
Did he say what time he would be back?
He said he will not return until late tonight, madame.
Christian de Caray is a very wicked boy.
And his sister Odile is no better.
But... why should he do such a thing?
You may ask Philippe to speak to him about it.
Yes, I certainly shall.
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have a terrible headache.
Marianne, would you fetch me an aspirin, please?
I'm sorry that you're feeling unwell.
I shall try not to trouble you any more.
Don't let her in here again.
This time I can't...
I can't be involved.
Rennard.
Madame?
Didn't Monsieur le Marquis just get back?
No, madame.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, madame.
Because I saw two men riding to the courtyard.
Who were they?
I'm sorry madame,
I neither saw nor heard anyone.
- Thank you, Rennard.
- Good night, madame.
Take your children. Drive out to the valley.
Never turn back.
Jacques, why aren't you sleep, darling?
What's the matter, darling?
I do love it here.
Oh mama, please let us stay here.
Don't let as leave here.
Oh please, let us stay here forever.
Now darling, you must go to sleep.
It's very very late.
You will be a good boy, eh?
Darling, I am sorry.
Rennard said your telegram arrived just after I left this morning.
When did you get back?
Oh, just a while ago.
I've forgotten how long that ride takes in the dark.
I had dninner with old Conier and his wife.
They send their best regards to you.
Oh darling, I'm sorry
I didn't came up right away, but I had one or two things in the office to attempt to.
I saw some lights on, in a tower room.
I went to see who is there, and...
Philippe... it really was horrible.
Those de Caray children were carrying in a dead dove.
And there were men in robes...
Darling, the people of Bellenac have always been steeped in strange rituals.
I never tried to understand them.
Neither should you.
You broght the children of course.
Yes.
Yes, of course I did.
You know... every time we've been apart,
I'm surprised all over again how beautiful you are.
- How are the children?
- Oh, very fine.
They've missed you. And so have I.
I had Jean-Claude in for drinks the other night.
Did you?
He's very worried about you.
Can the vineyards be saved?
In time... maybe.
Well, there's... not really very much you can do about, it is there?
Catherine... my family has lived here in Bellenac for over a thousand years.
Somehow here the years seem to shrink.
I find myself thinking in... generations and centuries.
What are you seeking, Philippe?
Am I seeking... or am I being sought?
Oh darling...
- I just want to help you.
-You can't help me.
I have great responsibilities here, and they can't be shared.
But Philippe, what are those responsibilities?
Do the people here think that you're some kind of a magician...?
Or... a god?
Catherine, you shouldn't have come here.
I asked you not to.
I want you to go back to Paris.
Take the children and leave first thing in the morning.
But darling, the children are unhappy without you, and so am I.
Even now you... you don't seem to need me anynmore.
Of course I need you.
I just want you to leave here.
Yes, but why, Phillipe?
Alright.
Stay then, if you must.
But please, don't ever question me about this anymore.
- She kept asking me questions.
- What questions?
She implied I was keeping things from her.
- Did you enlighten her?
- Don't be a fool, Philippe!
I'd rather died than speak of that to anyone.
I think I'll go away from here.
As you wish. You know these rooms are always kept ready for you.
This is no place for a woman, it never has been.
I sometimes believe you're all mad.
All the men of this family, from the very beginning.
She loves you.
She's a fine girl, a beautiful girl.
Take her away from here, Philippe.
Take her away and the children.
Put a thousand miles between you and this place.
Hello.
Hello.
What's your name?
I'm Odile.
Odile de Caray.
And you're Jacques, aren't you?
And this is your sister Antoinette.
How did you know?
We met when you were both very young.
What's this?
Tell me, do you believe in magic?
Do you, Jacques?
Do you?
In magic?
Oh yes, I do.
Do you see that toad, there, on the lily pad?
Sitting very still.
All by itself.
I can see it, but you have to look.
Exactly where I tell you.
No, Jacques.
Not there.
Just over here...
All by itself...
Do you see it now?
Yes, yes! I see it!
Well, shall we change that toad...
- ...into a dove?
- Yes!
Alright.
There!
- Look! Look!
- Where? Where is it?
There, there it is! Can't you see?
Flying up in the sky!
Look! I can still see it!
You're being silly.
Now come along inside children.
It's starting to rain.
If it does, the rain will not last, madame.
Mama, she changed the toad into a dove!
Why won't it last, Odile?
These are not life-giving clouds, madame.
Now, just exactly what are you doing here, Odile?
My brother and I come here often.
Well, you may tell your brother he is no longer welcome here.
I will not stand for him killing the doves.
Madame la Marquise.
- Hello, Jacques.
- Hello.
- Antoinette?
- Hello.
You like it here, Jacques?
Oh yes, I love it here.
I want to live here for always.
What lovely children you have.
I hope you overheard, what I said just now.
I will not permit your killing the doves on this property.
Killing doves?
Madame must surely have misunderstood.
My sister has just created a dove.
A white dove from a toad.
Mama, it stoped raining.
She said it would.
I warn you, Christian... if there's any more foolishness with that bow and arrow,
I shall report it to the police.
Come along, children, come along.
Run and wash your hands,
I'll be along in a moment.
Philippe, you must do something about Odile and Christian de Caray, immediately.
They are devils.
What did they do?
Well, that boy Christian, that bow and arrow of his is a lethal weapon.
He's just managed to frighten me half to death!
The day I arrived he shot a dove right in front of me.
And just now he was actually aiming at me.
- He must have been joking.
- Oh my God, darling, joke or not, the thing might have slipped, it might have hit me or one of the children.
He wouldn't have slip, he's far too good for that.
Philippe, that is not the point.
The point is the boy is dangerous and he shouldn't be allowed here.
Catherine, his family have had a hounting rights here at Bellenac for centuries.
I show you he's quite harmless.
Both of them are.
Strange? Yes, but harmless.
I'm sorry darling, but I don't believe that.
- Believe it, Catherine.
- I just told you I don't.
Believe it...
Believe it...
Believe it... or leave here.
What?
Philippe!
But what does it mean?
What does it mean, Father?
Has the world reached such a past, we must ask what it means, when a man chooses to pray?
Father, you know as well as I do, that Philippe is not a religious man.
My poor child, you're upset.
Bellenac has this effect on you.
I know that.
Perhaps you should go away, generate for a little while.
Yes, but why should I?
I only want to help him.
But you're in no position to help him, my child.
Your husband is one of the few really great landowners left in Europe.
For three years now the vines are born no fruit.
If it were not for Philippe's personal generosity, half of the families in his demain would have gone hungry.
Isn't it just possible in these circumstances of the men might to turn to Almighty God?
Yes. Yes, I suppose it is... but... what was that ceremony, up there, in the tower? 
That... that wasn't part of any church ritual.
You should not concern yourself, my child, with things you know nothing about.
The people of Bellenac are deeply rooted in the past.
Their traditions of worship are... ancient.
Some of these traditions may seem strange to an outsider, but I think you agree they should be respected.
Oh, it isn't that I lack respect, Father.
It's just that I...
I want to understand.
Understanding is not always necessary.
Indeed sometimes it is not possible.
Now go to bed, my child.
You're tired.
Jacques!
Odile!
- Mother is angry.
- I think we should go down.
Must you always do as your mother says?
Mama saw you on the parapet, so she'll tell papa.
Now you know perfectly well you're not suppose to be up here!
Now go downstairs at once!
- But mama, we only play...
- Don't argue with me, Jacques!
Go downstairs immediately, both of you!
How could you let Jacques do that?
How could you!
He might have been killed.
You know as well as they do, that they are not allowed to play up here.
Christian and I were playing on the roof at home.
And here we may were far younger than they are.
Because nobody cared enough to stop you.
But I do care about my children, and I don't want you seeing them any more.
But don't you think that kind of ultimatum should come from Philippe?
Well... has Philippe said nothing to you?
About Christian and the children?
Did he say he will?
Did he lie to you?
Oh, but you must be used to that by now.
Men always lie.
Personally...
I have no use for them.
Except for Christian.
But then he's different.
Catherine...?
What's the matter?
Is the sun bothering you?
Are you alright?
Would you like to go in?
You're getting very tired.
Would you like to go in?
Your eyes are heavy.
Very heavy.
You must go to sleep.
You must go to sleep, Catherine.
To sleep...
Careful Catherine, you might fall.
Take my hand.
Odile...
Help me.
I am helping you, Catherine.
I am helping you.
Just a few more steps... then you'll be save.
And you can hold my hand.
Take it, Catherine.
Take it!
Odile!
Poor Philippe.
You're mad.
Quite quite mad.
Then all the men in your family are all mad.
But of course you know that, don't you?
I told you to frighten her, not to kill her.
My child, where is your conscience?
What a hypocrites you are.
What stupid hypocrites!
I don't... I just don't know what happened. I...
One moment I was talking to her and the next moment I was lying on the roof.
Get killed her of what she tried to do to you.
Yes, I can believe it.
In fact, it's about the only thing I can believe.
What exactly does that mean?
Oh no... it's just... in spite of everything I'm... I'm sure... that you personally... don't wish me any harm.
But darling, of course
I don't wish you any harm.
I love you, you know that.
Yes, I do know it.
That's exactly what keeps me here, Philippe.
Is it Jean-Claude?
Yes, how did you know?
I telephoned him.
I wish you hadn't done that.
I don't want anyone staying here at the moment.
Oh, he's not going to stay, darling.
He is just on his way to Spain.
Well I can't see him.
You got to explain him
I had to go to the vineyards.
You say Philippe is in some kind of torment.
But then he won't confide in you nor shed any light on what has been happening here.
These are Philippe's ancestors, aren't they?
Who is that?
Oh, that? I think is...
Yes, that is Edouard,
Edouard de Montfaucon,
Philippe's grandfather.
Philippe's grandfather, eh?
Philippe's father, as I remember it, was drown, wasn't he?
Yes.
It looks almost medieval.
12 men dancing round the 13th.
Those men in robes... they yook like the men I saw in the tower.
In the library I seem to remember some kind of family history.
Records documentation.
Yes. Yes, I think there is.
In fact, I'm sure there is.
Do you realize how many of Philippe's ancestors have died under, what the police will call: mysterious circumstances?
Here is a list of 22 Montfaucons,
22 heads of the family, who have died in veriest extraordinary ways.
Gillaume, 1262, murdered on the way back from the crusades.
Jehan, the same in the year 1310.
He was only 19.
Gerard, 1437, killed while out hunting.
Jules, 1509, the same, and so on, and so on.
Catherine, you're in danger.
Your son maybe too.
- No, you're trying to frighten me.
- Yes, I am.
Have you forgotten already how that girl tried to kill you?
No, but... that I can think of at the moment is Philippe and what's happening to him.
I shouldn't have dragged you into all of this.
I'm sorry.
- I'm not leaving here...
- No, no, please, it would only...
I can manage. But... thank you.
Odile, what are you doing here?
I'm waiting for Christian.
Odile, where is the grave of Edouard de Montfaucon?
It's in the forest, madame.
Where in the forest?
Madame should take the lower road, to cross the white bridge, take the path to the right.
The path is steep, very steep.
It leads directly to the place.
Thank you, Odile.
- I beat you. I said I would?
- I let you beat me.
You always get so bad temper, when you loose.
I saw madame riding into the woods.
Where was she going?
To La Bosse, Monsieur le Marquis.
Madame wishes to see the grave in the forest.
"I would be saved, and I would save.
"The Twelve dance on high.
"Whoso danceth not, knoweth not what cometh to pass.
No!
I thought...
I thought I heard voices.
You were just regaining consciousness.
There was nobody here.
You knew, didn't you?
I knew from certain things
I was told what might happen.
I warned you you should be in great danger, if...
You were lucky.
It's only a surface cut.
You won't even have a scar.
Now you must rest.
This will help you.
Dr. Monnet prescribed it.
Remember dr. Monnet?
He says that you'll be perfecly alright.
You're just suffering from shock.
- Philippe...
- Yes, my darling?
- Please, don't leave me.
- You must rest now.
Sleep.
Oh, Philippe...
Come back...
Please, come back...
I can help you.
No one can help me.
Not even you.
You don't understand.
You could never understand.
"Whoso danceth not,
"knoweth not what cometh to pass.
It's in the painting, isn't it?
Is that it?
Is that it, Philippe?
"Whoso danceth not,
"knoweth not...
Good bye, Catherine.
Good bye, my darling.
Open this door!
Open it!
Philippe!
Philippe, where are you?
Oh, please, somebody open this door!
Double two.
You got to go back to the bottom.
No! It's not fair!
Come on young lady, ride back to the bottom.
- Your throw, Jacques.
- Estelle, see it!
Yes! See it, Estelle!
See it!
Estelle, see it! You must see it!
Nine!
It's not fair. You won again.
One, two, three.
Estelle, help me!
Help me!
What is that, auntie?
It was only a reflection from a piece of glass.
It's your go, auntie.
Shall I go for you?
It's there! See it! Its there!
I thrown three!
You've got to go back too.
Go on, auntie, go back.
Marianne?
- Marianne, where are you?
- Yes, madame?
I want you to go down to my niece's bedroom.
Mama is ill.
We're not allowed to go and see her yet.
That's true, madame.
I don't thing Monsieur le Marquis would like...
Monsieur le Marquis doesn't pay your wages, I do.
Go down there please, at once.
Dr. Monnet is here.
Of course I didn't come.
For the very good reason they never call me.
But they told me, that you'd come...
Is it one of old Mother Blossac's concoctions?
Yes, what is it?
Belladonna.
My friends who practice witchcraft call it by other names.
Generates a potent narcotic.
And it can induce sleep, as in your case.
And occasionally it's used for move states of trance.
Trance?
Visionaries, religious seekers have been using it since the Middle Ages.
Supposedly it induces states of religious ecstasy, a spiritual purgative, one might call it.
The user is cleansed, prepared.
But... prepared for what?
Who knows? Ehm, glorious pilgrimage of the soul, I suppose.
Now, you come along back to bed.
That's it.
Doctor, what's happening down in the square?
The flags and the bells...
It's "Les Treize Jours", madame.
The thirteen days.
Is there something special about it?
Does it have some symbolic meaning?
It's just a fair, madame.
A simple country fair.
No, it's more than that.
I attend of the bodily needs of these people, not the spiritual ones.
Now, come along back to bed and promise me you'll take no more this silly witch's brew.
Now I'll stop by.
See you again tomorrow.
Philippe!
Welcome friends and neighbourd to Bellenac.
And to "Les Treize Jours".
Let the earth bring forth vines, yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.
And the word was God.
No!
Oh, Estelle, please, you must tell me now.
What was it, that you swore to keep to yourself?
I swore on the Bible.
But surely God will forgive me.
Surely he will.
I think of your little Jacques...
He won't have to do that terrible thing Alain did.
You... You mean...
Destroy himself.
Then your brother... wasn't drown by accident.
He killed himself... to escape from Bellenac.
From whatever it is, that's happening here now.
He escaped, yes.
But it was neither an accident nor a suicide.
It was a plan.
He is still alive.
He's in the tower.
Above here.
Estelle?
Where is Catherine?
Leave me alone, Philippe.
You told her.
Yes.
Philippe...
Even before you were born
I prayed that you would...
Shirk my responsibilities, as Alain did?
Alain is your father.
Yes, but is not one of the men of this family.
Jacques is.
Philippe, I beg you.
If it is now beyond your power to prevent this terrible thing, at least spare your own son.
- Marianne, bring my son to me.
- No.
Bring him!
Madame?
Fetch him, Marianne.
Monsieur! Monsieur Alain!
Oh please, please!
Your sister Estelle sent me.
Oh, Philippe, Philippe...
Isn't there anything anyone could do to?
It was you!
In the hall that night.
What has my sister told you?
Only that you are alive.
And that if anyone can help Phillipe, it is you.
Sometimes I believe that on that afternoon in Antibes
I really did drown.
Where did you go?
Oh, for years I wandered, and in the end I came back... to this shame.
Do you know the meaning of the words: "Les Treize Jours"?
There is here not an amusing play on one word.
"Les Jours" meaning "The Days" easily becomes "Les Joueurs", meaning "The Players", meaning...
Dancers.
The thirteen dancers.
The Twelve dance on high.
Amen-amen.
Amen.
The Twelve who were dancing are the twelve of apostles and the thirteenth in the midst is...
Christ.
Long before Christianity there existed religions in which twelve men danced.
The twelve... and the one.
The Whole on high hath part in our dancing.
Amen.
Amen.
When you entered the cathedral of Bellenac, you have the impression that you are listening to an ordinary mass.
Nearly all round you there are people who hear.
But you do not hear, because it is the Black Mass.
And when once a year on that square you watch the dance of the twelve men, there are people who see in the midst of the twelve... thirteenth: living god.
Those people are not Christians and never have been.
And Pere Dominique?
He is a part of it.
No, more than the part.
He's all of it.
Pere Dominique is a pagan.
Bellenac is a fortress of heresy.
But what of Philippe?
Men like Philippe, Pere Dominique, of course they realize that what these people believing is heresy, and they realize too what heresy is capable of.
The people of Bellenac issue a command, that has to be obeyed.
But... a command that do what?
The earth has to have sacrifice.
There has to be blood.
I would save and I would be saved.
But someone must stop them!
They must be stopped!
There is nothing we could be done.
When he embraced his son...
The Kiss of Peace.
That meant that Philippe was elected to die.
I will go to the police.
Inspector!
I was just on my way...
Why are you here?
I thought you might want to see me.
Then you know.
We have all been worried about you.
Worried about... me? No.
You don't understand.
My husband is...
You need rest, madame.
It was a bad fall.
Apparently the horse kicked her head.
Serious complications can arise, madame, if you don't rest after that kind of an accident.
- Let me take you to your room.
- You stay away from me.
Philippe wishes to see you.
Because of the children.
The children...
Jacques... Where is Jacques?
The children are perfectly safe.
They're locked in the great-aunt's appartment, just as you must be locked in here.
Philippe, you can't do this!
In a sense it is already done.
But it's meaningless.
Darling, you can't do it.
Catherine, you can't stop this.
Neither you, nor anyone else.
And... when it's all over... don't try to make a fuss, because no one will believe you.
No one will come forward to support what you say.
No one ever has.
You must be mad.
You must all be mad!
All of you!
You're dying for nothing.
I'm dying for what I believe.
For me people and for my faith.
You believe in all this primitive nonsense?
Yes, I do.
Philippe, you are my husband.
I am your wife.
We have two lovely children.
And once we were also happy, but here at Bellenac you get sick.
Philippe, listen to me, please...
Please, listen to me.
Leave here now, with me and with the children.
That's all you have to do.
Just walk away from this... this stupidity. This... this evil.
Alain, your father, was right.
He told me once: drive out of this valley and never come back.
Oh Philippe, my dearest, let's do that!
Let's do that now!
Catherine...
It's our belief in something, that makes that thing
- for a moment, or forever - divine.
It's time, my son.
Alain! Alain! You must help me!
You must help me!
Alain, in a few moments in a very few moments
Philippe will be dead.
Philippe, who you once loved so much, and who I shall love always will be murdered.
Sadistically murdered in cold blood.
Alain, you're alive because you couldn't believe in all this vile hypocrisy, this... this heathen mumbo-jumbo, these sadists...
And because you weren't ill, in a way that Philippe is ill...
Alain, I'm a prisoner here!
But you can help me.
You told me you came back secretly.
Tell me how?
While there is still time.
You can't be a part of your own son's murder!
Oh, Alain!
We must save him!
You and I, we must save him!
We've got to, we've got to!
Help me, Alain!
Help me!
Oh no!
"And asked, if it did not strike him this surprising
"that the fatal shot had been fired with, of all things, a bow and arrow,
"the Coroner replied, that he was not in the least surprised.
"He understood from those who knew about such things,
"that this ancient weapon
"had recently had something of a vogue among the young."
People don't want to hear the truth, Catherine.
I shall never come here again.
Not again.
I want to seat by the window.
Oh, my watch!
I forgot my watch!
I left it in my bedroom!
Did you think I'd forgotten?
No, my son.
I knew you would come.
Did you find it?
Yes. subtitles - Orion1
Who is the most self-reliant animal
made since the world began?
Who can be the most defiant animal
known to the world of man?
born with emerald eyes
so cold, so warm, so wise
within her kingdom lies
the world's arena
do we need to ask more than that?
you must know now it's a cat
but a very important cat at that
who's called...
Thomasina!
Thomasina
what are you thinking now?
Thomasina
what makes you so highbrow?
for I do think it very odd
if you are an Egyptian God
that the wee, little mouse
runs in and out his house
each time you blink or nod
Thomasina
though you may love to roam
Thomasina
don't go too far from home
there are beasties in the garden
who would never accept your pardon
if you left the jungle yard in
which we play
Thomasina
don't ever run away
Thomasina
come along with me now
Thomasina
though you've seen a
little bird leave the bough
Thomasina
even if it's a lark or dove, you
let them all fly away above you
but I guess I'll always love you
anyhow
Thomasina
come along with me now
Thomasina
I love you anyhow
Thomasi...
Yes, I am Thomasina.
This story's all about me.
I'm a self-made cat,
And here's the house
I live in
With the Macdhui family,
Whom I'd adopted when they first came here.
They started off by calling me Thomas,
But when they, well, got to know me better,
They changed that to Thomasina.
Humans are funny that way.
That the Macdhuis are a happy family
Is entirely due to me.
I made them what they are today...
Although I had to be murdered first.
Here's the scene of the crime -
Inveranoch, in Scotland,
In 1912.
And this is Mr. Andrew Macdhui.
From a cat's point of view, even before my murder,
He was a most difficult man,
Believe me.
His wife had died sometime before he came here,
So there was just himself
And Mrs. Mackenzie, his housekeeper,
And Mary, his daughter.
I'd moved in on them a few days after they'd arrived,
And on the whole,
I got on with them very well,
Though mostly because of Mary Macdhui.
She appreciated my rather special qualities
From the start.
Thomasina, there you are.
Of course I had this sort of thing
To put up with every day -
Fussed over, treated like a doll,
Being dressed up...
And over a fur coat, too!
Everything that happened to me from here on
Was due, in a way,
To a blind man and his dog.
Here they are now -
Tammas and Bruce.
Good morning,
Tammas.
Good morning, Mary.
Say good morning to Tammas and Bruce, Thomasina.
Good morning, Thomasina.
She's not in a very talkative mood today.
I have the same trouble with Bruce here.
He can be very reserved at times.
Isn't that right, laddie?
But what would we do without them, you and me?
Where are you going?
Oh, just to get some tobacco for my pipe.
Mind how you go, Tammas.
Och, Bruce is my eyes, lassie.
Come on, say goodbye to Thomasina.
Be good now, Mary.
Thomasina, it's rude not to answer
When you're spoken to.
Aah!
Hello, Geordie.
Oh, what have you got there?
I found him down by the loch.
I think his leg's broken.
He can't hop or swim or anything.
Oh, he looks fair sick.
Doesn't he, Thomasina?
Ah! Don't touch.
Why don't you go and ask my daddy to cure him?
Och, I don't know.
Do you think he would?
My daddy can cure anything -
Dogs and cows and cats and lions and pigs and...
Aye, but frogs?
And frogs.
Everything.
You take him in, then.
Och, I'm not allowed in the surgery.
You go, Geordie.
Well, if you say so.
I'm only saying I'm here against my better judgment, minister, that's all.
You'll be glad you listened to me, Dobbie.
Mr. Macdhui's a clever man.
Maybe so, but up till now,
I've never found much wrong with dosing Jock here
With Watson’s patent powders.
Ah, you must move with the times, man.
Macdhui's a man of science.
Aye. I Haven't heard tell much good of that.
Ha! Book learnin'.
Up at Kinkairale's farm, they're grateful enough to him.
Two hundred sheep cured of the foot rot
And not one lost.
Aye, you're a good persuader,
Mr. Peddie,
But farm beasts are one thing.
A man's pet is another.
You wait and see.
Och, I'll give him a try.
No one can say
I'm not a fair man,
But it's for him to convince me.
How old is this dog,
Mrs. Laggan?
Fifteen years and a bit.
I've had him since he was a puppy,
The year my husband died.
He's been ailing a wee bit this past year
But not so sick as this.
Well, he's very old.
The kindest thing would be to have him put to sleep.
Oh, no. You see how bad he is with the asthma.
The poor dog can hardly breathe.
He's in pain, Mrs. Laggan.
But you can't put Rabbie to sleep, Mr. Macdhui,
Or I wouldn't have come.
He's all I have in the world.
Couldn't you give him a wee bit of medicine
To tide him over till he's well again?
There is no medicine that can make him well.
He's very old, he's in great pain,
And his life is a misery to him, can't you see?
But I can't lose him.
What would I do without him?
Poor Rabbie.
Be fair now. It's yourself you're pitying, not the dog.
Oh, dear.
I don't know what to do.
I've told you what I think is for the best.
Now I've told you it's up to you
To make up your mind.
Very well.
I suppose if he is suffering...
You'll be gentle with him?
He won't feel a thing.
He'll just go to sleep.
Willie?
Fifteen years.
Poor Rabbie.
Poor Rabbie.
You're doing the right thing.
It's for his sake.
Oh, no, there'll be no charge.
Just leave him here with me.
You're leaving Rabbie to be cured, then, Annie?
Mr. Macdhui says there's no cure.
He's to be put away.
now, Mrs. Laggan, that's a shame.
No cure for him?
If it was my dog, I'd want a second opinion, I'm thinkin'.
I'll go with you, Annie.
Good day to you,
Mr. Macdhui.
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Who's next, please?
Please, sir, Mr. Macdhui?
Uh-oh. Who are you?
Geordie Macnab, please, sir.
I'm a bit of a friend of Mary's.
I found him down by the loch.
He's hurt his leg.
Can you make him better, please, sir?
No one can cure a hurt frog, Geordie.
You put him back where you found him.
But he might die.
Could you not mend his leg, please, sir?
No, nature's the only doctor can do that, laddie.
Come on, now.
Come on, off you go.
I'm busy.
You've lost another customer, Andrew.
Is there really nothing you can do
About old Mrs. Laggan's dog?
No, not a thing, just put it out of its misery.
Well, whoever's next,
Will you come in, please?
Oh, it's all right,
Mrs. Campbell.
You go in ahead of me.
I'm in no hurry.
hey, there's Geordie.
What have you been doing in there?
I took my sick frog to Mr. Macdhui.
Oh, aye.
What did he say, then?
He wouldn't even look at him,
And he's going to kill
Mrs. Laggan's Rabbie.
Kill him? Rabbie?
Aye, I heard him say so.
It's just like grandfather says about him -
He's only good with farm beasts.
He's not interested in people's pets.
A frog Will die if he can't hop or swim.
I'm not going to let him die.
What are you gonna do, then,
Cure him by magic or something?
Come on, Jamie.
Why don't you take your frog
To the witch woman livin' in the Glen?
She's supposed to do magic.
Well, why don't you?
Our mother says the witch woman's crazy
And we're not to go up there.
Och, you're just afraid, the pair of you.
I'm not afraid of anything, and neither is Geordie.
Are you, Geordie?
Right. Let's take the frog to her, all three of us.
I dare you.
Very well.
Geordie, we'll all go.
You want to get your frog cured, don't you?
We don't have to tell mother we went.
I was only joking.
No, you weren't.
You dared us.
I think you're afraid to go.
Me, afraid?
Let's go now.
Come on.
Keep up with us.
You'd think they were all telling on us.
Aye. Are you afraid to go on, then?
No.
Well, come on.
Whisht! Listen.
It's the witch singing and banging a drum.
She is crazy.
I want to go home.
When you've got this far?
What about your frog?
Put your box under the tree and ring the bell.
Aye, go on, Geordie.
We'll wait for you here.
No, no! Go on, Geordie. Go on.
Come on, Geordie.
Go away. Go away.
Go away. Go away.
Larry, come back here.
Oh, your leg is broken.
You poor wee thing.
Has somebody brought you up here to be cured
By the mad witch in the Glen?
Eye of newt and hair of dog,
Give me the power to cure the frog.
listen. Magic.
Off to my cauldron.
Where is my broom?
Och, you poor wee thing.
I don't know why
I bother
To dose that dog of yours.
The worst thing that's wrong with him is his owner.
Don't give him sugar.
Aw, but he has a sweet tooth, Andrew.
Poor old Finn.
Look how pleased he is.
You think more of his affection and gratitude for you
Than you do of his health.
All you people with pets are the same.
That's why he's too fat, poor brute.
"brute," he calls you, Finn.
Oh! That's part of the reason
Why folks here are slow to accept your doctoring.
You show no feeling for the sick animals you treat,
The animals they love.
Are sentimental about, you mean, to the point of not knowing
What's best for them, like you and
Mrs. Laggan who was here just now.
Poor old Annie.
Poor old Annie.
Poor old brute of a dog, you should say.
You thought I was hard on her just now, didn't you?
My job is to relieve suffering in animals.
The tribulations of the soul
I leave to you.
She'll get over it, angus.
Aye, but when someone you love dies,
Something of yourself dies, too.
You think you have to tell me that?
Oh, I'm sorry, Andrew.
Forgive me.
That dog of hers was all old
Annie Laggan had left to love.
At least you're not alone.
No.
Look at her now.
Thomasina, where are you?
Thomasina?
Be careful.
It's the jungle.
It's a million Miles thick.
It's full of lions and tigers.
Thomasina!
Thomasina, come back!
Have you lost something, Mary?
Shh! We're hunting lions.
Lions? Here?
Geordie, where's your frog?
Did daddy cure him?
No, he wouldn't try.
We took it to the witch in the Glen.
You didn't. I did. We all did.
You saw her?
Is she a real witch?
Aye, we saw her chant magic over the frog
And take it into her house.
Did you speak to her?
Och, no. She's queer in the head.
She's got a big drum in the house.
She bangs on it and sings awful weird.
There's all kinds of animals there.
Did she fly on a broomstick?
Well, not exactly fly.
But she had one, though.
Weren't you afraid?
Well, I wouldn't recommend just anybody goin' up there.
You were afraid.
You made Geordie take the frog to the tree.
That was you.
I wasn't afraid.
You must be awful brave.
I am... A bit.
Uh... Remember, angus,
Just keep him off the sugar.
Well, I can try.
Hello, Mary.
Geordie Macnab took his frog you wouldn't cure
To a witch who does magic and flies on a broomstick.
She could have turned him into a frog,
And it would have been all your fault.
Mary, Mr. Andrew,
I'm waiting for you.
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.
Thomasina!
Never mind Thomasina.
Dinnertime!
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.
There's a good girl.
That's enough about witches.
Mrs. Mackenzie Will tell you the same as me -
There aren't any outside of storybooks.
Oh, yes, there are.
She been making up more of her fairy tales?
I didn't make it up. There is a witch in the Glen.
Och, the Glen.
She bangs a big drum in her house.
And lives with wild animals and rides a broomstick.
Jamie Macnab told me.
He and Hughie and Geordie saw her.
They're filling your head with nonsense.
And for the hundredth time, Will you not feed that cat at the table?
Especially with meat.
She likes meat, and there is a witch.
Now, Mary...
It's a poor wee soul called Lori Macgregor
That's rented a croft in the Glen from Mr. Peddie.
She spends most of her time weaving on a handloom.
That's the "drums" your friends heard.
Now what do you say?
She's a witch.
She's a wee bit weird, that's true enough.
It seems she's a lassie
That doesn't mix with other folk,
But, mind, she's not been there long.
Some of the shepherds in the Glen say
She has a rare way with beasts and birds and that.
Now, mind Thomasina doesn't spill her cream.
Cream?
Oh, just a wee drop,
Mr. Andrew.
It helps her to see in the dark.
She told me so.
Didn't you, Thomasina?
There, you hear?
Ask her if she'd like me to go out and get my rod and catch her a salmon.
Thomasina...
She says, no,
She'd rather go to the store on market day
And choose her own fish.
Aye.
Come on, now, no more talk about witches or magic.
Just say your prayers, get into bed.
And look after mummy in Heaven and us down here,
Especially daddy and Mrs. Mackenzie
And Willie and Geordie and Jamie and Hughie and Tammas and Bruce
And Geordie's frog and Thomasina and me.
That's all till tomorrow.
Yours truly, Mary. Amen.
Good night, yours truly Mary.
Slippers?
Up. In you get.
There we are.
Good night.
Good night, daddy.
Thomasina.
I've told you about that before, my bonny.
You mustn't keep that cat on the bed at night.
There.
Oh, please let me have her.
No, you can have your doll if you like.
I don't want my doll.
Please.
She must go out and you must go to sleep.
Go on, lie down.
There's a good girl.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Thomasina.
You know.
Yes, I knew,
And Macdhui didn't.
This being put out for the night
Was just nonsense.
I could get in again anytime I wanted to.
Mary and I had it all worked out.
It was as easy as that.
Thomasina.
Thomasina, come on up.
But not tonight.
I'd remembered it was Wednesday,
The night before market day.
They set up the stalls at dawn,
So Wednesday's always my night out.
And just when I was beginning to feel like breakfast,
The market was getting ready to provide it.
Fish, fresh fish,
And the best sauce for it -
The danger of helping myself...
...Which needed cunning and caution,
A lot of caution...
And speed!
You, get out of the way!
Get out!
Mary?
Mary, come and have your breakfast.
What's the child doing?
Mary!
I can't find Thomasina.
I've looked everywhere.
She can't be far away.
Come on, now, sit down.
She didn't come home last night.
For what we're about to receive,
May the lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
I'm not hungry.
Daddy, she must be lost.
Of course not.
Cats don't get lost once they've decided to move in on people.
She's just had a night out and hasn't come back yet, that's all.
She's been out all night before,
But she's always come back.
She climbs up the tree and gets in my window.
What?
She always has.
It's our secret.
Aye, it certainly is.
Well, I'm off to the surgery now.
Be a good girl.
Eat your breakfast.
Don't worry about the pussy, child.
But she's lost.
Thomasina's too clever to get lost.
You do like her, don't you?
Aye, of course.
Would you do anything for her if I asked you to?
Promise?
Aye.
Well, let me go and look for her now, please.
You promised.
You're even craftier than
Thomasina, you wee monkey.
We'll split up.
Mary, you come with me.
Hey, what are you lookin' for, son?
A lost cat.
Have you seen one?
Not at my stall. Away you go. Go on. I'm busy.
She's a big... Mrs.
Macfarland, what would you like?
Nice cabbage.
Have you seen a lost cat?
Thank you very much.
Drat the cat!
Och, it's not Thomasina.
But never mind.
We'll find her.
Hughie, Mary,
I've found her!
She's here, Mary!
Oh, Thomasina.
Give her to me.
I don't think anything's broken,
But she's terribly stiff.
Oh, poor Thomasina.
I couldn't help it, constable.
He walked right in front of me.
it looks like Bruce.
Bruce? My Bruce?
What's all this about?
Och, Mr. Macdhui.
You're just here in time.
It's Tammas' Bruce.
Where is he?
Steady now, Tammas.
Steady.
He's fair crushed, sir.
I couldn't help it,
Mr. Macdhui.
Better get him back to the surgery - quick.
Bruce is my eyes,
Mr. Macdhui.
Can you save him? I'll do what
I can. Stay with him, angus.
He's in good hands now, Tammas.
Now, come on, you come with me.
This is going to take a long time.
I hope his heart
Will stand it.
Are you ready?
The Spencer wells, Willie.
How is he, Willie?
He's doin' fine.
What are you children doing?
Mary, go away from here.
Daddy, it's Thomasina.
She's hurt.
Go away, child.
Please look at her.
She's awful sick.
Here, Willie, take this cat.
Daddy, daddy, please look at her. Please make her well.
Mary, you mustn't stay here.
Now, listen to me.
I've got blind Tammas' dog here. He's badly hurt.
Well, so is Thomasina.
If you only look at her!
All right, I'll look at her, but go away, all of you.
You'll make her well?
You promise?
Yes, I promise, but go on out.
Come on.
Out, all of you.
I think you better look at her, sir.
Not now, man.
We got work to do.
Mr. Macdhui, sir, look.
Quick, get her out of here, and that cloth she's laying on.
That cat has tetanus.
Get her out of here.
Deal with her, disinfect your hands and hurry back.
But, sir... Mr. Macdhui, you promised the child.
The cat is beyond help.
Will you do as I tell you?
Hurry up, man.
We've the dog to seal.
Aye, I Will.
I Will.
Nearly an hour already.
How much longer can it be?
Aye, the waiting is hard.
Well, Bruce Will live, Tammas.
He'll even walk again.
Thank God.
Take me to him.
Not now.
He's still unconscious.
But I'll send Willie round to fetch you this evening.
Bruce Will know you then.
And he'll get better?
Aye, be as good as new.
It's a great skill you have, Mr. Macdhui,
And no one can deny it.
There now, what did I tell you?
Come on, Tammas,
I'll take you home.
God bless you,
Mr. Macdhui.
God bless you.
His pulse rate's fine.
I'll stay with him till he wakes.
Aye, he'll do.
I never thought to see such a surgery as that.
Aye, and what you have to do now
Will be just as hard,
I'm thinking.
You have to tell the child about her cat.
"the shoeblack tries his bread to earn
"and would an honest penny turn.
"when mud upon our boots leave stains,
"his ready help good payment gains.
The beefeater we see today... "
Daddy, Thomasina - is she better?
She's out of pain, Mary.
What was wrong with her?
Let me go to her.
She is better, isn't she?
Mary, uh, now,
Will you listen?
Listen to me just a minute.
You see, there are some things
That you have to learn to face,
Even if at first they seem a bit unfair.
Where is she?
Thomasina's wound was poisoned,
And she might have made other people's pets ill, even die.
But you did save her?
I- I couldn't, Mary.
I couldn't.
See, there are some things your daddy can do and some things he can't.
What did you do to her?
I, uh, had her put to sleep.
There was nothing else
I could do.
Now, try to understand, Mary.
No! No! You said you'd make her better.
You promised! You promised! Come on, Mary...
I'll never speak to you again! Mary, please...
He promised, and he's killed Thomasina!
She's dead!
I'll go up to her.
Aye.
And take everything she was wearing when she found the cat.
Everything, do you hear?
And burn what you can't boil.
I didn't realize she was going to take it so hard.
Could you not have saved the cat?
It was wounded, infected with tetanus.
I did what was right.
I'll get her another cat.
Can't I?
Well? Can't I?
Well, I'll buy her anything she wants.
Why did she take it so hard?
For a clever man,
You've an awful lot to learn.
Don't be so sad.
You'll do yourself harm.
Look, I tell you what we'll do.
We'll give Thomasina the best funeral any cat ever had, won't we?
Aye, with a full service and everything.
My mother's got just the right box
That'd do fine for a casket.
We could pick some flowers and have a procession,
Like when Old Dougal was buried.
Everyone in the village would see us.
Aye, you'll wear widow's mournings
And walk behind the casket, weeping.
And Annie here, she can be chief mourner.
I can cry awful loud, Mary.
not now.
Will I wear a hat and a black coat?
Mrs. Mackenzie has one.
Aye, we'll all dress up and get everyone to come.
I know! Jamie's just learning the pipes.
He's not very good... I can play Macktintosh's lament!
I'll wear my dress kilt with my skean dhu and sporran,
And everyone in the street Will say,
"there goes the poor widow Macdhui,
"a-burying of her dear Thomasina,
Foully done to death,
God rest her soul. "
Will they? Really?
Aye. It'll be a great, great procession.
You'll see.
We'll go and get Thomasina now!
Aye, come on.
I opened my eyes,
And where was I?
They say that to die
Is a Journey from light into darkness,
But here was light again.
This was no quiet endless sleep.
I was flying,
Flying wildly,
Without weight or effort,
Diving, spinning,
Falling backward and downward
Into the mists of time,
Where my ancestors were worshipped
In the temples to bast
Thousands of years ago.
Bast, the cat goddess,
The goddess with the golden eyes
Staring and staring,
Drawing me upward and upward
And upward and upward.
Then there were flowers,
Flowers everywhere,
All around me, touching me,
And the sound of music
Wild enough to wake the dead.
playing
"mackintosh's lament")
Lord sakes,
What are the children a- burying today?
Mary Macdhui's cat
Thomasina.
My grandson Hughie told me
Her father couldna be bothered to cure its sickness.
His own daughter's pet.
Ah, well, maybe he was busy at the time,
You know, what wi' Tammas' dog,
And after all, it's a blind man's eyes.
His own daughter's pet.
It's hard to understand.
Right.
This is far enough.
Put it here.
Now get some stones and build a cairn for the grave.
Now get the coffin off
And put it down just there, you two.
Come on, hurry.
Now get some stones.
Come on, get some stones.
That'll do fine.
Now, let's get on with the service.
I'm going to take the service.
It was my idea.
No, you're not.
I'm the oldest, and I've come prepared.
Brethren, friends, and fellow mourners...
och! Go on, then.
We have come here today
To bury Thomasina and to praise her.
She was the friend of Mary
Macdhui here, who you all know.
Uh, eh, well, anyway, there she is.
Shh! Not yet.
Hold your noise.
Thomasina was one of the best cats in all Argyllshire,
And we all feel for her best friend and owner.
Whisht!
Not yet, not yet.
There is no doubt that Thomasina was a terrific mouser, too.
She had a few faults, aye,
But I won't mention them here.
Uh, and her mortal remains
Will now be laid to rest.
Now!
playing "the Bonny Banks
O' Loch Lomond")
by yon bonny banks and by yon bonny braes
where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond
where me and my true love
Will never meet again
on the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond
oh, ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the...
It's mad Lori.
and I'll be in Scotland afore...
It's the witch!
She's coming for us.
Run for it!
Run quickly!
She's a witch!
Run for it!
The witch!
The witch!
What were they doing?
Your heart's still beating.
Oh, poor thing.
Didn't they know?
You come with me.
Mary, come on in and get your supper.
Hello, Mary.
What have you been doing all afternoon?
Mary, your father's speaking to you.
Mrs. Mackenzie,
I've seen the witch
That lives up in the Glen.
What?
We all ran away from her...
Hughie and Geordie and
Jamie and Jock and Annie.
What's this nonsense now?
And what were you doing in the Glen?
And she is a witch.
I've seen her.
So there.
Mary, the... The kittens that
Mr. Peddie's cat Amanda had
Are now ready to leave their mother.
Would you like to come and choose one for yourself?
Mary!
Would you like to come
To Mr. Peddie's with me tomorrow
And choose a kitten?
Jamie Macnab can play
"mackintosh's lament" on the pipes
With only nine mistakes.
Answer me, Mary.
Answer your father, child.
But he's not very good at "Loch Lomond. "
This is ridiculous.
If this is her way of sulking just because...
Don't you want your supper?
No, I do not.
Now who's sulking?
Tell miss Macdhui if she does want a kitten, she'll have to come and ask me.
Everybody was real scared when they saw the witch, except me.
I wasn't.
I just looked at her and said,
"I'm not afraid of you. "
Oh, give me strength.
Oh, you and your stories.
Eat your supper.
Now you've made your father angry.
No, I Haven't.
My father's dead.
by yon bonny banks
and by yon bonny braes
when the Moon...
bright on Loch Lomond
Don't cry, child.
I Haven't seen you cry for a long, long time.
Look, Mary, I'm sorry about Thomasina.
I've told you.
I'll get you another cat,
Or maybe a wee dog to be all your very own.
Wouldn't you like that?
Now, look, child, I can't bring Thomasina back to life.
What's done is done!
Oh, very well.
Good night, then.
Oh, granddad, don't keep on about it so.
That cat's funeral was nothing but a children's game.
Not to some of us.
I'm tellin' you...
I've said it before and I'm saying it now -
That Mr. Macdhui is doing no good here.
Now, don't interrupt me, woman.
He's a townsman, not a highlander.
He has no feeling for animals at all.
Oh, come now, granddad.
Some of the farmers round...
The farmers?
Did you not hear that he made an order
To destroy the whole herd of Ian Macclennen's cattle
Because one cow was sick?
That's the law. They had foot-and-mouth disease.
It wasna the law in my day,
And it was only Macdhui's opinion that they had it.
and look at his record.
Never mind the cattle.
Annie Laggan's old dog Rabbie
- he had him killed.
He saved blind Tammas'
Bruce, though.
Oh, aye, that was because everybody was there watching.
That was just showin' off.
Now, granddad, you shouldn't say that.
Well, the man that did what he did...
And he wouldna even take the trouble
To treat his own daughter's cat when it was sick...
Is no better than a murderer.
It'd be a good thing if he went away.
I'd make it too hot for him here,
I'm telling you, if I was younger.
So would others.
Him and his newfangled science.
Mary!
Mary Macdhui!
Are you coming out to play?
Mary!
She won't be comin' out today. She's in mourning.
And anyway, we've got work to do.
What work?
Forming an anti-Macdhui society
To drive him out of Inveranoch.
Och, listen to him.
My grandpa said he's no better than a murderer.
Your grandpa?
And he told me Mr. Macdhui
Had two whole herds of cows slaughtered
Because he thought one beast was sick.
People are saying he ought to go, and I think we ought to join them.
And what does blind Tammas say about him?
Och, he's only one.
Now, here's what we'll do.
Me and you, Geordie...
Morning,
Mrs. Macleod.
Morning.
You're not thinking of taking your cat to Mr. Macdhui, are you?
Why not? Och, he won't bother with it.
He doesn't care for anybody's pets.
What?
He'll just say,
"can't be cured,"
And then kill it.
Get away wi' you.
It's true. He even did it to his own daughter's cat.
And Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He killed them.
I did hear about Rabbie, but he was awful old.
That cat of yours is younger than Mary's Thomasina.
You take him in there,
And he'll just get his bottle of chloroform and...
Just a minute, Harry.
Listen.
We were just telling Mrs. Macleod,
Mr. Wallis, about Mr. Macdhui.
You'd be well advised not to take your dog in there.
I'm thinkin' of rebuilding my pigsties.
You know, I've had two outbreaks of swine fever up to now.
Have you spoken to this new vet here... Uh, Macdhui?
Not yet.
Is he any good?
One of Mr. Macclennen's cows had foot-and-mouth disease,
And Mr. Macdhui had two whole herds killed.
That young Annie of mine
Took my best black shawl from my closet yesterday
And tore it into ribbons in some game.
Aye, I saw them playing at funerals,
Burying young
Mary Macdhui's cat.
Mr. Macdhui killed it.
Killed it?
Aye, the same as he did
Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He kills things.
He saved Tammas' Bruce, laddie.
Aye, because everybody was there watching.
That was showin' off.
He's an animal murderer.
You tell me he killed his daughter's cat?
He didn't like it,
So he took his gun and killed it.
His gun? Well!
Och! Isn't that awful?
Well, now, Andrew.
Glad I saw you.
I wanted a word with you about Mary.
I did what you said, asked her to come round
And choose one of your kittens,
But she'd have none of it, or me, either.
It's like speaking with a blank wall.
To a child of her age, feeling is stronger than reason.
You know that, Andrew.
Aye, and grief is usually forgotten quickly, too,
But the death of this cat, it's like an obsession with her.
Well, she's something of a loner child.
Forgive me.
She has no mother, and she needs someone to love.
She has me.
I'd do anything for her.
No child's ever been loved so much. Unselfishly?
What do you mean?
Tell me the truth, Andrew.
Were you maybe a wee bit jealous
Of that cat of hers?
The truth, now.
The animal had to be destroyed.
It would have died anyway.
You can take my word for that.
Angus, would you do me a favor? Do you think you could have a talk with her?
You might be able to reason with her.
Well, I can try.
I wish you would.
She's at home now.
You ought to be out playing in the sunshine
And not moping here indoors.
Geordie Macnab and Hughie came asking for you.
Why don't you go and look for them?
Oh, Mr. Peddie,
Mr. Andrew's not in.
I was just passing by,
Mrs. Mackenzie,
And I thought
I'd pay a call on Mary.
Would she be at home, do you think?
I'm here, Mr. Peddie.
Well, now, there you are.
You were so quiet,
I didn't see you.
It's fair warm outdoors.
You're wise to stay inside.
Would you mind if I sit down and rest a while?
Here?
Ooh, I think the stairs are a grand place
When you want to have a good think.
You know, I was thinking just now about your Thomasina.
What with my own cats,
I get all mixed up remembering what yours was like.
Thomasina, now, he was about...
She.
Oh, aye, she, yes.
Thomasina.
She was about, what...
So long?
And did she not have a wee square blaze on her chest?
No, it was round.
Round? Aye!
Now you remind me.
It was round, aye.
But she did have three little white feet, didn't she?
No white feet at all.
No? Oh.
But she had a pink nose
With two black specks on it.
I remember that well.
No specks.
No specks?
Do you remember
How she'd sit and look at you sometimes
With just the tip of her tongue showing?
When she was waiting to be fed.
Yes, when she was waiting to be fed.
You see, Mary,
Thomasina isn't dead at all,
Not really dead,
Not when we can remember her together like this,
Because she's alive in our minds. No!
And as long as you can remember her like this, she'll never die.
Just call her to your mind, and she'll come,
Even if you were to have another wee cat to love.
You know, I was saying to your daddy just this morning...
My daddy's dead.
I killed him.
Did you, Mary?
How?
I killed him.
I put him in a box with flowers in it.
We all took him out into the Glen and had a funeral,
And now I Haven't anybody at all.
Mary...
No! I like being alone!
Good day to you, Birnie.
I'm here to look at the bull.
I've let him out.
He's in the paddock.
Oh, right. I'll find him.
No need to, Mr. Macdhui.
He'll do very well.
Just tell me how much your fees are.
What's all this about?
I'll be no more needing a veterinary.
If there's anything wrong with my beasts,
I'll take them to the woman in the Glen.
She's a rare way with them and charges nothing, I'm told.
Is that where you're takin' the cow?
Aye, my man is.
What's wrong with her?
She's dried.
You have as much chance of getting pints of beer as milk
Listening to that rubbish.
I thought you were becoming enlightened, Birnie.
What I do with my beasts is no concern of yourself, Mr. Macdhui.
This cow has no disease reportable under the acts of the county.
Your bull didn't, either.
Aye, I didn't know then what sort of a vet you were -
Putting beasts to death whenever it suits you.
What?
Aye, my stockman heard it from his son at school in Inveranoch -
The dogs and cats you've no use for,
Even your own child's pet.
I see.
So you believe that,
And you're going back to the witchcraft and the superstition.
You said times change.
Well, maybe they're changing back again, Mr. Macdhui.
The old remedies are as good as book learning, sir.
Good day to you.
Apart from Mary,
I've another headache now.
The whole village seems to be boycotting me and spreading tales
About what a heartless monster I am.
Och, a few children.
It's having its effect.
In a few days, the people have forgotten
That the blind man's dog is alive because of me,
But they remember the few creatures that I had to have destroyed.
Be patient with them, Andrew. Patient?
Tell me something.
What do you know about a half-witted woman named, uh...
...Named Lori who pretends to be a witch?
Well, I rented her the croft she's living in.
I know that.
That's why I'm asking you.
And she's not half-witted, nor does she pretend to be a witch.
She's been labeled that, just as you say you've been labeled a monster,
Only she doesn't mind, because she wants to be left alone.
Well, she's not succeeding.
At least two farmers that I'd won round to scientific treatment
Are taking their beasts to her.
Aye, I hear she has a remarkable skill with animals.
What skill?
Without real knowledge, you can do great harm.
Would you take a sick child to a quack doctor?
Some people have natural gifts, Andrew,
And Lori Macgregor has the rare quality of mercy.
Since you know her so well, perhaps you'd tell her
To stop undermining the progress that
I'm trying to bring to these people here.
Why don't you tell her,
Andrew,
And tell me afterwards what you make of her.
Aye. Aye, I Will, one day,
And put a stop to her interference with my work.
Time passed,
And I began to see and feel again.
I couldn't remember any part of my first life,
Although something told me
I'd lived before,
That I was still me.
I'd heard that a cat has nine lives.
I accepted the fact, so...
This was my second life,
My life with a girl named Lori.
She was gentle and kind,
I'll give her that,
But she didn't seem to realize -
And neither did the other creatures around me
- how important I was.
There we are.
All of you -
Dorcas, Mack,
Molly,
Whisker - be nice to Thomasina now.
"be nice," she said,
But none of the others paid any attention to me at all.
They weren't really my kind anyway.
Thomasina, dear,
Go and walk in the sun now you're able.
There are others here who are not.
I wasn't important anymore,
Treated just like everybody else.
Now I knew how a king feels in exile.
Hughie, Jamie, quick!
what is it?
Come and see quick.
A badger.
He's been in the trap a long time,
And he's badly hurt.
What'll we do with him?
If we try and take the trap off, he'll only bite.
We could wrap him up in a sack, trap and all,
And take him to the village, to the vet.
To Mr. Macdhui?
We can't do that.
We're trying to get rid of him.
What else, then?
Couldn't we take the badger to the witch?
She's nearer.
Aye, that's true.
She couldn't cure a mess like that with magic.
I bet she could.
Mr. Macdhui would only kill it,
So let's wrap him up and take him to the witch.
Jamie, get the things.
I'll get the sack.
Careful now.
You've got him?
Aye, got him.
Seeing and hearing these boys gave me that
"I've been here before" feeling.
You know what I mean?
I knew them, and yet I didn't.
They made me feel uneasy somehow,
So I kept an eye on them.
Well, who's gonna take him to her, then?
You. You're the eldest, you're always telling us.
Aye, but - but it was Geordie's idea.
He's too big for Geordie to carry,
But if you're afraid...
I'm not afraid of anything.
Well, go on, then.
Put him by the tree and ring that bell.
Oh, poor thing.
Poor thing.
Oh, God, please, God, help me.
Wait!
Don't touch it.
But it's hurt, from that.
Cursed gin traps.
Look what it's done to...
Mind yourself.
Drop it. It'll tear your throat out.
It'll not harm me. No creature harms me. They're not afraid.
Put it down. You're mad. Aye, so I hear.
Get away from it.
Let me go. Let me go!
I'm sorry, but a wounded badger could half kill you.
No creature ever harms me. Don't touch him!
Leave him to me.
To you?
Why, who are you?
My name is Macdhui. I'm the veterinary from Inveranoch.
You are?
Now I see.
What do you mean?
You have the skill that I Haven't,
The skill that I prayed for when I found the badger.
Don't you see? You're meant to help him, and you must.
It's no use, I tell you.
It's too late.
Be kinder to put him out of his pain.
And wonderful to give him his life.
You have the skill for it.
Please, for pity's sake.
Don't go!
I've got to get my instruments.
They're in my car.
God, you sent him.
Please make him hurry back.
Well, that's it.
We'll have to see how it takes.
Still, they're hardy creatures with great vitality.
He has a chance.
Bless you and thank you for giving it the hance.
He'll have to stay quiet until the wounds heal.
Have you got a place where you can keep him?
Yes.
All right.
Are all these wild things in your care?
Yes, they come here to me.
Some instinct or guardian
Angel brings them.
And what kind of treatment do you give them?
Food, warmth, comfort and love.
And let nature take its course,
And that mends them.
And what about the other beasts that are brought to you?
Farmer Birnie's cow, for instance.
I know all about that.
What did you do for her?
I sent her back to him with a message for him to be kinder to her.
Ha. Like to seen his face.
And this?
I found him one morning by the tree outside in a box.
He had a broken leg, but he's better now.
Well, I can describe his guardian Angel to you.
He's about six years old, red hair, and his name is Geordie Macnab.
Well, keep your eye on the badger, Miss Macgregor,
And see that he doesn't tear off the dressing.
Aye, I'll watch him.
You know, um, in Inveranoch,
They, uh, they call you "witch,"
And if you can get all these creatures here to live together in peace,
Perhaps there's some truth in it.
The truth is that they have security
Because they've no fear.
Animals are not like people.
They only fight and kill when they're hungry or afraid,
Not for gain or to prove how strong they are.
You don't have to be a witch to understand that.
What made you come here,
Mr. Macdhui?
Well, I-I thought that, uh...
It's no matter now.
I must go.
I've work to do.
Wait. I must pay you for the work you've done.
Um, there's no need.
Will you take this, then, from me?
I made it here.
Then I'm glad to have it.
Thank you.
I knew the man...
And yet I didn't know him.
He reminded me of someone,
Something that was missing in my present life.
What do you think he's done?
Killed it.
But the witch wouldn't let him.
He wouldn't be likely to help her with magic, now, would he?
Suppose we had a look through the window.
It's our badger.
We're responsible for him.
Aye. Maybe if we were careful...
Come on, Geordie.
If she catches us,
You can say you came to see how your frog was getting on.
You want to know, don't you?
Come on, then.
Psst!
the badger's in here.
I think he's dead.
I told you Mr. Macdhui would kill him.
Here, Geordie, you're the smallest.
Climb up and have a look.
He's not dead.
I can see him breathing.
are you sure?
Look out!
ow!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Och! It's all right.
What's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Let me go!
You're the one who brought the frog to me.
He's better now.
His leg has mended.
Do you want him back?
Then come and see him.
He's not very strong at hopping yet,
But he can swim all right.
He's going in with her.
She must have put a spell on him.
Here's your wee frog.
Look.
Oh, he's better.
Did you do it with magic?
With a powerful magic,
Geordie.
You know my name.
Cor!
Was it you who brought the wounded badger, too?
Is he going to be all right, please?
Did you do magic with him?
No, that was Mr. Macdhui.
What he did was magic.
Mr. Macdhui - does he do magic?
He has a wonderful skill that's almost magic.
He saved the badger's life.
Can I go now?
Don't you want to take your frog?
Thank you for curing my frog.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Well, not much, that is,
But I have to go now.
are you all right?
Yes. Look, she cured the frog.
But what about the badger? She cured him, too.
She put a spell on Mr. Macdhui and made him help her.
She's an awful good witch.
Hello, Mary.
Do you know what I did today?
Went up to the Glen to see your witch.
You know, she's not a witch at all.
She, uh... Isn't even what Mrs.
Mack calls, uh, "something weird. "
She's a bit like yourself -
Wants to be left alone.
Except that she's, uh,
She's got all kinds of creatures up there with her -
Squirrels and rabbits, stray dogs, cats,
Uh, wild birds
And a -
And a badger.
If I go up there again,
Would you like to come with me and see him?
Look, Mary,
I brought you a present.
look.
Something of your very own.
Och, I couldn't get nowhere with her.
She shows no signs of wearying of this game she's playing, that I'm not there.
And how do you play it,
Andrew?
Talk to her, behave as if everything was normal between us,
Read stories to her, but she pays no heed.
And that wee dog you got for her?
She'd have none of it.
I had to take it away again.
No, she won't forgive me, because I failed her.
At least, that's the way she sees it.
I think the trouble lies deeper than that.
You were the only human focus for her love.
That's why her shock of disappointment in you was so great.
Andrew, have you ever thought of getting married again?
No.
You need another focus for your love
Besides the child, and Mary needs a mother.
It's too late for me to fall in love again.
Oh... So you've seen
Lori Macgregor.
Aye, I've seen her.
What do you make of her?
Don't know.
She, uh, she has a-a strange way with her,
A strange skill that's instinctive.
I don't understand how she lives out there, cut off, alone,
And yet doesn't seem to be alone.
You should see her again, Andrew.
Maybe she could teach you that rare virtue.
You're in need of it, my friend, great need of it.
Good night, angus.
Hello, Miss Macgregor.
So he came to see Lori,
But putting a stop to what she was doing
Soon went out of his mind,
And he kept on coming to see her.
I've learned a great deal watching you.
If only I had the skill you have.
But you've a way of taking the fear out of these wild creatures,
Making them trust you, that I wish I had.
But I'm a witch, remember?
Aye, you must be.
You cast some kind of a spell on them.
I love them all.
When they're lost or strayed or alone in pain,
That's what they need.
I feel for them.
And you, with all your skill - do you?
I give them what I have, my knowledge of what to do.
I do my job.
Is that all it is to you?
You must have chosen to become a veterinary.
No, my-my father was one himself.
He chose it for me,
And he was a man that you didn't cross.
No, all my life,
I wanted to be a doctor,
Dreamed of it and worked for it.
You must have put a spell on me to make me tell you that.
Except for my wife,
I've never told another soul.
Only she knew.
"knew"?
Aye, she's dead now, about five years ago.
You say you believe in providence and in God's mercy,
And you wonder why I don't?
How can you not?
I loved my wife.
She did nothing but good.
She went out nursing the sick in an epidemic,
Caught the sickness herself, and died.
"the Will of God is inscrutable," they told me.
"God is love," they told me.
Which is true.
That's what she believed,
Yet the God who's supposed to be love allowed her to die.
And therefore you reject him?
Because your love died, his love has no truth?
Is that what you mean?
Ask yourself that when you've known pain.
I saw both my parents drown,
Andrew, in a storm at sea,
But my Faith didn't die with them,
And they wouldn't have wished it. I know that.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Forgive?
I'm glad you told me of yourself
And I told you.
Aye.
I'm glad, too.
I must go now.
The man's coming back gave me that feeling once again
Of there having been some other time,
Some other place...
And one night it came to a head.
It was as if something was pulling me,
Drawing me on
And on and on.
I knew the way somehow,
Although I didn't know why or where I was going.
Thomasina.
Thomasina!
Thomasina! Thomasina!
Come back!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Thomasina!
Mary!
Mary!
Thomasina!
Thomasina.
Thomasina.
No, no!
Let me go! I saw her!
I saw her! Let me go!
You were right to call me.
She's in bad shock.
Could turn to pneumonia.
I see signs of it now.
I've done all I can for the moment.
I'll be around first thing in the morning.
Thank you, Strathsay.
What should I do?
Keep taking her temperature every hour or so.
It's just over 100 now.
If it gets any higher, let me know at once.
I won't leave her. Show the doctor out, Mrs. Mack.
You better get out of those wet things. You'll catch cold.
I heard the shouting, saw the doctor arrive.
Glad you came, angus.
I'm worried sick.
If she should catch pneumonia...
Aye, that's a great battle
For a wee bairn to fight alone.
Pray for her, Andrew.
Pray for God's help and mercy.
Pray.
Yes, pray, because if ever there was a man
In need of mercy, it is you.
You know I'm not a one for praying,
For goin' down on my knees.
Well, pray on your feet, man.
It's what's in your heart and mind that matters,
Not whether you kneel or not,
Though that would be good for your soul.
It's this stubborn pride of yours
That has made you live inside yourself so long.
I've forgotten how to pray.
I can't do it.
I can't feel the need for it.
Humble yourself, Andrew.
Humble yourself.
If you love the child,
Pray for her.
Oh, Thomasina, where have you been?
I didn't know.
From the present back into the past,
To the present again,
Where I was safe,
Protected,
And loved.
Where are you boys going?
Further up the Glen, granny. Well, you're not to.
They say in the village there's a witch up here.
She'll put the evil eye on you.
make way!
yah!
Hah! Hah!
Right, you devil.
You'll pay for this.
Come on!
What's he gonna do to the horse?
Let's go and see.
Aye.
Darvas, put the bear to his paces
And wake him up.
come on, get out.
Get out. Go on. Go!
all right, get him out.
Get him out!
Down you come.
Down!
Come on.
Now this way. Up.
Up now.
Come on, up and dance.
Come on, up! Up!
Up and dance.
Come on, you blackguard.
Get up and dance now!
This one's worse than the other.
The bear can hardly walk, let alone dance.
What are you doing under there? Get 'em!
Come on, boys, get 'em!
One gettin' away.
The other one's...
Got him down.
All right!
Let him go!
Come back here, you.
Get back to work!
Mr. Macquarrie, sir, there's some gypsies in the Glen,
And you've got to do something about them.
They're beating horses, and there's half-starved dogs
And a poor bear with a sore foot. It's true!
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
One at a time. Now.
We were up there watching them.
They're beating their animals.
Oh, they're awful people, sir.
You've got to arrest them,
Mr. Macquarrie.
I've already told them to leave the district and move on.
I gave them until tomorrow while they rest their horses.
rest them? You should see what they're doing.
You bring me a complaint from the proper person, and I'll act on it.
I don't take orders from a lot of children.
What proper person?
The county officer concerned
With cruelty to beasts -
Mr. Macdhui.
Mr. Macdhui?
Uh-oh, what's this?
How's Mary, please, sir?
We're sorry that she's sick.
Aye, she's very sick.
We hope she'll get better soon.
We Haven't seen much of her sin...
Since the funeral of Thomasina.
But we really came to see you about another matter, sir.
what's that?
To report cruelty to animals.
There's some gypsies up in the Glen
With performing animals.
They're awful cruel.
They've got a bear with a sore foot,
And they make him dance!
Constable Macquarrie said that if you were to examine them
And report them to him, he could put a stop to it, sir.
But I thought that my opinion as an animal doctor
Was no good.
Somebody called Hughie Stirling has been saying so.
Would he be a friend of yours?
He's no friend of mine, sir.
Hughie Stirling's a bit of a fool, sir.
Everybody knows that.
would you do something about the circus animals?
Aye, I, uh,
I Will when I can.
Well, uh, run along now, all of you.
He won't do anything.
He wasn't even listening.
Yes, he was.
He said he'd go when he can.
He doesn't care about those animals.
Well, we can't do any more, can we?
Yes, we can. We've got to. Hey, Geordie.
We could tell the witch about it - Lori.
The witch?
Aye, why not?
You say you're not afraid of her.
You could tell her.
Me?
She'd maybe put a spell on those gypsies,
Turn that big one into a horse or a bear and learn for himself
What it's like to be badly treated.
I bet she'd do it.
Go and tell her, Geordie.
Go on. I dare you.
Why, Geordie, hello there.
I came to ask you something, please.
Will you come in, then?
It's better if I do.
I brought you a present if you'd like it.
It's because you cured my frog.
Oh, Geordie, you didn't have to do that.
How is your frog?
Och, he's fine.
This is my present.
I made it myself.
What a beautiful pipe rack.
Thank you, Geordie.
It's just what I need.
I thought you might.
I was - we were wondering
If you'd do something else with magic.
Another frog?
Och, no.
There's a gypsy circus down in the Glen
With all kinds of animals and a bear,
And the people are awful cruel to them,
Beating them and that, and they're half starved.
Have you told the police?
Aye, and Mr. Macdhui,
But they won't do anything about it.
Mr. Macdhui won't?
No, we asked him, and he said so.
We thought maybe you could put some magic
On the gypsies to stop them.
Would you, please?
The bear's got an awful sore foot.
I'll go and see what I can do, anyway, I promise you that.
I knew you would.
Oh, thank you.
I have to go now.
She's going to do it!
She's going to put a spell on the gypsies!
You cannot stay in here all day and night
Torturing yourself, man.
You've had no rest, no food.
Rest? What rest can I have?
Strathsay says she's no longer fighting.
It's as if she's lost the Will to live.
Where is Strathsay?
He said he'd be back by now.
He said the fever must run its course.
There's no crisis yet.
He's done what he can for Mary.
We're all of us praying for her.
Praying?
I humbled myself and prayed, too.
I'd crawl on my hands and knees if begging for her life would save it.
She's lost and hurt, angus.
I can make no contact with her.
I wonder...
Perhaps someone who has the gift
For hurt and lost creatures
Could unlock the child's mind.
You mean Lori Macgregor?
I do.
Then ask her.
Bring her here.
She's unlocked your mind enough to make you realize
You're not sufficient yourself.
Stay here with the child, Angus.
Lori?
Lori!
So one night the man came again...
Lori!
...But this time he looked helpless
And lost
And frightened.
music playing)
Now let's get the bear out.
We'll have him on next.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing in there?
She's the witch the women speak of.
Come on out, you!
If you're in charge here, you should be ashamed.
Your dogs are sick, these horses past work.
The bear is... You're breaking my heart.
All right, then, you dance, witch.
you do the bear's act for him.
Come on.
it's the witch.
no! Aah!
Let -
Let me go!
Let me go!
Andrew!
you dance for the bear.
Look at him!
Look at Mr. Macdhui!
Who's in charge here?
I am. King Targu.
What right have you to knock about my people?
What exactly were you doing?
Driving out the witch who set the evil eye upon us.
Evil eye? I've heard about the evil you do with these wretched beasts.
What do you want here?
I have the power to close down your show for cruelty to animals.
That's what I'm going to do.
You'll pay for this.
Get him, and the witch!
Behind your back,
Mr. Macdhui!
I'm not standing for this. Come on!
Get the boys out of here.
Keep clear of this.
ooh.
Form a water chain! Quick!
Lori, get those children out of here. Quick!
Macquarrie, take that man in charge for cruelty to animals.
Here, give a hand here!
Try to hold still.
The bleeding has stopped, but it's an awful deep cut you have there.
Lori, Will you listen to me?
I've told you I'll not till
I finish dressing this wound.
You should have gone down to
Inveranoch with the others,
To a doctor, and not come up here to me.
Stop! Listen to me, m...
I am listening, Andrew.
I'm a wee bit scared not to when you're so fierce.
I was afraid of you down there in the fightin',
And afraid for you.
I came up here looking for you,
Just like the other strays and the lost that come to you.
Why?
My daughter is sick with pneumonia,
And I need your help.
I want you to come to her with me.
To your house?
Please come.
Why me?
Well, you have a
- a kind of a magic for the hurt and the sick.
I've hurt the child so much that her sickness is the worse for it.
You have? How?
Well, she had a pet that she loved more than anything.
I had to have it destroyed.
I didn't realize how much it meant to the child,
But in-in doing what I did, I...
I betrayed her trust in me.
I killed something in her.
Lori, you prayed yourself once, didn't you?
And you said that my coming here
Could be the answer to the prayer. Aye, it was.
Well, I prayed, too, and your coming with me now could be the answer to that...
For me, for Mary.
Will you come, please?
So... He brought you.
What have you been doing, man,
To get in that state - brawling somewhere?
How is she?
The same.
What is this?
Mary?
Mary Macdhui.
Do you hear me?
Andrew, may I take her?
Do what you Will.
What does this woman think she's doing? Let her be.
Andrew, there's so little of her left.
When the man took Lori away and they left me alone,
I was frightened.
I had to be with somebody.
The feeling grew stronger
And stronger.
Suddenly, like the lightning flash that split the tree,
Everything -
My other lost life - came back to me.
I knew where I belonged.
I had to go home.
Home.
Home.
Home!
Thomasina!
Can't be.
It's my Thomasina.
Yours?
I found her sick and nursed her.
Is she hers?
Is that the pet?
Thomasina! Thomasina!
Lori, call her!
Make her come in.
No, you must.
She must come to you.
Thomasina.
Don't you see that if Thomasina
Is the love your child has lost,
Only you can give it back to her.
Call her. Make her come.
Thomasina.
Come to me.
For the love of God, come to me.
I knew him now...
Macdhui, my murderer...
And he needed me.
Without me, he was lost.
So this was my Chance,
The moment of truth for both of us.
Thomasina.
Come to me.
Yet, because of my second life with Lori...
Thomasina...
...Because of what
I'd learned from her,
I didn't want revenge.
I wanted to come home.
Mary.
Mary...
I brought Thomasina to you.
She's come back to life again.
No, it's not a ghost,
Not a dream.
It's Thomasina.
She's come back.
It's Thomasina.
She's alive again.
Aye.
She's alive again.
And you're alive again, too.
I'm alive again, too.
So, my third life began,
With all of us together.
Not now.
goodbye!
And, to coin a phrase,
We all lived happily ever after.
{{{the end}}}
I suppose it was the loneliness... and being far away from anyplace... that made me decide to buy the house.
And after I did, I told myself
I'll never go through with the plan... even though I'd made all the preparations... and knew where she was every minute of the day.
Bye.
It looks just like him.
See?
See you. Bye.
- Miranda, Miranda, stop.
- Have a jug.
Just one. Just one jug.
Psst!
Freddie, come over here.
Freddie!
Come over here quick.
Come on, Freddie.
Get a move on.
Aunt Annie, what are you doing here?
- This came for you in the post.
- I told you never to come to the bank.
Read it, Freddie.
Read it!
He won the football pools!
He's won 71,000 pounds on the pools!
Open the door, please!
Is there anyone there?
Please let me out!
Let me out, please!
I hope you slept well.
I brought you some cereal.
You'll have to tell me what you like.
I'll get anything you want.
Where is this? Who are you?
I had to take the nail file and the scissors out of your bag.
Why have you brought me here?
This is your room.
- Get out of the way!
- Please... don't oblige me to use force again.
I demand to be released at once!
It's no good shouting.
You can't be heard.
And anyway, there's never anyone to hear.
I don't know who you think I am.
If you think I'm someone's rich daughter and you're gonna get a huge ransom... you got a shock coming.
I know who you are.
You're Miranda Grey.
Your father's Dr. James Grey of Reading.
And I know he's not rich.
I know a lot about you, more than you think.
How do you know that?
Look, what am I doing here?
I hope the clothes fit.
I didn't know your size exactly.
But I've seen you wear those colors.
You looked very nice in them.
Wait! No, wait! Don't go!
Wait! Come back!
Please come back!
Please open the door!
Don't leave me, please!
Open the do...
Please!
Do you mind telling me... where we are... and who you are?
You've gone to a lot of trouble.
All those clothes in there, all those art books.
I'm your prisoner, but you want me to be a happy prisoner.
Why?
Since you know my father isn't a rich man, it isn't for ransom, as you say.
The only other thing is sex.
It's not that at all.
I shall have all the proper respect.
Then why am I here?
I want you to be my guest.
Your guest?
I don't want to be your guest!
Let me go!
I love you.
Funny thing is...
I told myself a dozen times...
I wasn't going to tell you.
I was going to let it come natural on both sides.
But I touched you just then.
It came out.
You see... at home in Reading... we used to travel on the same bus together.
I even sat next to you once or twice.
I used to watch you all the time.
And then, when you got the scholarship... and went to London...
I thought I'd forget you.
From the first time
I saw you, I...
I think I knew you were the only one.
I don't understand all this.
I don't understand why you brought me here.
I want you to get to know me.
But you don't kidnap people so they'll get to know you.
Don't you realize the trouble that you could get into?
I don't care.
It must be in the papers.
I haven't looked.
You could go to prison for years.
But it'd be worth it... be worth going for life.
If you won't think of yourself, think of me.
And my parents.
Think how frightened they must be.
- I'm sorry.
- And my school.
I can't stay away from school.
I worked very hard for that scholarship.
I can't afford to lose it.
You want to go back to that chap.
What chap?
The la-di-da one in the pub.
You love him, don't you?
Oh, God!
This is like a lunatic asylum.
Look, people must be searching for me.
All of England must be searching for me.
Sooner or later, they're going to find me.
Never.
Because, you see... they're looking for you, all right... but... nobody's looking for me.
Wait, wait, wait!
Look, I'll make a promise.
Let me go now.
I won't tell anyone.
We could be friends.
I could help you.
Look, if you let me go now,
I shall begin to admire you.
I'll think, he had me at his mercy, but he was chivalrous.
He behaved like a real gentleman.
I'll make up some story.
Nobody will know about this except us.
No, I can't let you go.
Help! Help me!
Help me, somebody!
Help! Help, help, help!
Please help me!
How long are you gonna keep me here?
I don't know.
It depends.
On what?
On my falling in love with you?
Because if that's what you want,
I'm going to be here until I die!
Now, go away.
Go away!
Think it over.
What happened?
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I thought I'd die last night with the pain.
I told you this would happen.
I told you you'd get sick.
- I told you you should have eaten.
- It's not that.
It feels like my appendix.
You must get me a doctor.
Look, take me to the hospital.
- It'll be safer for you.
- It'll be the end for me.
There's a phone box down the lane.
All right.
I'll make a bargain.
I'll tell you when you can go... but only on certain conditions.
You have to start eating... and talk to me... and don't try to escape like that.
You still haven't said when you'll let me go.
- Six weeks.
- Six weeks?
You must be mad.
- Five weeks, then?
- No, never!
I was only trying to be nice.
Wait, wait.
Five weeks?
I'll stay for one week and not a day more.
No, I couldn't agree to that.
Please be reasonable.
Can't you see I haven't made all these arrangements... just so you'd stay for one week more?
It's not enough time.
Time for what?
I told you. To get to know me.
I know you.
I hate you. I hate you.
- I'll give you my word.
- To what?
When the time's up, you can go as soon as you like.
- Two weeks.
- Four weeks.
A month.
That'll be the 14th.
Don't you see that four months, four years, won't get what you want?
How can you be so sure?
Because I know how I feel!
You may not feel the same after four weeks.
Four weeks will be the 11 th, not the 14th.
It's agreed?
On the 11 th, I leave?
Well, I've got some conditions too.
I must write a letter to my parents.
And this room... I can't breathe.
I need some fresh air and light.
I want a bath.
I want some drawing materials, and I need things from the chemist.
And I want fresh fruit and salad.
Fresh fruit... and salad.
Now, you promised to eat.
It's all right. It's agreed.
Really.
Bon "appetite".
Four weeks.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
Twenty-eight.
- Amuse me. Do something.
- What?
Anything. Sing, dance.
I can't.
- Tell me about your family.
- Nothing to tell.
- Know any funny stories?
- No.
You must.
I thought all men had to know dirty jokes.
If I knew one,
I wouldn't tell it to you.
Why not?
I respect you too much.
Then I'll tell you one.
Because I know one that's filthy.
What's got four ears... and eight legs?
What?
Two dogs.
I did fix something up.
The bath, I mean.
Would you like to have one now?
Oh, yes! Yes, please!
You have to give me your word you won't try to escape.
I promise!
You're not going to tie me up?
- I have to.
- But I promised.
How am I supposed to have a bath like this?
Oh, no. No, don't.
I won't scream.
Marvelous!
Couldn't we just walk for a little bit?
Oh, it's been so long.
Please.
All right.
You're hurting my arm.
Help...
What happened just then...
Won't happen again.
But if it does... if it does happen again and worse...
- I want you to promise me something.
- It won't happen again.
Not to do it in a mean way.
I mean, don't knock me unconscious... or chloroform me again or anything.
I shan't struggle.
I'll let you do as you like.
I forgot myself.
I...
I can't explain.
The only thing is, if it ever does happen...
I'll never respect you... and I'll never, never speak to you again.
Do you understand?
I wouldn't expect anything else.
There's a clean dress.
Take as long as you want.
Don't worry.
I'll respect your every privacy.
I'm afraid I had to take the blade out of the razor.
He seemed old to me.
The chap I saw you with.
You know, the painter.
He seemed old.
Have you known him long?
That day in the pub, you seemed unhappy.
Did you have a quarrel?
You looked like lovers to me.
We're not lovers. We're friends.
Will you let me have my bath, please?
I'm sorry.
I'm ever so sorry.
I won't speak again.
Help!
Hello!
Anybody there?
What do you want?
- Are you Franklin?
- Yes.
I want to see you for a moment.
What have you been doing with those cellars?
- What?
- You put a light in there, didn't you?
- Yes.
- What else?
Just some tools and things.
They'll be on your neck for that.
The Ancient Monuments people.
Oh, damn it.
I haven't even introduced myself.
I'm Colonel Whitcomb, your neighbor.
I saw your lights on and thought it was about time that we got acquainted.
Those cellars are quite famous, you know.
The inner one was used as a secret Roman
Catholic chapel during the persecution.
- Didn't you know that?
- No.
Well, must be very lonely for a young man here.
At least I have my horses and my dogs.
Oh, and, of course, my wife.
I don't mind being alone.
Anytime you feel the need of a spot of company, don't be afraid to come over.
You know where we are... just half a mile down the road.
You can't miss it.
It's the only other house on the lane.
By the way, we're having some friends over for drinks tomorrow night.
Why don't you join us?
Well, I don't know if I can make it.
You did say you lived alone?
I have a guest. My cousin.
Bring him along.
Actually, I was planning to drive him to London.
I'll be gone all day, but if I get back in time...
I'll perhaps come over.
Well, fine.
By the way, did they ever tell you about this thing?
It's a priest hole.
A priest could hide in here when he was on the run.
There's a story that some of Cromwell's men trapped a poor devil in here... and fired right through the wall, killed him.
My wife knows more about this place than I do.
She's well up on all the local legends.
You must get her to come over one day and tell you all about them.
Yes, I will.
Nice to have met you, Franklin.
Good Lord!
Look at the water!
It's really my girlfriend.
Are you all right?
I'm coming in.
You should have called me.
It's all right.
I fixed it now.
Don't be upset.
I should have told you about these old baths.
Of course there's no damage.
It doesn't matter.
The handle came off the tap.
I got it back on, though.
Why didn't she call out?
She was embarrassed.
You know how it is.
Well, I remember how it was.
If you can't make it tomorrow evening...
I'll understand.
Please tie them in front this time.
They hurt the other way.
There's something
I want to show you.
In there.
I wouldn't be a good prisoner if I didn't try to escape.
It's my hobby.
I've been collecting all my life.
I'm an entomologist.
I won a hobby prize for this setting.
And most of these come from Central America.
I correspond with a monk who sends me larvae, and... and then I incubate them myself.
You see that?
This is a leaf butterfy.
Looks just like two leaves.
These are my chalkhills.
And... these are my Adonis blues.
I bred that aberration myself.
And it's better than any they've got in the Natural History Museum.
These are my fritillaries.
That's the silver-washed and that's the medium brown... beckerwood, red admiral, swallowtail, peacock.
They're beautiful... but sad.
How many butterfies have you killed?
You can see.
Think of all the living beauty you've ended.
That's silly.
What difference does a few specimens make to a whole species?
- Be careful. It's very rare.
- Let it go.
You're joking.
Don't do that!
I may never get another one.
And now you've collected me, haven't you?
Don't you see what's happened?
You've had this... this dream with me in the center of it.
It's not love. It's the sort of dream young boys have... when they reach puberty, only you've made it come true.
I'll tell you something.
There'd be a lot more of this if more people had the time and the money.
- We all want things we can't have.
- We all take what we can get.
I never had your advantages.
My father wasn't a la-di-da doctor.
I never went to a posh school.
I was just a clerk in a bank.
Reading.
Of course!
You won a fortune on the pools.
You had your picture in the paper.
I remember now!
You could do so much.
You could travel, learn, meet people.
You could have a wonderful life.
But... this is death, don't you see?
Nothing but death.
These are dead.
I'm dead.
Everything here is dead.
Is that what you love?
Death?
It's very good.
Would you consider selling it?
I hadn't.
But I will.
Two hundred pounds.
All right.
You'd give me 200 pounds for this?
But it's bad.
It's because it's of you.
Put it in a drawer with the butterfies.
I know why you're upset.
It's that letter to your mother, isn't it?
I'm going to London this afternoon.
I could post it then.
I bought these in Woolworths.
Nobody will ever be able to trace them.
Thank you.
I'll dictate it.
Dear Mother...
I'm safe and not in danger.
Do not try to find me.
It is impossible.
I'm being well looked after by a friend.
That's all.
Just sign your name.
May I say Mr. Franklin sends his regards?
Very funny.
I'll address the envelope.
If you really want one of my drawings, why don't you go and choose one?
I like this one.
It's yours, for nothing.
Would you sign it?
Oh, yes.
Prisoner... number 1436.
"Kidnapped by madman Gerald Franklin.
Pools winner.
Prisoner in cellar.
Old Tudor house, near Reading.
So far, safe.
Frightened".
Frightened?
What have I done?
And mad?
Think a madman would have gone to all this trouble?
I'll tell you what a madman would have done.
He'd have killed you by now.
I suppose you think I'm going for you with a carving knife or something.
Don't look like that.
I was frightened. You can understand.
I'm a prisoner and it frightens me.
All that you live for is the day you'll see the last of me.
I'm a nobody still, aren't I?
But I just want to see the last of this house, not of you.
Take me out. We can go together.
You could come with me.
I won't tell anyone.
We'll get you a fat near mine.
I'll see you every day.
I'll introduce you to all my friends.
You could start a new life.
Your friends would look down on me like you do.
- I don't look down on you.
- What about the other night?
You didn't even try to understand about my collection.
I'm sorry about that.
I've seen you with your friends.
I know what they're like.
You'd be ashamed of me in front of them.
- Oh, no, that's not true.
- Then why don't you talk to me?
You never talk to me, not really.
So why should anyone else of your kind?
People like you... you just have to walk into a room.
You can talk to anyone.
You understand things.
It's different for people like me.
Now, that book you asked me to buy for you, The Catcher in the Rye.
Is that a good book?
Do you like it?
Oh, yes, it's a beautiful book!
I've read it three times.
Could I understand it?
Could I talk to your friends about it?
Oh, of course you could!
I'll read it.
The note wouldn't have done you any good.
My name's not really Franklin, and we're nowhere near Reading.
I put all the clothes back.
And the pictures, well, you can have all of them.
You... know today is the last day?
I know.
At 12:00 tonight.
- I read your book.
- Oh?
Did you like it?
Well, I don't see much point in it, really.
Why not?
I don't believe it, for one thing.
That boy... going to a posh school and... his parents having money.
He's got no real problem in my opinion.
Perhaps you're right.
So what right does he have... to behave the way he does?
Well, I never looked at it like that.
You mean, you never saw the faults in the book before?
No, but it's an interesting point of view.
Don't patronize me!
I'm not, really...
You've read that book three times.
You told me you loved it.
I do, but that doesn't mean...
You would never have agreed with anybody else so fast.
You would have argued, wouldn't you?
You see, you won't really talk to me.
That's not true.
All right.
You tell me what you think is so marvelous about that book.
Well... Well, the boy.
The way he hates everything that's false. He's so aware.
See?
He sounds a mess to me.
But as a human being, for all his faults...
I mean, you felt sorry for him, didn't you?
I don't like the way he talks.
- Oh, but that's part of his charm.
- And the way he behaves.
Always talking about people squeezing pimples. You think that's charming?
He behaves that way because he doesn't fit anywhere.
I don't wonder, the way he carries on.
- He didn't try to fit.
- You don't understand.
No?
Well, I mean... you're not trying to see how much like... like all of us he is.
Like me. That's what you meant, isn't it?
- I don't fit anywhere either.
- No, I didn't mean that.
- Then I'm too dumb to understand him?
- No, I didn't say that either!
No, but that's what you meant.
You're twisting my words.
Am I?
That's a good painting, isn't it?
Yes, it's a Picasso.
People don't look like that.
Well, of course they don't.
He's not trying to draw a face as it is.
He's trying to express a face as he sees it and feels it.
- Him seeing it that way makes it good?
- But it's not a photograph.
- What's wrong with photographs?
- Nothing wrong with photographs.
- Photographs don't lie!
- Neither does this.
It's a face from all different angles.
It's a character behind the face.
It's just a joke, that's all it is.
It's just a bad joke.
- Because you can't grasp it right away...
- Well, how do I grasp it?
I'll tell you something about this.
It doesn't mean anything!
Not just to me.
To anybody else.
You just say it does because some professor somewhere told you it did!
It makes you so superior, you and all your friends.
I don't think one-in-a-million, decent, ordinary people... would say this was any good.
It's rubbish!
Rubbish, that's all it is!
And the book, too, that's just as bad.
It's filthy!
Oh, you're so blooming clever, aren't you?
You and all your friends.
I can just see me with the lot of you.
I'd be a right laugh, wouldn't I?
Well, you're not gonna get me in that position.
Not... Not you, not anybody, ever!
Please!
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, really.
Really, I'm sorry.
You see...
I was right to bring you here.
We could never be friends outside.
But we can.
But we can!
We can! Oh, my God!
Oh, God, what have I done?
What have I done?
Oh, let me be free.
Please, please, let me be free.
I bought you something... for tonight.
Your last night...
I made some supper upstairs.
The dress is... is lovely.
Oh, no.
That's all over.
Why, it's lovely.
I bought some champagne and... caviar.
You thought of everything.
Well, I wanted to do it proper tonight.
To us.
We've come through, haven't we?
You know, you don't have to drive me all the way home.
You could drop me off at a station.
No, I don't think
I could do that.
If you're still worried about me telling anyone, you needn't be.
I know.
I just thought it would be safer for you.
No, I'll take you all the way home.
All right.
I suppose the first thing you'll do when you get back is see that chap.
The first thing I'm going to do is call my mother.
Thank you.
She'll be so relieved.
You will be seeing him, though.
Oh, no, no.
I don't see him all that... often.
It'll be lonely here without you.
I do want you to come to London, really.
It'll be so much better for you.
Can we eat now?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I'm hungry.
Thank you.
This is how I hoped it always would be.
You and me up here, talking, having a nice time.
You're not drinking.
You said you were hungry.
Oh, I am.
Marry me.
Please marry me.
I don't expect anything.
I don't expect you to do anything you don't want.
You can do what you like... study art.
I won't ask anything... anything of you... except you live in the same house and be my wife in name.
You can have your own bedroom.
You can lock it every night.
But that's horrible.
Why?
I couldn't marry a man I... don't belong to... in every way.
I belong to you.
I just want you here.
I want to be able to see you.
Say you'll marry me.
Please?
Say yes.
I'll marry you.
I'll marry you as soon as you like.
That's what you want, isn't it?
We'll stay here.
We'll marry and live here.
We'll start afresh and get to know each other... right from the beginning again.
We don't have to see any of my friends ever.
Don't you think I know you need witnesses to get married?
But you said you'd let me go.
You can't go back on your word.
I can do what I like.
Help!
Help!
Help!
I brought you some orange juice.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know I said I'd never use force unless obliged.
But you'll admit you did oblige me by what you did.
Anyway, I want you to know that... while you were asleep,
I didn't take advantage of you.
I brought you straight down here.
I showed every respect.
Wait.
I've stayed the four weeks.
I just have to have you here a little longer.
Why?
What more can I do?
What more can you want?
You know what I want.
It's what I've always wanted.
You could fall in love with me if you tried.
I've done everything I could to make it easy.
You just won't try.
Must I go straight back to the cellar?
Couldn't we sit downstairs for a bit?
All right.
Is there anything to drink?
There's sherry.
Could I have another one?
Thank you.
Why don't you sit down?
I'm sorry about our dreadful fight.
I'd like us to try and be friends again.
I'd like that too.
Put your arms around me.
Am I too heavy?
Kiss me.
Not like that.
Untie my hands.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
Come back then.
Put the light out.
Let's... just have the fire.
It's not right.
You're just pretending.
Why don't you come and see?
Look at me.
Would I be doing this if I were only pretending?
Help me.
What is it?
You think if we make love
I'll have to let you go.
Is that what you think?
Well, I'm not going to!
I thought you wanted me.
I just wanted to please you.
I can buy what you're talking about in London anytime I like.
Get dressed!
I used to respect you, but you're no better than the common street woman.
You'd do any disgusting thing to get what you want.
I'm never getting out of here alive... am I?
Help! Help!
Oh, don't die.
Oh, please don't die!
Please don't die!
Are you there?
Oh, please answer me.
Please!
Are you there?
Oh, God.
I've killed him.
I've killed him.
Oh, I'm so glad.
It's been so long.
Three... Three days.
Oh, please don't go!
I was afraid...
I was so afraid that I...
I hurt you badly.
Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me.
It's been so cold.
Don't leave me alone!
Please, don't leave me alone again.
Help me.
Please.
Please help me.
I still love you, Miranda.
I'm so afraid.
Will you... tell anyone?
- Tell anyone?
- About me.
Will you... tell anyone?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I don't want... to die.
So much to do... be.
There's a painting
I want to do... a butter-yellow field... white luminous sky... the sun just rising.
So still.
I'll get a doctor.
The doctor's coming.
You'll be all right.
He gave me some pills.
He'll be here in a little while.
You'll be better tomorrow.
You'll see.
I sat there all the rest of the afternoon remembering... and all sorts of nice things came back.
I remembered the beginning... the times in Reading just seeing her get on the bus.
I thought how happy I'd been... feelings I've had these weeks she was here... feelings I never had before and would never have again.
And now suddenly she was dead.
And dead means gone forever.
Forever.
She's in the box I made under the tall oak.
For days after she was dead
I kept thinking... perhaps it was my fault, after all, that she did what she did... and lost my respect.
Then I thought, no.
It was her fault.
She asked for everything she got.
My only mistake was aiming too high.
I ought to have seen I'd never get what
I wanted from someone like Miranda... with all her la-di-da ideas and clever tricks.
I ought to have got someone who would respect me more.
Someone ordinary.
Someone I could teach.
Bon soir, Ann-Marie
- How's it going
- bon soir
Some turnout this evening, eh?
...you know, really...
...no, listen, it's true. I tell you,
I've met you before, you must believe me...
...not at all...
...it'd be a pleasure...
Alan, it's for you...
Sandra, you're an angel!
Sandra! You grow more ravishing...
Don't be silly...
Would you like a drink?
...thank you...
...nothing - fortunately I have a good character...
...because otherwise you'd be bored, now...
...ah, Andrew!...
You're leaving tomorrow?
Yes, tomorrow
Darling, something wrong?
It's the music
Shall we go closer?
- Thank you
- Good luck, Sandra, dear
- Good luck in America
- Bon voyage
Good night
Good night, Sandra, bon voyage
- Good evening, thank you very much
- Thank you, good night
Bon voyage, Andrew
Have a nice trip. Good night
I'm dead... absolutely dead!
So am I
And we have to get away early in the morning
Everyone seemed to enjoy the party
So it seemed... what a mob
- You liked it?
- Yes
Want a scotch?
- A sip - Have some of mine
Thank you
Good night
Thanks for everything
Let's get some sleep
Fosca - hang on a minute
Do you think we'll be there in a half hour?
Maybe less
Good. Fosca, we'll be there within the half hour
Yes
I hope you'll recognize me
Yes
I'll see to them when we get there
She says there are two telegrams
From your brother?
No. He phoned from London.
They're from Florence
Father's side of the family
Thanks, goodbye
So you'll meet only our old maid, and relatives even I don't know
See the terraces?
We've arrived!
Here is the San Francesco Gate
The sea is down there
Look!
The old Etruscan wall
We're here, Fosca!
I'm coming
You look fine, Fosca.
All in order?
The house yes, but the garden...
I'll see later
This is my husband,
Andrew Dawdson
- Good evening
- Good evening
- So you're Fosca
- Yes, sir
No, thank you, it's not necessary, I can...
This way, please
Pleasant trip?
The best, thank you
Signora...
Was I right to prepare the guest room?
Magnificent!
Excuse me, would you give these to the Signora?
Certainly
But first I must bring up the bags
May I help you?
No, I'll bring up only what we need for the next few days
You're leaving so soon?
In a couple of days
Signorino Gianni comes and goes...
...like the wind too
He comes to Volterra?
Of course
Not as with Signora Sandra.
We see him often, particularly of late
Last year he was even here for Easter
Don't be stupid
He was in London last Easter
Couldn't come to our wedding. Remember?
It's true
Yes, I even spoke to him on the phone
But I know he was here for Easter
Came on Good Friday and stayed a month
He was here when they took madame to Palagione
Before that too?
Both before and after
He comes often
Didn't you know?
No, I had no idea
I've never been informed
Sandra, this house is a marvel, a jewel.
I didn't expect...
It is like a museum
But excuse me, I'm forgetting
I must bring up our bags
I'll see to it at once
And what about Signor Gilardini?
He sent you those flowers, didn't you see?
He didn't want to upset you on arrival
He'll tell you about madame tomorrow
I've visited her several times at the clinic
But not at the villa
He says the doctors object
They treat her well.
Private nurse
Fornari's son, who is now Dr. Zanutti's assistant...
...visits her almost every day
But he thinks she was better off at the clinic
All that isolation
You can go now, Fosca
I've prepared the drawing room, signora
Would you like me to sleep in?
What if those from Florence...?
No. No one is coming from Florence
Sandra! Look here!
Look! Come now, smile.
Stop teasing me, please
Come and sit down
Much better
You'll laugh, Sandra
I got lost on my way back
This is the strangest house
Like you in a way
No, no, don't say that!
All right
I'm not sure it's a compliment
I meant it to be
Then let's stay here...
... forever and ever
Well... I... I...
See, you're worried
Poor Andrew
A compliment, you say?
Are you sure?
What do you mean?
Don't evade. It's better to keep silent
Anyway I made you laugh
Forgive my moodiness
It's those telegrams
I don't understand...
But why speak of it?
Let's take a look at the garden
It's pitch black out there
There are lights we can switch on
I'll get a wrap
As you wish
Not that way, that wing's been closed off for years
Mother's apartment -- closed ever since she was taken ill
I understand
I'd like you...
...to go there with me tomorrow
Of course
Come now
Sandra, I thought
I saw someone
Sorry to disappoint you, but we haven't any ghosts
"From a Nazi rage, he was torn away, to the studies of life, and his loved ones"
Sandra...
Gianni!
Gianni! What are you doing here?
Does Forsca know?
Forsca's always been my accomplice
They're not coming
Who?
Father's relatives
They wired from Florence
They're senile and can't travel
No, they want nothing to do with us
Mother's fault.
Can you blame them?
I'm Sandra's brother,
Gianni
I thought so.
Pleased you could make it
You see, he came
Is this the bust to be dedicated?
I must get a closer look at the inscription
I must go in the house and change
Gianni...
I've come to do my duty, then I'm leaving this house
I understand you
You'd better learn some things about me
What are these papers?
Forsca told you that
I come here often?
Yes, that was a great surprise to me
Your husband will feel we desert him
What's his name, by the way?
Andrew? Here!
He's a nice chap
I was telling Sandra...
Isn't that a snap judgment on your part?
First impressions are what count with me
Is Sandra a good wife?
She used to be disorganised, lazy
That's Sandra - a disorganised lazybones
I thought marriage might change her
Hope she gave you fair warning
She told me all
Stop it, Gianni!
What are all these papers?
Receipts for what I've sold
I often need money
I can't live on the pittance
Gilardini doles out
Hasn't Sandra told you?
I've chosen a difficult calling
She said you have many interests
Meaning none. True, I used to be like that
Then I started writing for certain papers
Oh, trivial society stuff - not serious
But I made a discovery -
I love to write
So I started a novel
My editor likes it...
Really?
Story of my adolescence
Are you serious?
See, she never had any faith in her brother
Wait till I'm rich and famous
But unfortunately that day's far off
So, when I'm broke...
...I come back here
Haven't you noticed?
Silver missing, fewer pictures
All this belongs to
Sandra and me, you know
I admit I have no right, but I owe a lot
I'll pay you back, Sandra.
With interest
I think you did right
Does Gilardini know about this?
Of course. He thinks you do too
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Didn't want to worry you
Tell me why I should live like a pauper run down to mother's place every time I need money?
We must decide, Sandra
Tomorrow our garden becomes a park dedicated to father's memory
So at least someone will enjoy it
But what about the house?
Is it to crumble away?
We can't afford another such gift
Let's sell the furnishings and rent if selling upsets you
Have you a serious proposal?
Just that... I want your consent
Sandra, wait, Sandra...
You're angry
If I've done anything to annoy you, please forgive me
I don't like you undressing in front of me
Very well
Quite correct, Sandra
I beg your pardon... excuse me one moment
Aren't you going to offer a drink?
There's nothing in the house
That's like Forsca.
Never thinks of it
We'll go for supplies and drop in at the bar
Been there?
I've not been anywhere
She wants to keep you shut up.
But you rebel, don't you?
How stupid you talk,
Gianni
Get out, both of you
I want to stay here and get some rest
Then we'll all stay
No, please go and I'll go to bed
You can't do that
We've a thousand things to talk over, and you want to sleep!
The thousand things will keep till morning, when I'm rested, calm
Please order wine when you're out
And try to come in quietly
I might wake you
No, you won't disturb me
I'll sleep in my old bed
I don't like the guest room
Over the centuries, landslides have been burying this ancient town
All attempts to prevent them have proved futile
Over there stands
San Giusto
Volterra is the only town I know condemned to die of disease... like most human beings
No! Be careful
Slides occur even down here
This is Camaldoli Abbey
The monks had to leave for fear of being buried alive
Here's the church of San Giusto --
16th Century at its best
I'm sorry.
The town is beautiful but I'm absentminded.
Do you know I'm very much in love with your sister?
Glad to hear it
She has spoken of you and the family
For me, however, Sandra was born when we met in Geneva
She had a job as interpreter where I worked
Was she good?
She showed great courage during our investigation of Auschwitz
Particularly with survivors who had been imprisoned with your father
Before we started the inquiry I thought
I knew everything about your sister... but during this inquiry about a man - a stranger to me and also practically to his own daughter...
I came to realize I didn't know Sandra at all
Have you been in love?
It happens
Then you too have felt this sudden curiosity... this desire to know all about a loved one
It's a curiosity that doesn't last
One loves a woman for what she is, not for what she was or will be
I used to think that too, but not now
Tell me about your sister
Her life here
Her first love or loves?
I wouldn't dream of asking that
What then?
I want to know about her life here
I'm a foreigner. Everything is so different in my country
Provincial life is the same everywhere
The same unbelievable boredom
Unbelievable when you're away, real the moment you return.
Maybe even after 100 years
Want a drink?
A beer
Good evening, sir. Welcome home
Thanks. How are you?
Not bad. Is Signora Sandra back too?
Yes, this is her husband,
Andrew Dawdson
A pleasure
Mariella, two beers, and send some whiskey to the palazza
Yes, sir
Andrew, a surprise! Your wife's first Volterra lover
Don't look yet
He's the son of our agent
For love of Sandra he studied and became a doctor
He's Dr. Zanutti's assistant
Care to meet him?
Pietro! You're looking well
Come here, please
I want you to meet Mr. Dawdson,
Sandra's husband
Good evening, pleased to meet you
Most lucky of mortals, the man who wed my sister
Where is Sandra?
Well, we're back.
This is it, isn't it?
Yes, go on in,
I'll close up
- Do you remember where the room is?
- Of course.
How glad I am that you could come
You've grown more beautiful
Thank you
Tomorrow's my father's birthday
We've been kept waiting over a half-hour.
This is too much
I won't promise anything, but
I'll speak to the major
- It seems the lady is late,
Your Honor. - This wedding?
They've been waiting since ten
Do you mind? It'll only take a few minutes
I've never know a wife to keep one waiting this long
Your Honor, my sister
- Good day
- Good day
- Do you know the notary?
- Yes I know everybody.
Here is the deed of gift.
Please read it
Senor Gilardini has consented
All is in order
I'm tired of warming the bridegroom's chair
What are you up to really?
What do you want of me?
What do you want of me
Why have you come here to humiliate me?
Four years, and you glide in here like a snake
You take advantage because I'm ill
But I'll tell Antonio you came to insult me. He'll punish you!
We can now turn to the signing of the documents
We are indebted to you above all for the gardens and adjoining land
From tomorrow, a park... dedicated to the memory of your illustrious father
In the name of our town, I express our profound thanks... for this generous gift
You're afraid
You don't want to know the truth about your father
You've got his
Jewish blood in your veins
You're corrupt just as he was you with your rottenness your secret vices
We think this is the best way to express our love for our father... this will testify to his tragic fate
Everything is in order, sir
You've seen mother?
We've finished, Your Honor
Dedication tomorrow
I warn you in advance that
I'm a poor speaker, but I'll do my best
Till tomorrow then
Good bye
I was looking for you
What do you think you are doing?
Your duty is to ask my permission for any visit
You came here to justify yourself because...
I asked him
You've been complaining about your mother's treatment...
Saying I took her from the clinic...
...not for her good...
No one says that
Oh, yes they do
I don't want any scandal, but there comes a time when one must speak plainly.
Good
Wouldn't it be better to talk this over later?
Gianni's right
We'll talk calmly another time, another place
Calmly
Not lose our temper... or we might live to regret it
Maybe they did try to explain to us... at the time
But now I know... I'm sure
They DID denounce father
When news of his death came through, mother refused to see Gilardini, and then tried to forget in the arms of other lovers
What more proof do you need?
But she married him, Gilardini
Later!... Later!...
Gilardini knew how to wait
He knew that despite her lovers... her gestures... her frantic goings and comings... she'd end by giving in to him
Yet it was only after she was ill that they married
He installed himself as head of this house
Said we needed disciplining...
Took over our education
Before it was a governess...
We were always taught at home
Now Gianni was to go to boarding school in Florence
And I to convent school
He couldn't bear our criticism
That's easily understood
Gianni wrote mother immediately saying he'd die rather than go to boarding school
He actually took some veronal... bluffing suicide...
And I... I egged him on
It's not normal for children to play such degenerate, vengeful games
But our was not a normal atmosphere
Gilardini was always taunting Gianni about that mock suicide
He still speaks of it as a scandal
Anyway, Gianni won
Mother interceded, he went to school here
We stopped speaking in
Gilardini's presence
This led to a new game...
We found great fun
We communicated by messages...
Deposited in secret places
Shall I show you?
Show me
Come
You see, in a place such as this...
Or in this Etruscan vase, for instance
Wasn't it a rather morbid game?
Morbid?
I don't think so
Where else?
Come
Sometimes we hid them here
You see?
And sometimes in mother's room in this Cupid and Psyche clock
What's that?
A note
"Most urgent!
"Your faithful slave awaits you...
"at the water tower
"Make sure you're not followed"
It can't be so urgent after all these years
All these years?
What are you thinking,
Andrew?
Nothing
Do you know who was the "faithful slave"?
It was Pietro
Our agent's son
He loved me and
Gianni protected us
We couldn't meet openly... would have caused... a scandal at home
Yes, Gianni told me
What else did he say?
That provincial life seems unreal when you're away...
But when you return, even after many years... you're thrown back into it
I don't want that to happen to you, Sandra
It's been almost 20 years
As to your mother, consider her present condition
Besides, I'm not convinced
What you told me proves nothing
Your hostility towards your step-father is only natural... a normal reaction
Sandra, darling, I want to get you away from here
You're jealous of phantoms
Yes, I'm jealous, I feel a strange force... a force that's trying to separate us... and I'm afraid
But I love you... you know I love you
Sandra...
The signora is resting
- I'm going out
- Very well, sir
Gianni? Gianni!
Gianni - where are you?
You've kept me waiting
Are you sure no one followed you?
No
But I warn you, Gianni,
Andrew found the note
Did he
Why make me come here?
To prove... something
You want to say...?
So many things!
I wanted to say them last night, but your door...
It was you!
Yes
Did you lock it to keep out your husband?
Poor chap. I thought you were happy with him
But I am happy with him.
Look, let's go back to the house, we can talk there
This is our house
It was once
It isn't any more
What do you want?
Will you lend it to me?
Just today
No! No!
You're crazy!
You're mad, mad, mad!
Give it back to me at once!
No! This evening
Reprehensible!
You're irresponsible!
Leaving me to face mother alone
Two monsters... monsters, my children...
yes, my children...
He was always hiding there, behind the door
What am I to say?
Are my children monsters?
My enemies?
Don't speak of it
I'll only hate you
Remember the first time we went down there?
The wind banged the door shut, and you were so scared...
We thought no one would let us out
You cared about me then
I still do, Sandra, I swear it
- It's in mother's room
- What is?
The novel
Read it and you'll understand everything
Don't you believe me?
You'll know why I don't want to hear of your visit to mother
Why I can't talk about it
I've freed myself from some things forever
I don't want to involve you needlessly
You seem an intelligent, decent man
Please listen to me...
I would like to ask a favor
Take from me the administration of Sandra's and Gianni's inheritance
I want nothing more to do with their affairs
I never want to see them again
I'm sorry, but...
Signor Gilardini, weren't you going to the house with a lawyer today?
You could talk to Gianni and Sandra
No! I won't set foot in that house!
What I've gone through for that family!
But for me, every cent would be gone
And what would've become of that poor lady, their mother... if I hadn't looked after her?
I'll continue to take care of her, despite limited means and without help from anyone
You must talk to Gianni and Sandra.
These misunderstandings -
Misunderstandings?
You're joking
You think I don't hear their insinuations?
Please, Mr. Gilardini...
It's the fault of their upbringing
I was wrong... wrong to give in
Sandra told me about it
- Really?
- Yes
Gianni's difficult adolescence
The fake suicide... the anxiety
Such things often happen
Not so often
I think so
That affair of
Sandra's, too
All water under the bridge now
Poor Dr. Fornari
Mr. Dawdson, more than loving Sandra, he actually worshipped her
Sandra at 16 - already a raving beauty... socially high above him
Yes, I can well understand the mother's opposition, the small town gossip
No. The real trouble that ravaged my wife's family was something quite different
What?
Can't you tell me?
Well... nothing to say?
Is what I've written so terrible?
Has anyone else seen this?
My editor
When it's published...
It won't be published
Why not?
Are you taking it personally?
Try to remember... this is fiction that I've written, fantasy
No one will believe that it's fantasy
You mean a few lazy louts from around here?
Why worry about them?
Why be ashamed of a sin we've not committed?
You're a real bourgeois, Sandra
I don't care what they say.
If they criticise what we did,
I'll shock them.
Can't you see their faces when they come to this?
"My desire grew...
I hurled myself on my sister's body...
as if to destroy mine enemy
No intimacy could satisfy..."
Good writing, eh?
Stop it! You're disgusting!
What do you want?
How much to destroy it?
How much?
This is priceless
Shall I sacrifice money and success too?
Judging by your reaction...
I'm on the threshold of a successful career
All right. How much?
Can I ask you something?
You want my book destroyed?
It would be a weapon in the hands of our enemies
Only that?
And because of this
Why have you avoided me?
You ask that when you didn't even come to my wedding?
Look, Sandra...
A strange thing happened to me then
I went into convulsions... like a romantic hero
As a child, did I...?
No one here remembers
I became frightened and ran
In all the years since we separated
I had scarcely given you a thought
A new life, the past shattered
I wanted to see, to know everything to travel... fall in love
I loved... many women... so many they have no importance
This I realized the day you wrote of your coming marriage
It all came back to me then...
Our talks... our silences... my anguishes, anxieties...
Walks on the terraces, sleepless nights
How happy I was with you...
Even in childhood before passion is known
Only you can understand me, help me
You know the fright of solitude... of returning memory...
A sound... a voice... a colour
I sought to record all these
But the child has felt passion
Has grown up... has grown beyond innocence
I can't help you
Stay with me a little longer
No, I can't
Gianni, among mother's letters
I found one of your letters... a child's letter
You were only 8 or 9
Mother was off on one of her concert tours
You wrote...
"Dear mother
"I'm glad you arrived in Vienna
"Sandra and I have done our excercises
"I haven't been able to sail the little boat
"I've been too busy in my garden"
When mother returned from Vienna she brought presents
- Remember?
- Yes
Yes
Andrew...
Andrew!
I've invited Mr. Gilardini and Dr. Fornari for dinner tonight
Try to be pleasant
Your husband is right about Gilardini
Bury the hatchet
Sandra, please be nice to them
A relief to all
Those bulbs needed changing, now it's easier to see
Sandra...
Something to drink?
This is better than neon.
The curse of neon!
Is it used much in America?
In offices, bars
In better places, candles are the rage
I understand
Did you know that light has certain clinical effects?
Red, for instance, is an aphrodisiac
No, I never heard that
Good evening, Sandra
I'm sorry I can't stay, I'm on hospital duty tonight
You must eat first
Insist, Sandra
You can't say no to Sandra
Yes, I must -- even to her
I simply can't stay
This is the end of the world.
He doesn't love you any more.
No matter
Good evening. How are you?
Good evening
Darling, what's wrong?
Nothing
It's my fault
She's cross with me
Thinks I'm a lousy writer
Shouldn't have shown her my book
It's not bad, really
And I'm happy tonight, for
I've found the title
"Vaghe Stelle Dell'Orsa"
By Leopardi. Know it?
No
Of course. Perfect!
"Beautiful Stars of Ursa Major"
"Did I return only to lose myself in you...
"shining high o'er our garden...
"To whisper to you from the windows...
"of my childhood...
"where all happiness ended"
- Mr. Gilardini is here
- Show him in
Good evening
- Good evening, Mr. Gilardini
- Good evening, Mr. Dawdson
I swore I'd never enter this house again, Sandra
You see, I'm frank with you
You husband has been so understanding, so generous
He insisted so that...
Well, here I am. Can't we let bygones be bygones?
- Hi, Gianni
- Hi
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please
I'm sorry, Sandra, I'm late and must run
You're so funny, Pietro, you never change
Not at all
She defends you as always
Sandra, I invited the doctor here after a talk with... Mr...
- Gilardini
- Yes, excuse me, Mr. Gilardini
- Water?
- Yes, please
Mr. Gilardini will not oppose your mother's return to the clinic
I talked to Pietro about that
We all know his opinion
You think I turned him into
Excuse me, Mr. Gilardini, let me speak for myself
I've told you I think the clinic preferable... even though the villa has comforts... not available at the clinic.
Sandra,
I propose some special therapy for that sick woman
A new method of treating your mother
Mr. Gilardini consented to this approach after visiting her this morning
Yes
Your mother has been insisting all day on attending the dedication tomorrow
She understands
Moreover...
She now seems to remember, when before she was completely blank
- Right, Doctor?
- Yes
You're not bringing mother to the ceremony?!
I know you. To play it safe you'd stuff her with sedatives
What do you mean?
What are you saying?
Exactly what I said
Please, Sandra...
We're here to try to agree... not to quarrel again
Agree! You heard her.
I know what's hatching... in that hostile, merciless brain of hers
- Isn't that right, dear?
- Yes
If anyone tries to help you you draw back... become evasive, hard... aggressive!
Mr. Gilardini
What is this truth you want to expose?
I know all about the one you seek to conceal
Do you know what you're doing?
I'll tell you
Please...
You're accusing your mother and me of a horrible crime... to maintain your innocence... to hide the filth we've tried to cover like cats purring over their own excrement
To hell with you and your rottenness!
Mr. Gilardini... please.
Please, wait
Wait! You can't leave like this
I've got to know!
Yes, yes, speak!
Speak right out!
Think I care!
I've no one
Not even you
Yes, he too
How can HE help you?
Have you told him how many times
I've gotten you out of trouble?
I can prove it
I could put your knight-errant behind bars
Maybe I will
He with his treats of suicide, boasts of hereditary taint, incestuous love!
Is it a joke?
What do you want?
Look at me!
Answer him!
Talk!
I've nothing to say
Answer him! You dirty swine!
No! Don't!
Enough
Enough! Leave me alone! Please!
Please! Oh, please don't hurt him!
No, no, no! Let him alone!
Let him alone.
Let him alone!
Let him alone
Don't you believe me?
Trust me? Have you no faith?
I had faith in the woman
I married
I want to go on believing
I'm ashamed
These shadows. This shifting of ashes of a dead past, these doubts...
You don't mean you...?
I'm sorry, I have nothing more to say
Ah, but I have
When Gianni and I went separate ways
I felt deserted, alone in a hostile world...
I was desperate
Yes, when he wrote begging me to rejoin him,
I refused
Why
Because of lies, because gossip and slander... had cast a shadow over our relationship
We had nothing to reproach ourselves for
We would've been proud to have the world know... the true nature of our bond...
A passionate loyalty... to father's memory... to our race
Sandra...
For you, as well as me, this past must be blotted out, nonexistent
We must leave together. Now!
No
How can we go on together after this?
We've nothing to say to each other
My poor dear
No...
You don't dare say what you think
And I'm tired of repeating again and again
I quite understand, you know
You so want to believe
Yet those doubts.
"They say at Volterra..."
No, we cannot go on Andrew. No
You must go, and I shall remain here... forgetting nothing
I'll do my penance
I don't know how to forget
And I don't ask forgiveness, for I forgive no one
Sandra
Andrew's gone
A fine exit
See? He's not at your side when you need him
The star exits... the play is ended
Poor Sandra. What now?
Will you go running after him with a leash?
Listen to me
We stay here together
Those intervening years, they didn't exist
Anyway, stay a few days then decide
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Why?
Because I have guts to say what you only think?
I speak the truth!
You know it
Then face it
You disgust me!
You know I'm right. You don't believe yourself
You're like the one who becomes a nun not out of faith, but unrequited love
Sick with desire they mortify their flesh for pleasure... and turn on those who won't share their guilt
You were wretched, alone
In order to identify with me... you went to the concentration camps, relived father's calvary... hid your love for me under the mask of self-sacrifice... persecuted a poor, sick woman... let your husband go
I may be cynical, corrupt... but I'm capable of the grand gesture
I've burned my book for you, Sandra
You're lovely, so lovely
We must be as we were before
Help me! Stay with me!
Don't leave me! Don't go!
You can't leave me again
I beg you!
I burned my book
I did. If you go, I'll kill myself
I'll kill myself!
This time I mean it, not like before
If you go I'm done for, finished
Look
I've prepared everything, right here
Here, you see? You don't believe me? You'll see!
You'll see!
To me you're already dead, Gianni
"Dear Sandal,
"I leave for Rome, then New York
"Need I say that my waiting period begins?
"I ask nothing. I know you need to be alone
"For me, the past is but a time for choosing the future
"May the choice you make bring you to me
"Soon, darling -- Andrew"
"Sandra -
"I'm alone, wretched
Waiting, waiting for you
"Can't you overcome your revulsion?
"I am at the bottom of the pit
"In the blackest hell one can imagine
"I'm frightened, so frightened
"Don't abandon me!
-- Gianni"
I'm frightened. So frightened
I don't want to die
Help! Help me,
I don't want to die
Help
Help...
Help, help
Help, I don't want...
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die
Sandra...
Sandra...
I remember so well that
April evening in 1942
"My hope is yours, Andrew
"You've put me to the test.
I've not betrayed your trust
"We'll be together soon
"Free from phantoms and remorse
"Love, Sandra"
I think we can begin the ceremony
Excuse me
Place it here
"From a Nazi rage, he was torn away, to the studies of life, and his loved ones"
Ladies and gentlemen
This is the first official tribute to our town's great scientist
Good day
Forsca, tell Gianni I've gone ahead to the ceremony. It's late
Very well
Signorino. Signorino Gianni...
Sir...
...for his achievements, his genius
It is not difficult to recall the image of
Emanuele Wald Luzzati
Doctor! Doctor!
Signorino Gianni - he's not in his room!
Have you looked everywhere?
The bath...?
Only his bedroom
Let's have a look
No, he's not here
Look, that door's open!
No, Tosca
God bless the soul of
Emanuele Wald Luzzati...
...at rest with those of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
May the lord welcome him... and may his soul awake on the
Day of Resurrection together with all the Righteous
For it is written in the
Prophet Isaiah:
"Your dead shall rise, shall live again"
You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy!
The dew of light and earth shall again fall upon thy loved ones and the earth will revive the spirits of the dead
Seek thy consolation in the Lord,
O thou survivors
For Thy mercy and justice, we thank Thee, O Lord!
Let us say thank you and goodbye. Amen!

The late Maialetti, Antonio.
Mother's name?
- Di Meo, Teresa.
- Three lemons, 100 lire.
Where were you born?
Rome. March 16, 1942.
- Address?
- 160 Via Trionfale.
Tell me exactly what you did
yesterday afternoon.
What time did you leave home?
It must have been 4:00 or 4:30.
I went to look for work.
- Where did you go?
- To look for work.
I haven't worked in ages,
and my family can't make ends meet.
I had an appointment at 5:00
with two priests
who had a letter
of recommendation for me.
They were waiting for me
when I got there.
You bastard!
Even miracles don't take that long!
Come on, let's go.
Well, are you coming?
I feel really mean today.
I could make all of Rome's lovers cry.
You're all talk.
I want to see you in action.
Come on, Chief. Get a move on!
Go get that purse.
Move it!
Hurry up!
- Where are they?
Over there. Go on.
I'll take care of him if necessary.
I'll punch him and knock him down.
What the hell!
Two pears!
She could have brought some spaghetti, the bitch!
It's every man for himself!
Hey, Chief!
You doing a rain dance?
You look like Robinson Crusoe.
Get in here!
Come and join civilization.
That lying almanac could have warned us!
Go ahead and laugh, idiot.
Who's gonna come make love here now?
Nino, are you going senile?
Eon't you know love knows no limits?
My little rain-soaked love
It stopped already.
It was just a passing cloud.
Let's go, Canti'.
Come on, Chief, let's go.
Mushrooms are popping up.
Come on.
So you wanted to swipe my radio, you dirty scumbag!
First I'll break your neck, then I'll take you to the police.
I didn't see you guys.
I thought someone forgot the radio.
I didn't see you.
I thought someone had thrown it out, or maybe lost it.
How was I supposed to know?
I didn't see you!
But I saw you, you little thief.
I'm taking you to the police.
Not the police.
Eon't do that to me, mister.
I swear I won't do it again.
I'm a starving orphan.
Miss, tell him to let me go.
Tell him to let me go.
You can't do this to me.
I'm just a kid!
You can't ruin me!
I'm just a kid!
Kill this thief, Giova'.
He interrupted our lovemaking.
Thief!
Just to save your mother the grief, get out of here. Beat it.
That dirty bitch!
You stink worse than a sheep!
Eirty peasant.
Eirty, smelly peasant!
Hey, Canti', what's this?
Almost the year 2000 and still getting pushed around?
I thought you were gonna kick his ass!
You're a good-for-nothing.
You should be ashamed.
Laugh it up, bastards!
I'll get even, you'll see!
I'll show you who Canticchia is!
Hey, you bastards!
Show yourselves!
Hand over the purse!
You can't hide from me!
What do they think?
That I was born yesterday?
Nino!
Sindaco!
Show yourselves!
Those rotten -
Blugippe! Succhia!
Where'd he come from?
Those dirty bastards!
It was three against one, damn them!
The three of them were partners.
The oldest brother, the priest's friend,
took to me right away.
So did the other two.
- So you found a job.
- And a good one at that.
A really busy place,
open even at night.
How'd you end up in the Parco Paolino
coming from the Viale Marconi?
I walked all the way.
I didn't have money for the bus.
I crossed a bridge
and came to the park.
Tell me everything you saw there:
Who was there, what they were doing,
and what you did.
Me? Nothing.
I just walked through,
like everyone does. I was tired.
I didn't see much.
- Be more exact. Take your time.
I want every detail,
no matter how insignificant.
I think I saw a woman.
But she was far away.
I didn't really pay attention to her.
I saw some guys too.
Didn't you see a soldier?
He had to be there.
A soldier?
Why a soldier?
I didn't see him.
I've got other things on my mind.
I didn't see any soldier.
Officer, I really want to work.
You've got to believe me.
I swear on my mother's grave.
Well, Bustelli, long time no see.
Just as well.
One less scare for me, and one less worry for you.
Why this renewed interest in my affairs?
Eon't you know I've quit stealing?
Don't worry.
We know all about it.
I'm sure you don't mind seeing me
after two years.
I don't have a beef with anyone.
I paid my debts, and now
I don't owe anybody anything.
Especially the police.
We know you don't steal anymore.
You've come up in the world.
You've got a woman now.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
She's a good girl.
Good for you.
You've had
a hard time of it until now.
In court 17 times,
and over three years in prison.
Now at 30 you've settled down.
That's old age for you.
It gets us all in the end.
This time you're in big trouble.
You're implicated
in the murder of a prostitute.
Officer, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I'll be the judge of that.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
Where did you go? Who did you see?
I got together with my girlfriend.
We met at the race track.
We have to sneak around,
because her parents are against it.
You must really be in love.
You're always early.
There's no shame in being in love.
Give me a piece of candy and I'll give you a kiss.
- Your new car is really nice.
- You like it?
Sorry I can't take you for a ride.
Too much to do.
I thought we were going for a ride.
What do you have to do?
See Esperia?
- Yes. Eon't be upset.
You know I'm breaking up with her.
I got all dressed up.
I thought we'd go someplace.
Should I just go home?
Eon't go home.
- What else can I do?
- Wait an hour or so.
- Where?
- The newsstand at San Paolo.
Here.
Buy a magazine to read while you wait for me.
Be good and I'll take you somewhere nice later.
- Eon't be long.
- San Paolo in an hour and a half.
Enough, you hear?
I've had enough!
- I'm fed up.
- Give me a break.
I'm tired, and it's all his fault, that leech!
I slaved away my whole life so I'd have a crust of bread in my old age.
You brought him here, and you can get rid of him!
You don't know Eonna Anita!
You'd like to have it all, but the money is mine too, and I'll give it to whom I please!
Is this welcome party all for me?
- So you're back.
- Very kind of you.
You're finally here.
Take your stuff and get out.
Haven't you done enough?
You made her sell the apartment and ate up the five million from the store, and now you've bought a new car with the money this idiot gave you!
Enough!
Eon't worry, Eonna Anita.
I know it's time for me to go.
- You do, do you?
- I'm fed up with living here.
Fed up, eh?
Why don't you get out, you bastard!
You know... when one pope dies, another takes his place.
Where do you think you're going?
Eon't even think about it.
Let him go!
If you don't like it, you can clear out, you old hag!
That's a good one!
You'll die covered with lice.
They'll feast on your rotten bones!
You deserve it, after all you put my poor father through!
I swear I'll kill you!
I'm not afraid of you!
I brought you into this world, and I'll take you out of it!
I don't care if you are my mother!
Come on if you dare!
You take me for that woman you blinded with the hot coals?
- They're at it again.
- Always the same thing.
Is there no respect anymore even between mother and daughter?
Put that thing down!
You think because I'm old you can walk all over me!
All you think about is squeezing money out of people, sucking 'em dry!
I don't want to end up like you!
Money-grubber!
That bastard ruined you and dragged us all down in the mud!
We gave you everything.
We fed you. You lived like a lord!
Money, nice clothes!
Come here!
Come see what this filthy beggar's got in here!
Look here!
Look at the clothes he bought with the sweat of our brow!
With our blood!
I should burn them!
Get out!
You're through living like a lord!
Get out and go back to your old rags!
You should thank God for holding me back.
Two more words and I'd have killed her.
Let's go see Maria first.
She still owes me for two weeks.
I'll show her if she doesn't pay up.
Then we'll go to Soraya's.
She owes us her usual fee.
And Clara still owes us 30,000.
We've got to hurry.
I've got things to do.
I don't care!
You're staying right here with me.
What, are you keeping tabs on me?
I've got friends to see.
Eo your friends feed you?
Forget it. You'll do as I say.
Esperia, you want me to kill you?
My mother and father and little brother are inside.
Please, don't let them know
I work the streets.
We don't care.
Just pay up, and make it quick.
- Can't you come tomorrow?
- Eon't start that again.
Come on, get the money.
We're in a hurry.
- Okay, but just keep quiet.
- Fine.
Please, make yourselves at home.
Bastard!
Here, Esperia.
Now I'm only two weeks behind.
From the factory to the consumer.
Fresh from the seller.
Here, take this.
Eamn your old mother, the hag!
Soraya!
Califfo, get over here!
Califfo, I'm so glad you bought yourself that car.
I want everyone to envy you.
Who is it?
It's Esperia. Open up.
Go away. I don't have a penny.
Soraya, don't be such a baby.
Come on, open up.
I said leave. I don't have a penny.
I'm sleeping.
You want me to break the door down? Open up!
I said I don't have it.
Can't you get it through your head?
There's no use yelling.
I'll show you yelling!
I'll break this door down! Open up!
I told you, I don't have any money.
What's the point of yelling like that?
Afraid this useless ninny won't make it one day without his allowance?
You tired of living or what?
This useless ninny is my business, you hear?
Now you can put your money in the ninny's hand.
All of it, down to the last penny!
I swear on my mother's grave!
I don't even have money to put food on the table.
You've got to believe me!
I'm used to your whining, and I'm not falling for it.
Take something else.
Want my radio? My blankets?
Take something?
This house if full of junk!
What could you possibly give me?
The fleas are eating you alive!
Take the radio. It works.
- What's this little orphan's name?
- Angelo.
No, not the dog!
Leave him out of this!
What would you do with the poor creature?
He was born right here.
When you pay up, you'll get him back.
Eon't worry - we won't eat him.
Hurry up and get us our money.
Let's go, Esperia.
The sooner you give us our money, the sooner you get the dog back.
You happy now?
Now you belong to a gentleman.
Esperia, save me some time and go on home.
Home to that witch?
Come on. You can take care of your business some other time.
What?
Stop wasting my time.
I've got lots to do. Go on home.
What?
Eo you think I pay you for your good looks?
You'll take me where I say and do as I say, or else!
Listen, I do as I please.
If you don't like it, find yourself another slave.
Either you take me where I want to go, or you can forget where I live, and this time it's for good!
I'm not going back there!
Eon't worry - you won't see me again!
Fine!
You're not worth it anyway!
Then we're agreed -
I won't wait around for you!
See you around!
What are you doing, you bastard?
We have nothing more to discuss.
We're through.
Nothing more to discuss?
I'll make you throw up all the sweets you ate at my expense, you rotten -
Okay.
You took your girlfriend home,
then walked back through the park.
It's like I told you.
I saw some people,
but I wasn't paying attention.
There was a woman in the distance,
and some guys.
But I don't remember them.
I wouldn't recognize them.
So you didn't do or see
or hear anything.
Not a thing.
All I did yesterday
was take a nice, long walk.
Eamn her!
Now what am I gonna do?
Relax.
Have a seat.
Are you going to sit down?
- Okay, Officer.
- What's your name?
- Cosentino, Teodoro.
- Parents?
Giuseppe and Beppina Gigliotti.
Feroleto Antico, province of Catanzaro.
September 15, 1940.
What regiment are you in
at Cecchignola?
Thirteenth artillery, fourth company.
Were you in the Parco Paolino
last night?
Me? No, Officer.
What do you mean, no?
Three or four people saw you there.
Okay, I was there, but I was just passing through.
That's what I asked.
Try to pay attention.
You can't forget anything here.
Several witnesses
saw you in the park.
They all say you were sitting
on a bench by yourself.
What motive
could you have for lying?
I was just passing through.
I hardly even remember it.
Okay, then where
were you before that?
Where were you coming from?
Rome.
I had been to the movies.
I was walking back, and the sun was still out.
I amused myself by watching the cars and all the people getting off the streetcars.
There were so many children and pretty girls.
Let us praise the God of Abraham
You created the mighty
among the moon and stars
Strong men
And beautiful women
Let us praise the God of Abraham
Hey, come on over here!
When I got to the park
it was already dark.
I was dead tired,
so I rested on a bench.
I understand, Cosentino.
Now try to remember-
who was in the park?
No one. Just me.
God, I was sleepy.
And when you're sleepy, what do you do?
You lie down.
And when you lie down, what happens?
You fall asleep.
Okay.
Listen, Cosentino,
I know exactly what happened.
I know you slept on that bench
for an hour and a half.
When you woke up,
who else was in the park?
What did you see?
- I didn't see anything in the park.
I ran into a man outside the park.
I remember him
because he was wearing clogs,
and he was running.
He had blond hair.
He had something under his jacket.
Some kind of package.
What a mug!
What?
I didn't like the way he looked.
He gave me a dirty look.
Could you recognize him now?
Sure I could.
He gave me the creeps.
This is all useless information.
We don't care about that.
You're the one who was seen
running through the Parco Paolino.
There aren't many low-lifes
who go around in clogs.
Besides, the soldier recognized you
from the lineup.
So were you there or not?
Sure I was.
Any law against that?
Now we're getting somewhere.
Where were you coming from?
Why were you in such a hurry?
You were coming
from down by the river,
where that woman was killed.
I don't know.
I'm always roaming around.
How can I remember everywhere I've been?
Let me refresh your memory.
You were running, and you had
something hidden under your jacket.
Some kind of package.
What was it?
A present for my girlfriend.
What kind of present?
A cat. A kitten.
Okay, let's say it was a cat.
But where were you coming from?
I can't remember.
It's been a few days.
You don't remember.
That soldier was right.
You are a strange one.
Okay, let's see if you get
your memory back.
Think it over.
You have all the time in the world.
For your own sake.
Now I remember clearly.
I'll tell you everything.
I always go wandering at night.
I get off work at the club at 6:30.
I have nothing to do, so I just wander around.
I just walk around.
The EUR building,
the amusement park,
the pyramid,
and around Monteverde.
The other night
I found myself at the Parco Paolino.
A kid walked by, all by himself.
But he didn't hang around.
He followed the path and left.
In the distance I saw a man.
He was hiding behind a bush.
I don't know what he was doing.
I didn't get a good look at him.
I think it was a young man,
with bleached-blond hair.
I came to the edge of the park.
A soldier was asleep
on a park bench, all alone.
There was another man further along,
minding his own business.
Then I saw two kids I know.
Sometimes they come to play pinball
at the club where I work.
Yeah, I saw them.
I know their faces well.
They were talking.
I think that man
was waiting for them.
The two boys started talking to him.
Then the three of them left together.
They walked by the woman.
What do you want from me?
I don't know anything about her!
I saw those three hanging around her.
She must have gone with them.
You have to believe me!
So you got a good look at them.
You'd be able to recognize them.
Sure, they're regulars at the club.
And I know where they live.
Where?
Via Portuense, in the new developments.
What are their names?
The light-haired one is Francolicchio, and the dark-haired one is Pipito.
How can you say we did it?
Yes, we saw that woman, but we didn't talk to her.
We didn't even get a good look at her.
I wouldn't lie, if I were you.
How can you say
you didn't go near her?
We didn't.
You and your friend were seen
hanging around that woman.
What woman?
What were you doing?
Francolicchio and I had to scrape together 2,000 lire.
- What for?
- We needed it for a meal.
You're confusing me.
What's this about a meal?
Start over.
I have to understand.
Francolicchio and I meet up with two girls every day at 4:00 at Villa Sciarra.
They work nearby.
When they get off, they have a bite at Villa Sciarra.
What?
Eon't you know she who eats alone chokes on her food?
You look really hungry.
I bet you didn't even say grace first.
So what?
I'll say it for them.
We brought something for you too, since you're always starving.
Who, us?
Here's some jam.
And a roll for each of you.
Hand over the jam.
- Put some jam on mine.
- Go on, spread it on.
You're making a real mess!
It won't come off.
You're such good girls.
Even my mother isn't this good to me.
This jam is delicious.
Another sandwich like this and I'll marry you.
I'm thirsty.
Wanna get a drink at the water fountain?
They're so big.
Will they survive?
Sure, until someone decides to eat them.
Milli, you like this place?
A friend of mine's getting married Sunday.
Lucky her!
When are you getting married?
Me, get married?
Why? Eon't you want to?
Sure, but not now.
When? When you're 80?
You think it's so easy getting married?
What's the big deal?
You go to church and you get married.
Hey, would you two marry me?
Why don't we all get married?
If I got married, my wife would have to make me two pounds of potatoes with meat sauce every day.
Man, are those potatoes good!
That's nothing. It's easy to make potatoes in meat sauce.
I'd have her make gnocchi.
No main dish - just gnocchi.
Let me tell you how love is born
In case you don't know
I'll kiss you softly
and lightly brush your lips
I'll stand so close to you
My shoe!
Eomenica!
Mariella!
Come on up, but be quiet on the stairs!
Good afternoon.
Well, aren't you coming in?
Eon't just stand there.
The door.
I've been waiting for ages.
Since 2:30.
I was about to leave.
Who are these boys?
Friends of ours.
Francolicchio and Pipito.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
What are you doing?
I want you to hear a good record.
Eon't insist, Milli. I can't.
Come on, please.
No, really, I can't.
Come on, please.
Okay. It's in my room.
Eid you see how good-Iooking she is?
What a looker!
How old is she?
- Twenty.
- Can't be. She's 17, like me.
- You're 16.
- Well, I'm almost 17.
Listen to this record.
It's really good.
Of course it's good.
That's my song.
Let me tell you how love is born
In case you don't know
I'll kiss you softly
and lightly brush your lips
I'll stand so close to you
That's how, without a sound
love is born
In case you don't know
Never
Never again
Just like a butterfly
Are you engaged?
Us, engaged?
What are you waiting for?
Go on, dance.
I'll put on some good dance music.
Wanna dance?
I don't know how.
Eance with him.
Wanna dance?
Come on, dance with me.
Are you shy or what?
We just don't know how.
Forget about them.
Let's you and me dance.
Too bad.
If I'd known you were bringing friends,
I would have fixed something.
We could do it tomorrow.
We could be here at 4:00, when we get off work.
4:00 is perfect.
My mother goes out at 3:00 and doesn't come back until 8:00.
We'll have loads of time.
What are we gonna make?
- Gnocchi.
- And potatoes with meat sauce.
Sure, gnocchi and potatoes.
But you have to bring the food.
My mother doesn't leave me any money.
Of course we'll bring it.
You guys bring the food, and we'll cook.
I'll write down the ingredients for you.
Okay.
Four pounds of potatoes... six ounces tomato paste...
Four pounds of potatoes, six ounces of tomato paste, six ounces of ground beef and a bottle of wine.
We'll need at least 2,000 lire.
- So what?
- So it's a big deal.
- We'll get it somehow.
- Where? How?
We just have to find it.
Soldiers are lucky.
All they do is sleep.
You should show some respect.
Eon't you know who he is?
Who is he?
Eummy.
He's the Unknown Soldier!
I'm gonna stuff myself tomorrow.
My belly will be out to here.
Would you have a comb?
Eamn, I left mine at home.
Here, I have one.
- Would you like an American cigarette?
- Thanks.
How come you're not with your girlfriends?
We just walked them home.
Good for you.
So now you're alone.
That's right, all alone.
Eon't you ever talk, blondie?
Cat got your tongue?
What should I say?
Your friend is shy.
Want to take a little walk with me?
Let's go, Pipito.
We've got things to do.
Wait, Francoli'.
We won't do anything with him.
We'll take his lighter.
Eid you see it? It's gold.
He keeps it in his raincoat.
Leave me alone.
Come on, don't worry.
We won't do anything with him.
How else are we gonna get the money?
We'll look like jerks tomorrow.
Come on!
- What's your name, wild boy?
- Francolicchio.
What did you say?
Francolicchio.
What a cute name.
Where do people come up with them?
Is that a real name?
What about you, you little animal?
I've got a name, you know.
It's Pipito.
Look who I've ended up with!
- Come on.
- Aren't you coming?
- It's sandy. I'll slip.
- Come on. We'll give you a hand.
- What, are you doing a striptease?
- I don't want to get dirty.
Come on.
Hold my coat and wait here.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
I didn't do anything!
Of course not.
If you were innocent,
why did you run away?
It's all because of that lighter.
Then what happened?
Go on. What happened?
What happened?
You know as well as I do.
Pass the ball over here.
What do you want?
Over here!
What do you want?
The cops are here to arrest you.
They're at your house.
What are you talking about?
They want to throw you in jail.
Eid they go to my house too?
Francolicchio, run!
My God!
I can't go any further.
Come on.
We can't let 'em catch us.
They're not gonna catch me.
I won't let 'em.
Francoli', come back!
I'm scared!
What are you doing?
Francoli', don't run away.
Stay away from the middle!
What am I gonna do?
I can't swim!
I'm scared!
Where am I gonna go, Francoli'?
Eon't go off without me!
I can't swim!
I can't swim!
Eon't run away, you coward!
Coward!
You have to help us.
Perhaps you've left out
some crucial detail.
Try to remember.
I don't even know
what she looked like.
It was dark.
I couldn't see a thing.
Besides, she was far away.
Then I went home.
It was chilly.
Eamn, it's cold!
Where are you going in those clogs?
Aren't you cold?
My clogs?
I always wear them.
I work in my clogs.
It's become a habit.
- Nice habit.
Where are you from?
- I'm from Friuli.
That's what I thought.
What are you doing in the park?
- I don't know where to go.
I don't know anyone.
Now you've met someone important - me!
I had a friend from Friuli.
She was a really good girl.
Wait here. I'll go first.
I had a friend from Friuli.
A really good girl.
And she was shrewd.
Girls from the north get more respect.
Everyone respected and admired her.
But I know why that is with you northerners.
Why?
You talk so well.
It's that beautiful accent.
I can't get enough of it.
Say something for me.
What do you want me to say?
I don't talk much.
You're not shy, are you?
Me, shy? I'm no kid.
She wrote me last Christmas.
She's quit working the streets, and she's gonna open a bar.
But she didn't include a return address, so I couldn't write back.
Maybe she thinks I'm dead.
You out of work?
- No, I've got a job.
Who dresses you like this?
You're a strange one, you know.
Hey, you got the money?
- Of course I've got it!
Calm down.
I'm short of breath.
I can't climb those steps for nothing.
I always meet the most desperate guys.
First they act like big shots.
But when it's time to pull out the 1,000 lire...
Climbing up and down these steps leaves me short of breath.
And since they know I'm a soft touch, all the low-lifes come to me.
The other night one of them started crying on me.
You've got me all wrong.
I don't cry with hookers.
Let's go down this way.
Come on.
Come on over here.
Eon't be afraid.
I come here all the time.
Set your purse down.
You're not gonna hold on to it, are you?
Why should I set it down?
Eoes it bother you?
Let go!
Let go of my purse!
Help!
Help!
Stop yelling!
Be quiet. Eon't yell.
What do you want from me?
I didn't do anything!
Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
Natalino!
She was a whore!
She was a whore!
What did I do?
What did I do wrong?
And the Grim Reaper of Giulia Street
raises her scythe once again...

"I shouldn't be in love with a married man, but he's everything to me.
I feel sorry for his wife, but this is the only way to make him mine.
I'm sorry, Mother. Tamiko"
A double suicide brought on by the woman?
Lucky man to have a woman who loved him that much.
I agree.
What kind of work did he do?
Chief.
"Police Detective Koichi Takeshita"
Hey, watch it!
Damn you! That hurts!
Be careful!
Any special girl you want?
What are you doing?
Bring the best.
Very well, sir!
Waiter, ice!
He's quite a playboy.
A very good customer.
He's already spent 70,000.
Who is it?
Somebody beat up Ken.
You guys take care of it.
He says it was a total stranger.
- Where's Ken?
- Outside.
Forget this stranger.
Just pay him off.
Maybe this guy is from the Sanko mob.
They're no match for us.
Just forget it.
Get Ken in here.
Is that the man?
That's him!
The total is 72,500 yen.
- Any policemen around?
- Why do you ask?
Well, I've got no money.
Don't give us that bullshit!
Wait.
Let's settle this peacefully in the office.
Stop.
He isn't packing.
This room is soundproof.
One false move and they'll blow you away, so watch your step.
You're new.
Where are you from?
I hear you've been messing around on our turf.
You got some grudge against Nomoto Enterprises?
Spit it out or you'll get hurt.
I just felt like doing it.
If it had been this lady here,
I would've been gentler.
- Smart-ass!
- Shut your face!
Good thing it's soundproof.
Turn around.
- What for?
- Do as I say.
You stay here.
Get up.
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.
How much?
One million yen up front.
You got it.
And 200,000 yen a month.
Then...
Did you think I was a hit man?
I just wanted a job.
Thanks for hiring me.
Good.
I'll introduce you to the boss.
You aren't the boss?
You keep wanting more!
But our area is a slum!
You can't ask for so much.
- That's enough!
NOMOTO RESIDENCE
You a killer?
I bet you're fast with guns.
I dislike such unreliable weapons.
I like to feel the results with my own hand.
These are the best.
Put that away.
I don't like being shot in the back.
Take your hand off the gun.
Let's get rid of them together.
You've got a few things to learn.
So do you.
I'm Minami.
We'll get along fine.
We will. I'm Joji Mizuno.
Call me Jo for short.
Don't touch that!
He's never been able to hold a gun in his left hand.
I wanna meet the boss.
I'm Nomoto.
You guys should act more respectable.
You still act like yakuza off the street.
Minami,
I told you to wear a tie, didn't I?
You won't believe this, but alcohol and women are my weaknesses.
Where are you staying?
The Hibiya Hotel.
The Hibiya?
That's classy.
Can you afford it?
No, I'm broke.
So you're going to bilk them then?
You've got guts.
I'll pick up the tab for you.
Take care of him, Minami.
He looks useful.
Is he really at the Hibiya?
Forget it.
He won't be on your list.
Here he is.
- Oh, yeah?
From Abashiri, the prison town.
Just a moment, sir.
That's a hell of a suitcase!
- Nomoto runs this place too?
- Yeah.
Jo, what's in there?
Wanna report to your boss, huh?
The tools of my trade.
I take better care of them than I do of myself.
Pretty impressive!
Come on.
I'll show you around.
Then on to your first job.
Let's see what you're capable of.
This is for you.
Hello. Good to see you.
- He's the new hand.
- Got a name?
Jo Mizuno, I think.
A bit of a maverick, but I hear he's good.
A shakedown!
- What?
- Where?
The realtors' office.
Some guy's blackmailing them.
What?
The deed.
Make out a check.
How the hell can I pay three million yen?
Just write it out.
You can't threaten me.
You can't do anything to me.
Get out!
Okay, I'll write the check!
Hold it right there.
You almost pulled it off, but you got a little overconfident.
To hell with your plan!
Hold it!
Hold it!
I said hold it.
Jo, let's finish up this job.
I've changed my mind.
I've decided I want the three million in cash.
Please! Just a little, please!
No. Drugs are expensive.
I can't give you any.
Don't say that.
I promise I'll work harder.
Shut up!
It hurts so bad.
Give me some quick, please!
You want it that much?
Here.
Give it to me.
Wait!
The dope!
Damn you!
You're inhuman!
If you want it, get your ass out there and make me some money.
Don't be playing around with your boyfriend.
Well?
Do you understand?
How did the job go?
Boss!
That was the first time
I've pulled that trick.
Here's the three million.
It was like Jo said.
There was a guy on the balcony.
From now on we're partners.
I won't work without him.
Jo, I checked you out.
You're clean.
You're now on the payroll.
Here's your front money.
I'm gonna hang out with you today.
Sorry. Not today.
I have a memorial service to attend.
An old friend of mine.
A memorial service?
Wow, thank you.
Oh, it's nothing.
Seeing these photos makes you feel like Takeshita's still alive.
He used to love to sing when he got drunk, didn't he?
Hello?
Excuse me.
Mrs. Takeshita?
My name is Mizuno.
My condolences.
Thank you.
A long time ago, your husband was very kind to me.
Is that right?
Please, come inside.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Please stay and eat.
Thanks, but I must go.
Would you mind telling me a story about my husband?
Hello. Takeshita speaking.
A yellow sweater?
I'm sorry, but we're all out of yellow wool.
How about red?
TAKESHITA KNITTING SCHOOL
HOW ABOUT A DATE AT THE CLUB AOI?
Look at this.
You're sure she didn't work at your club?
- Yes.
- Thanks.
Go out the back way.
A man's been following us.
DOUBLE SUICIDE
Come here.
I need to talk to you.
But I'm naked.
Me too.
I already took a shower.
That was careless, rushing into the bathroom like that.
What if I were a killer?
I'm only joking. Come here.
What are you after?
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.
What brings you here?
I just want to get to know you, silly.
You're so strong.
I want you to kill a woman.
Find her and then kill her.
- Who?
First let's make love.
Tell me who.
You won't have much luck in marriage.
Three wives, it says.
I thought I'd marry you, but I'd better not.
Cut the jokes.
It's no joke.
I'm here to talk to you.
Kill the boss's sixth mistress.
Just kill her.
Isn't this fun?
I'm gonna build a tomb for her.
You know the suicide case involving the detective?
That girl was one of our call girls.
The paper said she was a clerk.
Yes, that was a cover.
Most of our girls have covers.
And?
The boss' sixth mistress runs the show.
Nobody's ever seen her, and Nomoto keeps quiet about her.
But they can't fool me.
A woman's intuition, huh?
Find her.
Will you kill her?
First tell me why.
Is it jealousy? Money?
Everything.
She's the only one I can't control.
I see.
And what's in it for me?
Half of what I get.
And if I say no?
I'll say you dragged me here and raped me.
He's insanely jealous, so that'll be the end of you.
Not a bad deal.
But what happens if I find her more attractive, or if she pays me more?
LOVELY YOUNG LADIES
THE MURASAKI CLUB
No girls right now?
Tonight's fine, then.
Send one to the Hibiya at 8:00.
What's this? Why so upset?
Nothing.
Better safe than sorry.
What's on your mind?
Our boss wants to see you to thank you.
Okay, but not right now.
What?
Not like this, anyway.
I don't like people telling me what to do.
He's got a big mouth!
Gonna kill me here?
The cops are nearby, and this area's full of apartments.
From this range, it'd be hard not to blow your face off.
Go ahead.
The cops are nearby, and this area's full of apartments.
That's my line, fool.
Now drop the gun.
Let's go.
- What?
You said your boss wanted to see me, right?
Shut up!
So you don't care if you've gotta close up shop?
Pay us a little more and you'll be safe, Pachinko man.
I hear you're leaning towards
Nomoto Enterprises, right?
Answer me!
Watch it or they'll do you in.
Good work. Thanks.
So they finally brought you.
You got it wrong.
I came on my own.
Come on.
Don't be a sore loser.
Tell him.
He's got a gun.
A gun?
Give 'em the details.
It's a shotgun.
It can blow your face off.
Blow my face off?
Sounds like fun. Show me.
Hold it!
We don't want our guest hurt.
Show him out first.
Do it!
Come on!
Take it easy.
I don't know what Nomoto pays you, but I'll double it.
Why do all you big shots say the same stupid lines?
Fine. Everyone out.
We're gonna talk.
Out!
Now, how much?
- Gimme your gun.
- Don't! You'll put the boss in danger.
Shut up! I can't just stand by.
No, don't!
Watch this.
I'll get him in the back.
One million up front and 200,000 a month.
I'll give you one and a half million, and 300,000.
Join us.
No.
That's our top salary.
But I want Nomoto's, too.
You can't do that.
Nomoto is buying guns to crush your mob.
What?
I'll spy on them for you.
Nomoto was originally one of your men, right?
You should attack first and wipe him out, but don't let me pressure you.
- It's a deal.
- Thanks.
Hold it!
You overheard us?
I heard nothing, and I'll never talk.
Leave him. He won't rat.
Besides, we're all partners now.
I'll let it go for today.
All right. Let's go.
- What?
You're my shield.
We're enemies on the outside.
I've got to stay on guard.
Don't!
I went to your apartment... and saw you being taken away.
But I knew you'd come out on top.
I did, thanks to this.
I see.
The hammer's broken.
Those idiots would be so pissed off if they knew.
Minami.
Do we run call girls?
Call girls?
This'll cost a fortune to fix.
Onodera kept asking if we ran call girls. Do we?
Have some of this. It's great.
Don't you know anything?
All I'm interested in is guns.
Nothing else.
That's why they make fun of you.
Even Onodera knows a woman runs the business.
A woman?
Alcohol and women are bad for me.
You're like that broken shotgun.
A useless piece of crap!
Go to sleep!
As useless as a broken shotgun?
How dare you call me an idiot!
You're the idiot!
He wasn't talking about a woman.
He meant Hideo.
The boss's brother. He's gay.
The one you met at his house.
Don't forget
I know everything about our gang!
I'm sorry.
Tell me about Hideo.
Sure.
His mother was a whore after the war.
Specialized in black men.
But never mention that to him.
A drunk woman once called him
"a son of a whore."
He carved her face up with a razor.
I saw it.
Her face looked like a venetian blind.
Venetian blind?
Hideo with the razor blade.
Murasaki Club here.
Send me one.
- And your name?
- Yoshida.
Where are you?
In Shibuya.
Call us back in 30 minutes from the pay phone at Namikibashi to discuss the place, okay?
Do you have a car?
Please arrange it for me.
Keep this quiet.
Looks like there's nothing wrong with him.
Yeah, he looks like he can pay.
Get me 416-1920, please.
Hello? It's me.
Do we have a girl for 3:00 p.m.?
Send her to Shibuya Public Hall.
Thanks.
Are you Hideo with the razor blade?
You know who I am, don't you?
- No.
- Really?
Who were you calling?
Where did you call?
None of your business.
You're going to take me there.
Where?
The place you just called.
I already know.
Hello? Put me through to the same number as before.
Just do it!
Hello. Nomoto Enterprises?
What's your number?
416-1920. Nomoto?
I've got some business to see to.
I heard your mother was a whore.
Don't make me carve up your face.
Don't!
Tell me who your partner is.
I don't know.
You wanna look like a venetian blind too?
Stop! I'll talk.
Who is it?
What're you doing?
Talk. Why did you do it?
Start talking, or more than your face will look different!
I'll never talk, no matter what.
Who sent you?
Talk.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again.
Forgive me.
You fool!
If you don't suspect me, just let me go.
Just shut up and watch!
Go on! Get out!
Stop it!
Hey, don't.
What's that?
He always gets like that beating up women. It excites him.
He's a sadist.
There's a deal.
Be at the house by 2:00.
A deal?
- Drugs.
- Where?
Just be there at 2:00.
Hello? What?
The boss isn't here!
What?
Good morning. It's for you.
Now talk.
I told you to come alone.
I'm carrying money.
I need protection.
All right.
Nomoto's got a drug deal planned for ten million.
Really?
Where?
Wait till the deal is done.
Then strike and take the money.
Just the money.
Forget Nomoto's drugs.
Why's that?
They'll think Nomoto did it.
They'll never sell to him again.
Drugs are the backbone of the mob.
Without them -
I see. And Nomoto's finished.
Thanks.
But why would you tell us this?
You got a grudge against them?
No, I just want the money.
On this one,
I'll take four of the ten million.
With two million in advance.
Two million?
Make it snappy.
Where's it happening?
Otherwise we forget the whole thing.
Hey!
Two million.
Two million's cheap for a chance to finish off Nomoto.
I should be at Nomoto's at 2:00?
Yeah, just follow behind me in the car.
One blast of the horn means it's the Nomoto car.
Two means the other car has the money.
Laying low these days, Takechi?
Hello, Officer.
Mizuno!
Why did you attend
Takeshita's memorial service?
It's like you were insulting him.
Have you joined up with Nomoto now?
I hear you have.
Takeshita didn't talk much about you, but he took what you did pretty hard.
He'd be even more shocked at this.
Don't give me that sentimental crap.
You've changed since you went to Kobe.
Embezzlement? It's a setup.
No, I looked into it.
You did it, just as the letter says.
No, I just borrowed the money for investigation.
Why didn't you clear it first?
I had no proof.
It was a hunch.
The boss wouldn't have understood.
Please understand.
I know the Sakura mob wrote that letter.
I wonder how they knew.
Anyway, this shows they've panicked.
Can you keep quiet about this for me?
You sure about this?
Well?
I'd stake my life on it.
Okay.
I'll forget about this letter.
I don't care what happens to it.
Thanks.
Just don't go too far, or you risk your life.
Thanks. I'm grateful.
That night I tortured one of the Sakura mob.
I went so far that he couldn't talk anymore.
That was all.
I was arrested for assault and embezzlement and went to prison.
I was framed by the mob.
Takeshita almost lost his job.
That Takeshita.
In spite of the trouble I caused him... he took care of my wife while I was in jail.
She had TB, and he got her into the hospital and even sent her money every month on his pittance of a salary.
But in the end, she died.
He was quite a guy.
Mizuno.
I had no chance to pay him back.
When he was killed, I figured this was my chance to repay him.
So I'm after his murderer.
- That was a suicide.
You think Takeshita would cheat on his wife?
He was so awkward with women.
There's proof.
What proof?
It was a trap.
He was framed like me, and murdered.
You think the murderer is with Nomoto?
You know Yosuke Ishiyama?
You do, right?
This is him in Kobe. Look familiar?
A drug tycoon.
When he moved to Tokyo,
Takeshita was transferred here too.
Ishiyama is real smart.
Takeshita searched for proof.
I met a guy in prison who Takeshita once arrested.
A Nomoto mobster.
He'll be here soon.
Got an appointment or something?
I'm gonna get Takeshita's killer.
Idiot! That's not your job.
Leave that to the cops.
We'll look into it.
No way.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
I'll kill the killers.
But -
Stop right here.
Don't stop. Take us to police HQ.
Stop!
Stop!
Don't worry. I'll be in touch.
Take him home.
I'm arresting you for illegal possession of a firearm.
Gonna use handcuffs?
Don't be an idiot!
Don't take it out on the car, you jerk!
Damn it! He tricked us!
Who told you about this?
I'm too ashamed to say.
He looks like he's in a hurry.
He mustn't see us.
Hide, you idiot!
What is it?
I think I've seen him somewhere before.
Seen who?
I must've been imagining it.
Long time no see.
How about some mah-jongg tonight?
- Sounds great.
Business first.
Perfect.
The deal is done.
We're changing cars.
Sorry.
I think I know you.
Or do I?
- What's up?
- Nothing.
I think we've met before.
I can't remember everyone I meet.
One blast of the horn.
Get the Nomoto car.
Give us the money.
Hand it over!
We'll get you for this.
Shut up!
Hurry up!
We have just one thing to say to you:
You pay us again.
Mr. Ishiyama, you've got it wrong.
I swear we didn't do it.
The only ones who knew the details were you and us.
But -
If you don't pay again, then fine.
That'll be the end of our dealings.
Wait a minute.
Please don't jump to conclusions.
Boss.
What is it, Shibata?
That guy driving the car!
He's a cop!
I'm sure I saw him in Kobe!
Who was it?
It was Jo.
That's four million for me.
Not a bad deal.
Let's do business again sometime.
I'd be happy too, but are you sure it's okay?
Not all of Nomoto's men are fools.
I know.
Just to join me for lunch.
That's all.
Have her wait at the Hibiya.
A red flower on her handbag?
Got it.
Here it is.
You wanted me to see these people?
No, I'll send them away.
He tells me to work and work, but look at the guy he sends me to!
Go tell Hideo he should be more selective!
Anything else?
Tell him he's an idiot too!
Minami, let's get it over with.
I can't shoot Jo!
Where's the loot?
What loot?
The money your men took from Mr. Shibata.
What are you talking about?
You're with the Kobe police.
I met you three years ago.
Look!
You idiot!
Why didn't you just ask me if you wanted to know about that?
That picture means nothing.
So you're a cop, huh?
I was.
Listen. Three years ago,
I was arrested for assault and embezzlement.
Don't forget I did time too!
Check it out.
It was in the police gazette three years ago.
Damn!
You cut my finger for that!
Get someone to check it out!
"Detective Mizuno arrested for assault and embezzlement."
I'll get you back for this, boss!
You idiot!
Don't talk to him like that!
Hold it.
You have reason to be angry.
I'm sorry.
Let's settle this.
How much do you want for your finger?
Let me have one of yours.
Can you prove it wasn't you?
Now you ask?
Any ideas who it was?
I saw a Sanko guy there.
The Sanko mob?
Yeah, by the bridge.
I'm sure he's involved.
I bet he sent the signal.
You sure you're not mistaken?
Don't ask if you won't listen.
Why don't you get the guy?
What's his name?
Just some punk.
But I remember his face.
Bye.
So it was you and your buddies, huh?
- I don't know who -
- Bullshit!
Talk! It was you guys, wasn't it?
Minami, throw this bum in the river!
Okay.
All right! We did it.
Now you tell us.
So, they did do it.
One last question.
I'll just ask you once:
Did you set it up?
No!
I did as Takechi told me!
Takechi?
How did he know?
I don't know.
Don't give me this bullshit!
Whatever you might think,
I'm a Sanko man!
I never lie!
You'll be dishonored if you drown me in the river.
Kill me with a gun.
Shoot me straight in the heart.
Lock him in the basement.
Boss, this looks like a challenge from the Sanko mob.
Damn them!
Onodera plotted all this.
We'll go on the offensive, damn it!
Hold it.
We can get them anytime.
First we find out from Takechi who the informant was.
It's my honor on the line.
Let me handle this.
You guys work with Jo.
No, let me do this.
Come on, Jo.
Who is it?
Sorry to bother you.
Is Takechi in?
He's not back yet.
Tell us the truth.
When's he expected back?
She's beautiful.
Don't get any funny ideas, Minami.
All we've got to do is wait.
You, outside.
Thirty-minute shifts.
Minami, your shift.
It's your turn.
I wanna stay with her.
For you, I'm drinking for the first time in my life.
What if he puts up a fight?
Our orders are not to kill him.
"Run. Nomoto's trap. Jo."
That's enough.
What if Nomoto finds out?
You don't have to tell him.
I've fallen for her.
Don't look at me like that.
We just have to get Takechi, right?
Jo, change places.
No. Why should Minami have all the fun?
I don't like it.
If you want to keep a lookout, go ahead.
I never thought you'd fall for a woman.
I thought touching a statue's ass was all you could handle.
The key!
By the door.
Your husband's gonna die anyway.
Let him have some fun with you.
You all right, Minami?
Ishizaki and Takechi shot each other. Got that?
Leave me here.
I wanna be with her.
It's a murder!
Stop!
Jo.
You can't make it with me.
Leave me here.
Don't be stupid.
You go. I'll stay here.
I don't want the police to get hold of you.
Stay here. I'll take a look.
She was so nice.
TAKESHITA KNITTING SCHOOL
You?
I'm sorry, but he's wounded.
May we come in?
Doesn't he need a doctor?
No, I'll see to him.
I'll take the slug out myself.
Mrs. Takeshita, your deceased husband and I were detectives together.
But I got fired over a certain incident.
I didn't believe the story about what happened to him.
I checked it out myself.
I found out he didn't kill himself.
He was murdered.
- Really?
- It's true.
You know he couldn't have done it, don't you?
Not with a call girl.
She worked for Nomoto.
The note was a fake.
She didn't know she'd be killed too.
Who did it?
I don't know yet.
Someone in Nomoto's mob.
I joined them to find out.
I'm getting close.
If the cops come in now,
I'll never find out.
Will you help me?
Just look the other way for a while.
I understand.
Thanks. I'll get started now.
Nomoto here.
Jo? What's up?
Takechi surprised us.
Sanko knows what we're up to.
Just think if they find out about Takechi getting hit.
They're probably already planning revenge.
Where are you?
Right now?
The Takeshita Knitting School.
Please send help as soon as possible.
Hurry, or Minami will die.
Oh, it's you. What's up?
What? Takechi's dead?
Nomoto did it? Damn him!
They're preparing to attack.
I'll bet they're the ones who started this.
Be careful.
"Forewarned is forearmed," as the saying goes.
You can count on me.
Mrs. Takeshita, will you do us another favor?
Someone's coming for him.
Will you go with them?
No!
You've seen his face.
If they see you alive,
Nomoto will suspect me.
Don't worry.
Trust me. I'll protect you.
Thanks for coming. I didn't expect you'd come in person, boss.
How's Minami?
Still unconscious.
Better take this woman with you.
She'll just get in the way of our attack.
- Then you're going to -
- I won't kill her.
I'll leave Hideo to watch her.
Nothing to worry about.
Boss!
Okay? Keep a good eye on her.
Something's fishy about Sanko.
They may be getting ready to attack.
Inui will keep us informed.
Are you all right, sir?
You ran right into this -
Look!
You bastard!
We caught a Nomoto punk!
Don't bother about him.
The more they think we're making a big deal of this... the more of them we can lure in.
We'll get 'em all together in one place and then let them have this.
Kaboom!
That'll be the end of them.
Let's go!
If we're successful, you can have their turf.
Thanks. We'll be on our way.
Jo, come here for a sec.
You're not going.
With Minami and Ishizaki dead,
I'll be needed.
You'd only watch anyway, right?
Freeze!
What is it this time?
Thanks a lot for all your lies.
What's that?
Don't play dumb!
We know everything.
We know you joined us to avenge your pal.
And you're in with Sanko on their plan to wipe us out!
Who told you that crap?
Don't play dumb.
Who was it?
Damn! We're too late!
They're coming!
The more, the better!
This is our chance, guys!
Wait!
Leave it to me.
I'll go first, and then you follow.
Good. If you do it, you can have their turf.
Come with me if you want to!
Don't let them die in vain. Go!
Go! Next!
Attack!
Crush him and you get all his turf!
Go! Will nobody go?
Damn that Nomoto!
Damn that Nomoto!
Now talk!
Did you kill Detective Takeshita?
- No.
Talk or I'll blow those fingers off!
- No!
- Then who was it?
I don't know.
I'll ask again.
Who killed him and why?
Really, I don't know!
- Talk!
- I don't know!
Would you tell if you were me?
What's Takeshita's wife to you?
You wanna lose them all?
- Don't you know?
She's my sixth mistress.
You promised not to shoot!
A promise to you is nothing.
I want to kill you, but I've promised to keep you alive.
So it's just three fingers today!
One day you'll lose all your limbs!
Remember that!
You shouldn't let someone live who has a grudge against you.
You've got a lot to learn.
A wrong number?
They thought this was a clinic.
Are you hungry?
Your brother is missing three fingers now.
Wanna lose your nose?
Who killed Takeshita?
Say it again.
Who killed Takeshita? Say the name!
You killed Takeshita, didn't you?
No! How could I?
He knew your secret.
That's crazy! Can you prove it?
Nomoto sang like a bird!
I shot off three of his fingers.
No mercy for you either.
You admit it?
Nomoto did it. I had to help.
He threatened me.
Was Nomoto there?
Yes.
The motive?
He found out about our call girl ring.
What were you to Nomoto?
His lover.
Why'd you marry Takeshita?
Nomoto ordered me to.
He wanted me to spy on the police.
How did you snare him?
He fell for me.
I was his first love.
How did you kill him?
Chloroform and an overdose of sleeping pills.
Then we took him to the hotel.
- What about the woman?
- Nomoto killed her.
Are you sure?
I didn't want to kill him.
I had to! He made me do it!
He's a sadist.
Killing means nothing to him.
If I refused, he would have killed me too!
Don't look at me like that!
It's been hell for me, too.
I looked for a way to escape from Nomoto.
But I couldn't.
I'm sorry I killed him.
I really did love him.
It's not a lie.
At first, the marriage was only part of a clever plan.
But then I truly fell in love.
I wanted us both to get away from Nomoto.
Honestly, I did.
I thought if I told him all about the call girls and drugs, he'd put a stop to it all.
I would have done it, if we weren't up against Nomoto.
But it would never work.
He'd never spare an informer, even to the ends of the earth.
There's no way to save yourself.
I loved Takeshita, but I was terrified of Nomoto.
Is that unforgivable?
He threatened me!
I was a victim too!
Mr. Mizuno, please!
I have a feeling you'll help me.
You were a victim.
I know he was a sadist.
I wonder what kind of childhood he and his brother had.
Their mother was -
Yes, she was a street whore.
Even at 40 years old.
Put me through to Detective Hirokawa.
Hirokawa?
Yeah, it's finally all over.
Mizuno, where are you?
Hello? Hello?
What's wrong, Mizuno?
Who killed Takeshita?
Say the name!
Kumiko Takeshita.
How do you know that?
She called me.
My brother and I moved the body.
Was Nomoto there during the act?
No.
All he did was help move the body?
Yes.
He didn't like the fact she'd married Takeshita.
She came up with the plan all by herself.
And the girl who was killed?
Kumiko killed her too.
And the phone number
An unlisted number.
THE END
SPIRITS 0F THE DEAD
Hughes!
Hughes!
Are the horses ready?
Whenever you wish, Madam.
Get them, now!
Your guests are still in bed,
Milady.
I slept badly last night!
Wake them! I need fresh air!
I want to ride, to forget this dream I had!
Are you sure it was a dream?
Sometimes you need me... to tell you what you did was real.
Get out!
You're always lurking about!
At the age of twenty-two,
Frederique,
Countess of Metzengerstein
inherited the entire family fortune.
Rarely had a noble of this land
come into such a legacy.
She ruled over it capriciously:
Both night and day
according to her whim.
That morning, haunted by her
nightmare of the dawn,
she decided to take her guests
to the castle
where she had spent
her childhood.
Marquis!
Give me something to drink!
Blood!
Swine!
Milady!
What! Can't I enjoy myself?
Surely one can still laugh.
I love this place.
It's beautiful!
You have ten finer castles.
Finer than childhood?
Fool!
Is that boy still annoying you?
Shall I throw him out?
And supposing he flies...
It would be a pity!
Shoot straight and true!
The cord must break!
Shameful debaucheries,
flagrant treacheries,
unheard of cruelties soon taught
her vassals
that nothing
could guarantee them security
against the remorseless fangs
of this petty Caligula.
Come!
Come on!
Give me the necklace, boy!
- Is this our room?
- I have a surprise for you.
What is it?
There she is.
Don't be silly!
I knew him long before you did!
The other way!
All encouraged her in her whims,
not only her depraved friends,
but many others who feared
her displeasure.
The sole exception to this rule,
was the less well to do branch
of their related Berlifitzing
family,
who were traditional enemies
of the Metzengersteins,
and openly critical
of Frederique's behavior.
These two families had been
locked in discord for centuries,
and their deadly enmity
reaching so far back
that none could remember
its origins.
At this time the young
Baron Wilhelm of Berlifitzing
lived alone in his family's
castle.
Although he was her closest
neighbor,
he had never spoken to his
appalling cousin,
Frederique of Metzengerstein.
For her part, Frederique, if
by chance she caught sight
of her cousin from afar,
would mock at him and openly
show her scorn.
But Wilhelm seemed not to
notice her.
His lively intelligence would have
made him a great success in society
but nothing interested this
young misanthropist
who divided his life between
hunting and his stables.
Help me!
Quickly!
If I find the idiot who set this trap, he'll be flogged for two hours and I'll apply the vinegar myself.
Hurry!
And stop staring!
When a vixen gets caught, she plays dead.
0pen the trap, and she runs off, even if she's injured.
Does it hurt?
Chance alone brought Frederique
and Wilhelm together.
The girl would have preferred
to hate this face
that she knew not, but instead
she was unable to forget it.
Something within her had changed.
Haunted by the memory of
a gloomy, mocking glance,
she had but one desire- to see
Wilhelm again.
Hunting the vixen,
Wilhelm Berlifitzing?
Sultan!
Sultan!
He'll be back.
I'm cold!
A Metzengerstein offers his cloak to a lady.
You don't, apparently!
You never speak, Cousin.
My ankle still hurts from the trap.
Prince!
Do you only speak to animals?
Come this evening.
You'll find what you need.
Most of my guests are boars, buzzards and bears.
It should amuse you.
I won't be part of your collection.
I'm not accustomed to being refused.
- Do not keep bad habits.
- Who do you think you are?
A happy man.
Frederique!
Wilhelm!
Rejected and ridiculed when
she'd never been so sincere
Frederique angrily suppressed
the emotions
that had drawn her towards
her cousin.
Hughes!
Her only thoughts were
her vengeance.
Hughes!
Yes, Milady?
How did he come here?
He galloped here through the flames.
- Whose is he?
- Nobody knows.
Not even the Baron Wilhelm's servants.
No one knows this horse.
- No one can approach him!
- I'll try.
Milady...
The Baron Wilhelm is dead!
What?
He tried to save the horse he loved and died.
Everything went up in flames.
Everything.
Hughes!
Hughes!
Hughes!
Yes?
You will repair this... as it was before.
But that's impossible, Madam!
You will, because I wish it!
Find the best tapestry-maker.
Frederique had ordered the stables
to be set on fire
without imagining that
Wilhem would perish in the flames.
His death satisfied neither her
love, nor her bitterness.
She felt a dark foreboding.
Terror took hold of her.
What are you thinking?
Nothing. Go on.
From that time forth, a marked
change took place
in the outward behavior
of the young libertine.
She no longer left her estate,
excluding all companions.
Qr could the wild, unearthly
horse that she rode constantly
have claimed some mysterious
right of friendship...
Frederique remained faithful
to him.
In the glare of noon,
at the dead hour of night,
in sickness or in health,
in calm or in tempest,
Frederique seemed riveted to the
saddle of that colossal horse,
his audacities so well
accorded with her own spirit.
0ld man, will it take long?
I don't know.
Some days, the threads sing.
0n others, they resist and tie themselves in knots.
I asked you how long.
Weeks... months perhaps.
This spell, which she accepted
with all her being,
reached even
into her solitary moments.
She would spent hours before
the tapestry
that was slowly taking shape.
Fascinated, she watched
the agile hands of the old man,
bringing back to life
the great black steed.
His fingers, so deftly knotting
the threads,
seemed to be weaving with
a fatal logic,
her own destiny.
Help me now, my hands.
You always served me well.
Do not betray me.
Have you worked it out?
- Is it blood?
- No, fire!
Frederique had accepted
and now desired her own end.
She rushed toward the flames.
Like Wilhelm, with Wilhelm,
she will die by fire.
- I want to confess!
- After Mass. People are waiting.
- No! Right away!
- Please...
- After Mass.
- Now, I said!
Proceed.
I don't know how.
Tell me what to do. Help me.
I'm not a Catholic.
In that case, my son, we'll talk after Mass.
I want to confess, you must hear me!
Do not shout.
You're in God's house.
I don't care about God!
I need to understand.
I want to talk.
I've killed a man.
Someone from this town?
I don't know...
I don't think so.
- Ah, a stranger?
- Yes.
Well... no. I know him.
I have always known him.
You're drunk!
Listen to me!
It's your duty.
Why did you kill him?
I'll tell you everything, from the beginning.
Franz von Lowenstein.
William Wilson!
It's from Italy.
It must be from your Mother.
Attention!
At ease.
Silence! Stop that!
Wilson did it!
Wilson!
Down.
Up.
Down.
Up.
Down!
Who's that?
He's the new boy.
- What is your name?
- Wilson. William Wilson.
- What's your name again?
- William Wilson.
His name was Wilson?
The same as yours?
Same name, precisely.
- A coincidence.
- Unacceptable.
Power cannot be shared.
Suddenly I had a rival.
A rival, or rather a companion who beat me in everything, but who watched me from a benevolent distance.
He exasperated me but I felt extremely curious about him.
Good God!
Wilson!
You again, as usual!
We were both expelled.
It took me a long time to forget.
0bviously this childhood incident has always haunted you.
- Before you leave...
- Let me finish!
Several years later
I enrolled in medicine, out of curiosity.
I remind you that a doctor is also a sorcerer.
We shall seek life in the depths of matter.
And now I have the pleasure of dissecting before you a human body which has always been the dream of priests, poets or philosophers.
To be precise, I shall open a human heart.
If we were dealing with a live body, we'd process in this fashion.
Going laterally from the sternum, between the 6th and 7th rib, we'd find the apex of the heart.
But in the present case, we shall section all the ribs of the sub-auxiliary region on the left and the right as far as the sternum.
Then we will separate the diaphragm and fold back the rib cage.
This will reveal the contents of the thoracic cavity.
The heart, gentlemen, is a hollow muscle composed essentially of a firm ventricular mass and a softer auricular mass.
This pump which gives forth as much as it receives, has come to be seen as a symbol of courage and generosity.
Does Mr. Wilson have a comment?
No. In that case, we may proceed.
Thank you!
Even in dealing with a corpse, always be sure of the cleanliness of your instruments.
It is said, gentlemen, that the heart is the seat of the emotions, the passions.
Indeed.
But experience shows that it is the seat of our cares, our sorrows.
Its only generosity lies in the suffering it gives.
So, when we have cut the ribs, separated the diaphragm and folded back what is commonly called the rib cage, we can deliver our patient from the source of her woes.
The doctor is a benefactor.
We will thus bring her relief.
Along with the heart...
No!
We'll remove despair and the pain of love.
Gentlemen, we shall restore her her pristine purity, the peace of paradise lost.
Even if it's a living person, make sure your instruments are perfectly clean.
Here, put this on!
Cover yourself.
Did she die?
Forget about the girl!
It's him, don't you see?
I had to leave the University, and I joined the Austrian Army.
To fight.
But no one fights anymore.
The twin garrison is infamous.
Thanks to me.
People have told me all about the trouble. The poor women.
All was well... until that night.
Don't. It's Wilson!
You recognize me?
I'm flattered.
There were many of us the other night.
It was dark, and you were so busy.
Good evening, Mr Wilson.
- Is that Wilson?
- Be careful, Tonina.
This Wilson is surely not the lover you dream of.
He's made his reputation from men... not from us.
He loves parades, the theater, dressing up.
He needs an audience.
But in private, he puts on a poor show.
- Have you met him before?
- No... and I don't want to.
I hate wasting my time.
- Are you referring to me?
- You... you.
You are not the only man alive, Wilson.
Are you taunting me?
Are you threatening me?
